1
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.040
So I was first introduced to haul about four years ago,
and this is,

2
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:14.500
I had just moved back to the bay area with my wife and we drove up to Napa and

3
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.310
it was our first time up to Napa.
We had never been,

4
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:19.970
they're completely clueless as to where to go,
just kind of winging it.

5
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:22.250
But I think like most novice wine drinkers,

6
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.620
we just knew that we liked reds and we like big reds.

7
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:28.640
And so we're driving down St Helena and we saw the sign,

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.190
was it a crazy,
crazy good calves?
And we're like,
okay,

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.093
why not?

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.320
So we pulled in and we were blown away,

11
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.810
not just buy the wine by,
by the facility.

12
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.920
Everyone there was so kind and nice to us.
Um,
and uh,

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.070
we signed up as members and that was about four years ago and we'd been members

14
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:52.490
since and that's kind of what turned us on to wine.
Um,
so we,
you know,

15
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:55.900
we make a trip up to an APP and maybe on a monthly basis these days.
And so it's,

16
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.430
it's actually can add a pretty big impact on our lives.
Um,

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.640
so I am a very happy to have you guys here and thank you David for this

18
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:07.850
opportunity.
Um,
so I'd just like to introduce our guest for today.
Um,

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.680
so captain hall is a Copra Pirate of hall wines and Walt Wines along with her

20
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.260
husband Craig and therefore children.
Uh,

21
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.070
Catherine has been involved in the California wine industry since her family

22
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:22.310
first purchased a a winery 30 years ago.
Um,

23
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.600
she has had a distinguished career as a successful business woman,

24
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.070
community activists,
and as the United States ambassador to Austria.

25
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.950
So all this you can read in her book.
Um,

26
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.520
and also joining us today is her daughter Jennifer Brown.

27
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.630
So Jennifer is the halt and hall and Walt's partner,

28
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.490
brand ambassador representing the winery nationally,
uh,

29
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.890
tasting and equitable educational events like the one where we were having

30
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.130
hosting here today.
Um,

31
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.210
she graduated from Northwestern university and received her JD and Mba from

32
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.860
Stanford.
Very impressive.
We are hiring by the way.

33
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.673
<v 2>Oh No.</v>

34
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.880
<v 1>Um,
so Catherine at Google,
we pride ourselves on having a very diverse workforce.</v>

35
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.750
We believe diversity contributes to more collaborative environment,
um,

36
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.440
which eventually leads to more innovative products that address the needs of

37
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.780
like broad audiences.
Um,
Catherine,

38
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.360
your background is quite diverse from lawyer to Merrill,

39
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.550
Merrill mayoral candidate,
uh,
to ambassador to Austria.

40
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.570
How have your experiences outside of the wine industry influenced you

41
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.930
<v 3>in many ways?
Um,
first of all,
Daniel,
thank you so much for having us here,</v>

42
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.010
Jennifer,
and I've been really excited to see you all to see you,

43
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:42.960
to see you all Googlers.
Thank you for having us and thanks for coming.
Um,

44
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.040
so I totally agree that diversity leads to creativity and uh,

45
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:55.290
in sort of a depth of experience,
that sort of tapestry that comes forward in,

46
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:58.860
um,
in so many ways in your life.
So I always,

47
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.310
I was going to come back

48
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.860
<v 4>to this business.
Uh,
eventually.
I mean,</v>

49
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.861
I love my happiest memories as a kid were watching my dad grow grapes,

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.070
farm grapes,
and so I just knew I'd come back.

51
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:13.810
I just didn't know quite how long it would take.

52
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.790
But in terms of a sort of experiences I'd say as a lawyer,

53
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.710
uh,
you really,
you have to learn.

54
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.260
I mean there's so many experiences from everything,
right?
But yeah,

55
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.530
I think there's a Laurier you learn to speak and therefore to think precisely

56
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.360
and to communicate in that way.
Um,

57
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.880
I think as a candidate for office,

58
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:43.330
and actually I ran twice and lost twice.

59
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.460
And so,
uh,

60
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.500
the biggest lesson from that I think was dealing with failure,

61
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.470
which I think really speaks a lot to the Google community too.

62
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.430
You know?
I mean I think if you don't,
if you don't take risk,
uh,

63
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.010
and you don't fail,
then you're not going to grow.
I mean nobody wants to fail,

64
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.720
but you do.

65
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.900
I mean that's just the other side of risk and the other side of that too,

66
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.850
its risk,
its failure and its creativity and they all sort of work together.

67
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.540
And so I think that has been a really important part for me.

68
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:23.740
The other thing is too,
I think is when you,
when you fail and you get up again,

69
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.090
that gives you a confidence that,
that you can't learn.

70
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.020
I don't think any other way to know that you can come back and keep on going.

71
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.440
So I think that all of those factors really come into who we are as a winery.

72
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:40.780
I mean,
there's many other things and we're so much a team,

73
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.210
but I think our DNA is so much about risk failure,

74
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.430
hopefully not too much of that.
Um,
and uh,
creativity,
just keep on trying.

75
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.020
Beautiful.
Great.

76
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.180
<v 1>And so,
Jennifer,
I just want for you,
so here</v>

77
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.153
<v 4>Google</v>

78
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.350
<v 1>constantly trying to shake the industry up,
um,</v>

79
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.060
in our space and everything that we're involved in,
uh,
you know,
innovate or die,

80
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:04.894
they say.

81
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.250
So what is hall doing to stay on the cutting edge of technology and innovation

82
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:10.390
in the wine industry?

83
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.560
<v 5>Sure.
That's a good question.
First of all,</v>

84
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:17.561
I think innovate or die is a really intense but awesome.

85
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.790
A slogan.
I like that.
Um,

86
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.570
we're not quite that intense at the way we talk about it.
Um,

87
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.220
but we do like to take risks like my mom said.

88
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:30.221
And I think risk taking leads to creativity and experimentation is a big part of

89
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:34.520
our winemaking philosophy at the winery are winemakers all designate part of

90
00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:36.200
their time to doing experiments.

91
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.390
Some really cool examples of them,
uh,
are first of all,

92
00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:46.010
our wine maker,
Steve,
we'll back our head winemaker and VP.
He,
uh,

93
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.090
had this idea of toasting the stems of some of our Pino grapes and putting those

94
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:52.520
in the fermentation tank with the grapes.

95
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.180
And some other wineries put stems in with the grapes and ferment,

96
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:58.520
but no one else toast them slowly like he did.

97
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.600
And so it gives it a really nice sort of full bodied,
uh,

98
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.950
sense of flavors and like Nice Paprika,
whereas if you don't toast them,

99
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:08.540
which other a lot of other wineries too,

100
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.980
it's kind of more of a green quality that's can be a little bit risky in the

101
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:14.520
wine making process.
So,
um,

102
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.210
the fact that he experimented with that and it worked out really well,

103
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:21.080
we were super excited about that.
And then,
um,

104
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.570
another example of an experiment is,
so we,

105
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.380
we work with the vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills area,

106
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.550
which is by Santa Barbara.

107
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.410
And the wine that we make from there has a really nice perfume quality to it.

108
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.660
And our winemakers had an idea like,

109
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.280
does this perfume quality come from the soil or does it come from the grapes or

110
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.114
something else?

111
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.410
So they actually took the soil from the Santa Rita hills vineyard and threw it

112
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:47.390
in to an experimentation tank.
Don't worry,

113
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:51.560
you're not drinking dirt right now into an experimentation with some of our

114
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.500
Pinot grapes.
And it did impart that perfume quality.

115
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:56.000
So because of that experiment,

116
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.390
they learned the soil had a huge part of that quality of the grapes.

117
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:02.990
So we just think that these experiments that they're doing are constantly making

118
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:07.280
us better for our wines.
So that's part of our innovation.

119
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.350
When we think about technology,
we're always trying to get the best new,

120
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.630
most cutting edge technology at the property.

121
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.740
We go around the world and other wineries and talk to Uc Davis,

122
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.490
which has a wonderful winemaking program and learn about what the greatest new

123
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:26.540
technologies are.
We have,
um,
an optical sorter if you've heard of that.

124
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.550
<v 1>Yeah.
During one of our visits,
uh,</v>

125
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:32.630
actually one of the most memorable things was somebody,

126
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.330
one of your employees was telling me about this and I was like blown away.

127
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:39.630
Like actually scans takes an x ray of each grade and you know,

128
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.790
for the grapes that aren't up to par like those them away.
And I was like,
no way.

129
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:44.550
You're kidding me.

130
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.080
<v 5>No,
it is,
it's,
it's pretty amazing.
Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:49.830
You basically choose which grapes that you think are the best and then you train

132
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:54.150
it to match those kinds of grapes and then exactly blows away with air.

133
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:58.170
The ones that don't match it and it's so much more precise than humans can be.

134
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.970
So it's actually made our wine making better in our wine quality better.
Um,

135
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.050
I mean I think we do other innovative and technologically advanced things in our

136
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:09.120
marketing department,
which I mom can speak to better.

137
00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:11.820
But that's what we do at the winery in production.

138
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.300
<v 1>Yeah.
And I also have to say,
you guys have an amazing website.
It's really good.</v>

139
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.750
Just like,
yeah,
I think you guys should check it out.

140
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.720
<v 5>Yeah,
thank you very much.
Yeah.</v>

141
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.230
<v 1>The buying flows,
purchasing all that,
the colonial animations.
Um,
yeah,</v>

142
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.360
it's really good job there.

143
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.740
<v 5>Well,
Hall wines.com or what?
Weinstock helpline.
Thank you Daniel.</v>

144
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.600
<v 1>So another question for you,
Jennifer.
So you have three sites now are the fruits,</v>

145
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:41.720
St Elena,
Walt,
they all have their own special character and you unique news.

146
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.450
Could you,
for those of us that might not get the chance to visit,

147
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.150
could you tell us something special about each?

148
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.870
<v 5>Sure.
So you know,
they are all different,</v>

149
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.990
but each one of them carries I think sort of a,

150
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.200
which is they all have really great wine and they all have,
um,

151
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.760
an art collection woven throughout the property.

152
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:07.600
Our families really interested in art in lots of forms.
And then,
um,

153
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.840
they also reflect the neighborhood that they're in.

154
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.750
So our brother for property is up on the hill.

155
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:14.520
Have you been to the rather than property?
Okay.
Yeah,

156
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.310
so it's a very special small property.

157
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:22.311
It's built right by our family's home on the hillside and it has these caves

158
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.660
that are,
um,
that were built with Austrian Hartsburg dynasty bricks.

159
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.170
And then at the end of the cave,
as you know,
there's the chandelier room,

160
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.720
which has this beautiful piece of art that's a chandelier that looks like,
um,

161
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.790
sort of the roots of a tree with a Swarovski crystals that are lit up.

162
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.010
It's quite magnificent if you get to see it in person and we'd love for you all

163
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:44.844
to come visit.

164
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.960
But we do tastings underneath the chandelier and we also do private events.

165
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.750
I got married a few months ago and my rehearsal dinner was there.

166
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:56.370
It's just a really special intimate feel and it has more of an old world feel.

167
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.050
And then on the flip side,

168
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:00.960
I'd say our Saint Helena property has more of a new world feel.

169
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.820
So it's big modern.
We say that we have something there for everyone,

170
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:10.821
whether you want to come with your dog and taste wine outside or just get bottle

171
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:13.740
service,
we actually don't make anyone have to sit through a tasting.

172
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:14.760
If you think that's boring,

173
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.820
you can just order a bottle and you don't even have to listen to what we have to

174
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:21.530
say about it.
Although we would talk your ear off if you want us to.
Uh,

175
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.000
and we have beautiful art throughout that property as well.

176
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.520
And then our third property is Walt,

177
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.250
which is on the Sonoma Plaza and it's totally different.
It,
it,
um,

178
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.020
we'd like to say that it has the warmth of the home,

179
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:38.400
but the sophistication of an art gallery.
So you've very much feel at home.

180
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.900
It's very cozy,
charming,
more in tune with Sonoma properties,

181
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.120
but very beautiful.
And um,
uh,
you know,

182
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:50.390
we have wonderful wine educators and every property to.
Yep.

183
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.890
<v 1>Uh,
so throughout your book,
you,
and we kind of touched on this earlier,</v>

184
00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:56.940
you talked about the numerous challenges you've faced in building hall.

185
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.090
For example,
early on,
losing the,
uh,
2000 plus cases in the fire.

186
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.910
And that was in your early days.
All right.
Um,

187
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.650
and then the difficulty is in like fat financing the operation during the Oh

188
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:12.010
eight oh nine economic crisis and then 2010 was interesting,
which was at the,

189
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:14.890
I believe it's a tough year for the industry as a whole in terms of the weather

190
00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:19.870
conditions,
but you guys somehow we're able to turn out a hundred point wine,
um,

191
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.900
you know,
out of what you grew that year.
So you know,

192
00:11:22.901 --> 00:11:26.170
you've seen that have a history of taking these like adverse situations and

193
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:30.130
navigating them through tier your advantage and kind of flipping them on their

194
00:11:30.131 --> 00:11:32.080
side.
So,
um,

195
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.680
how have some of these losses and struggles shaped what call is today?

196
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.340
<v 5>I'll give you an example of,
um,
the crop do you mentioned 2010,
but,</v>

197
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.280
so 2011 was also very,
uh,

198
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.980
it was a difficult year and it was,
um,

199
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.740
I mean it looks sort of mediocre.
And then when we got down to harvest,

200
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.730
<v 4>we thought our grapes weren't ripe enough,
so we kept him on the vine.</v>

201
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.940
That's part of the risk thing.
We kept him on a little longer.
Uh,

202
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:04.570
and while they were hanging out there,
there was a torrential rain.

203
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.140
And so,
which was disaster.

204
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.970
And so the vines developed rot and,

205
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.100
and then the question is how do you sort out the bad berries from the good

206
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.440
berries?
Right?
So as in general,
the people who took the risk,
uh,

207
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.280
what happened to the 2011 in general was winds either tended to be too green and

208
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:31.810
we're scored very low and we're enjoyed that much by the public.

209
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.590
Or they stayed on too long and they were,

210
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:40.450
had a lot of rot and they weren't great.
And so our team figured out,

211
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:45.040
and this is,
comes back to that sort of,
you know,
deal with it,
figure it out,

212
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:48.980
think about it,
take a chance,
you know?
And so,
uh,

213
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.590
they figured out that if you,

214
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.880
that the rock was really at the stem where the stem attaches the berry to the,

215
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.190
to the right,
right,
right.

216
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:59.560
In that little juncture between the stem and the various,

217
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.390
so they figured out if they could shake the vine,
the bay,
not too hard,

218
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:07.330
but the bad vine,
the bad grapes would fall off.
And the good ones,

219
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.470
good grips and stay.

220
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:14.370
So we went around the truly every vineyard and we show everybody and um,

221
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.640
and we ended up with some really nice wines and got some great scores that year

222
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.790
in 2011 and I was like,
okay.
Yeah,
I mean 10 we did well too,

223
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:28.830
but I mean 11 in a way it was neater because we,
uh,

224
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.800
it was a very high risk,
you know?
Yeah.
But you just,

225
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.190
I think if you live and work in a climate where you,
uh,

226
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.050
the idea is just figure it out,
you know,
think about it.
I mean,

227
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.810
give it some thought and by the way,
you make a mistake,
it's okay.

228
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:48.760
Your job's not going anywhere.
You know,
you just try it.
And so I think our team,

229
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.390
they did a fabulous job that year and we ended up with some pretty cool,

230
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.060
pretty cool wines.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Yes,

231
00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.320
<v 1>I can attest to that.
Um,
so you don't have to potentially three,</v>

232
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.710
a 100 point wines,
the 20,
2010 excellence,

233
00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:08.570
the 2013 a reign in and then fingers crossed the 2013 Catherine Hall,

234
00:14:08.571 --> 00:14:11.900
which pouring here today.
Um,
and all that has been in a,

235
00:14:11.901 --> 00:14:14.290
in a span of about like two years or so.
Um,

236
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.770
so does it get easier or is the bar kind of raised every time?

237
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.860
<v 4>Yeah,
well it doesn't get easier for sure.</v>

238
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.450
And I shall we talk about that in the book?
You don't because,
um,
you,

239
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.220
when we first got,

240
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:31.920
I remember when we got our first score over 90 and it was 92 for one of our,
um,

241
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.030
cabernets some several years ago and it was like,
oh my,
it was amazing.
I mean,

242
00:14:37.031 --> 00:14:41.560
we just,
nobody could stop talking about it was so exciting.
And now,
I mean,
like,

243
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.310
I think everyone reporting today has got scores in the 90s somewhere,
you know,

244
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.540
but,
and,
and I don't mean to demean that.
I mean,
we're really excited to have him,

245
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:53.290
but it's not the same as it was when we got a 92 the first time.
Yeah.

246
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.470
And so I guess in that sense the bar does sort of go higher.

247
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.143
<v 0>Bye.</v>

248
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.640
<v 4>But I think at the same time,
you,
you don't,
you,</v>

249
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.340
if you ever set out to make a wine with the idea,

250
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:11.290
I'm going to get a great score on this wine,
then you are dead.
Because yeah,

251
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.850
I mean,
a great wine has to be authentic.

252
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.280
And so you've got to think about what does that vineyard want to be?

253
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.470
What's this vintage like?
I mean,
uh,
you don't want to manipulate a grade.
I mean,

254
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.210
I did manipulate a wine.

255
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:30.230
I think the great wines of the valley are not manipulated.

256
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.430
Do you know they are.
Um,
we have a wine maker here who I'm looking at right now,

257
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:39.260
but she just,
I mean,
great wines,
uh,
they have a sense of who they are.
Just like,

258
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.270
you know,
great people.
You know what I mean?
There's this feeling of honesty,

259
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:46.700
I think that goes around with any wine.
So you just have to sort of,

260
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.640
you seek out that truth and then you try to support it.

261
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.860
<v 1>Awesome.
So you're,
the guiding principle is never a hundred point wine.
No.</v>

262
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.810
<v 4>Hey,
we do love it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it,
you know,</v>

263
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.770
and then the other thing that happens and you start getting these,

264
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.570
when you start getting these wonderful scores,

265
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.110
then more people want you to make wine from that vineyard.

266
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.760
So it's this beautiful spiral because now we have wonderful vineyard owners who

267
00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:14.170
are coming to us,
um,
who's,
who,
uh,
are,
uh,

268
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.930
would you like to have my grapes,
you know,

269
00:16:16.931 --> 00:16:20.470
because they have a lot of pride in what they do too.
So they don't want to give,

270
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.410
have put a lot of pride into the wines that they grow grapes,

271
00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:27.810
they grow and have it made into sort of a crummy wine.
So I mean,

272
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.790
we're really proud of excellence.
Comes from vineyard in our backyard,
um,

273
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.130
and rain and comes from one of our partners and they are as excited as we are

274
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.693
<v 0>about it.</v>

275
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.830
<v 1>Jennifer,
back to you.
So all has a strong commitment to being green.</v>

276
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.670
You farm organically.
You were the first winery in California.

277
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:49.450
It's a good gold Leed,
Leed gold.
Uh,

278
00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:52.550
so why is this important to all and how has it impacted the wine you produce?

279
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.710
<v 5>Well,
I think that for family business,
which we are,</v>

280
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.380
it often is a reflection of your family's principles.

281
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.790
And one of our principals has always been our commitment to the environment.
Um,

282
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:07.810
we're all very environmentally focused in our family.
Um,

283
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.810
my mom drives electric vehicle,
my brother drives an electric vehicle.

284
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.390
I would like to drive an electric vehicle.
Um,

285
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.820
we actually have two electric vehicle parking spots at the winery.

286
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:22.970
So if you drive a Tesla or any other time,
oh,
do you?
Yeah,

287
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.510
my husband works for an environmental energy company.

288
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:27.890
I think it's just a big part of our life.

289
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:32.330
So we've been able to make that principle be part of the winery itself.

290
00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:36.290
So yeah,
we're very proud of the gold lead certification,

291
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.420
especially paving the way for wineries.

292
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.610
And organic farming is really important to us.

293
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.300
The thing about organic farming is it,
it,
um,

294
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.710
it's not so much that changes the line really,
but it,

295
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.700
it takes longer to do organic farming.
And I think when you spend longer on,

296
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.420
on something,
not everything,
but in farming in particular,
in winemaking,

297
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.260
it just makes the quality better.
So they just have a higher attention to detail.

298
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:04.440
It's much more high touch.
And um,
it's,

299
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.640
it's been nice because we didn't set out from a marketing perspective to be

300
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:13.050
green.
That's just who we are.
And we've gotten a lot of recognition for that,

301
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.190
which we've been really proud of.

302
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.440
<v 4>Right.</v>

303
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.580
<v 1>Yeah.
You feel like that's something you,</v>

304
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.540
you ever sacrifice to like reduce costs or is that just kind of a core

305
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.000
<v 4>part of what all is?
No,
we really feel like that's a core principle,
you know,</v>

306
00:18:25.001 --> 00:18:29.260
and we've been lucky that,
um,
we've been able to keep doing that.

307
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.960
<v 1>So Catherine,
uh,
I'd love to your chapter,</v>

308
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:38.020
our friends can only buy so much and I think this one probably resonates with a

309
00:18:40.191 --> 00:18:44.720
lot of us here and in the audience.
Um,
so you talked about having to rely on,

310
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.300
let me get in your circle of friends and family.
Um,

311
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.790
and it's a struggle that we've all had it think are many of us at least.

312
00:18:49.791 --> 00:18:51.980
I've definitely had this struggle myself.
Um,

313
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.680
or maybe when launching products at Google.
Um,

314
00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:57.320
so what was the hardest part about scaling from friends and family?

315
00:18:57.321 --> 00:19:00.230
And going from like a couple thousand cases a year at a couple of thousand cases

316
00:19:00.231 --> 00:19:01.000
a month.

317
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.600
<v 4>Yeah.
Well I think the first thing about,
um,</v>

318
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.610
making any product is a,
and it's got to be good.

319
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.860
It's gotta be relevant.
It's got to be desirable.

320
00:19:11.861 --> 00:19:15.400
It has to be intrinsically good and valuable.

321
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.110
And I think when you go to build it,
uh,
you have,

322
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.890
you want to focus on,
uh,
building the brand,

323
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.100
not building the sales numbers mean I'm speaking from us anyway.

324
00:19:30.101 --> 00:19:30.940
Now our industry,
I mean,

325
00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:35.900
I think the idea is that when you have a brand,
um,

326
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.850
that's your competitive edge.
I mean,
nobody else can be you.

327
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.980
Nobody else can be your product.

328
00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:44.790
And so that means you gotta you gotta know your product,

329
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:49.480
you got to know who you are.
And then,
um,
and then I think you have to really,

330
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.560
you want to,
you have to communicate directly about who you are.
I mean,

331
00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:58.561
when you think about the products that I think about when I go to buy my cold

332
00:19:59.141 --> 00:20:03.140
press,
carrot juice,
I are,
we are,
you know,
um,

333
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.910
I like knowing that there's a person behind that product that is really the

334
00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:11.710
cares about health.
You know?
Um,
when I buy products,

335
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.490
I like knowing that those people care about the environment.
Um,

336
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.760
I think there is increasingly this desire to shop with people who share your

337
00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:26.190
values.
And so that means that you,

338
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:31.150
you want to communicate,
you are,
um,
and that's part of what your brand is.
I mean,

339
00:20:31.151 --> 00:20:35.310
your brand is you.
So it's like,
this is who I am,
you know,

340
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.950
like it or don't like it,
you know?
But if you like it,
this is me.

341
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.390
And so you just sort of,

342
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.650
and then I think that it helps you scale on it.

343
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:49.420
But is it hard?
Uh,
I'll tell you in my business too,

344
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:54.210
when you start to scale,
you've got to be prepared because,
uh,

345
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.940
at first we were going to be a 7,500 7,500 case winery.

346
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.970
Now we're going to,
we're pushing towards 100,000 cases,
uh,

347
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.920
four months of the year.
I'm on American Airlines,
you know,
I mean,

348
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.170
it changes your life,
so you gotta be prepared to,
uh,

349
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.290
to make those changes and to jump when you have the opportunity.
I mean,
hesitate.

350
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.850
It did.
I think also in terms of scaling,

351
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.390
what's been really helpful is just hiring amazing people.
Oh,
hello?

352
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.140
Yeah,
that's the thing is,
yeah,
you can't,

353
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.790
you can't scale without a team.
I mean,
you can't build a business without a team.

354
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.633
It's gotta be,

355
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.510
we have just been so lucky with our team.
I mean,

356
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:44.650
we've hired,
our first employee was this,

357
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.120
we talk about this in the book to this wonderful guy named Mike Reynolds,
who is,

358
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.970
was our first wine maker now is our president.
And he just,

359
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.950
the three of us have just been,
he,
Craig and I,
um,

360
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.250
I mean Jeff was coming in now,
but I mean,
you know,

361
00:21:58.251 --> 00:22:02.650
feel bit for many years it was,
uh,
it was,
it was the three of us,
you know,

362
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:06.160
and so,
uh,
we sort of,
we have,

363
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.810
we share values and Mike,
to this day,
anybody who's hired,

364
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:12.640
and I mean if you are working in the seller,

365
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:15.510
you're working in the hospitality or you're working in,

366
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.080
in any part of our operation,

367
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.360
Mike interviews all of our employees to know that we are all sort of,

368
00:22:22.361 --> 00:22:23.800
um,
simpatico.

369
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.450
<v 1>Yeah,
that's interesting.
I mean,
I mean,</v>

370
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:27.310
we've all been through the interview process here,

371
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:31.220
so I think we kinda can attest to that.
Um,
yeah,
it's,

372
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.070
it's not easy sometimes.
Uh,

373
00:22:33.071 --> 00:22:38.071
so your whole brand has received more than 261 scores of 90 points or above.

374
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.413
That's a lot.
Congratulate,

375
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.220
<v 4>but who's counting?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

376
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.320
<v 1>And then your wallet brand,
which is much smaller,
uh,
61 scores of,</v>

377
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:49.800
of 90 points or above,
um,

378
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.840
you basically went from zero to a hundred in less than 15 years.
Uh,

379
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.850
what are the next 10 years look like for you guys?

380
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.190
<v 4>Ah,
well,</v>

381
00:22:58.191 --> 00:23:03.080
hopefully they are full of lots of great wine and more consumers.

382
00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:06.950
I think this whole,
our,
our industry is,

383
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.490
is going to change a whole lot.
I mean,
in sort of,
uh,

384
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.370
we put a lot of attention into hospitality.

385
00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:18.371
So when you tell your story that you came up and you turn it happened to turn in

386
00:23:18.561 --> 00:23:21.860
and you know,
got to know our wines and then join the club,

387
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.730
that's the perfect story.
That's what we hope to have happen.
And you know,

388
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.780
you only have your chance a chance to introduce yourself one time to somebody,

389
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.030
right?
Um,

390
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.120
but there is a whole world out there that will or won't have the chance to drive

391
00:23:35.121 --> 00:23:37.130
up highway 29 and do that.

392
00:23:37.131 --> 00:23:39.650
So we have to communicate with them directly in other ways.

393
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.210
So we put a lot of attention and we have from the,
really,

394
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.110
from the beginning into how do we market,

395
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:51.290
how do we communicate virtually,
you know,

396
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.260
how do we use social media,
which is nothing.
I mean,

397
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.290
everybody in the whole world is using social media.
But I continue.

398
00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:01.100
It's not that common in our industry.
Yeah.
We sort of behind it.
So we,

399
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.580
we pay a lot of attention to how we communicate.
Uh,

400
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:09.581
we will do that and we will do it and we'll continue to work through our website

401
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:14.100
to try to enhance that relationship,
I think to,
um,

402
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.710
how we,
I,
I think if I were a distributor and that,

403
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:20.060
and these are the sort of middlemen,

404
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.110
there are several sort of middle people along the way in this industry.

405
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.060
I'd be concerned about where the industry is taking me because,

406
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.310
uh,
people right now,

407
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:35.190
we've only scratched the surface in terms of how people are buying wine.
Um,

408
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.810
most people still buy their wine walking into a store and buying it or coming

409
00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:44.050
into a winery.
But why wouldn't you buy wine online?
I mean you,

410
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.940
when you buy everything else online,
but wine is something that you,

411
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.790
you can't taste,
you can't smell,
you can't feel it.

412
00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:54.660
There's nothing about it that's unusual.
It's all reputation and brand.

413
00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.380
So I think the,

414
00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.180
the next 10 years we will see a huge change in our industry.

415
00:25:00.181 --> 00:25:03.910
And hopefully Hollin Walt would be,
it will be at the forefront to try to,
um,

416
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.120
communicate and deliver product,
uh,
in,
in changing ways.

417
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.690
And then one more thing I want to say on that is that we're creating new brands.

418
00:25:12.691 --> 00:25:15.310
So we're,
we will create a Zinfandel Brown,

419
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.880
we have a peanut Anwar brand and we have a hall brand.

420
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.190
But if we can do a Zinfandel,

421
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:26.010
a high quality Zinfandel can be made at a much lower cost than a holocaust,

422
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.280
high quality cabernet or Pinot Noir.

423
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.780
And so then this gives us a chance to open up to another level.

424
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.030
I've consumer who wants a fine wine but can't spend or doesn't want to spend as

425
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:40.710
much money as they would on the other brands.

426
00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:44.010
So I think new brands will also help us.

427
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.770
I think the idea of quality will be consistent,

428
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.990
but if we can get more people into our sort of family,
hopefully they'll been,

429
00:25:51.991 --> 00:25:55.930
we'll go have a Zinfandel at peanut Anwar and a Cabernet,
you know?

430
00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.150
<v 1>Yeah.
It seems like there'd be a challenge though.</v>

431
00:25:58.151 --> 00:26:01.360
So for those of us that are familiar with your wines,

432
00:26:01.361 --> 00:26:04.390
we know exactly what we want to buy online.
But like kind of the,

433
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.820
how do you address the,
uh,
the try before you buy for like new customers.

434
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:12.580
So no other things you've purchased online.
You can,
it arrive.
So you try it on,

435
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.150
you don't like it,
free returns,
all that stuff.
Try something different,

436
00:26:16.151 --> 00:26:18.890
get your money back whenever.
How do you see that?

437
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:24.040
<v 4>Well,
right now we have a policy.
If something is wrong with the bottle,</v>

438
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.340
you can send it back to us or we'll pick it up or you just let us know,

439
00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:30.880
we'll credit your account.
So,
um,
that's true.

440
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:32.710
If a bottle is corked or there's something wrong.

441
00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.210
Now if you just simply don't like it,
um,
you know,

442
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.420
honestly if someone really didn't,
like,
if someone didn't like it,
not really.

443
00:26:40.421 --> 00:26:43.650
Didn't like if someone didn't like it,
we would make it up to them.
I mean,

444
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.310
I mean the most important thing is,
is our customer relationship.

445
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.190
But have we figured out how to do that online?
No,

446
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:53.040
I'd sure maybe we need some Googlers to help.

447
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.310
<v 3>That's know 20% project.
Yeah.</v>

448
00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.890
<v 1>So last Saturday at a Saint Helena winery,</v>

449
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.390
you hosted harvest towns and event where a proceeds benefit the Napa humane

450
00:27:05.391 --> 00:27:06.530
society.
Um,

451
00:27:06.531 --> 00:27:10.070
so what are some other charitable events that the winery participates in

452
00:27:10.071 --> 00:27:12.050
throughout the valley or out the winery itself?

453
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.280
<v 5>Sure.
We really love participating in these and hosting these charity events.</v>

454
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.480
Harvest hands is a super fun event where everyone brings their dog or one of my

455
00:27:20.481 --> 00:27:24.140
friends brought their cat,
their cat ones.
You can bring any pet that you want.

456
00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:28.820
And then we have sort of like fun things like pet massages and other stuff.
Um,

457
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:33.110
were your animals also chip installation?
I think as well.
Um,

458
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.710
and then you also get to taste,
taste,
wine and all benefits the charity.

459
00:27:36.711 --> 00:27:40.430
But our biggest charity event that we have every year is called the Cabernet

460
00:27:40.431 --> 00:27:44.890
cookoff.
It's in April,
I think this year.
It's on April 29th,

461
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:49.550
and it's a really fun event.
We've done it now for eight years.

462
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.210
We had 700 people come last year and it's on our great lawn.

463
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.130
And basically,
uh,

464
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:59.720
chefs from around bay area partner with a charity of their choice that's local.

465
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.760
And then they create a dish to pair with our Cabernet.

466
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.260
So this year there'll be,

467
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.820
there'll be creating a dish using some of our Napa cab 2013 and then there'll be

468
00:28:10.821 --> 00:28:14.660
pairing it with the Napa cab 2013 and then we have a panel of judges who have

469
00:28:14.661 --> 00:28:16.010
the most fun job ever.

470
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.170
I'm trying all the different food pairings and then the winning charity of the

471
00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:23.420
winning team and then that charity,

472
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.210
then it gets them the majority of the proceeds of the event,

473
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.570
but then every charity that it participates also goes home with a check.

474
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.960
So we love that event.
It's become a huge hit in the valley.

475
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.080
And if anyone wants to come,
we'd love to have you.
It's a really great time.

476
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.740
Beautiful.
Yeah.

477
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.360
<v 1>Um,
questions in the audience.
We have a Mike over here.</v>

478
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.530
<v 6>I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the business aspect of the</v>

479
00:28:45.531 --> 00:28:48.990
winery in terms of it's well known that it's hard to make money in the wind wine

480
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.240
industry.
So I wanted to hear,
um,
from your perspective,
what it takes,
um,

481
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.330
to be financially successful or profitable as a winery.

482
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.960
And then maybe touch on how the economics of the winery you have changed as you

483
00:28:59.961 --> 00:29:01.610
guys have,
um,
extended.

484
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.460
<v 4>So I have to say that really hackneyed phrase that is used so often,</v>

485
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.460
uh,
in the valley,
which is a,

486
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.210
that's the way you make a small fortune in Napa is you start with a large one.

487
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:18.620
<v 3>But,
uh,</v>

488
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.610
<v 4>your question goes,</v>

489
00:29:22.611 --> 00:29:27.611
I think to the core of why a great wines will always be made by family owned

490
00:29:29.181 --> 00:29:31.430
wineries because

491
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.790
<v 0>okay,</v>

492
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.810
<v 4>we have to be,
well in our case we have to be profitable,</v>

493
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.070
but we don't have to report to a board of directors or to,

494
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.400
uh,
people who are looking at a 12 year return.

495
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.230
We can look at a return on an investment that's 10 years out.
And,

496
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.540
um,
because,
and I think if you are building,
uh,

497
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.630
a great winery,

498
00:29:55.631 --> 00:30:00.370
which is we're trying to do is you've got to look long range.

499
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.790
I mean they just,
um,
there is so much,

500
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.970
it's so capital intensive to from the

501
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.250
well,
from the tanks that you ferment in the,
uh,

502
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.600
the oak barrels that you use.
I mean,
you did,
we,

503
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.090
we committed from the outset that we were going to not cut corners when we were

504
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:26.470
making our wines.
And so,
no,
I guess in the sense,

505
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.010
once you make that commitment then it sort of becomes easy because you just say,

506
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:34.450
okay,
we're going for it.
You have to be patient,
you have to,
the,
the,

507
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.070
you have to look longterm.
Uh,
so we are,
um,

508
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:45.610
we're cashflowing it's been awhile,
you know,
I mean,
and we started in,
I mean,

509
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:49.770
it started in the business 20 years ago.
I had no idea how you sold,

510
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.480
why I'm in a lot of that is what we talk about in the book,
you know,
I mean,

511
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:55.900
we just,
um,
I mean I knew my dad was a grower,

512
00:30:55.901 --> 00:30:57.520
so I knew a bit about growing grapes.

513
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.170
I knew a little bit about making wine and I knew zero about how you sell a wine.

514
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:02.951
And,
I mean,

515
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:06.960
I didn't know who made the wine making the wine buying decisions in the story

516
00:31:06.961 --> 00:31:08.590
even.
I mean,
that's how far we had to go.

517
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:13.000
So in 20 years we made a lot of the mistakes,
but,
uh,

518
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.490
but it was a long term venture.
And so that's,
so,
uh,

519
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.700
I think what I would do if I were looking and my guess is there are people in

520
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:27.760
this room and who are watching this who are,

521
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.600
might think that they might want to get in our business.
Right?
And I,

522
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.700
I think the first thing is to just know how much time do you want to put into
it?

523
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.570
Because as I said,
it's a big jump.
You make a couple hundred cases,

524
00:31:40.571 --> 00:31:44.980
that's one thing.
You make a thousand cases.
Nobody has that many friends.

525
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.170
And uh,
so,
uh,
but if you start,

526
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:55.030
say for example,
as a grower,
when 95% of the wine is in the vineyard anyway,

527
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.290
so then you're,

528
00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.370
you're really involved and what's the core of what this whole industry is about?

529
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.990
And then I think that's a great way to see if you enjoy the,

530
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.740
the lifestyle.
I mean you've got,
if you don't like the lifestyle,

531
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.030
you don't want to be in this business,

532
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:14.200
you can make so much more money someplace else for the time and effort that she

533
00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:17.260
put into it.
But it,
if you do,

534
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.360
then it's just everything cause it's art,
it's business,
it's just a,

535
00:32:22.361 --> 00:32:23.500
it's dynamic.

536
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:28.690
It encompasses your world here at Google more hopefully in the future.

537
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.270
Um,
and,
and it's farming too,

538
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:36.070
so it puts you in touch with what's real in life,
the seasons of life,
you know,

539
00:32:36.071 --> 00:32:37.150
the,
the sort of,

540
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:41.570
the humility of dealing year after year with Mother Nature.
I mean,

541
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:46.310
there is everything wonderful about this business,
but if you don't for me,

542
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.800
but if you don't love it,
if you don't want to be in it.

543
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.151
<v 6>In your book,</v>

544
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:53.280
you mentioned that you were investing in some cool new technologies to make your

545
00:32:53.281 --> 00:32:56.150
wines even better.
Could you give us a hint on what some of those might be?

546
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.950
I think Jen,
you mentioned the,
uh,

547
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.260
did you hear me mention the optical sorter earlier?
Yes.
Yes.
Super Cool.
Okay.

548
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.030
And that's really,
that's a key.
That really is key.

549
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.920
<v 4>You know,
I mean that's just,
that's,
that's really been,
I think,
uh,
uh,</v>

550
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:14.550
a huge step forward in terms of quantity and quality.

551
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.700
I think the tanks now that,

552
00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:22.850
I mean the tanks that we use in Saint Helena are much better to work with then

553
00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:27.150
the tanks that we have up in our first facility,
which was in Rutherford.
I mean,

554
00:33:27.151 --> 00:33:30.870
that's how the technology has changed and what it's about.
It's about precision.

555
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.440
And we can really control temperature better than we ever could in temperature

556
00:33:37.501 --> 00:33:42.180
is such a key factor in wine making.
And uh,
we can control it.

557
00:33:42.181 --> 00:33:44.940
We can toggle it,
we can just zero down.

558
00:33:44.941 --> 00:33:48.690
So it's just this sort of an added degree of precision.
Craig,

559
00:33:48.691 --> 00:33:52.080
my husband and I were over at Uc Davis about,
I dunno,

560
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:57.180
eight months ago and looking about,
it's sort of this,
uh,

561
00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:02.490
systems where we'll be able to monitor someday.
Hopefully not.

562
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.850
I bet you not.
Everything seems to be exponentially happening.

563
00:34:05.851 --> 00:34:09.150
So it won't be that long.
Uh,
is,
um,

564
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:14.400
be able to monitor us vine by vine,
you know,
you know,
uh,

565
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.170
from,
from a desk away from the vineyard where we can look at,
you know,

566
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.670
uh,
sort of the water of that soil,
those that's getting on that particular vine.

567
00:34:23.671 --> 00:34:27.480
I mean that's going to give us a lot more control in the vineyard where as I

568
00:34:27.481 --> 00:34:32.270
said before is just such a key part of it.
And then the,
um,

569
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:36.480
technology about how we communicate is huge.

570
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:41.250
And so there it is.
I mean I,
I think on a,
just on communicating,
it's just,

571
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:46.920
uh,
being open,
having great,
having a great team.

572
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:51.850
I mean we are so lucky to have the team that we've got,
um,
cause most,
um,

573
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.140
the head of our marketing operation for example,
is she,

574
00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:00.700
she worked in digital and in digital advertising for a while.
But uh,

575
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.910
but she said that she was never even thinking about working for a winery.

576
00:35:05.911 --> 00:35:10.530
She loves wine and her husband is in our business.
Um,
he's a,

577
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.310
he's a som,
lives up in the Napa valley,

578
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.070
but she never thought about working for a winery because she didn't think

579
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:19.980
anybody.
So it was into that,
you know,

580
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.180
and so then it was totally a wonderful marriage,
you know,
is continuous.

581
00:35:24.181 --> 00:35:28.920
But then she is brought in more and more people who love wine and who love

582
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:32.700
working in that world.
So I think that that world,

583
00:35:32.701 --> 00:35:37.701
which is really your world I think is going to continue to grow and the are

584
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.520
<v 5>breathtaking.
The exciting.
Thank you.</v>

585
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.680
It kind of goes to Melissa's question earlier.

586
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:47.610
One of the keys for our success in terms of getting in the black from when we

587
00:35:47.611 --> 00:35:51.090
were in the red for a really long time was developing innovative marketing

588
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:55.560
strategies.
So even though it seems totally commonplace,

589
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:59.850
a lot of the practices that we do with our ecommerce platform are very one of a

590
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:01.830
kind in the wine business.
Pretty much no one else does.

591
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:06.060
I think we have one of the top individual wine online sales a bit,
um,

592
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.140
any individual winery.
So we just have a great team that,
um,

593
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.520
obviously our scores have helped tremendously and that's a big part of being a

594
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:16.320
profitable winery.
But having,

595
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:20.730
using great technology and marketing strategies has been super helpful.

596
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.640
And which Google is a big part.
Yes.
Thank you.
Btw Yeah.

597
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:29.440
<v 7>Could you elaborate on the importance of professional reviews and ratings on</v>

598
00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:33.700
daily decisions of a wine maker and is a perfect score,

599
00:36:33.701 --> 00:36:38.470
your ultimate end goal and what are the things you're unwilling to compromise on

600
00:36:38.471 --> 00:36:39.350
to achieve a higher step?

601
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:45.350
<v 5>Love the,
I'm going to take that.
Yeah,
you can do it,
but I love that question.
No,</v>

602
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.300
you can't.
Yeah.

603
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:53.180
<v 4>Do a wine.
Um,
you can't make decisions based on what a score is going to be.</v>

604
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:58.100
I mean,
you just,
uh,
you lose your authenticity.
You just,

605
00:36:58.101 --> 00:37:01.780
uh,
it's got,
you gotta be thinking,
uh,

606
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:06.140
all about that wine and uh,
and that,
that vineyard,

607
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:08.990
what that grape can do,
where it's going to go.
Um,

608
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.660
you start thinking about a score.
I,
you just,
uh,

609
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:17.710
you've lost it.
You just moved into a sort of,
uh,

610
00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.400
this area of,
um,
mediocrity,

611
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.840
which hopefully we will never move to.
So,

612
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.240
uh,
so we don't make decisions that way.
In the second question was,

613
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.320
I think it was sort of this part of the same question,
but anyway,

614
00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:36.483
the answer is yes.

615
00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:40.480
<v 5>Got It.
How does it,
how does it impact the daily life of the winemaker?
I think,</v>

616
00:37:40.481 --> 00:37:41.440
yeah.
Well it doesn't,

617
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:48.760
<v 7>with real estate being so high in the entire state and being in Napa where I'm</v>

618
00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:51.370
mean,
what's,
what's the square footage these days?
We don't know.
Right.

619
00:37:51.371 --> 00:37:52.360
But you probably do,

620
00:37:52.361 --> 00:37:56.980
but you see these wineries now opening in an old transmission shop and like

621
00:37:56.981 --> 00:38:01.420
Oakland's or you know,
up in long poke,
we have a whole thing going on up there.

622
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.600
How was this guerrilla type winemaking affecting people in a place that is

623
00:38:07.361 --> 00:38:11.650
traditional?
Like Napa is,
uh,
seems as if they're,
you know,

624
00:38:11.651 --> 00:38:13.870
that you can buy grape juice or grapes,
I should say,

625
00:38:13.871 --> 00:38:17.120
wherever you want and the state truck it to your facility and,

626
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.190
and make great wine.

627
00:38:18.191 --> 00:38:22.600
Does it put you guys at a competitive disadvantage to be having everything in

628
00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:26.360
Napa where the real estate prices are so high?
Okay.

629
00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.240
<v 5>I can take that.
Okay.
Yeah,
I mean,
in general,</v>

630
00:38:29.241 --> 00:38:32.840
we don't consider other Nafa wineries to be our competitors.

631
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.940
And I would say in the bay area either with,

632
00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:36.610
we really consider them to be our competitors.

633
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.890
We think of wines and other countries as being competitive to us.
And even then,

634
00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:45.100
not so much because we're actually competing against people that are drinking

635
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:48.670
beer and other kinds of alcoholic beverages.
The more people consume wine,

636
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:50.860
the better it actually helps our winery.

637
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.140
So we're really happy to see gorilla winemaking operations popping up all over

638
00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.610
and actually bringing that closer people in the city is great.
Um,

639
00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.750
from our perspective,
yeah,
they're not competing with us directly.

640
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:07.870
I think the really just overall helping everyone.
Um,
and yeah,

641
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:11.410
a lot of people do just buy bulk wine or they'll buy the grapes and press them

642
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:15.100
themselves or they'll get them custom crush to somewhere else.
And I think,

643
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.240
you know,
good for them.
That's great.
It does nothing but help us.

644
00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.100
<v 4>Yeah,
totally agree.
I mean,
I think they just think about your own,
um,</v>

645
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:28.220
wine drinking behavior.
I mean,
I think the more wine you have,
you,

646
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:32.780
you,
you try,
the more wine you want to try.
I mean,
it just sort of,
you,

647
00:39:32.781 --> 00:39:35.120
it just whets your appetite to know more about wine.

648
00:39:35.121 --> 00:39:38.990
So I think we are all benefited by having more wines.

649
00:39:38.991 --> 00:39:43.780
And in fact,
in our wallet brand,
a lot of our wines are grapes.
We do trucking.

650
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.070
I mean,
but we don't,
we don't buy the juice though.
I mean,

651
00:39:46.071 --> 00:39:50.420
we are hugely involved in the farming.
You know,

652
00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:55.190
when we first started out,
my dad was a farmer,
I was saying earlier.
Um,

653
00:39:55.191 --> 00:39:59.120
so my thought at the beginning was we would own all of our own vineyards and we

654
00:39:59.121 --> 00:40:01.790
would,
you know,
make the wines because we could control it.

655
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.700
And my husband also calls me a control freak,
you know?
I mean,

656
00:40:04.701 --> 00:40:05.540
I just think we really,

657
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.160
but the fact is that there are so many wonderful vineyards out there that we

658
00:40:10.161 --> 00:40:14.600
would never have acts were that grows grapes to which we would never have

659
00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:19.440
access.
So we find that we are now,
uh,
particularly for wall,

660
00:40:19.441 --> 00:40:24.080
but also for hall buying grapes from other,
uh,
grape vineyards.

661
00:40:24.081 --> 00:40:27.170
And so the idea of Walt is,
uh,

662
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:32.290
we have one of the most famous vineyards in Oregon is Dick Shay's Vinu shape

663
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:37.160
shaping Anwar.
You all I'm seeing is not,
so this is such a good wine group.

664
00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:42.410
And so,
uh,
we buy grapes from Dick and we,
you know,

665
00:40:42.411 --> 00:40:45.220
and we'd pick him at night and you struck him down and,

666
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.860
and then we make the wine up.
I mean,
so if you're going to make really quality,

667
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.870
uh,
wine,
you have to,
it's very expensive to do,
but,

668
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:57.350
but we like it and,
and like,
luckily,
so that people who buy the wine,

669
00:40:57.351 --> 00:40:59.690
so we do that too.
We don't buy the juice,

670
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.010
but we buy grapes from other vineyards that we will truck in.

671
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:13.440
<v 9>Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah.</v>

672
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.270
<v 5>Good.
Good.
No,
it's true.
I mean,
I think people will come,</v>

673
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.240
you'll have a different experience trying align on our property,

674
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:20.590
then you will in your own home.

675
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:25.600
I think your environment hugely affects your enjoyment of the line.
Um,

676
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.660
but yeah,
no,
I think there's people,

677
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:31.300
we'll try our wine for the first time in a restaurant in New York,
but then,

678
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.040
you know,
come out to the property and like it

679
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.530
<v 3>from a different perspective,
you know,
um,</v>

680
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:41.800
I want to say something on you used the word tradition,
which I,
uh,

681
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:46.370
which is so it's such a critical part of this industry.

682
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:51.450
Um,
so our,
one of our phrases,
we've got a bunch of internal phrases like have,

683
00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:55.810
you know,
what was it something or die,
innovate or die.
Right.
Okay.
So,

684
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.940
um,
you know,
one of ours is,
um,

685
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.910
true where a tradition meets innovation.
And so,
uh,

686
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.380
we are in wine making is,

687
00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.200
has fabulous traditions associated with,

688
00:42:10.201 --> 00:42:14.610
and they are tried and true and they'd been around for many,
many,

689
00:42:14.611 --> 00:42:17.760
many years.
But,
uh,
but,

690
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.960
but innovation allows us to refine on that.

691
00:42:21.961 --> 00:42:25.320
So the idea,
I think of the winery in the future,

692
00:42:25.321 --> 00:42:27.900
and this goes actually back to one of the questions that you were saying
earlier,

693
00:42:27.901 --> 00:42:31.510
Daniel,
was,
uh,
or your comments was,
um,

694
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:35.280
what's the future for us?
And I think part of the future is to,
uh,

695
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:40.440
to take advantage of the innovation that technology has afford this and we'll

696
00:42:40.441 --> 00:42:45.320
continue to afford us,
but not to lose the great parts about tradition.
Um,

697
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.460
so it's this really,
it's,
it's a lovely blend,
you know,

698
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.100
and,
uh,
I,

699
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:56.920
I would like to never be regarded as I've traditional winery,

700
00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.110
you know,
I mean,
I,

701
00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:02.580
but I hope we will always be a winery that respects and uses the best of

702
00:43:02.581 --> 00:43:03.414
tradition.

703
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.440
What percentage of your wine is sold online and what percentage is sold at the

704
00:43:08.441 --> 00:43:12.430
winery and club together?
That will help frame my next question,

705
00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:17.540
but online,
very small presale smile.
Oh,
so small.
I mean,

706
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:22.070
we are watching it.
I mean,
under 10% or 5%.
I mean,

707
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:25.940
it's really small,
but you know,
let's talk again in three years.

708
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.890
It's going to be huge.
Um,
but I mean,
but wine club,
um,

709
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.880
that's a very important part of who we are.
It's sort of this,
uh,

710
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:41.090
I'd say over,
um,
music.
I thought maybe it was,

711
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.280
oh,
I think it's more,
is it more than third?
Yeah.
I mean,
well for 60%,

712
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.980
um,

713
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:53.020
and growing of our sales are direct to consumer and most of that is wine club.

714
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.580
So it's a huge part of,
um,

715
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.500
wine club is a huge part of who we are.

716
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:05.470
You sound like smart marketers in the wine business,
that's for sure.

717
00:44:05.471 --> 00:44:10.471
Like trying to lead the cutting edge as you start to grow into online consumers

718
00:44:10.901 --> 00:44:13.640
where they don't have the chance to drive up 29 and swing into,
you know,

719
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.040
meet funny Fufu.
Um,

720
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:21.040
what do you wish you knew about your online consumer?
Oh,

721
00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.520
oh yeah.
Well,
their email address.

722
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.690
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

723
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:33.630
<v 3>Give me an email address.
I can do so much,
um,
before that,
before that.</v>

724
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:38.250
Yeah.
So I mean,
we want to know everything we can,

725
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.170
you know what I mean?
That's,
uh,

726
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.830
we want to know where they live.

727
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.020
We want to know their buying pattern.
We want to know,
um,

728
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.970
you know,
give us their gender or when we can stereotype with the best of him,

729
00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:54.780
you know,
give us,

730
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.200
give us as much information as we can get and we'll build a model around that

731
00:44:58.201 --> 00:45:02.580
person.
I mean,
I,
I,
uh,
we want to know their income.

732
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:07.640
We want to know,
um,
what kind of luxury products do they use me?
Now,

733
00:45:07.641 --> 00:45:12.450
how do,
so how do we cope brand?
Um,
do they join other clubs?

734
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:16.530
Uh,
we know that there are people out there who,
uh,

735
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.250
love good wine,
but who are not wine club.

736
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.370
They don't want to join a wine club.
They don't want to have that tie.

737
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.440
So we created this program called online rewards.
So that's where,

738
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:31.300
and it's so if you want to shop online,
um,

739
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.490
and you don't want to be part of a club,
we got something for you.
So you can,

740
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:40.680
you buy and then you meet a threshold at six,
at $600 in a calendar year,

741
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:44.340
then you get 5% off.
If you are by a lot of wine,

742
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:49.320
if you're at $2,000 in a calendar year,
you get 10% off.
So,
I mean,
it's,
uh,

743
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.910
we're,
we're trying to figure out,
I mean,
it's,

744
00:45:51.911 --> 00:45:55.320
so much of our world is about customization.

745
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.880
So the more and in this digital world allows us to do that.

746
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:04.620
So the more we can know about who they are,
you know,
I can't think of anything.

747
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:05.580
I wouldn't want to know.

748
00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:10.560
<v 5>Yeah.
Basically what they like so we can show them what they like.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

749
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:11.900
Hi,
I'm,

750
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.520
you just mentioned about a cold branding and actually came to your winery.

751
00:46:16.521 --> 00:46:18.740
First time I went through the Alexis Club.

752
00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.680
Can you tell us more about like who you partner with,

753
00:46:21.681 --> 00:46:25.280
how you select the partnership and how's that working for your wineries?

754
00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.280
<v 3>So the credit,
who else are we involved with?
It's sort of evolving.
I don't,</v>

755
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:34.000
um,
we've done,
obviously with Lexis,

756
00:46:34.001 --> 00:46:37.900
we'd done some luxury brands are really natural for us.
We've been doing,

757
00:46:37.901 --> 00:46:41.680
we've done some,
uh,
we're doing some,
uh,

758
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.760
wedding things with Tiffany now.
Um,

759
00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.280
<v 5>we're trying to get more into the wedding market.
Um,</v>

760
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.770
especially people with their last name hall.
They really like,

761
00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:56.330
they really like partnering with using us for their wedding,

762
00:46:56.331 --> 00:46:57.170
for their wedding line.

763
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.070
<v 3>Yeah.
I thought we did something with American Express.</v>

764
00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.170
We have done things with American Express.
What do you like,
you know,

765
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:07.090
luxury brands that you can think of and,
um,

766
00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:12.010
and we're,
you know,
we're always looking,
I mean we have,
that's part of,

767
00:47:12.011 --> 00:47:16.240
we have a team that's sort of part of one of their responsibilities and we have

768
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:21.300
one guy whose job is to sort of look around and see who can we work with.

769
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:27.100
Yeah.
We'll obviously a Tesla.
Yeah.
We doing,
we have the,
you know,

770
00:47:27.101 --> 00:47:28.900
I mean we have the test,
the state test,

771
00:47:28.901 --> 00:47:32.320
the station I think you mentioned that is that we've been doing some things with

772
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:35.860
Tesla.
Would you mind introducing what we're calling today?

773
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.560
Um,
so I do this.
Sure,
sure.
Okay.
So,
well,
let me see.

774
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:44.880
I will start with what I was drinking.
That's a Sauvignon Blanc,
um,

775
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:49.540
that this is under the hall brand.
So Hall is the,
all the Bordeaux varietals.

776
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:53.980
So that would be a Sauvignon Blanc for the white.
And uh,

777
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:57.910
this is the only wine in our portfolio between hall and wealth.
The seasonal.

778
00:47:57.911 --> 00:48:00.670
Okay.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

779
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.430
100% sob blog.

780
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.970
What I think is special about this is something that our team experimented with

781
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.730
and keen to.
Uh,

782
00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:15.520
and that is that we leave this juice on the lees.
Uh,

783
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:16.970
and so what,
you know,

784
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.220
I mean it's still video blog should be bright and have nice acid and have these

785
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:24.940
like,
I think Mellon qualities or grape grapefruit on the nose.

786
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.890
We expect that,
but when it's not great,
it's going to have,

787
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.490
it's sort of be a little green or it's going to be thin,
mid palate.

788
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:36.220
And so if you leave this on the leaves,

789
00:48:36.221 --> 00:48:38.870
you can get this sort of lusciousness mid palate.

790
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.140
And I think they'd just done a beautiful job.

791
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.060
And obviously I like it because that's what I've worked for myself today.
Um,

792
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.100
to start with.
Uh,
then we,
the peanut auto is the gaps crowd.

793
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.640
I think we're pouring the gas crown.
Yeah.
So the gap's crown,

794
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.470
I is under the Walt Walt label.
This comes from,

795
00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.320
uh,
over towards the coast in Sonoma.

796
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.550
It's a out wine that has sort of,
um,

797
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.390
oh,
uh,
sort of,
uh,

798
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.310
sort of Raspberry Jamey I think on the nose.

799
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:18.100
The sort of the pallet has a,

800
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.900
I would say some,
um,

801
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.920
sort of earthy mushroom quality to it.
Um,

802
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.440
it's got nice acid in it.

803
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.800
But what distinguishes I think in particularly this wine for us in our portfolio

804
00:49:32.201 --> 00:49:34.330
is it's a very robust wine.

805
00:49:34.331 --> 00:49:38.650
I mean it's a really sort of more angular I think in terms of its structure.

806
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:40.510
Its uh,
the,
uh,

807
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:45.070
it's growing climate is very severe in the census,
got very,

808
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.120
very strong winds,
uh,
in that area.

809
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:52.570
And so these are very,
very hardy grapes and,
uh,

810
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.340
and it's reflected in the wine is produced from them.
The uh,

811
00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:01.730
two calves we have are the cur.
I get three caps.

812
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:06.890
Well you guys are great.
Okay.
So,
um,

813
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:11.870
in the Napkin Napa cab 2013,
uh,

814
00:50:11.871 --> 00:50:16.800
is,
uh,
very sort of dark inky color,
uh,
is,

815
00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.130
uh,
this is the wine we make the most of,

816
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.330
maybe the best value in the portfolio because that's our one that most people

817
00:50:23.331 --> 00:50:24.170
get to know us through.

818
00:50:24.171 --> 00:50:28.940
So we try to really load in wonderful fruit in and then hope people come back

819
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:31.790
and join the club and buy more wine.

820
00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:35.660
And just do just what Daniel did.
And um,

821
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.460
and so it has this sort of chocolatey quality to it.
I think,

822
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.300
uh,
in the,
in the uh,
taste,

823
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.370
it's a aged
something under 20 months,

824
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.880
a bit,
I think about 18 months in French oak by the way.

825
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:54.440
But we only use French oak as part of,

826
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:56.300
we were talking really about cutting corners.

827
00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:59.180
I mean I think we really looked at trying other oaks,

828
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:02.870
but there's just nothing for us that compares to French Oak.

829
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:06.920
There's that subtlety about it that just is wonderful.

830
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:11.370
So that's the,
so this is likewise age didn't um,

831
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.240
French oak.
So it's a,
we designed this wine to be drunk right now.

832
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:20.900
Robert Parker thinks is going to be fabulous in 20 years.
He says it's good now,

833
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.420
but he says he thinks it could go 20 years.

834
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:28.220
I think in 20 years is going to be hard to find a bottle of it.
I don't know.
Uh,

835
00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:32.450
and then,
uh,
we occur with French for heart,

836
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.650
comes from the heart of the valley,
which is say Halina,
uh,

837
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:39.410
from are mostly from this our vineyard right by the Saint Iliana winery called

838
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:40.244
Berg felt.

839
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:45.110
So since this is a really warm part of Napa Valley,

840
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:49.180
warm climate is going to produce grapes that aren't as fruit forward,

841
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:53.750
although you will get some black fruit in here.
Uh,
it is,

842
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:58.140
um,
sort of,
um,
more,
not as much food in,

843
00:51:58.141 --> 00:52:02.420
a little more sort of Mocha quality at for me on that taste,

844
00:52:02.421 --> 00:52:06.710
a big bigger wine.
And then finally the Catherine Hall,

845
00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:11.450
which to begin with has a very nice name,
uh,
is uh,

846
00:52:11.451 --> 00:52:13.490
comes in part from our,

847
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.170
the vineyard where our houses are family houses and it is a,

848
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:22.900
um,
it's a wonderful wine.
Uh,
not to go back to scores,

849
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.400
but I just have to say,
so,
uh,

850
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:30.480
Parker pre rated this a in barrel at 98 to 100.
So this could end,

851
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:34.670
that really could be our third hundred point wine.
But anyway,

852
00:52:34.671 --> 00:52:37.700
it is what it is and I think it's beautiful.
Here's the,

853
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:42.170
you will try it today.
And,
um,
those of you who are seeing,

854
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.310
seeing is later.
Sorry,
you just have to come,

855
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:50.470
come to the winery and try it.
Um,
but it is a,
uh,

856
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:56.180
it's a very big wine.
It's very dense.
It's got lots of dark fruit in it.

857
00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:00.500
It's a,
uh,
it's huge.
It's got,

858
00:53:00.501 --> 00:53:02.750
now it's very young at 2013.

859
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:07.751
So it's got this sort of 80 fat that makes it very appealing and you just do,

860
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.240
it's luscious.
But,
uh,

861
00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:15.050
the challenge is going to be to wait cause it really is going to be better in

862
00:53:15.051 --> 00:53:17.030
four or five or longer years.

863
00:53:17.031 --> 00:53:21.770
But it is drinking so beautifully now that it's very tempting.

864
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.980
Well,
thank you so much.
Oh,
thank you.

865
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.813
<v 11>You guys made</v>

866
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.610
