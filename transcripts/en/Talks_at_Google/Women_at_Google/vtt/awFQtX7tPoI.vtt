00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.870
Good morning.
Welcome to talks at Google in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.
Today.

2
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:16.190
It's my great privilege and pleasure to introduce Sherry Turkle.

3
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.120
Dr Turkle is professor of the social studies of science and technology at Mit.

4
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.320
She's a sociologist and clinical psychologist,

5
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.730
it leading media scholar who spent the last three decades studying our

6
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:38.021
relationship with the digital culture where you've created or classic studies in

7
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:43.091
the field or the second self life on the screen and alone together.

8
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.370
She joins us today to discuss her latest book reclaiming conversation,

9
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.220
the power of talk in a digital age,

10
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.950
emphasis here on the power.
I found this book and eloquent,

11
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.090
profound,

12
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.150
and often moving examination of the consequences of our addiction to our devices

13
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.470
for ourselves and our families,
and how conversation,

14
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.860
which we may dimly recall as an interaction between two or more humans in which

15
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.710
no devices are involved can help.

16
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.920
Please join me in welcoming Sherry Turkle.

17
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.370
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.510
<v 2>well that was a lovely introduction and what was loveliest about it is that I</v>

19
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:38.190
think it,
it touches on the fact that this really is a book of my heart.

20
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.040
Um,
the other books I've written and I,

21
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.920
I'm dedicated to all of them.
All books.
Do you like your children?
Um,

22
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.520
basically came out of my doing sponsored by the NSF or you know,

23
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.500
kind of other funders,
10,
15 years of work,
five,

24
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.370
10,
15 years of work and then reporting out on what I had found.

25
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.650
And this book began in a somewhat different way at the end of loan together,

26
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.090
which was the book about I kind of new social situation that people found

27
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:13.350
themselves in.
We'd all be here.
Uh,
so we were together,

28
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:16.670
we were in a social situation of some stores,
but um,

29
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.700
we often found ourselves feeling um,
uh,

30
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.720
that we could find a sort of place alone in our heads in a new kind of way.

31
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.110
Cause we could go to our phones and being a different kind of space or flip

32
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:33.930
Bitch,
oh,
we would be alone in our apartments or I'm in a park or wherever,

33
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160
but we would feel ourselves more together with the world,
with our communities,

34
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:38.994
with,
I mean,

35
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.010
I knew kind of global together that that was absolutely unprecedented.

36
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:44.844
So that was the,

37
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.270
the topic of that book really was what was the psychology of what were the new

38
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:52.250
political dynamics?
What was the feeling of that new state?
Um,

39
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.880
at the end of that book,

40
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.570
as I listened to the transcripts and gone over the hundreds and hundreds of

41
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:01.240
transcripts,
particularly from young people,
but not just from young people,

42
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.790
no one phrase kept coming up,

43
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.270
something that I really hadn't had a chance to explore in that book,

44
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.020
which was I'd rather text than talk as part of the kind of situation of people

45
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:22.090
who now had the devices that enabled this alone together state,

46
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.680
these new always on,

47
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:28.681
always on new technologies that enabled this new thing I was studying and I'm a

48
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:32.950
psychologist and,
um,
I'm psychodynamically trained,

49
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.450
which means that I'm interested in sort of interpersonal dynamics,

50
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.040
the importance of early childhood,

51
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.120
the boards of communication and connection in early childhood.

52
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.560
The importance of empathy and its development in early childhood.
Um,

53
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.760
and I thought to myself,
okay,

54
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.380
let's take seriously,
you know,

55
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.480
instead of taking this as the litany or catchphrase,

56
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.900
let's really take seriously.

57
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.280
If people tell me they'd rather text than talk.

58
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.470
If you're really doing that,

59
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.660
let me explore this like an ethnography.

60
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.660
Let me follow this story in business and romance and the raising of children and

61
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:19.300
how people are getting along in their communities and their,

62
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.600
with their colleagues,
with their lovers,
with their families,
with their friends.

63
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.970
Let me follow the story and what will that mean in all of these areas of life.

64
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.650
And so that's why I'm trained.

65
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:33.330
I'm trained to be an ethnographer and essentially that's what we claiming

66
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.160
conversation is.
It's a look at for me,

67
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:41.161
a much broader sweep of data because I did go into law firms and doctor's

68
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:42.461
offices,
you know,

69
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:46.780
the kinds of doctor's offices where literally doctors are looking at screens

70
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.600
instead of talking to patients because they're forced to,

71
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.140
to law firms where people felt it was more important to stay at their screens,

72
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.280
then go to lunch with their colleagues.

73
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.330
Big Mistake if you're a lawyer and want to get promoted.
Um,

74
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.150
big mistake in terms of the culture of those firms.

75
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.160
But yet that's how they felt about it.

76
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.520
Software companies where people had the right kind of cafeterias and micro

77
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.580
kitchens to sit down and have a conversation,

78
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.850
except the highest value of the company was that they'd be always on the

79
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:25.720
messaging system in order to show their devotion.

80
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.790
So I went to all kinds of places,
as I say,
a much broader sweep of the world.

81
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.880
And I studied this issue of conversation.

82
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.760
So what did I find?

83
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.110
Well maybe it makes sense to say what I find by starting with a story,

84
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.330
which is not a feel good story for me.

85
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.720
At the end of the book was published and I'm just waiting for it to come out

86
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.770
before it comes out in New York Times reporter calls me.
Um,

87
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.140
my publisher hadn't wanted me talking,
you know,

88
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:55.480
talking much before the book comes out.
This such a,

89
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.620
an event and the New York Times reporter calls me and he wants me to now and

90
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.170
finally allowed to talk about the book.

91
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:07.760
He wants me to comment on a story he's writing about Hello Barbie.

92
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.230
So Hello Barbie is a robot doll that comes out of the box and says,

93
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.780
hello.
I'm Barbie.
I think I love you.

94
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.980
I have a sister.
I don't like her so much.

95
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.640
I think I'm jealous of her.
I hear you have a sister.

96
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.870
Are you jealous of your sister?
Let's talk.
In other words,

97
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.900
it comes out of the box with a pretend empathy narrative and starts to try to

98
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:43.841
engage you in conversation about this pretend empathy narrative with the idea

99
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:48.770
that that will be,
does this pretend best friend thing?

100
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.410
That will be conversation.
So

101
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.330
my position on this,
you know,

102
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.860
everything I know about kids growing up and from studying social robotics and

103
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:05.861
how kids respond to it is that you can get a kid to talk to a robot that offers

104
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.080
pretend empathy,

105
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.950
but you can't get a child to learn and experience empathy from a robot that has

106
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:22.580
none to give because this robot hasn't known a life,

107
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.200
it doesn't have a sister.
It doesn't know what jealousy is.

108
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.720
In other words,
this is not,

109
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.050
this conversation is not going to do the job that conversation needs to do.

110
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.730
So it turns out after you know,

111
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:45.731
studying law offices and business offices and you know,

112
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.660
families.
Now,

113
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:52.661
there was another part of the story in fact to which in fact I do end the book

114
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:57.860
on the issue of robotics,
but Hello Barbie wasn't on the market.
You know,

115
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:00.710
I would have ended the book with Hello Barbie had it hadn't been.

116
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.810
It turns out that sociable robotics is also part of this story of kind of a

117
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:10.811
crisis of conversation because we're offering ourselves and our children objects

118
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.340
that are full conversation.

119
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So just to give you some sense of all the ways we can't learn empathy now in our

120
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:24.050
culture and yet there's an empathy crisis and I'm going to argue just to give

121
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:28.070
the argument of that I'm going to make today and that I'm making reclaiming

122
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:33.071
conversation the to this empathy crisis conversation is the remedy.

123
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.610
And to make a bad pun,
I call it the talking cure,

124
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.940
and that in fact is where the book began with a 40% drop in all markers for

125
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:48.110
empathy among college students.

126
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.740
It was a Meta analysis that looked at many surveys,

127
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.290
many studies over the past 20 years.

128
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.260
There's this 40% drop among college students in many markets for empathy.

129
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.230
Most vet in the past 10 years.
And I,
and in,

130
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.250
in our conversation,
uh,
because I'm only going to talk for about half my time,

131
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.360
um,

132
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360
it's telling that the very brilliant woman who was the head of this study after

133
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:21.501
learning this decided to write empathy apps for the iPhone.

134
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.130
So the whole question of

135
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.840
let us grant that part of the way we got ourselves into some trouble with

136
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.220
empathy,
which is borne from looking at someone in the eye,

137
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.920
not breaking that contact,
hearing what they have to say they're hearing back.

138
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:48.510
Would you have to say taking some time,
let us grant that,

139
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:53.430
interrupting that by going like,
this is part of the problem.

140
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:59.030
To what degree do we want to solve it with this technology that we have always

141
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:00.144
on hand,

142
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.430
how much are we going to look to technology to solve the problem that perhaps

143
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:06.870
technology got us into?

144
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.730
It obviously is very seductive to do that,

145
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.260
but is that a good idea?

146
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.420
So I found out that,
um,

147
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.740
I began to get more evidence about the,
the empathy,

148
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.430
the empathy crisis when I was called in to consult in middle schools for a much

149
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:33.010
younger students than college students.
Um,

150
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.540
and in one school in particular in the book,
I call it the Holbrook school,

151
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.920
the teachers were saying that the students bout 12 year old students were

152
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:42.750
behaving like eight year old students.

153
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.710
There were showing a kind of cruelty their fellow students,
not on the Internet,

154
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:49.710
I mean not kind of in cyber bullying situations,

155
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.020
but really the teachers were saying,

156
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.940
they didn't seem to understand how other students were feeling when other

157
00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:58.320
students were talking to them.

158
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:03.300
I mean they essentially were describing a crisis of empathy and they didn't seem

159
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:06.270
to get it when their teachers spoke to them.

160
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.410
They said 12 year old students behave like eight year old students.

161
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.590
So with was a very dramatic study for me.

162
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.580
All these places where I was finding teachers and um,

163
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.990
educators of did a large study of kind of teachers and all kinds of educators in

164
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:27.480
that age range who were all talking about kind of the same thing.

165
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.960
But then there were group of studies that were truly optimistic.

166
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:38.451
And then I want to share with you in only five days without phones in a summer

167
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:40.830
camp,
that's device free.

168
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.790
Young people get those empathy markers to come right back up.

169
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.960
In other words,

170
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.280
we are built to have an empathic response to each other know how did they get

171
00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:01.060
those empathy markers to come back up.
They talked to each other,

172
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.710
they talk to each other without turning away from each other to look for a

173
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:08.290
device.
So why would we,
you know,

174
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:13.150
getting back to the Barbie and getting back to the fact that most kids have

175
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:15.040
phones when they're five or six or seven,

176
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.280
why would we give kids just at the time when they're developing that empathic

177
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:21.124
response,

178
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.160
why would we want to give children an object that will block the development of

179
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:31.060
empathy and phones do block the development of empathy?

180
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.750
Not because we met them too.
It's not kind of a sub because we said,
oh,

181
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:36.010
we're going to just,
you know,

182
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:38.830
invent something that's really going to get in the way of empathy.

183
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.910
It's just because when you go like that to a person,

184
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:48.270
you're putting them on pause and your saying that you can't attend to what

185
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.270
they're thinking or feeling.
Now the more developed an older the person is,

186
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.600
you know,
the less let's say damage it's going to do,

187
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.460
but a series of studies show that if you are sitting at a table and you put a

188
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:06.250
phone,
a silent phone on the table between you,

189
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.190
you will feel less.

190
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.350
First of all the conversation will go to trivial matters.

191
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.510
The topic of the conversation will change.
It will not be about important things.

192
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And secondly you will feel less empathic connection with the person you're

193
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:26.164
talking to.

194
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:32.170
And then they redid this study in a natural setting where they put the phone,

195
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.790
not between two people having lunch but in the periphery of the landscape.

196
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:40.060
Kind of like if you put the phone almost where I couldn't see it at the edge of

197
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:44.740
the stage and had me talking to you know,
somebody at lunch.

198
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:49.150
But th th th the phones is almost like at the next table and they got the same

199
00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:49.984
results

200
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.520
conversation on things less important and less sensitive commitment and

201
00:13:57.401 --> 00:14:00.940
connection,
lesson path exams with the person you're talking with.

202
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.620
Essentially.

203
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.340
It makes every kind of sense that if people think they're going to be

204
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:10.240
interrupted,
their attitude toward a conversation changes.

205
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.480
It's really as simple as that.
Um,

206
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.490
and college students know that.

207
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.820
They know that they don't pay attention to each other when they have their

208
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:19.540
phones.

209
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.720
And they talked to me about something they called the rule of threes and it's a

210
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:25.900
lot of my own research took place on college campuses.

211
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.340
So one young man says to me,

212
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.850
um,
introducing the rule of three,

213
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:37.850
because at the beginning I had been thinking of doing a study really on the,
um,

214
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.080
on the nature of texting,
on the diction of texting,

215
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.990
really getting deeply into the kind of linguistics of texting.
And he said,

216
00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:49.990
don't do that.
It's not our texting.
He says that's getting us into trouble.

217
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.560
It's what our texting is doing to our in person conversations.

218
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.610
And that's really was my Lodestar for this study,

219
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.790
if not our texting that's getting us into trouble.

220
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:06.791
He said it's what our texting is doing to our in person conversations.

221
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.430
And I said,
well tell me more.
And to illustrate this,

222
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.300
I'd get the story about the rule of three.
And here's the rule of three.

223
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.020
When you're at dinner,
let's say it's six,

224
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.720
it's three people have to have their heads up before you get,

225
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.250
give yourself permission to put your head down to texts cause everybody has

226
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:30.530
their phone and everybody's going to be texting at dinner.

227
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.930
So the rule of three is a kind of new politeness about when you can let your po,

228
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.850
your attention go down.
So what is the result of the rule of three?

229
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.930
It's exactly the result of all those studies that took place with the silent

230
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:45.890
phone on the table.

231
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:50.891
That kind of silenced that change the nature of discussion and gave people less

232
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:52.730
than an empathic connection with each other.

233
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.650
Things are kept light and on subjects will you don't mind being interrupted and

234
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:02.651
people feel less of an empathic connection with each other and then it's not

235
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:06.740
just among college students.
I mean,

236
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:11.741
I should mention a recent pew study showed that 89% of adults say that in their

237
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:18.161
last social interaction they took out a phone and 82% say that it diminished the

238
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:23.540
conversation.
Now that said,

239
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:28.541
he goes on to be very realistic and very positive and very kind of upbeat about

240
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:31.550
all the great things people did when they took out their phone.

241
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:34.880
They looked up a movie,
they,
I mean they,
they looked up a cinematographer,

242
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:39.390
they checked a a thing in their neighborhood.
I mean they,
you know,

243
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.250
phone is completely integrated in their life,
but bottom line,

244
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.540
89% interrupted social interaction.
82% of,

245
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:50.510
let's say it less than the conversation rule of three.

246
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.120
And then there's the rule of seven.

247
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.530
The rule of seven is what a college junior described as this.

248
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.960
It takes seven minutes to know whether a congress,

249
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:04.640
where a conversation is going to go.

250
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:10.300
You have to just like it probably takes seven minutes to know like whether

251
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:14.480
you're going to pay close attention to that.
You have to get used to do,

252
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.410
you know somebody's body in the room.
The way somebody speaks,

253
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:21.800
the kind of cadence,
how they express themselves,

254
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.300
but certainly in a conversation where you're kind of adjusting to each other,

255
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:28.520
there are fits in there.
It starts,
there are lows.

256
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.740
It takes seven minutes to sort of see whether this is going to be worth her
time.

257
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.080
She explains to me and then she says,

258
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.350
I often don't put in my seven minutes because I just would rather go to the

259
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:46.280
phone and get the reliability of that sort of steady feed.

260
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.760
It's easier to just a text during those seven minutes.

261
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:54.870
It's easier to get something sure and certain and it's more efficient

262
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.460
and a lot of people I interviewed said that that day don't put in that kind of

263
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:07.731
time or wait for that kind of low or allow themselves a moment of boredom in

264
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:14.340
conversations today before that happens.

265
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.790
They go to a phone so you can see a kind of perfect storm building up here.

266
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.450
All roads led me to a crisis in a certain kind of conversation.

267
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:28.530
It's not like we're not talking,

268
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.820
I'm talking about the kind of conversation that's spontaneous,

269
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:36.150
open ended where they're tangents will you allow yourself lows?

270
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.870
Will you don't interrupt each other where there's eye contact,

271
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.870
the kind of thing where empathy is born,

272
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:47.871
where creativity is most likely to happen and crisis in empathy is happening and

273
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:54.420
I'm arguing the conversation is the talking cure conversation.

274
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.780
That kind of conversation is the most human and humanizing thing that we know

275
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:02.154
how to do.

276
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.640
That doesn't take away in the slightest from the fun and the intellectual

277
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:13.791
qualities and the sexiness and the eroticism and the joy of texting and email

278
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:19.590
and messaging and everything.
I mean just everything.

279
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.370
It just means the conversation has some particularities even in our

280
00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:27.180
neurophysiology.

281
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:32.510
That makes it the ideal thing for teaching empathy and for getting certain kinds

282
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:36.750
of results in creativity,

283
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.690
collaboration and developing the human.

284
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.020
It's the training ground for empathy and I'm not saying to put away your phones

285
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:49.860
for certain amount of time because it's polite or because I want you to learn

286
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:53.670
some kind of art of conversation to be kind of fancy talkers.

287
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.700
I'm really saying that this flight and from conversation,

288
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.500
the fact that we don't want to sit around for the boring bits is one woman said

289
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:01.801
to me,

290
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:06.780
I don't like the boring bits is actually interfering with something we need to

291
00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:11.160
do for each other as human beings.
You know,
and they're,
they're a great ironies.

292
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:15.840
As I said,
even though the psychologists are agreeing on this crisis and empathy,

293
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.170
there's this big movement to create these empathy apps does getting ourselves

294
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:27.270
into trouble and wanting technology to cure it just as people are intolerant of

295
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:31.740
being alone and want technology to cure that.
You.

296
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:36.540
Many of you may have heard of a study that's become widely cited in which a

297
00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:41.010
group of college students,
this was part of a group of 21 studies,

298
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:44.940
but in this one study at the University of Virginia Group of college,

299
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:47.100
students were asked,
um,

300
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.520
they were told that they were going to be asked to sit alone from six to 15

301
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:55.920
minutes.
And were they okay with that?
Sure.
No devices,
no book.
Sure.
Um,

302
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.470
did they think they might want to give themselves electric shocks during that

303
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:03.610
period?
No,
not really.

304
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:08.260
Uh,
no.
They're asked to test the shocking though they'd tested it.

305
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:11.110
There was no really not.
Um,

306
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.040
and then they would just ask to sit alone without a device.
After six minutes,

307
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:16.690
the students were shocking themselves.

308
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:22.470
So being alone was so intolerable that they would rather give themselves

309
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:27.850
electric shocks than sit quietly with their own thoughts.

310
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.600
Being alone is a problem that we want technology to solve.

311
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.840
And I bring this up because there's actually an important connection that I want

312
00:21:37.351 --> 00:21:42.010
to leave you with between.
It's like if you leave with one thing,

313
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.730
it's sort of like this is the thing to leave with this important connection

314
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:53.790
between conversation and solitude because I think this is where my work is often

315
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:58.030
misunderstood.
They'll say,
well,
sure.
Sherry Turkle says,
the problem,

316
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:00.670
if we're looking at our devices when we're together,
okay,

317
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:02.140
granted that that's not so cool,

318
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.270
but what about if I look at my device when I'm alone?
Was that bothering?

319
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.200
What does that,
that's not a problem for anybody.

320
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.730
You need to have a capacity for solitude in order to have a capacity for

321
00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:17.350
sociality.

322
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.770
The company link between conversation and solitude is tremendous.

323
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:29.130
We cannot sell our flight from conversation or crisis of empathy without dealing

324
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.450
with our incapacity,
for solitude,
with our site,

325
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.480
with our flight for soft from solitude that it's only when you can gather

326
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:44.770
yourself,
be content with yourself and because of that,

327
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:50.010
talk to another person and really see who they are as a person and hear them for

328
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:54.370
who they are because you're okay with yourself.

329
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.740
Can you begin to have a conversation?

330
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.050
The way psychologists have put this so beautifully is that if you don't teach

331
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:05.860
your children to be alone,
they'll only know how to be lonely.

332
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.230
That solitude and sociality go together.
And that's why you can't just say,

333
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:13.750
oh well you know the devices.
Like you know,

334
00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:15.730
I'll worry about the devices one on whether the people,

335
00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:17.260
but whatever I do by myself,

336
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.460
my intolerance for having a moment alone,
that's nothing.

337
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.340
We have to be more intentional in our use of devices for ourselves,

338
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.700
not just because we're breaking up conversations with other people.

339
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:36.100
So what I'm basically saying is that we're at a kind of Rachel Carson moment

340
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.750
distracted at our dinner tables and living rooms at business meetings and in

341
00:23:40.751 --> 00:23:44.620
classrooms.
I see traces of the new silence spring.

342
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:49.621
That's the term that Carson coined when we were ready to see that with

343
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:53.780
technological change had come and assault on our environment.

344
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.910
And now we've arrived at another moment of recognition.
I think people,

345
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.830
you know what?
When I wrote a loan together,
people thought it was a good book,

346
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.710
but people want to fight with me.
I mean it was like,
okay,

347
00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.580
that's a really good book.

348
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.580
Let's fight about this and now I really feel that we've arrived at a moment of

349
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:18.281
recognition when people feel that something is amiss,

350
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.840
something is amiss.

351
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.070
We have a great technology but something is amiss.

352
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.520
We need to get it more aligned with the lives we want to leave this time.

353
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:36.560
Technology is implicated in an assault on empathy.

354
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.160
Rachel Carson's moment was a moment of recognition that we were at a point where

355
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:47.531
we had to do something and we could do something and now too we can do

356
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:50.360
something.
We can do many somethings,

357
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.930
many somethings both in how we design technology.

358
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:55.880
I'm delighted to be speaking here,

359
00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.440
delighted to be here and how we use technology.

360
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.730
There are many something so I'm just going to quickly rushed through a couple of

361
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:05.610
these little somethings.

362
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.560
It was not to take too much more than seven minutes on all the things to do and

363
00:25:09.561 --> 00:25:13.670
then I hope that in the questions we can open up to more somethings.

364
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.710
These,
some things sound like little,
some things,
but when you add them together,

365
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.480
it's the change in culture.
We're not looking for solutions.

366
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.760
We're looking for first steps.
So what are some first steps?

367
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.620
First of all,
act with intention.

368
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.160
A father is getting his two year old daughter a bath and he's on,
he's,

369
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.280
he's doing his mail with on the iPhone and he says to me,

370
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:44.540
I remember giving my 11 year old daughter a bath when she was two and he used to

371
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:48.050
just sit with her and talked to her and sing to her and play the little play

372
00:25:48.051 --> 00:25:51.230
with the little toy she had in her bathtub.

373
00:25:51.231 --> 00:25:55.810
I kind of missed that with my two year old.
I play,
uh,
I,

374
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.180
I don't do that.
I just do my mail on my iPhone.

375
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.530
Technology makes us forget what we know about life.
That's author's choice.

376
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.780
That's my fear.
That's my favorite line in my book.

377
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.720
Technology makes us forget what we know about life.

378
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.770
He knows that he is doing something that's not,

379
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.240
that's a mess.

380
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.750
That little girl needs some conversation from her dad and he enjoyed and was

381
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:26.750
nurtured himself by talking to his older child.

382
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.050
At a moment like this,
pull up your socks,
put your,

383
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:31.940
pull yourself together and put down the phone.

384
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.000
So Act with intention,
participate however you can,

385
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:41.360
and a revitalization of public conversation.
Um,

386
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.880
because public conversations teach us,

387
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.200
they model how conversation can unfold to many of my students say they don't

388
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.820
know how to have a public conversation.

389
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.700
They don't know how to have a conversation.
Their families,

390
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.900
they say their families didn't talk at dinner.
I lay a lot of this on parents.

391
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.020
It was my generation that thought we would only get a dick Tracy to weigh risk

392
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.170
radio.
That was like the best we would ever get.
And I've been,

393
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:12.171
all of a sudden I have a smartphone and like this is like amazing and we didn't

394
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:17.340
talk to our kids.
It's parents who didn't talk at breakfast and dinner.

395
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:19.290
It's kids who were telling me that they're,

396
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.550
that they never took a walk with their father to the corner store when the

397
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:25.140
father didn't have his phone with them.

398
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.210
So it's very important that we have public conversations,

399
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:33.150
including classrooms where there's a lot of talk,

400
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.690
which is part of my problem with putting everything on screens and distance

401
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:39.480
learning.
Not that it itself isn't good,

402
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.160
but you have to worry every time you take conversation away from the classroom.

403
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.380
Remember that the presence of a device already signals that your attention is

404
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:52.800
divided even if you do not intend it to be.

405
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.500
So remember those studies at phones on the table.

406
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.810
Remember that when you put that phone on the table,

407
00:27:57.811 --> 00:28:01.110
you were signaling that you could be elsewhere,

408
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.910
even if you don't mean to go elsewhere.
So do the simplest thing.

409
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.940
Just don't put it on the table except what research has made clear.

410
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.180
And you've heard this so many times,
it's so boring.
Anyway,
just listen to me.

411
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.220
Unitasking is the next big thing.
There is no such thing as multitasking.

412
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.780
Do one thing at a time.
Really be in the vanguard.

413
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:29.670
It is.
Everybody knows this.
Nobody wants to hear it.
So I said it,

414
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.680
you know,
it's true.

415
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.880
Conversation is the human way to practice.

416
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:40.530
Unitasking part of the reason it's,
um,
why it's so hard.

417
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.410
Don't try to be perfect.

418
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.400
My students come to me and they say they do not want to go to office hours.

419
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:52.080
They want to write me an email instead of office hours.

420
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.240
What do they want to write me an email?

421
00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:01.070
Because they will write the email that best expresses their question and I will

422
00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:07.160
write them an email back that perfectly answers there.
You know,

423
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.350
that's perfectly pitched and gives them the most information back.

424
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.610
It's a transaction and it's perfect.

425
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.080
Who developed a love of knowledge,

426
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:24.110
a love of learning and I here today because I asked the perfect question and

427
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:27.540
somebody gave me a perfect answer.
No,

428
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.080
there was no one who developed a love of learning for that reason.

429
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.300
It's because somebody sat down with me,

430
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:37.890
believed in me because I looked at somebody in a conversation and said,

431
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.800
I could be like that person.
I could be,

432
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.130
what would it take for me to be like that person and that person is talking to

433
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:48.490
me and interested in me.
That's how it happens.

434
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.070
Cultivate solitude.

435
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.360
The capacity to be alone with your thoughts is crucial.

436
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.380
Some of the most crucial conversations you're going to have our conversations

437
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:04.240
with yourself to have them,
you have to learn to listen with your own voice,

438
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.430
set aside your laptops and your tablets and put away your phone

439
00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.550
and finally obey the seven minute rule.

440
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.840
That's the rule suggested to me by a college junior that says that it takes at

441
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:25.420
least seven minutes to see how a conversation is going to unfold.

442
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.210
You have to let it unfold and not go to your phone before those minutes pass.

443
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.280
If there is a lull in the conversation,
let it be.

444
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.660
Every technology challenges are human values,

445
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.060
which is a good thing because it causes us to reflect on what these values are.

446
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.780
If we've invented a technology that causes us to look at each other less to make

447
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:54.820
less eye contact,

448
00:30:55.210 --> 00:31:00.210
that needs to be a signal to us and the message of my book is that we're all in

449
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:03.460
this together.
Let's just look up,

450
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.190
look at each other and start the conversation.
Thank you very much.

451
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.223
<v 1>Okay,</v>

452
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.270
<v 2>so questions?
Yes,</v>

453
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.780
<v 3>a previous generations have or last generation anyway.
Um,</v>

454
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:26.300
tended to use television when they didn't want to be alone.

455
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:27.920
That kind of sense of,
you know,

456
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.570
breaking the loneliness and from what I understand from recent studies,

457
00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.340
the use of television that way is decreasing to some degree as people are

458
00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.580
spending more time either online or potentially online with some sort of chat.

459
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.640
Do you think that this decrease in empathy,

460
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:51.950
that people actually got som modeled conversation,

461
00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:56.951
modeled empathy in Pv and that the decrease in TV is potentially a bad thing?

462
00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.230
As weird as that sounds.
I mean,
how,

463
00:32:00.231 --> 00:32:03.640
how do you compare TV as a form of using that?
Well,
well

464
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.890
<v 2>I think TV is that we,
let me just say a word about TV.
I in,</v>

465
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:10.030
in reclaiming conversation,
I talk a lot about TV because TV,

466
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:14.770
we've all experienced TV and it's very important not to get into,

467
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.360
oh well we're talking about the latest technology and then we're just,

468
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.790
we're just upset about this one because the one we have now and then we were

469
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:26.500
upset about TV when that was the thing.
What,
what is the reason I'm on?

470
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:27.370
I was a big,

471
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.240
I don't want to say computer diva because that would be a little much,

472
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.310
but I was on the cover of,
believe it or not,

473
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.550
I was on the cover of wired magazine for being a kind of booster of this

474
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:38.470
technique is it seems like very early days,

475
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.730
but in fact it was true that I was very,

476
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:45.320
and it juiciest and the difference between,
so before I answer your question,

477
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:50.710
what this device has that other devices don't TV anything.

478
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.600
The uniqueness of this device is the always on,

479
00:32:56.601 --> 00:33:00.620
always on new property where you can,

480
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.080
every interaction you're in,

481
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:08.420
like your baby being with your baby.

482
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:12.110
There are,
there are potty trainers that have a slot for the IPAD,

483
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:17.120
there are baby bouncers with a slot for the IPAD.
There are,
and,
and,
and to me,

484
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:22.510
those signify our kind of willingness to interrupt every time that normally we

485
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:29.360
would be thinking of the human gaze and the human talk to a baby,

486
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:35.110
which is built into us as what the baby needs as potentially broken by a screen.

487
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:42.830
So that the fact of those objects in the culture are symptoms of the fact that

488
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:47.090
we have still gotten so used to this always on,
always on u s situation,

489
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.910
a television.
I grew up with a television,

490
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.080
my family sat around it and we all talk to the television.

491
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.831
There was this program,

492
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:59.360
I remember Mama on the television that are an immigrant family and we all fought

493
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:03.230
with the television about what that family did and how our family would have

494
00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:06.800
done it differently and and how they're making big mistakes and what they're

495
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:10.610
doing with their money.
Television didn't have to be isolating.

496
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.170
It could be isolating.

497
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.040
We have to find a way to make our current technologies less isolating.

498
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.120
I mean,
it's kind of like a,

499
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:27.190
to television as a perfect example for me of how it's not the object,

500
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.120
it's the designing for vulnerability around the object.

501
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:39.250
We are vulnerable to certain kinds of uses of our phones that are not really

502
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:45.350
nurturing of us as a co,
as individuals in a collective.

503
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.930
And we have to design around that vulnerability to make that relationship
better.

504
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:51.980
I mean,
that's how I see it.

505
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.750
But I don't know about television modeling empathy in our troubles with empathy.

506
00:34:56.751 --> 00:35:01.550
I have to think about that.
That's,
uh,
I'll get back to you.
We'll,

507
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.750
we'll talk more about that.

508
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.940
The idea that not enough television is the root of,
this is something I,

509
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.050
I have to admit that's a,
that's a toughie.

510
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.580
<v 4>Your work is on the level of sort of peer interaction and it's very fascinating</v>

511
00:35:21.241 --> 00:35:23.400
and frightening to me.
Both.
Um,

512
00:35:23.401 --> 00:35:28.020
I wanted to ask you about two areas that are related but are on a kind of a

513
00:35:28.021 --> 00:35:31.380
different scale.
Um,
20 years ago,

514
00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:36.381
Robert Putnam wrote bowling alone about the decline of civic participation

515
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.210
society.
Um,

516
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.750
he wrote that between 1995 and 2000,

517
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.370
he was looking back to 1950.
Um,

518
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.800
it's talking about the client of voting of civic organizations,

519
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:54.420
even things like bowling legs,
hence the title of the book.
And they're clearly,

520
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:57.090
there are a lot of things that play into this,
including,
you know,

521
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:59.310
residential mobility and all kinds of stuff.

522
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:04.500
But he did in fact link it to technology,
uh,
notably TV,

523
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:08.790
the rise of TV.
And later the Internet over that whole period.

524
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.120
I'm just wondering,
I know you didn't directly study,
you know,

525
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:14.730
things like a wider organizations,

526
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.420
but I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about whether this might be related

527
00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:22.500
to that.
That's number one and number two,
um,
uh,

528
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.450
a slightly different sort of thing.

529
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.070
I wonder if you have any thoughts about whether this kind of trend is in any way

530
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:31.170
related to the recent,

531
00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.730
a huge increase in diagnosis of autism and autistic disorders.

532
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:40.960
<v 2>Well,
let me take the second first.
I'm not an autism expert,</v>

533
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.810
so I,
I,
I,

534
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.230
I say this kind of bracketed with that disclaimer,

535
00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.740
but I know for a fact that in the schools that I was studying that were not

536
00:36:53.111 --> 00:36:58.111
schools specifically not schools for children who had developmental disorders or

537
00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:04.510
autism or were on the spectrum
children,

538
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.110
we're not looking at each other in the eye.

539
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.140
We're having conversations with their heads down,

540
00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:16.210
did not show empathy towards the other child,
other children.
In one case,

541
00:37:16.211 --> 00:37:21.211
I report in the book again in a school that is not for children on the spectrum.

542
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.610
A child,

543
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:30.030
one child's father had committed suicide and another girl says to him,

544
00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.850
I hope you go the way of your dad when she didn't lock,

545
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.710
when she wanted to talk to his sister more in the lunch room and you know,

546
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.150
honestly a 13 year old fight.

547
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.200
And when the headmaster tries to talk to her about this and he said to me,

548
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.500
his goal was to make that girl cry,
you know,
that would,

549
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.240
and then he had to call his or her mother to explain why she came home in tears.

550
00:37:55.241 --> 00:37:56.280
I mean,
you know,

551
00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:01.180
to try to get her head into the head of this other kid.

552
00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.060
He said it was almost impossible.
In other words,

553
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:09.090
you have children acting as though they were on the spectrum and the knee,

554
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.360
the in the camps where children go and have a summer without phones.

555
00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:21.450
One of the things the counselors note is the children come in kind of heads

556
00:38:22.451 --> 00:38:26.590
down,
not talking,
having a very hard time relating to other kids.

557
00:38:26.591 --> 00:38:28.180
And by the end of the summer it's often,

558
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.890
it's often as long as a 10 week or 12 week session.
Um,

559
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.420
they taste they're,
so,
I,

560
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:41.530
I fear that we're misdiagnosing all his kids who really have a different kind of

561
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:46.050
disorder,
which is that they,
they're,

562
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:50.620
they're out of a kind of practice and I mean this quite literally,

563
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:54.820
they're out of a kind of practice of,
of,

564
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:59.990
of meeting to deal with the complexities of a conversation and we're diagnosing

565
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:07.411
them perhaps as on the spectrum when really they need the talking cure because,

566
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:15.010
um,
I'll tell you just one piece of this.

567
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.220
Children don't apologize.
They say they type I'm sorry,

568
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:22.450
and they hit send and the elements of an apology,

569
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.710
which is looking you in the eye seeing that you are hurt.

570
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.150
<v 1>Okay,</v>

571
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:32.500
<v 2>your seeing that I'm upset that I see that you're hurt,</v>

572
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:38.080
you feeling compassionate because you see that I'm upset my seeing,

573
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:39.850
oh my God,
he looks compassionate.

574
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.140
Maybe there's a chance for me and you're seeing that.
I want to take that chance.

575
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.310
This is a very,

576
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:49.420
very complicated dance and this is how empathy is born.

577
00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:54.400
We're doing all of this,
putting each other and the in the turn of the other,

578
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.690
I'm sorry,
on and hitting send does none of this work.

579
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.750
So I'm saying that I see a lot,

580
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:06.520
I have a lot of optimism and just giving kids more of an opportunity.

581
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.100
And this is where I want to get back to Robert Putnam.

582
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.850
When you're not sending a kid out on the street,
when you're,

583
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:14.710
when he's not part of that boy scout troop,

584
00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:17.530
would that afterschool thing where that little league or that,
you know,

585
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:22.280
I recently had a reunion.
One lovely thing about getting your book with you,

586
00:40:22.281 --> 00:40:25.480
The New York Times as you all of a sudden you're meeting people you went to

587
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:27.970
kindergarten with.
You know,
because they,
I mean it's like,
you know,
they,

588
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.480
oh my God,
Sherry,
you know,
I can go to your book towards signing.
You know,

589
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:32.680
I always went to kindergarten with you.

590
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.310
So I'm going to having like all these wonderful reunions and we're all talking

591
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:41.170
about how much time we spent on the street does in Brooklyn.
We spent a lot of,

592
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:45.400
this is pre bowling alone.
We bowled together.
I mean we didn't bowl,

593
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:48.740
we played the other games,
but hopscotch or tag or,

594
00:40:48.741 --> 00:40:53.741
but we were on the street and all of those interactions were part of communities

595
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:56.860
where people were constantly negotiating.
We're kids,

596
00:40:56.861 --> 00:41:01.150
we're constantly learning these skills.
So I see my work as the,

597
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.460
she hung inside the micro side,
the personal side,

598
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.020
the opening up the door of the how the home side of what Robert Putnam is

599
00:41:11.021 --> 00:41:14.570
talking about.
So I feel very close to the work of,

600
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.240
of Putnam and other people like him who were talking about the macro was my
work,

601
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.340
excuse me,
focuses more on the micro.

602
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

603
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.380
<v 2>Good morning.
The um,</v>

604
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.550
I love what technology is doing in schools right now for the most part in terms

605
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:33.980
of enabling collaboration between students and things like that.

606
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.760
<v 5>Uh,
but it's the same.
It's the same.</v>

607
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.640
A lot of the same opportunities for avoidance and,
um,

608
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.120
being alone are created with the screens.

609
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.450
So talk a little bit about what you think schools might need to do or could do

610
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.860
to help mitigate against,
you know,
pushing us faster down the path.

611
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:56.840
You're talking about number one and number two,

612
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.910
have you heard from maybe corporations at all,
uh,

613
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.490
around the training implications for this,
for communications,

614
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.640
particularly in a selling environment?
Um,
you know,
go to a sale.
I'm,

615
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.590
I'm a sales leader here.
Um,

616
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:17.600
everyone has a device or two or three at every meeting you go to.

617
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.400
So from what you've described,

618
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:24.430
that means that automatically empathy has gone from the meeting and empathy as a

619
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:29.450
key part for in salesmanship.
So if you could talk about that for a minute too.

620
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.590
<v 2>Let me start with that.</v>

621
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:35.950
Here's a great chapter in my book on business and my favorite,

622
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.190
my favorite story is,
um,
is a,

623
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.990
is a guy who says,
I cannot make,

624
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:45.561
you know,

625
00:42:45.561 --> 00:42:50.561
I cannot close the deal unless I have a conversation and I have to get,

626
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.480
and I cannot tell you how many times he tells me that I will send out an email

627
00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:58.730
and,
and uh,

628
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
they'll want to send me an email back and I know that I need to see this person.

629
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
I need to have his device away and for me to close this deal and,

630
00:43:10.491 --> 00:43:15.491
and I have to work so hard to get him at least on the phone or hopefully face to

631
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:21.860
face to really make the money I need.

632
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.430
Or people talk at length about people who do not,

633
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:28.880
who just want to send emails back and forth instead of really closing,
you know,

634
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:33.230
instead of really dealing with a problem or who will not put there or the

635
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:38.231
struggle to get the highest levels to put their devices away during very

636
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:39.650
important meetings.

637
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:45.040
And I'm seeing a big shift in willingness to start to force people to put their

638
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:54.630
devices away because really to get things done,
you,

639
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.800
you,
you need full attention.
So I think we're just at the cusp.
I mean,

640
00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:02.020
I want this project to be part of,
you know,
no,

641
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.340
no one book changes people's,
I mean,

642
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:07.070
I don't expect you guys to read this book and say,
Oh,
you know,

643
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.220
now my mind is changed completely,
but I want this to,

644
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I think I've assembled a lot of data that should start a good conversation about

645
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.680
phones and business.
I know in my work setting,

646
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.820
five years ago,
professors were,
I am not anybody's nanny.

647
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:30.080
I don't want to be anybody's nanny.
You come to class,
you do whatever you want.

648
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.650
I'm nobody's nanny.

649
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:36.830
And now with all the new data that is in about how one open laptop not only

650
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:40.110
destroys the attention of the person with the open laptop,

651
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.260
but it kind of circle around that person.

652
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.600
We have baskets and we say put,

653
00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:50.820
put the phone and put the laptop in the basket and then come into class.

654
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:55.320
The professors are now have a totally different attitude about this.

655
00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:58.500
There's a story in the book about Carol Steiker at the Harvard business school

656
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.790
who five years ago,
six years ago,
had everybody,
you know,
taking notes on laptops.

657
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:06.180
She thought that was the way,
okay,
sure.
Everybody,
that's how people,
right.

658
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:11.570
And then she says that she found that when they had their laptops open,

659
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.480
people would transcribing the class.

660
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.150
They weren't integrating what was happening in the class.

661
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:21.270
They were doing a trial like they were court snog refers and her law school

662
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:23.370
class at Harvard.
So,

663
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.700
and then one day one of the students was sick,

664
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.790
she was in the hospital and different members of the class had offered to take

665
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:34.630
notes for this sick girl.
And a student comes up to her and says,
Professor Saker,

666
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.570
I,
I need to have your notes today because my,
my,
my power was lost.

667
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.620
I didn't have a power cord.
And she said,
well why didn't you take notes by hand?

668
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.350
And she said,
well I couldn't do that.

669
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.450
I couldn't get it all down if I took notes by hand.

670
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:53.790
So the whole thing that she wants her students to do,
which is to integrate,

671
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:58.800
which is to integrate what you hear and make sense of it for you,

672
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.840
which you can do by hand.

673
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:06.420
The student had level was not even like on the program that she would even think

674
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:09.450
of doing that.
All she knows how to do is take everything down in a laptop.

675
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.060
And that's the day that Steiker said no more computers in class.

676
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.450
So to your point about schools,

677
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.200
I go into classrooms and students are just using these devices in ways that are

678
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.120
fantastic mind blowing.

679
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:31.070
And there's a lot of use of these computers in ways that are mine deadening and

680
00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:35.850
now it's our job to sort this through and it's,

681
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.190
it's a big job because I have,

682
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.950
there are some of the most hysterical stories in my book.

683
00:46:40.951 --> 00:46:45.951
I think our students who print out their reading assignments because it's too

684
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:50.190
distracting to read them on the computer that their school gave them because

685
00:46:50.191 --> 00:46:51.024
they're too,

686
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:55.290
they're too tempted to look at other things and let their minds wander so that's

687
00:46:55.291 --> 00:46:57.510
what you don't want so you have to,

688
00:46:57.511 --> 00:46:59.690
it's not enough to just put the computers in class.

689
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.840
You have to be now it's the second generation we all have to like get very

690
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:08.841
vigilant about what about the culture of the classroom that we use the men and I

691
00:47:09.961 --> 00:47:13.680
really think schools should not close their libraries.
Very,

692
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:16.740
very bad choice.
Very bad choice.

693
00:47:16.741 --> 00:47:20.640
Putting everything on the machine and thinking libraries are gone.

694
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.230
Very bad choice
is that my phone,

695
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.940
my daughter who works for Linkedin,

696
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.430
God telling me something,

697
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.850
she's 24 she works for Linkedin,

698
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
says that only someone over 40 ever forgets to turn over their phone.

699
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.340
Off their phone.
That's very funny.
Yes.

700
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:47.991
<v 6>Hi.
Uh,</v>

701
00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:52.180
how do you deal with the idea that more and more time being spent on devices is

702
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.380
being used to be more productive,

703
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:59.360
be emails or reading articles or because Internet has so much information,

704
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.370
so all the additional time that it's been used to spend on devices is being used

705
00:48:04.371 --> 00:48:06.740
to be more productive and anything,

706
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:12.230
any time that is spent in solitude is sort of wasted time or so to speak.

707
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.860
<v 2>Well,
I honor your question</v>

708
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:23.270
and how can I say in the nicest possible way,
the premise is wrong.

709
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.310
The premise,

710
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.940
the time and solitude reading a male is without any further qualifier,

711
00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:34.830
productive,

712
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:39.830
the most productive way you could be spending your time is part of what we have

713
00:48:39.921 --> 00:48:44.330
to examine because it turns out not to be true.
And the premise,

714
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.580
the time in solitude,

715
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:52.270
getting more information online is the most productive way to be spending your

716
00:48:54.681 --> 00:48:58.130
time instead of,
for example,

717
00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.960
and it just may sound crazy to you,

718
00:48:59.961 --> 00:49:03.130
but it's by hearing something that sounds crazy,
that you kind of say,
Oh,

719
00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.370
let me think about this crazy thing and I'll let me entertain this idea.

720
00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.450
Mind wandering,
letting your imagination wander.

721
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:16.010
We're terrified of that idea.
People like,
oh,
I want to stay with my computer.

722
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:21.040
I want to stay on my machine when we now have a device that lets us do that.

723
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:26.690
Unless us feel that we're always productive.
That's why we want to be at it.

724
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.400
I mean,
we wouldn't be in this,

725
00:49:28.401 --> 00:49:33.401
probably wouldn't be having this problem if this thing didn't seduce us with the

726
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:38.330
promise that we're more productive when we're at it.
So that's why I,

727
00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:39.403
you know,
I'm,

728
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.330
I'm so sympathetic with your premise because that's how we feel when we're with

729
00:49:44.331 --> 00:49:46.850
it.
I sometimes say it makes us three promises,

730
00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:51.080
like gifts of the benevolent ferry.
You will always be productive.

731
00:49:51.081 --> 00:49:52.190
You will always be,

732
00:49:52.191 --> 00:49:55.400
you can go where you can let your imagination go wherever it wants to go.

733
00:49:55.401 --> 00:49:56.540
You will always be her.

734
00:49:56.541 --> 00:50:00.380
You will never be bored and you know when now you'll always be productive.

735
00:50:00.381 --> 00:50:05.120
You'll or you'll never be wasting time.
You'll never,
and just turns out that,

736
00:50:05.121 --> 00:50:08.840
that,
that we've sort of,
um,
it's like multitasking.

737
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.500
The great studies of bi,
of multitasking by,
by Clifford Nass,

738
00:50:12.501 --> 00:50:16.520
who tragically died a few years ago,
showed that when people multitask,

739
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.560
they feel like they're doing better and better and better and better every for

740
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.410
every task they add,
when in fact they're doing worse and worse.

741
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.170
Every test they add,

742
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:31.280
they feel they're doing better at every task and in fact are doing worse than

743
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:35.480
every task.
And we have to force ourselves to reconsider that.

744
00:50:35.481 --> 00:50:40.460
That extra time at our email is,
is,
is not timed.

745
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:43.070
It's really the most productive and the most collaborative.

746
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:48.250
That's why I do case studies of companies where instead of allowing for

747
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:56.330
conversation and collaboration,
the,

748
00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:01.360
the value of the company is to keep everybody at their screen and they're losing

749
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:07.001
out even though they're stating that really what they want is people talking and

750
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:11.930
collaborating because the pressure to stay at your screen is such an important

751
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:13.010
part of the company culture.

752
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.540
So that somebody asked about do I want to have an impact on businesses mean if I

753
00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:21.590
had one impact on business,
that would be the conversation I would want to start.

754
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:24.620
I think.
Yeah.
Hi.
Um,

755
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:29.740
I was curious about when you were talking about kind of resilience of that just

756
00:51:29.901 --> 00:51:34.160
a bit of time away helps rebuild that empathy.
Um,

757
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.800
and it's particularly interesting to me because I keep Shabbat,

758
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.940
so from Friday afternoon till Saturday night,
my phone is off,

759
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.520
no exceptions,
no computer,
no nothing.

760
00:51:43.521 --> 00:51:46.550
And the community of people that I'm friends with and that I spend that time

761
00:51:46.551 --> 00:51:51.020
with also have their phones off and I enjoy it.

762
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.913
Um,

763
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.040
and I'm curious if there's been any studies either examining the effect within

764
00:51:57.711 --> 00:51:58.940
that sort of community,

765
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:03.170
but also I would imagine that that information would be very useful.

766
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:08.290
Applying outwards of what sort of techniques are useful and how much time away

767
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.630
has an effect on empathy and community.
Well,
actually there's a,
there's a,

768
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:18.030
there's a large community of people who are um,

769
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:23.500
working on the notion of sort of a digital Shabbat and who have kind of,

770
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.600
um,
but not necessarily making it a religious practice,

771
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.470
but you sort of using that experience and,
and many people find that it,

772
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:39.730
the 24 hours turns out to be almost ideal.

773
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.980
An ideal time.
Others,

774
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:48.250
others find that taking three hours a night is perfect.

775
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:56.630
Others find that.
So what people have,
what people have shown is that

776
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.920
is that there are many ways to do it.

777
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:06.790
And that what makes most sense for the beginning is for people to tune it to

778
00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:11.360
their,
you know,
own family lives and their own,

779
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.230
you know,
kind of,
you know,
stories.

780
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.070
But certainly the one day once a week is ideal.

781
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.520
Many families take one and a half day vacation with a sort of literally go to a

782
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:29.490
different place where there's no internet,
where they do things together.

783
00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.680
The the,
the part in,
in,
in the studies that were done,

784
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.690
I'm forgetting the name of the company,
it's a,
it's a large consulting company.

785
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:39.660
It's public information.
It'll come back to me.
I write about it.

786
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:44.100
They just haven't called predictable time off where they gave people only one

787
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:47.130
night a week.
But what you mentioned was very important.

788
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:50.940
You're in a community of people to talk about it and they didn't only give

789
00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:55.470
people one night a week where they said,
you don't have to be on your phone,

790
00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:01.050
but they had people talk about that experience when they came to work and they

791
00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:02.520
gave them support at work,

792
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:06.900
more support perhaps in other workers had about the stresses of the always on

793
00:54:06.901 --> 00:54:07.734
life.

794
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:12.910
And many people think that what is helpful about the Shabbat is that so many

795
00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:17.820
people who were taking that Shabbat,
they're not just taking that Shabbat,

796
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.050
but they're taking that Shabbat and they're also in community with other people.

797
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:27.380
Which is why it makes it harder to study your experience and make it seem like,

798
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:31.530
oh,
well we'll just apply this to everybody and that will be the right recipe for

799
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:36.531
digital detox because you're having a combination of no digital but then an

800
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:40.110
extraordinary group community experience.

801
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.650
But I think people are trying different things.
It makes sense,
you know,

802
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:45.750
different people in different ways.
Yeah.
Thank you.

803
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.980
<v 7>I liked your term seduction.
Um,</v>

804
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.250
it's very easy to get on and stay on even though there's no reason to,
um,

805
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:59.340
to um,
uh,
to say,
well,
it's the easy thing to do just to stay on here.

806
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.010
Uh,
my question I guess is,

807
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:08.120
is there some way to use these tools more intentionally as you say,

808
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.300
Facebook,
for example,
Mike,
kindergarten friends,

809
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.930
sometimes I do see them on Facebook and said,
wow,
you know,

810
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.620
I had no idea you were in California.
You know,

811
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:21.300
what have you been doing for the last 50 years
or more?
Actually,
but,

812
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.770
um,
so,
you know,
but I on the other hand,

813
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:28.980
uh,
realizing that they've just spent an hour on Facebook,
I said,

814
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:30.570
what the hell have I been doing?
Right.

815
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:36.180
Is there some way to use tools like that more effectively?
More intentionally,

816
00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:41.420
<v 2>yes.
But I'm not sure that,
um,
but,</v>

817
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.520
but you know,
again,
what is your intention?
I think,

818
00:55:46.521 --> 00:55:48.230
I think we have to figure out if is it,

819
00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:53.240
I now have an intention that I actually like from,

820
00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:58.241
I've learned from this tour that I actually like connecting with the people I

821
00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:02.870
knew when I was a kid in Brooklyn.
So when I'm on Facebook now,

822
00:56:02.871 --> 00:56:05.450
I'm not wandering the plains of Facebook,

823
00:56:05.451 --> 00:56:08.990
just hoping that somebody will bite me.

824
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:13.280
I actually kind of like,
you know,
if I spend some time there,

825
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:18.281
I'm actually feel motivated to look for the people who were on the masthead of

826
00:56:18.981 --> 00:56:22.610
the Lincoln log at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.

827
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.730
I don't feel that that's,

828
00:56:24.731 --> 00:56:29.731
I think I feel that joyful and positive time online so that that's behavior with

829
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:33.970
intention.
I think the issue is behavior with intention.

830
00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:37.150
When you're on the Internet with behavior,
with intention,
what's,

831
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:40.170
what's not to like it's,
I mean,
when,

832
00:56:40.171 --> 00:56:45.171
when if students in our classes actually looked up something that was crucial to

833
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:48.910
the discussion,
broader to the class and said,
my God,

834
00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:52.000
well here's the thing that's,
that's crucial to the discussion.

835
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.740
And then that was the end of it.
That'd be fine.
But that's not what happens.

836
00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:59.860
They look it up and then they get,
they see a message and they'd go,

837
00:56:59.861 --> 00:57:01.990
did they was one of my students says,

838
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:06.991
I can't bear not to see who wants me when she sees a message from Facebook.

839
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:10.690
And that's what it's about.
We all want to see who wants us there.

840
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:12.580
So you go to Facebook and then once you're there,

841
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:15.040
you see an ad and then we see we have the,

842
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:18.190
the trail and then you're buying rei sportswear.

843
00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:21.670
I mean that's the sort of MIT trail from the,
from the,

844
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:23.350
from the factoid to the,

845
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:28.540
who wants me to the hub to enter to the choose to the hiking shoes.

846
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.800
So I think that the notion of acting with intention is the one that matters,

847
00:57:32.801 --> 00:57:35.680
but you have to decide what your intention is for each of these,

848
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:40.210
for each of these things.
Thanks.
And this is the last question.

849
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:41.303
<v 8>Okay.
Um,</v>

850
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.160
I'm just wondering if you've looked at the difference between talking on the

851
00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:48.030
phone with people and texting.
I've noticed that I used to,

852
00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:50.640
if my wife had a conversation on the phone,
I over here,

853
00:57:50.641 --> 00:57:53.160
part of what she's talking about,
you can ask questions about it later,

854
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:56.010
but if someone picks up a phone and looks at it,
it's all private.

855
00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:00.210
Have you looked at the difference between texting and talking on,

856
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.710
<v 2>well,
you know,
there was a wonderful,</v>

857
00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:04.240
and we talking about privacy and there's so much to discuss here,

858
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:04.811
but let me just give you,

859
00:58:04.811 --> 00:58:09.811
just refer you to one wonderful piece of writing a woman in any issue of privacy

860
00:58:10.451 --> 00:58:11.830
and texting and what you lose.

861
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:16.510
A woman recently wrote an op Ed in the New York Times about,
uh,

862
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.960
being a mother and the difference between being a mother and doing all of her

863
00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:25.450
work for her children like this.

864
00:58:25.451 --> 00:58:30.310
On the phone and the way her mother did work for her by getting on the phone,

865
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:34.840
organizing a birthday party,
you know,
getting,
getting stuff,
you know,

866
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:39.460
calling up ans and asking,
you know,
do they have any children's toys?

867
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:43.690
She says,
my children complain that I'm on the phone all the time,
texting.

868
00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.390
But really I'm organizing their birthday parties.

869
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:50.470
When my mother was on the phone,
I could hear her life.

870
00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:56.130
I could hear that she was doing things for me and our family and food and

871
00:58:56.321 --> 00:58:57.940
friendships and did,

872
00:58:57.941 --> 00:59:02.560
part of the problem with the privacy of what we do on our phones is that we

873
00:59:02.561 --> 00:59:07.300
don't see that we're actually doing things for each other.
So,
I mean,

874
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:12.050
I'm just so moved by your saying,
I could hear,
but my wife was dealing,

875
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:14.980
so it's very complicated.
This whole,
uh,
this whole,

876
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:19.960
this whole part of how texting takes us away from each other in this other way

877
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:22.960
is just something that people are starting to study now.
Well,
listen,

878
00:59:22.961 --> 00:59:25.990
thank you very much.
You've been a great audience.
Sorry about my phone,

879
00:59:25.991 --> 00:59:28.330
my phone etiquette.
