1
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.340
Hello everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.
I,
it's really lovely to see you.

2
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.890
I'm incredibly excited to be here.

3
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:22.460
If anyone is hiring a fiction writer here at Google,

4
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.730
please email me.
Uh,

5
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.710
I like your kitchens

6
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.550
and I want just an endless supply of seltzer water.

7
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.360
That's like my absolute dream in this world.
Um,

8
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.300
so today I am going to be reading from her body and other parties and I wanted

9
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.690
to briefly talk about the collection before I started reading and I'm actually

10
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:48.740
going to read you an entire story,
which I'm extremely excited about because um,

11
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.550
at readings I almost never get to read an entire story and it makes me real

12
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.020
cranky.
I hate doing excerpts,

13
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:58.840
so I'm like very excited to give you an entire story.
I'm stoked.

14
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.100
I have done that in ages.
Um,
so yeah,

15
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:04.940
her body of the parties is a collection of short stories that does a lot of sort

16
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:08.870
of genre bending material or it has a lot of gender bending material.

17
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.600
The cool story I'm going to read you is the only sort of pure science fiction

18
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.300
story in the collection.
Um,

19
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.240
most of the stories are sort of fabulous kind of deal with like,

20
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.800
or sort of surrealist,
liminal fantasy,
that sort of area.
Um,

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.310
this one just happens to be my,
my science fiction story.
Um,

22
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.600
and I'm really interested in,
uh,
using fiction,

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.650
just sort of explore and examine questions about women's lives and then includes

24
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.680
sex,
gender,
um,

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.640
sort of intellectual problems that like women experience or have uniquely in

26
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:41.810
their lives.
Um,

27
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:45.680
in terms of like how do we tell stories about women that talk about mental

28
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:48.770
health without falling into traps of like say,
writing like a crazy,

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.970
a crazy woman's story or like a crazy lesbian story,
for example.
Um,

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.330
so this is just think it's really interesting to me and is really important to

31
00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:59.660
me and I've been working on these stories for about five years and uh,
yeah.

32
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.920
And then I finally had a book's worth,
which is pretty exciting.
Um,
yeah.

33
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:06.920
So the story I'm going to be reading you today,
it's called inventory

34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.200
inventory.
One girl,

35
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.550
we lay next to each other on a musty rug in her basement.

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.230
Her parents were upstairs.
We told them we were watching Jurassic Park.

37
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.230
I'm the dad and you're the mom.
She said,

38
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.270
I pulled up my shirt and she pulled up hers and we just stared at each other.

39
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.270
My heart fluttered somewhere below my belly button,

40
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.200
but I worried about daddy long legs and her parents finding us.

41
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.850
I still have never seen Jurassic Park,
I suppose.
I never will.
Now,

42
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.320
one boy,
one girl,
my friends,

43
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.150
we drank stolen wine coolers and my room on the vast expanse of my bed.

44
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.680
We laughed and talked and passed around the bottles.
What I like about you,

45
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:56.420
she said is your reactions.

46
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.130
You respond so funny to everything like it's all intense.

47
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.750
He nodded in agreement.

48
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.460
She buried her face in my neck and said like this to my skin.

49
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.490
I laughed.
I was nervous,
excited.

50
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.870
I felt like a good tar and someone was twisting the tuning pegs and my strings

51
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.890
were getting tighter.

52
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.240
They batted their eyelashes against my skin and breathe into my ears.

53
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.710
I moaned and rise and hovered on the edge of coming for whole minutes.

54
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.840
Even though no one was touching me,
they're not even me.
Two boys.

55
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.190
One girl,
one of them.
My boyfriend,
his parents were out of town,

56
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.020
so we threw a party at his house.

57
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.920
We drank lemonade mixed with vodka and he encouraged me to make out with his

58
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:42.490
friends girlfriend.
We kissed tentatively and then stopped.

59
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.200
The boys made out with each other and we watched them for a long time board but

60
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:52.180
too drunk to stand up.
We fell asleep in the guest bedroom and the guest bedroom.

61
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.620
When I woke up,
my bladder was tight as a fist.
I padded down to the foyer,

62
00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:00.130
Yay and saw someone have knocked a vodka lemonade onto the floor.

63
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.330
I tried to clean it up.
The mixture had stripped the marble finish bear.

64
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.620
My boyfriend's mother found my underwear behind the bed weeks later and handed

65
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:10.690
them to him.
Laundered without a word.

66
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.340
It's weird to me how much I missed that floral chemical smell of clean clothes.

67
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.290
Now all I can think about is fabric softener.
One man,

68
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.310
slender,
tall,
so skinny.
I could see his pelvic bone,

69
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.330
which I found strangely sexy,
gray eyes,
wry smile.

70
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.960
I had known him for almost a year since the previous October.

71
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.470
When we met at a Halloween party.
I didn't wear a costume.

72
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.130
He was dressed as Barbarella.
We drank in his apartment.

73
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.270
He was nervous and gave me a massage.
I was nervous,
so I let him.

74
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.950
He rubbed my back for a long time.
He said,
my hands are getting tired.

75
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.650
I said,
oh,
and turn toward him.
He kissed me.
His face rough with stubble.

76
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.700
He smelled like yeast and the top notes of expensive Cologne.

77
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.400
He lay on top of me and we made out for a while.

78
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.220
Everything inside of me twinged pleasurably.

79
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.760
He asked if he could touch my breasts and I clamped his hand around it.

80
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.140
I took off my shirt and I felt like a drop of water was sliding up my spine.

81
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.880
I realized this was happening really happening.
We both undressed.

82
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.640
He rolled the condom down in Lumbard on top of me.

83
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.150
It hurt worse than anything ever.
He came and I didn't.

84
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.850
When he pulled out the condom was covered in blood.

85
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.240
He peeled it off and threw it away,
everything and be pounded.

86
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.410
We slept on a too small bed.
He insisted on driving me back to the dorms.

87
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:36.610
The next day in my room I took off my clothes and wrap myself in a towel.

88
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.840
I still smelled like him,
like the two of us together and I wanted more.

89
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.860
I felt good like an adult who has sex sometimes and a life.

90
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.660
My roommate asked me how it was,
hugged me.
One man,

91
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.200
a boyfriend,
didn't like condoms,
asked me if I was on birth control,

92
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:58.190
pulled out anyway,
a terrible mess.
One woman on and off again,

93
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:02.120
sort of girlfriend,
classmate from organization of computer systems,

94
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.080
long brown hair down to her,
but she was softer than I expected.

95
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.840
I want it to go down on her,
but she was too nervous.

96
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.530
We made out and she slept her tongue in my mouth and after she went home,

97
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.730
I got off twice in the cool stillness of my apartment.
Two years later,

98
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:18.040
we had sex on the gravel roof,

99
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:21.650
top of my office building four floors below our bodies.

100
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.940
My Code was compiling in front of an empty chair.
After we were done.

101
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.090
I looked up and noticed a man in a suit watching us from the window of an

102
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:32.900
adjacent skyscraper.
His hand shuffling around inside his slacks.

103
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.810
One woman round glasses,
red hair,
don't remember where I met her.

104
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.890
We got high and fucked and I accidentally fell asleep with my hand inside her.

105
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.880
We woke up predawn and walked across town to a 24 hour diner.
It drizzled.

106
00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:50.600
The mummy got there are sandaled feet were numb with chill.

107
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.190
We ate pancakes are mugs ran dry and when we looked for the waitress,

108
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:59.150
she was watching the breaking news on the batter TV hanging from the ceiling.

109
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.010
She chewed on her lip and the pot of coffee tipped in her hand tripping tiny

110
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:05.690
brown dots on the linoleum.

111
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.670
We watched the news caster blinked away and was replaced with a list of symptoms

112
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:14.240
of the virus blossoming a state away in northern California.

113
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.140
When he came back,
he repeated that the planes were grounded.

114
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.610
The border of the state had been closed and the virus appeared to be isolated.

115
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.200
When the waitress walked over,
she seemed distracted.
Do you have people there?

116
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:30.350
I asked her and she nodded her eyes filling with tears.

117
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.670
I felt terrible having asked her anything.
One man,

118
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.320
I met him at the bar on the corner from my house we made out on my bed.

119
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.060
He smelled like sour wine though.
He'd been drinking vodka.
We had sex,

120
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:48.410
but he went soft halfway through because some more he wanted to go down to me,

121
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:53.180
but I didn't want him to.
He got angry and left slamming the screen door so hard.

122
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.330
My spice rack jumped from it's nail and crashed to the floor.

123
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.550
My dog lapped up and nutmeg.

124
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.960
Then I had to force feed them salt to make him throw up red drum.
Adrenaline.

125
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.420
I made a list of animals I've had in my life,

126
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.230
seven including two Beta fish who died within a week of each other when I was

127
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:14.180
nine and a list of the spices and far cloves,
cinnamon star,
anise,

128
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:18.260
coriander,
ginger,
cardamom pods,
one man,

129
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.970
six inches shorter than me.

130
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.780
I explained that the website I was working for was losing business rapidly

131
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.840
because no one wanted quirky photography tips during an epidemic.

132
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.020
And I had been laid off that morning.
He bought me dinner,

133
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.650
we had sex in his car because he had roommates and I couldn't be in my house

134
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:37.250
right then and he slid his hand inside my bra and his hands were perfect,

135
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.280
fucking perfect.
And we fell into the two small backseat.

136
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.740
I came for the first time in two months.

137
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.370
I called him the next day and left him a voicemail telling him I'd had a good

138
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:49.280
time and I'd like to see him again,
but he never called me back.

139
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.710
One man did some sort of labor for a living,
I can't remember what exactly,

140
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.560
and he had a tattoo of a Boa constrictor on his back with a misspelled Latin

141
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:02.790
phrase below it.
He was strong,
could pick me up and fuck me against a wall.

142
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:05.190
And it was the most thrilling sensation I'd ever felt.

143
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.380
We broke a few picture frames that way.

144
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.640
He used his hands and I dragged my fingernails down his back and he asked me if

145
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:15.900
I was going to come for him and I said,
yes,
yes,
I'm going to come for you.
Yes,

146
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:20.730
I will.
One woman,
blonde hair,
brush voice,

147
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.040
friend of a friend we married.

148
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.890
I still not sure if I was with her because I want it to be,

149
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:30.120
or I was afraid of what the world was catching all around us.
Within a year,

150
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:34.290
it's soured.
We screen more than we had sex or even talked.

151
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.340
One night we had a fight that left me in tears and afterward she asked me if I

152
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:40.920
wanted to fuck and untrust before I could answer.

153
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.020
I wanted to push her out the window.

154
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.460
We had sex and I started crying when it was over and she was showering.

155
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.580
I packed a suitcase and gotten my car and drove one man six months later,

156
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:55.320
and my post divorce Hayes,

157
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.980
I met him at the funeral for the last surviving member of his family.

158
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.590
I was grieving.
He was grieving.

159
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.430
We had sex in the empty house that used to belong to his brother and his

160
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:09.870
brother's wife and their children all dead.
We fucked in every room,

161
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:13.620
including the hallway where I couldn't bend my pelvis right on the hard floor,

162
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.850
and so I jerked him off in front of the bear linen closet in the master bedroom.

163
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.450
I caught my reflection in the vanity mirror as I wrote him and the lights were

164
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:25.230
off and our skin reflected silver from the moon.
And when he came at me he said,

165
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.220
sorry,
sorry.
He died a week later by his own hand.

166
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.750
I moved out of the city,

167
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.100
north one man gray eyes again,

168
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.710
I hadn't seen him in so many years.

169
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.060
He asked me how I was doing and I told him some things and not others.

170
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.840
I did not want to cry in front of the man to whom I give him my virginity.

171
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.970
That seems wrong.
Somehow he asked me how many I lost and I said my mother,

172
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.930
my roommate from college,
I did not mention that I'd found my mother dead,

173
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.620
nor the three days afterward I'd spent with anxious doctors checking my eyes,

174
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.390
my eyes for the early symptoms,

175
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.320
nor how I'd managed to escape the quarantine zone.
When I met you,

176
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:09.180
he said you were so fucking young.
His body was familiar,
but alien too.

177
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.090
He'd gotten better and I had gotten better when he pulled out an album,

178
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.970
suspected blood,
but of course there was none.

179
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.840
He gotten more beautiful in those intervening years.
More thoughtful.

180
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.020
I surprised myself by crying over the bathroom sink.

181
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:27.060
I ran the taps so he couldn't hear me.
One woman,
Brunette,

182
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.010
a former CDC employee,

183
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.910
I met her at a community meeting where they taught us how to stockpile food and

184
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:35.910
manage outbreaks in our neighborhood.
Should the virus hop the firebreak.

185
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.050
I had not slept with a woman since my wife,
but when she lifted her shirt,

186
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:43.920
I realized how much I've been craving breasts,
wetness,
soft miles.

187
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.130
She wanted cock and I obliged afterwards.

188
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:49.380
She traced the indents in my skin from the harness.

189
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.620
I confessed to me that no one was having any luck developing a vaccine,

190
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.570
but the fucking thing is only passing through physical contact.

191
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.290
She said if people just stayed apart.
She grew silent.

192
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.040
She curled up next to me and we drifted off.
When I woke up,

193
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.070
she was working herself over with a Dildo and I pretended that I was still

194
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:10.420
sleeping.
One man,
he made me dinner in my kitchen.

195
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.200
There weren't a lot of vegetables left from my garden,
but he did what he could.

196
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.770
He tried to feed me with a spoon,
but I took the handle from him.

197
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.090
The food didn't taste too bad.
The power went out for the fourth time that week,

198
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.840
so we ate by candle light.
I resented the inadvertent romance.

199
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.710
He touched my face when we fucked and said I was beautiful and I jerked my head

200
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:32.770
a little to dislodge his fingers.
When he did it a second time,

201
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.520
I put my hand on his Chin and told him to shut up.
He came immediately.

202
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.080
I did not return his calls.
When the notice came over the radio,

203
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.990
the virus had reached Nebraska.
I realized I had to go east and so I did.

204
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.140
I left the garden,
the plot where my dog was buried,

205
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.020
the pine table where I'd anxiously made so many lists.

206
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.490
Trees that begin with m maple Mimosa,
Mahogany,
mulberry,

207
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.530
Magnolia Mountain,
Ash Mangrove,
myrtle states that I lived in Iowa,

208
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:02.290
Indiana,
Pennsylvania,
Virginia,
New York,

209
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.830
leaving unreadable jumbles of letters and printed in the softwood.

210
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.630
I took my savings and rented a cottage near the ocean.
After a few months,

211
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.690
the landlord based in Kansas stopped depositing my checks to women refugees from

212
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:21.220
the western states who drove and drove until their car broke down a mile from my

213
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:24.630
cottage.
They knocked on my door and stayed with me for two weeks old.

214
00:13:24.631 --> 00:13:27.460
We tried to figure out how to get their vehicle up and running.

215
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.690
We had wine one night and talked about the quarantine the generator needed

216
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:33.580
cranking and one of them offered to do it.

217
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.910
The other one's sat down next to me and slid her hand up my leg.

218
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.940
We ended up jerking off separately and kissing each other.

219
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.610
The generator took and the power came back on.

220
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.590
The other woman returned and we all slept in the same bed.
I wanted them to stay,

221
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.890
but they said they were heading up to Canada where it was rumored to be safer.

222
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.780
They offered to bring me with them,

223
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.540
but I joke that I was holding down the fort for the United States.

224
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.020
What state are we in?
One of the mask and I said Maine.

225
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.030
The kissed me on the forehead and turn and WBE the protector of Maine after they

226
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:04.361
left,

227
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:07.810
I only use a generator intermittently preferring to spend time in the dark with

228
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:11.230
candles.
The former owner of the cottage had a closet full of them.

229
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.450
One man national guard.
When he first showed up to my doorstep,

230
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.020
I assumed he was there to evacuate me,
but it turned out he'd abandoned his post.

231
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.990
I offered him a place to stay for the night and he thanked me.

232
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.260
I woke up with a knife to my throat and a hand on my breast.

233
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.320
I told him I couldn't have sex with him lying down like I was.

234
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.950
He let me stand up and I shoved him into the bookcase,
knocking him unconscious.

235
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.070
I dragged his body out to the beach and rolled it into the surf.

236
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.440
He came to sputtering sand.
I pointed the knife at him and told him to keep walk,

237
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:44.350
to walk and keep walking and if you ever looked back,
I would end him.

238
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.400
He obliged and I watched him until he was a spot of darkness on the gray strip

239
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:52.250
of shore and then nothing.
He was the last person I saw for a year.

240
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.950
One woman,
a religious leader for the flock of 50 trailing behind her,

241
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.260
all dressed in white for three days.

242
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:02.750
I made them wait around the edge of the property and after she,

243
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.000
after I checked their eyes,
I permitted them to stay.

244
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.870
They all camped around the cottage on the lawn,
on the beach.

245
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.690
They had their own supplies and only needed a place to lay their heads.

246
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:16.010
Leader said she wore robes that made her look like a wizard.
Knight fell.

247
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.610
She and I circled the camp in our bare feet.
The light from the bonfire,

248
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:21.440
carving shadows into her face.

249
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.760
We walked to the water's edge and I pointed to the darkness at a tiny island.

250
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:28.580
She could not see.
She slipped her hand into mine.

251
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.070
I made her drink more or less moonshine.

252
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:34.820
I said as I handed her the Tumbler and we sat at the table as that,

253
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:38.480
I could hear people laughing,
playing music,
children romping in the surf.

254
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.560
The woman's seemed exhausted.
She was younger than she looked.
I realized,

255
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.880
but the job was aging her.
She sipped her drink,
made a face at the taste.

256
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.160
We've been walking so long.
She said,

257
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.280
we stopped for awhile somewhere in your Pennsylvania,

258
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.470
but the virus caught up for us when we cross paths.

259
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:58.010
That caught up with us when we passed crossed paths with another group.

260
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.380
I took 12 of us before.
We got distance between us and it.
We Kiss,

261
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:06.830
keep deeply for a long time.
My heart hammering in my cunt,

262
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.960
she tasted like smoke and honey.

263
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.220
The group stayed for four days until she woke up from a dream and said she'd had

264
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:17.180
an omen and they needed to keep going.
She asked me to come with them.

265
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.620
I tried to imagine myself with her,
her flock following behind us like children.

266
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.280
I declined.
She left a gift on my gift on my pillow,

267
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.240
a pewter rabbit as big as my thumb.
One man,

268
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.490
no more than 20 floppy,
great floppy,
Brown hair.
He'd been on foot for a month.

269
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.990
He looked like you'd expect skittish,
no hope.
When we had sex,

270
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:43.400
he was reverent in too gentle.
After we cleaned up,
I fed him canned soup.

271
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.480
He told me that how he'd walk through Chicago actually through it had they'd

272
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:49.850
stopped bothering to dispose the bodies.
After a while,

273
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.410
he had to refill his glass before he talked about it further after that,
he said,

274
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.460
I went around the cities.
I asked him how far behind the virus was really,

275
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:01.670
and he said he did not know.
It's so quiet here.
He said,

276
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:06.350
by way of tuning the subject,
no traffic.
I explained no tourists.

277
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.710
He cried and cried and I held him until he fell asleep.

278
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.050
The next morning I woke up and he was gone.

279
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.440
One woman much older than me while she waited for three days to pass,

280
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.150
she meditated on a sand Dune.

281
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.390
When I checked her eyes and notice they were green as Seaglass,

282
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.860
her hair graded her temples and the way she left trip pleasured on the stairs of

283
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:28.694
my heart.

284
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.900
We sat in the half light of the bay window and the buildup was so slow.

285
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.340
She straddled me and when she kissed me the scene beyond the class pinched and

286
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:40.610
curved,
we drank and walk the length of the beach,

287
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.310
the damp sand making Pale halos around our feet.

288
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.150
She told me about her once children,
teenage injuries,

289
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.580
having to put her cat to sleep the day or she moved to a new city.

290
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.800
I told her about finding my mother,

291
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.410
the perilous track across Vermont and New Hampshire,

292
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.150
how the tide was never still my ex wife.
What happened?
She asked.

293
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.500
It just didn't work.
I said,
I told her about the man in the empty house,

294
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.890
the way he cried in the way his come shimmered on his stomach and how he could

295
00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:10.380
have scooped a spare from the air by the handfuls.

296
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.130
We remembered commercial jingles from our respective use,

297
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.510
including one for an Italian ice chain that I went to at the end of long summer

298
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.730
days where I eat gelato drowsy in the heat.

299
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.760
I couldn't remember the last time I had smiled so much.

300
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.320
She stayed more refugees filter to the cottage through us.

301
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.070
The last stop before the border and we fed them,
played games with canes,

302
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:36.960
with the little ones.
We got careless.
The day I woke up in the air had changed.

303
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.040
I realized it was a long time coming.
She was sitting on the couch.

304
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.940
She gotten up in the night and made some tea,
but the cup was tipped in.

305
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:48.180
The puddle was cold and I recognized the symptoms from the television and the

306
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:52.350
newspapers and then the leaflets and then the radio broadcasts and then the

307
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.040
hushed voices around the bonfire.
Her skin was a dark purple,

308
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.150
a compounded bruises.

309
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.810
The whites of her eyes shot through with bread and blood leaking from the misty

310
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:03.780
beds of her fingernails.
There was no time to mourn.

311
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.410
I chucked my own face in the mirror.
My eyes were still clear.

312
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.260
I consulted my emergency list and it's supplies.

313
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.400
I took my bag in my tent and I got into the dinghy and I wrote to the island,

314
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.940
to this island where I've been stashing foods since I got to the cottage,

315
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.780
I drank water and set up my tent and began to make lists.

316
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.740
Every teacher beginning with preschool,
every job I've ever had,

317
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.390
every person I've ever loved,
every home I've ever lived in,

318
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.760
every person who's probably loved me.

319
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.980
Next week I will be 30 the sand is blowing into my mouth,
my hair,

320
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.840
the center crevice of my notebook and the sea is choppy and gray.
Beyond it,

321
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:45.690
I can see the cottage,
a speck on the far shore.

322
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.040
I keep thinking I can see the virus blooming on the horizon like a sunrise.

323
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.090
I realized the world will continue to turn even with no people on it.

324
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.080
Maybe it will go a little faster.
Thank you.

325
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.990
<v 2>Okay,</v>

326
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.350
<v 0>so I'm happy to take questions.
If anyone has any,</v>

327
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.260
<v 3>one of the things that's actually what you referenced at the beginning about</v>

328
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:16.050
like having to not write the crazy lady story or something.

329
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:18.900
Like I feel like there's always a balance that it feels more with women writers

330
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:20.100
that there's like more pressure there.

331
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.790
I think one of the balances that you struck incredibly was this balance between

332
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:28.200
like intimacy and honesty about oneself and not being like eat,
pray,
love,

333
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:29.560
narcissistic.
Um,

334
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.210
and I don't know if you could explain a little bit about like your approach

335
00:20:33.211 --> 00:20:35.490
there and if it's intentional in how you handle those things.

336
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.070
<v 0>Ooh,
that's a really good question.
I mean I'm,</v>

337
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.730
I always tell my students,

338
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.340
you have to write the books you want to see in the world.
Like you,

339
00:20:45.341 --> 00:20:47.980
you need to fill the gap.
That's not right.
And so the

340
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.610
<v 4>book that I wanted to see in the world was I really wanted something that dealt</v>

341
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:52.960
with,
um,

342
00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.560
but the dealt with like the realities of,

343
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.800
of being a woman and in sort of our society and like having then the female body

344
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:08.120
and like dealing with that.
And so,
you know,
this book has a lot of like this,

345
00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:12.090
Sarah in it,
a lot of like liquids,
a lot of guts,

346
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.200
a lot of sex,
a lot of fluids,
just there's a lot of stuff.

347
00:21:16.201 --> 00:21:20.520
And there's also a lot of very honest discussions of things like,
um,

348
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.030
like the dive store in here called the resident,

349
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.850
which is about a woman who goes to a writing a writers colony,

350
00:21:26.851 --> 00:21:30.210
an artist's colony to work on a novel and kind of like has a sort of a mental

351
00:21:30.211 --> 00:21:33.720
breakdown of,
of uh,
of a sword.
And it's basically like me,

352
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:37.110
but like turned up to 11.
So like,
you know,
I was like,
this is me kind of,

353
00:21:37.111 --> 00:21:39.600
but like,
it's not actually me,
it's a fictional character,

354
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:42.960
but it's like a lot of my sort of vulnerabilities and anxieties and thought

355
00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:45.420
loops and all the sort of things that make up my weird brain,

356
00:21:45.421 --> 00:21:49.530
like just went into her.
And something very scary about that,
right?
Like,

357
00:21:49.531 --> 00:21:51.150
just like being like,
I'm gonna put this out there,

358
00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:53.760
like I'm going to write all the weird shit that happens in my head on a daily

359
00:21:53.761 --> 00:21:57.090
basis in a character.
People were like,
Yo,
that character is crazy.
And it's like,

360
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.780
oh great,
thanks.
People get really like people,

361
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.010
a lot of feelings about her particularly.
Um,
and I'm like,
well,

362
00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:09.780
that's the person who's most like me.
So,
um,
but yeah.
And so I feel like,

363
00:22:09.781 --> 00:22:12.780
you know,
I,
I just wanted,
I wanted his collection at that,

364
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.600
dealt with that in a way that felt honest and felt like I was,

365
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.690
I mean obviously like it's not,
I'm not,
I'm only one person.

366
00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:20.670
Like I can only portray sort of like one

367
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.210
<v 2>okay.</v>

368
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.320
<v 4>Type of experience or like one person's perception of experiences.
Um,</v>

369
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.330
but yeah,
I just wanted,
I wanted that honesty.

370
00:22:29.331 --> 00:22:32.350
It was really important to me to like have that sort of immediacy and

371
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.820
viscerality and like not,

372
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.960
and not sort of move around it because I feel like that's a thing people like to

373
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:39.310
do is they're like,
they get,

374
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.300
they get close to it and they get afraid to like go like dive in.
And I was like,

375
00:22:43.301 --> 00:22:46.660
no,
I just want to like,
I just want to be in there.
Um,
so yeah,

376
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.660
<v 5>once in a while you read something where the techs just hits you in a certain</v>

377
00:22:53.661 --> 00:22:58.661
way that couldn't be described to you and just sort of cold logic and you just

378
00:22:59.181 --> 00:23:02.660
get an emotional punch and veining of the husbands.

379
00:23:02.661 --> 00:23:05.510
Did she talk about the voices?
If you read the story out loud,

380
00:23:05.511 --> 00:23:09.440
please use the following voices.
And the first one is me.

381
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:11.390
You as a child,

382
00:23:11.391 --> 00:23:16.391
high pitched forgettable as a woman of the same and the last one is listed as

383
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.930
all other woman are interchangeable with my own.

384
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.720
And to me that was,

385
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.270
that was quite quite a punch just to just to hear it that way,
to hear,
um,

386
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.540
your experience and women's experience,
uh,
express that way.

387
00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:34.910
And I would just love to hear one more you'll have to say about that.

388
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.680
<v 4>Yeah.
So,
so did anyone here ever read like the scary stories?</v>

389
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.070
Tell them the dark bucks.
Okay,
so the husbands didn't,

390
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.000
so if you've read my book or if you haven't,
the husband's stitches or

391
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.650
of a story that actually is not in that boat,
people think it is.

392
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:50.560
It's like a weird,
like false memory.
Uh,

393
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.140
so Alvin Schwartz who wrote those books also had another book called in a dark

394
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:57.300
dark room.
And it was actually for younger readers,
like not teens,
but like,

395
00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.611
like it was an,

396
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:01.700
I can read buck that was like equally scary stories with slightly less

397
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:04.080
horrifying illustrations.
And that story had a,

398
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.750
there was a story called the green ribbon in there,

399
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.420
but the girls were unified around her neck and you know,
her husband is,

400
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:10.640
I was asking her about it and she won't talk to him about it.

401
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:13.730
And then on her deathbed,
he on ties in her head falls off.
Right.

402
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.370
So when I,

403
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.890
and I wanted to do like a retelling of the story in the first story in this

404
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:23.150
collection is a retelling of,
of that of urban legend.
And um,

405
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.430
in the Alvin Schwartz scary stories book,

406
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:27.980
there was a lot of stage directions because those stories are meant to be like

407
00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:31.160
their folktales.
They're meant to be performed.
And so when I was a kid,

408
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:35.930
I was like in girl scouts and I did a lot of campfire like camping and we would

409
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:39.980
tell stories and I learned really quickly that this book was a great way of like

410
00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:43.520
freaking out my fellow girl scouts and I could like read the story and they'd be

411
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:46.220
like a command at the end.
Like,
you know,
it's like,
you know,

412
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:49.190
who has my liver like that story.
And then like you could,

413
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.010
it would say like grabbed the person next to you,
be like you have it.

414
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.410
And I didn't mean it,
the fellow girl scout like cry hysterically.

415
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:58.190
And I was super into it.
Um,
cause people were like having a reaction anyway.

416
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.220
So I was really the idea of like having stage directions in my story,

417
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:03.890
but of course like I didn't want them to be like regular stage directions.

418
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.210
I wanted them to sort of have some quality that reflected like the themes of the

419
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:09.680
book or like what I wanted to talk about.

420
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.390
So in the opening section of that story,
I'm sort of saying like,
cause in,

421
00:25:13.391 --> 00:25:14.990
in the actual scary stories book,
they'd be like,
you know,

422
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:17.150
if you read the story out loud,
like,
you know,

423
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:20.660
use a squeaky voice or a booming voice or whatever that sort of like reflects

424
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:21.980
whatever the character's supposed to be.

425
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:27.080
And I sort of wanted to kind of make a little nod to may experience,
you know,

426
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:30.380
it's like a person who consumes a lot of media,
especially like I love TV,

427
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:32.420
I love films,
but like a thing that frustrates me,

428
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:36.280
especially in genres that I love,
which is like science fiction and horror,
um,

429
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.260
is that female characters are often very interchangeable and completely

430
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:40.730
unmemorable.
Um,

431
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.140
and so I wanted her to sort of be sort of slightly referring to the fact that

432
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:48.200
like,
we sort of think of like these female characters,
like each of these,

433
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.140
each of the women being described in that opening section,
it's like the man of,

434
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:53.900
he's very distinctive voices and I met the women just start like they're all

435
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:56.420
sort of interchangeable.
The irony being that when I read it out loud,

436
00:25:56.421 --> 00:26:00.080
it's me reading it and I'm,
it's all mine.
It's all the same voice.
Right.
Um,

437
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.050
but yeah,
so I think it was something I had to do,

438
00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:06.380
which is like take a formal constraint or formal conceit in my work and like use

439
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:10.550
it to just create some kind of like narrative energy.
And in that case,

440
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:15.440
like making a point about like a thing I have a thought about about women in

441
00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:18.200
media.
Um,
yeah.

442
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.890
<v 5>Through my years of seeing a Carmen and her friends online on Facebook,</v>

443
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:29.030
conversing about all manner of topics,
um,
there's some equivalent to the,

444
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.410
to the stages of grief,

445
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.980
which is my stages of disagreement with whatever Carmen and her friends have

446
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:34.814
written.

447
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.610
<v 4>Okay.
Yeah.
Right.
Everything on this,
this</v>

448
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:43.710
<v 5>one,
which is uh,
well I don't know exactly what they are cause they made this up,</v>

449
00:26:43.711 --> 00:26:46.650
but it starts with denial.
Like I don't agree with that point.

450
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:51.651
And then it eventually comes around to agreement and not 100% of the time,

451
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.870
but you know,
usually,
uh,
if I sit and read and think,

452
00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.560
um,

453
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.250
I realized there was a point being made that I had not fully understood before.

454
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.340
Um,
but one very,
uh,

455
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.830
interesting disagreement in the last couple of weeks was about what fiction is

456
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:14.520
four.
And um,

457
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.290
one writer said in an interview that,
um,

458
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.530
uh,
I believe,

459
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.700
I believe he said my fiction is not meant to be political.

460
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.710
Um,
I believe that.
Yes,
I know I am.

461
00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.653
<v 4>You're a controversial</v>

462
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.210
<v 5>and some people I think took it as his saying that no fiction should be a</v>

463
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.350
political and so there's a debate about what exactly he said,

464
00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:43.050
but I thought it was an interesting topic.
Um,

465
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.460
is there room for fiction that isn't intended to be political with the

466
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:51.870
understanding that in the end everything must,
must,

467
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.430
everything must be political in the end.
But you know,

468
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.910
if you write something that's just,
Oh you know,

469
00:27:56.911 --> 00:28:00.570
here's a person in a boat who has an adventure and you're not trying to be

470
00:28:00.571 --> 00:28:03.870
political about it is,
is that,
is there room for that?

471
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.200
And that's not,

472
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.400
<v 4>no,
they're really good questions.</v>

473
00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:09.230
I'm going to blow up his spot because it was in the New York Times.

474
00:28:09.231 --> 00:28:10.400
It's not like it's private or anything.

475
00:28:10.401 --> 00:28:15.401
So Andy where who wrote the Martian and whatever his new book is called Artemis,

476
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.550
I think.
Um,

477
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.850
yeah I had this like incredibly infuriating interview in the New York Times that

478
00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:21.800
just filled me with a blinding rage,

479
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.110
has a glossy ability to see for like a minute.

480
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.190
Like I was just like so stressed out by it.
Um,
there's this,

481
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.590
the near terms as a series called by the book where they talk to writers about

482
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.730
the books that they're reading.

483
00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:34.220
So it's like really cool cause you're sort of getting like,
okay,

484
00:28:34.221 --> 00:28:36.590
that's a writer that I like,
here's like stuff they're interested in,

485
00:28:36.591 --> 00:28:38.030
books that are like important to them.

486
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.580
Like it's a really cool way to sort of get like a,
as a writer,

487
00:28:40.581 --> 00:28:43.970
like amping other writers voices and also like helping your readers,

488
00:28:43.971 --> 00:28:47.330
like kind of learn about like other books that they should be checking out that

489
00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:50.240
like you,
you like,
um,
and

490
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.940
his answers were just,

491
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.410
they were very frustrating to me because he knew everybody he mentioned,

492
00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.250
except for JK Rowling was an old white man,
most of them are dead.

493
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.910
There was almost zero contemporary fiction and it was all like,
as a mob,

494
00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:08.840
which is like,
not bad,
but like I,
I was like,

495
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.970
had you not read a book in the last 30 years?
I mean,
like,

496
00:29:10.971 --> 00:29:13.730
it was literally like that kind of list and um,
you know,

497
00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:17.000
one woman and it's like the most famous female writer like that we have right

498
00:29:17.001 --> 00:29:21.850
now.
Right.
Um,
and it was,
and it was really angry about,

499
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.410
and then also in the interview,
he said,
someone was like,

500
00:29:24.411 --> 00:29:26.000
asked him some question and he was just like,
I don't,

501
00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.100
my fiction is not political.
I just don't believe in like,
you know,
you know,

502
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.780
I just don't,
I don't want my fiction to be political answer question.

503
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.100
And my answer is I don't,
I don't want us,
you think it's possible.

504
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.490
I don't think it's possible because even thinking that you were writing that you

505
00:29:40.491 --> 00:29:44.950
can write a political fiction is,
is in itself a political,
it's political,
right?

506
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.880
So like even a guy in about having an adventure or a person having a boat named,

507
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.900
like,
who is that person?
Like that's still a political choice,
right?
Of,
of a kind.

508
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.250
Um,
so no,
I actually don't think those things can be separated from each other.

509
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.620
Um,
and it's infuriating to me that he,

510
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.210
that he is so uncurious about his own craft and about the world,

511
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.900
that that is his response.
Um,
it just really,

512
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.910
it just really bothered me and that,
that would,

513
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.730
that platform and he just want to talk about like asthma,
which is like,
again,

514
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.540
that sounds great,
but like,
come on.
Um,

515
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.670
and yeah,
so,
no,
I actually don't think,
I mean,
and I love like,

516
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.560
I love a good,
exciting

517
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.380
triple B piece of art as much as the next person.
Um,

518
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:32.810
they give me a lot of pleasure,
but I also,
that's still,
it mean that like,

519
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.511
like I said,

520
00:30:33.511 --> 00:30:36.100
I'll come away from like the stupidest movie and let's like kind of just like a,

521
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.340
like a,
like a very simple sort of pleasure.

522
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.210
I'm thinking a lot about like the choices that have been made at like every

523
00:30:42.211 --> 00:30:45.000
level,
right.
And like who gets published as a political decision?

524
00:30:45.001 --> 00:30:47.010
Like who is working the publisher needs work,
doesn't get published,

525
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:51.390
whose work gets amplified in certain ways,
what,
who the characters are like,

526
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.280
what store,
who was allowed to tell what kinds of stories you know,
like,
um,

527
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.830
there,
I mean these are all like really inherently,

528
00:30:58.831 --> 00:31:01.620
really fraught political positions and like the idea that you can just like

529
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.370
write,
make a piece of art or make a story that is not political to me,

530
00:31:05.371 --> 00:31:08.930
it's just utter folly and just reveals like a deep sort of misunderstanding of

531
00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:13.550
like what art is.
Um,
yeah,

532
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.390
sorry I went to that place again like I did.
That was rough.

533
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:19.580
It was like flashing back to like reading the article.
But thank you.

534
00:31:19.581 --> 00:31:21.530
It was a great question.
Yes,

535
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.860
<v 3>it's actually similar to something I was wondering,</v>

536
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.990
would love to hear about from you about sort of how,

537
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.510
how your work exists in the outside world,

538
00:31:30.511 --> 00:31:33.390
like outside of the scope of just the work itself and how,

539
00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:37.590
what people's reactions have been and what impact you've had.
Like,
um,
so I read,

540
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.080
I read your book a few weeks ago when I happened to be on vacation.

541
00:31:40.081 --> 00:31:44.820
I've also been going through this really weird obsessed.
I have like not,
I just,

542
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.280
I have like one little thing that's just mine that I do in the mornings.

543
00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:50.280
It's for me,
um,
sort of echoes of the Green Ribbon Story and like,

544
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:51.810
just having one thing for you,
um,

545
00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:56.460
that I'm like curly rewatching the entire west wing and listening to a west wing

546
00:31:56.461 --> 00:31:59.580
revisions,
which is fricking amazing.
Like you,
it sounds horrible,

547
00:31:59.581 --> 00:32:02.970
but it's actually surprisingly interesting and like the show in some way,

548
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.260
like Aaron Sorkin being this ridiculously talented writer watching it with 2017

549
00:32:07.261 --> 00:32:12.060
eyes for like a show that started filming in 1999 and how like ridiculously

550
00:32:12.061 --> 00:32:14.700
chauvinistic it is.
And it's funny because some of the themes are really,

551
00:32:14.701 --> 00:32:18.030
and like don't even get me started on like the racial stuff because you know,

552
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.200
anyway.
Um,

553
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.260
but like even there was this amazing moment in the first season that the,

554
00:32:22.261 --> 00:32:25.590
the people that podcast go into looking back and saying where the president and

555
00:32:25.591 --> 00:32:27.590
Leo are like staying there and there are heroes.
They're like,

556
00:32:27.591 --> 00:32:29.940
the heroes of here is the top of the cream of the crop of the people.

557
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.320
And they're saying they're good boys and the things we do to women and this sort

558
00:32:34.321 --> 00:32:35.670
of like acknowledgement.
Like you're,
you're,

559
00:32:35.671 --> 00:32:37.320
a lot of your stories are the other side.
They're like,
yeah,

560
00:32:37.321 --> 00:32:40.290
these are the fricking things we do to women.
And like hearing it from the mail,

561
00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.140
then they're like,
Yup.
And then they go like,

562
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:44.750
say something inappropriate to a woman.
And you're like,
what are you doing?

563
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:46.940
So I totally agree that you can't separate.

564
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:49.400
Like it is hard for me to like listen to Aaron Sorkin and be like,
man,

565
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:50.990
you're brilliant.
Like why can you,

566
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.600
you've one strong female character and you're constantly sexually harassing her

567
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:56.080
on the screen.
Like what the,
what is wrong with you?
Um,

568
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.170
I'm curious how your work being such the opposite perspective and being so

569
00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:01.820
strong voice in that way.
Like how does it have,

570
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.420
how have you found it has impacted other people and impact a sort of the

571
00:33:04.421 --> 00:33:05.810
literary world that you live in?

572
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.250
<v 4>Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
the Westwind does not age well.</v>

573
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:13.480
I've also discovered this a is,
it is true.
Um,

574
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.780
yeah,
you know,
the,
the sort of idea.

575
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:19.560
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

576
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.270
<v 4>I think what's been really hard,
again,
as a person who consumes media,</v>

577
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.800
like the media that I'm most interested in is in absolutely not made for me.

578
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.680
Like the genres that I'm interested in,
our genre is where like I am,

579
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.070
my demographic is like an utter afterthought.
Right?
And so

580
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.850
that sort of idea of like,
wow,
like I'm not even being considered in any way,

581
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.550
like in anything about this.
Even artists that I love.
And like,

582
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:47.090
I like Aaron Sorkin.
I love Josh Sweden.
I love,
you know,

583
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.760
Lars von Trier is like a filmmaker who I adore it even though,
look,

584
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:52.820
literally every film is him like taking a woman part on the screen for like

585
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:56.900
three hours,
you know,
and that's like his entire project over and over again.

586
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.810
Um,
and like,
it's really hard because it's like,

587
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:03.260
those are artists that like mean a lot to me whose work has meant a lot to me.

588
00:34:03.261 --> 00:34:06.380
Like Buffy was really important to me,
you know,
like,
like that is a,

589
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.610
and I feel like,

590
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.920
so at some point I had to kind of come to this like sense of peace where it's

591
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:14.030
like,
okay,
like the art that I most,
not all the art that I love,

592
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:17.780
but like a lot of the art that I love is absolutely not made with me and it's in

593
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:18.200
mine.

594
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.970
And also at times is like actively like destructive,

595
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.760
um,
in,
in certain ways.
Uh,

596
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.030
and harmful to women for example,

597
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:33.380
or other people of color or queer people or whoever.
Um,
and so,

598
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.680
<v 2>okay,</v>

599
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.660
<v 4>so that's been like a thing I had to like come to terms with.</v>

600
00:34:36.661 --> 00:34:39.720
But then in terms of my own book,
I mean I'm really lucky because like,
you know,

601
00:34:39.721 --> 00:34:43.920
I,
I,
the work that I write is like,
you know,
I was like,

602
00:34:43.921 --> 00:34:46.770
I want to write a book that has like all female protagonists.

603
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.580
Most of them are queer.
I want lots of sex.

604
00:34:50.581 --> 00:34:54.030
I'm a weird genre stuff that doesn't really have a category I want.

605
00:34:54.031 --> 00:34:55.530
Like I want all these things for this book.

606
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.930
And I was really lucky that like I just managed to find a publisher who like

607
00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.800
kind of got the vision of that project because I feel like,

608
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:06.690
I mean I once had a swagger rejected by an editor who's hitting this comment

609
00:35:06.691 --> 00:35:09.450
where he was like,
there's just no men in this story but there are none.

610
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.590
And I said,
I know,
I know there are none.
It's about a mother.
I mean,

611
00:35:13.591 --> 00:35:16.560
she's got sisters,
like she's got like,
there was just like,
and I was like,

612
00:35:16.561 --> 00:35:17.394
I don't,
there's just,

613
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.630
I mean they just don't because it will lead to be mentioned.

614
00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:24.450
So they did an inch in the father and I was like,
why?
Um,

615
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.560
and I feel like it's like that sort of reversal of perspective is like an

616
00:35:28.561 --> 00:35:31.350
intense,
it's like it's a intense and people kind of deal with.

617
00:35:31.351 --> 00:35:34.380
And I think the reason people respond really strongly to my book is like this

618
00:35:34.381 --> 00:35:37.050
sense of like utter relief that,
um,

619
00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.410
that that is being sort of inverted because we're just so used to seeing the

620
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:44.340
opposite.
Right.
And so in that same way that like,
you know,
I'm,

621
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:47.550
I'm also queer and like whenever I see a queer character on TV or like,

622
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.310
here's a song that could be thought about as like a queer song,

623
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.950
I'm just like all over it.
I'm like,
I will give it all my money.
I will watch it.

624
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:56.810
I will follow it because like,
I'm seeing this like teeny,
oops,
sorry.
Whew.

625
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.620
I'm seeing this like tiny place where I feel even slightly represented or like

626
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:02.770
Jane the Virgin is like a show that I'm,

627
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.100
because I'm like how many liquids you know,
that you'd see on TV?
Right.

628
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:09.450
So like there's,
when I see that I like respond to it really strongly.

629
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:13.890
Um,
and I feel like people are feeling that way about my book where they're like,

630
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:16.590
I'm seeing a thing that like I didn't see before.
I'm hungry for,

631
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.780
I don't even know how hungry I was.
Or maybe you didn't know how angry you are,

632
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:22.140
but like seeing it is like this really exciting thing.
Um,

633
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.230
so the response to my book,
and as honestly I think they'd like the political,

634
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.240
even though like I'm writing this book for five years,

635
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.930
women's life lives have always been garbage.
They continue to be garbage,

636
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.390
but right now it's actually really bad.
Um,

637
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.210
but like we're this weird political moment where like suddenly my book is like

638
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.910
extra weirdly relevant even though I would like that sucks.

639
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:42.860
Like I wish it wasn't like,
I wish it was less relevant.
Um,
but yes,

640
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.570
I think that's why people are responding so strongly to the book is because of

641
00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:49.140
this,
because not only are people like I that's familiar to me from like my whole

642
00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:53.640
life,
but also in terms of just like what's happening like right now sort of

643
00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:56.580
politically.
Yes.
Hello.

644
00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.090
<v 6>I just want to follow up a little bit.
Um,
uh,</v>

645
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.710
I'm curious about how you think about,
uh,
the,

646
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.810
the line between like,
you know,
here,

647
00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:11.370
here are the stories that I've published so far,
um,
and,

648
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:16.270
and a book as a thing that sort of exists in of itself.
Like what,

649
00:37:16.271 --> 00:37:20.890
what was the process like of,
of uh,
putting it together as a,

650
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.520
as a whole packet?

651
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.340
<v 4>Sure,
sure.
I see you have this sort of story.
I haven't calendar.
I do.</v>

652
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.580
Um,
yeah,

653
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:34.230
so I've been publishing fiction for a five,
five,
six years now,

654
00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:37.410
look professionally.
Um,
and I publish a lot more stories that are in this book.

655
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:39.690
There's only eight stories in this book.
Um,

656
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.960
and it's weird because like when I was sort of talking to editors in the process

657
00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:43.920
of trying to publish it,

658
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.190
there was someone who was sort of interested in was saying like,

659
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.510
well I feel like you could add all these other stories that like I know you've

660
00:37:48.511 --> 00:37:52.200
published but like aren't in this in this version of the,
of the book.

661
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.890
And I feel like there's sort of two philosophies about short story collections.

662
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:59.610
There's either like a short story collection is like the last 15 stories you

663
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.680
published in the last 10 stories you published or whatever.

664
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.780
Or it sort of has like a strong thematic heart and like a strong sort of

665
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:10.950
thematic link.
Um,
and for me,
I,
when I reach to our collections,

666
00:38:10.951 --> 00:38:13.650
I prefer the latter.
Like I don't like as much of random stories.

667
00:38:13.651 --> 00:38:16.200
I didn't want them to feel like they're in conversation with each other in some

668
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:20.280
capacity.
So I actually,
like when I was in Grad School,

669
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:22.590
I published my distraction.
My thesis,

670
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.190
which had the same title as this book only had three common stories where this

671
00:38:26.191 --> 00:38:27.600
book,
and there's a lot of other stories that are like,

672
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:29.730
since like retired and the like the Disney vaults,

673
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:33.330
like I've tied them away and like no one will ever see them.
Um,

674
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:39.030
but I,
I wanted it because I sort of realized like,
Oh wow,
like these,

675
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.500
some of these stores have really like,
and other stories,

676
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.820
like it's something I don't like them or like they're not really like there are

677
00:38:44.821 --> 00:38:47.860
about something else.
Like they're not about like women's bodies and sex.

678
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:49.930
Like there,
there was a gender and they were like,

679
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:52.600
themes that I have with this book and this like that.
I wanted it to,

680
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.710
the stories to be a part of.
And um,
if they fell outside of those parameters,

681
00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:57.041
I was like,
well,

682
00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:59.530
that's for another book or mean just like a one off story that like is not going

683
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:03.100
to go in a book.
Um,
and what's really interesting about that is like,

684
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:08.260
as I was wrapping this book up,
I sort of was writing brand new stories.

685
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:11.860
I was realizing like,
Oh wow,
like I have a second book in me.

686
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:15.940
Like I have like another set of interests that like is related to these stories,

687
00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:20.200
like in,
in certain ways,
like still lots of sex,
still queer women,
like et Cetera.

688
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.060
But like I have like different interests.

689
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.360
Like I'm writing this book now that have the word,

690
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:25.480
like memory is like a very central theme.

691
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:27.970
And like that's not really a thing that exists in here,
but like,

692
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:29.710
it's like this new idea that I'm having.

693
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.840
And so it's actually pretty cool because I feel like when you're,

694
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.650
when you're trying to put together a debut book,
it's like,
that's your focused,

695
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:38.800
or like,
this is the,
this is,
this is my book,
this is the thing in my brain.

696
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.570
And then you have it and you're like,
oh,

697
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.020
I had like other books in my brain about other things.

698
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:46.990
And it's like a very odd feeling when you've been really focused on publishing a

699
00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:51.450
book for like your whole life.
Um,
so,
so yeah.
So I just like,
I,

700
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:55.660
so now I have like a new projects and um,
these stories just get my,
my,

701
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.020
my editor really wanted like a tight lean collection.

702
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.820
Two of these stories are really huge.

703
00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:05.320
Like the resident and especially heinous are,
are massive.
Um,

704
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.580
and so yeah,
it's when it's been like two novellas,
six store,
six short stories,

705
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.930
it's like a fairly average sized collection.
Um,
yeah.

706
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:16.930
And I just didn't want to add anything else to at least felt like they were very

707
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:20.790
tight and sort of in competition with each other.
Um,
so yeah,
so that's why,
but I,

708
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:24.670
I really like the result.
Like I feel like this was the book I needed to be.

709
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.670
I'm glad I didn't publish it as earlier versions of it with like more stories

710
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:28.840
and let that weren't as connected.

711
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.011
<v 3>Um,</v>

712
00:40:32.011 --> 00:40:37.011
so I was curious when for you or what was the book when you first felt like you

713
00:40:37.801 --> 00:40:42.420
saw yourself or presented?
Um,
oh,
like that I read that you read.
Yeah.
Like,

714
00:40:42.421 --> 00:40:45.510
and when that happened in your life and how long it took for that to happen?

715
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.400
For me,
it took a while.
I was a teenager,
so.
Great.

716
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.100
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean,
I mean it happens,</v>

717
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:53.560
there have been bits and spurts sort of through out.
So like,
I mean,

718
00:40:53.561 --> 00:40:56.440
I was a voracious reader as a teen.
I read like a lot of books.

719
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.700
I mean books like,
I mean it was assessed with a lot of like red,

720
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:03.760
like Anna Morris.
I get all of those and I rapped me,
I read a lot of like series.

721
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.570
Um,
but I really loved like a wrinkle in time.
Like,
you know,
like that,

722
00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:12.160
that was like a really formative book for me.
Um,
uh,

723
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.190
I mean,
I didn't really get to read.
Maybe I grew up in the 90s,

724
00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:17.410
so like I wasn't really reading many books about like queer teens,

725
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.080
but it would be like,
in terms of like female voices,
like I was getting a lot of,

726
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:21.970
there was like behind the attic wall,
which was like a novel.

727
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.690
That was really important to me.
Oh,
you know it,
you know it,
it's so good.

728
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.590
It's so good.
Okay.
We can talk after.
We can talk about that because it's,

729
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.940
it's so good.
Um,
whenever I say to people who know it,

730
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:32.920
they get like incredibly excited.
It's such a good buck.

731
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.360
So that was like a really formative book for me.
Um,
where I,
I,

732
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.770
I mean like every teenager and every like preteen,
it feels like,
oh,

733
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:41.420
I'm so gawky awkward.
No one likes me.

734
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:45.290
So it's like easy to identify character in a book because you're like,

735
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.860
they're all like gawky and like hard,
you know,
it,
you know,
they're like,
oh,

736
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.300
I have problems making friends.
It's like,
yeah,

737
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:54.200
we all do like welcome to the club.
Um,
yeah.

738
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:58.550
And then as I got older,
I mean the work that sort of really kicked off my,

739
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.550
my contempt,
what I call it,

740
00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:05.440
thinking about my sort of my voice or I felt like I was reading work that I

741
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.310
wanted to respond to you with my own work,

742
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.440
which was like a very distinct sort of moment in my life.

743
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.070
I was reading people like Kelly link,
Karen Russell,
Helen.
Oh,
yummy.

744
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.170
George Saunders.
Um,
mostly female writers.
Um,

745
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.750
and yeah,
and they were all,

746
00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:22.880
it was all like short stories that look like weird stuff.

747
00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:26.510
And just like felt weird and like had a lot of women in them.

748
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:29.210
Then we're just like really like weird and interesting and I don't know that

749
00:42:29.211 --> 00:42:31.400
those are those.
So I feel like I'm sort of multiple steps.

750
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:35.630
And then also like in high school I had this teacher who gave me,
um,

751
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.250
I was really at,
so she taught as a public school.

752
00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:40.940
So we constantly learning like Hemingway and I really,

753
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.920
really hate Hemingway still to this day.

754
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.040
And I would just yell at every class.

755
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.000
[inaudible] I like every class she'd be like,
let's talk about it.

756
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:53.610
And I'd be like,
he's an alcoholic.
Like I had thoughts,
I was like,
he's horrible.

757
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.880
The women,
like this woman I hate,
I hate everything happening.

758
00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:00.430
Oh well my mic down in my rage anyway.
Um,

759
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.370
and I was really mad and she stopped calling on me through.

760
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.140
I would retire cause I'd be like my hand be like furiously raising it there and

761
00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:09.530
she'd be like,
Carmen,
I don't even want to hear you say about or something way.

762
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.190
Um,
but she could tell that I was frustrated by like what we had to read it,

763
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.060
what we were reading in school.

764
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:16.970
And like we only ever read like one book by a woman,
like my entire,

765
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:21.070
we read Jane Eyre and that was like,
Eh,
and then everything else was fine.

766
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.310
So like I was very frustrated even though I loved English class and I loved,

767
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.670
you know,
and so one day my teacher,
Ms. Dot.
Mrs Time,
Bob,
bless her heart,

768
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:32.150
came in with like a pile of books from her personal library and she's like,

769
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:33.950
I think you will like these,
like you need to read them.

770
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:38.030
And it was a hundred years of solitude but can't be like Garcia.
Mark Has Gloria,

771
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:44.000
Gloria Naylor's Mama Day.
Um,
Henry James is what Maisie new,
um,

772
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.750
uh,
Kate Chopin's the awakening.
Um,

773
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.210
I'm like a handful of others and it was just like,

774
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:54.950
and I suddenly was also like able to like just see what sort of possible in

775
00:43:54.951 --> 00:43:57.260
literature and like what it was like to sort of write from all these different

776
00:43:57.261 --> 00:43:59.650
places and like,
I don't know,
like it just really liked.

777
00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:03.440
So I feel like I had this like stages of like self discovery as a young person

778
00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:04.550
in terms of what I was reading,

779
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.910
this very directed thing that happened to me like in high school.

780
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.510
And then when I was in Grad School,
I had a lot of friends who were sort of like,

781
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.180
you need to be reading these people because like it's in,

782
00:44:14.181 --> 00:44:15.710
but that's what you want to be doing as a writer.

783
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:18.800
And then I felt like my mind was like blown open and I was like,
oh my God,

784
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:22.730
everything is amazing.
Literature is,
um,
you know,
I was just like so exciting.

785
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:25.280
So cause I think it's been like different phases.
Um,

786
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.910
so you talked about

787
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.793
go together and

788
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.560
<v 7>I wondered if you'd talk about the name a little,
her body and other parties.
It,</v>

789
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.250
you mentioned Jane the Virgin earlier.

790
00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:43.251
I feel like there's this group of subversive and thoughtful media with this sort

791
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:48.030
of like,
yeah,
I know what you think of me.
Names Jane the Virgin Crazy,

792
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.210
<v 4>his girlfriend.
I was just,
Yup.
Yup,
Yup,
Yup.</v>

793
00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:52.260
Wondered if you'd talked about that all

794
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.500
as a great question and one that I have a lot of thoughts about.
Um,
yeah,

795
00:44:57.501 --> 00:45:00.250
so I really,
it's funny,
I actually did not watch cruise yesterday,

796
00:45:00.251 --> 00:45:04.010
a friend for a while because the title was so off putting to me and then someone

797
00:45:04.011 --> 00:45:05.780
was like,
no,
no,
so who knows me?
It was like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

798
00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:08.240
You really need to watch it.
You will love it.
And I,
and I did.

799
00:45:08.241 --> 00:45:09.980
And I think it's like one of the best shows on television right now.

800
00:45:09.981 --> 00:45:12.710
I absolutely love it.
I'm doing the version also.
I was like,

801
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:17.900
what a weird title for a show.
Um,
but yeah,
and so,
I mean,
this story collection,

802
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.700
there's a few reasons.
So,
um,
I wanted,

803
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.230
I asked her friend how do people named short story collections and they were she

804
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.000
and he was like,
well oftentimes it's like the title of one of the stories,

805
00:45:32.001 --> 00:45:35.780
but it's like a title that sort of embodies the themes of the,
of the bowl book.

806
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.680
And you'll notice if you read your story cloths and you'll notice that like,

807
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:41.900
usually the title is like a title of one of the stories.
Um,

808
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.500
but none of the titles were working for me in that capacity.

809
00:45:45.501 --> 00:45:46.550
Like I was looking at all the towels,
I was like,

810
00:45:46.551 --> 00:45:50.390
none of these feel like a book title.
And I love titling things.

811
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:54.760
It's like a hobby,
a weird hobby I have.
Um,
so yes,

812
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.160
I was sort of thinking about it and then I also,
excuse me,
it was thinking about,

813
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:01.700
um,
so this book that I really love Ted Chiang's story of your life and others,

814
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.010
um,
which is a book which if you haven't read,

815
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:06.200
you absolutely must cause it is literally perfect.

816
00:46:06.201 --> 00:46:09.200
And Ted Chiang's a genius since science section and it's gorgeous and amazing.

817
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.610
Um,
but he,
uh,
so that,
that title has that sort of Pun,
right,

818
00:46:13.611 --> 00:46:14.930
where it's like stories of your life,

819
00:46:14.931 --> 00:46:17.810
which is the name of one of his stories and others it can be like,

820
00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.850
and other lives are and other stories,
right?

821
00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:24.410
So using that sort of structure of like and other stories sort of riffing on

822
00:46:24.411 --> 00:46:27.830
that structure.
So then I had that in mind.
Um,

823
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.990
and then I started kind of mashing my titles together.

824
00:46:29.991 --> 00:46:31.770
So I was just sort of like,
let's see like what words,

825
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:35.210
like keywords for my titles,
my story titles could like be put together in this,

826
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.400
in this structure.
Um,

827
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.140
and then I came up with I think like,
um,

828
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:46.010
but like bodies and other parties because like real women have bodies is like,

829
00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:48.530
that's in the title.
And then it was like,
but I feel like I want the agenda,

830
00:46:48.531 --> 00:46:51.080
I want the gender element to be in there.
So then I was like her body,

831
00:46:51.081 --> 00:46:54.650
her body and other,
her body and other parties and like,
I just really liked it.

832
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.600
And then it just stuck.
And I've,
it's been,

833
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.630
and he's been the title of his book even before this book was like even remotely

834
00:46:59.631 --> 00:47:01.130
looked like this.
Um,

835
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.220
and I feel like it also helped me because it was having kind of work toward
like,

836
00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.180
it was like a light,

837
00:47:05.181 --> 00:47:07.700
like a light house that I can sort of like be moving toward with like my work

838
00:47:07.701 --> 00:47:12.410
and the way I do my edits.
Um,
so yeah.
Uh,

839
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:17.150
that was just,
I mean that was just like how I kind of came to it.
Um,

840
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.240
but has a really important and yeah,
I do think that sort of quality of like,

841
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.990
fuck you for what you think of me.
Right.
Like that title.
It's like such a good,

842
00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:28.430
it's really fun.
And I think that sort of level of some version is a,

843
00:47:28.431 --> 00:47:31.270
is really and really interesting.
And I think there's thing that both,
