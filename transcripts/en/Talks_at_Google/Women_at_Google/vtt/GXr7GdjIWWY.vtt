1
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.973
Okay.

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.470
<v 0>So thank you,
Michelle for joining us.
I'm ed through our,</v>

3
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:16.640
for those of you don't know me,
I'm a business manager in g class.
Um,

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.870
Michelle is the CEO of peanut and she's also the founder and it's a basically a

5
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:25.250
Tinder style dating apps for mums to meet other mothers.
Um,

6
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.593
she,
the,

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.690
the APP launched in Fed visio and has had amazing traction so it's been picked

8
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:37.010
up in the press a lot.
So you might've seen her mentioned there.
Um,

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.190
and we want it to get,

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.080
take this opportunity for her to come in because I know a lot of Googlers sort

11
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:45.770
of talk about starting their own thing or starting something outside of work.

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.760
And sometimes the inertia of just being in your day job can stop that.

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.960
So someone who's actually gone from working for other people to working for

14
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:58.310
herself,
it's quite an interesting journey.
So,
um,
Michelle also launched peanut,

15
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.140
uh,
on android and October.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So finally we,
uh,

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.570
we can claim fame to it too as well,
which is amazing.

17
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.600
So I'm going to do a few questions,
but really,
please come.

18
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.460
Please have like your own questions prepared.

19
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.090
We'll have loads of time at the end for,
um,
for your questions as well.

20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.570
Um,
so,
um,

21
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.750
I remember distinctly when you first kind of talked to us about the ideas,

22
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.290
I know Michelle outside of this particular thing,
um,
we were at a,
uh,

23
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.860
at a wedding and she had a phone and a deck on a phone and it was like,

24
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.940
this is my idea for,
um,
uh,

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.280
for an app and what it was going to be like.
And she,

26
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.610
I remember at that point she was kind of passing the phone around a table and a

27
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:45.530
lot of people were like,
this is amazing.
And equally a lot of people were like,

28
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.810
isn't this like Mum's net?
And like really like challenging about the idea?
Um,

29
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.000
yeah.
So can you talk a little bit about where the idea came from?
Yeah.

30
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.910
And then how you kind of got to that first investor meeting and kind of like the

31
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.570
challenges and the People's reactions to that?

32
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.820
<v 2>Yeah.
So,
um,</v>

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.770
I started life actually as a corporate lawyer way back when and that was my kind

34
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:11.030
of am starting point.

35
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.950
I still a lot of m and a and I went to work in house for a biotech company,

36
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:19.970
which was again very,
very different and not very many all.
Um,

37
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.780
and one of the lawyers that I used to work for called me and said,

38
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.100
you should go meet this guy.
He's a new client of mine.
Um,
I,

39
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.620
he needs someone to go and work with them.
I think you'd be great.

40
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:33.470
I think you'll love it.
It's a dating website.
I was like,

41
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.230
not really,

42
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.580
and this was back in 2010 and dating was definitely not what it is now.

43
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.510
And there was definitely a feeling of like dating,
not sure,

44
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.070
maybe something your parents did when they got divorced or it just wasn't like

45
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:53.390
it is today.
Um,
and tech definitely wasn't kind of in London.

46
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:56.690
It definitely didn't have the same feel and an excitement and buzz that it does

47
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:58.040
now.
Um,

48
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.070
and I went to meet the founder who was a young guy who was,

49
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.750
um,
unusual and um,
it was interesting.

50
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.850
I'd never really understood it as a business.

51
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.840
And what I mostly couldn't understand is that when they were 56 million people

52
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.320
using this product,
I'd never heard of called Badu.
Um,

53
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.310
yeah.
And um,

54
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.580
I met a few more people.
It was very exciting.

55
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:28.900
It was in some crazy rundown office in Soho.
And um,

56
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.850
I decided I would do it.
So I became the lawyer there.
Um,
I'm very nosy.

57
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.810
I all sorts of questions under the guise of being the lawyer you're allowed.
Um,

58
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.900
and particularly was fascinated by it was making money.
Um,

59
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.390
I wanted to understand how people were using the product,
what the journey was,

60
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.560
why they would pay for certain things.
Um,

61
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.540
and then I was kind of there for the evolution from web to mobile.

62
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:57.340
So this was all back like web.
I think the most adventurous we had was well,
um,

63
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.240
and it was kind of that transition and that was exciting.

64
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.180
I'm really understanding why people's behavior was different,

65
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:08.140
why people were spending differently,
how long they spent on web versus mobile,

66
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.750
all of those different,
um,

67
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.870
kind of vantage points that I'd never really seen of the business before.

68
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.273
Um,

69
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.580
and it kind of came to the evolution of Tinder.

70
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.500
Tinder came out and I remember my girlfriend's in the states talking about it

71
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.590
and me being like,
what is it?
Um,

72
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.040
and it was a gray screen and I was desperate to see and desperate to understand.

73
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.770
And,
um,
that was really the kind of starting point of looking more,
um,

74
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.210
less about legal,
um,
and more about kind of being involved in the business.
Um,

75
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.360
I started working alongside Andre,
has his kind of right hand,
um,

76
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.440
and became deputy CEO at Purdue and as part of that was involved in a bumble,

77
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.500
which I'm very proud of and was very exciting.
Um,

78
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.720
and I suppose it was that whole journey and that was kind of over the course of

79
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.170
five years,
wrapped up in 30 seconds,
um,
that I,
um,

80
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.450
decided that I really wanted to do something that,

81
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.580
a product that I would use.
I wasn't dating,
um,
in my personal life.
Um,

82
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.970
and I really had had this experience when I became a mother that I didn't really

83
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:22.900
have any girlfriends who had babies.

84
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.210
And I really wanted to just take all of the kind of learnings that I had about

85
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:32.990
connectivity and apply it to women.
I also was really frustrated,
um,

86
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.340
by the products that were out there for mothers.
Everything changed.

87
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:40.960
You go from using,
whether it is snapchat at the time,

88
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.771
which was really,

89
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:46.510
really buzzing or Insta or Pinterest or delivery or any of these amazing or Uber

90
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.320
or any of these,
like very slick,
cool products.
And then you become a mom.

91
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.800
And it was like,
well,
where's my thing?
Um,

92
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.890
and everything felt like it was very much aimed at babies,

93
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.860
kids and not aimed at me as a woman.
Um,

94
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.460
and so I decided I would do it.
So I,
um,

95
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.200
left Purdue in January last year and it was absolutely terrifying.

96
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.620
I loved my job and I love what I did and I was very proud of everything that I

97
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:17.960
did with [inaudible],
with bumble.
Um,

98
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.720
and so to make that move was,
or,
you know,
I was very scared.

99
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.983
Um,

100
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.970
but I really wanted to do it and I believed in it and it wasn't just that I

101
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.000
wanted to do a product for me,
it's a huge business opportunity.
You know,

102
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:37.001
women are making 85% of household decisions on spend and yet there was just this

103
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:43.460
huge gap and I really wanted to,
to address it.
Um,
so I left,

104
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:44.540
did a lot of consulting,

105
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:49.520
saved a lot of money because I knew I'd have to start the build on my own and
um,

106
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.150
went to one of our friends' weddings and was kind of talking through it.

107
00:06:56.061 --> 00:07:01.061
And one of our friends in particular who is now a very avid supporter was like,

108
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.030
I didn't get it.
I don't think mom's really need this.
And I was like,

109
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:09.380
how would you know,
you're not a mom,
but also,
um,
why?
And he was like,
yeah,

110
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:13.550
but this is mom.
I was like,
absolutely not.
This is something very,
very different.

111
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.803
Um,

112
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.840
and I think at that time I had had my term sheets so I just got a term sheet

113
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:25.130
from NEA.
Um,
and getting the term sheet,

114
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.840
it was a real whirlwind cause I don't think I really fully appreciated what that

115
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:32.570
process was.
So I'd gone from,

116
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.610
I probably threw naive butty I just was really ballsy and had me in a deck.

117
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.651
So that's all you,

118
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:43.130
how did you commission someone to do some research or did you do your research?

119
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.030
I had done,
I'd just gone and researched the market,

120
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.880
had a look at what a change,
what was the size of the market,

121
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:53.150
what else was out there?
Like doing those weird competitor analysis,

122
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.350
speaking to women.

123
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.150
So many women everywhere on Facebook groups,
on,
you know,

124
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.750
in real life everywhere.
Asking them what they did,
what was their view.
Um,

125
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.600
lots and lots of that kind of qualitative research was one of the overwhelming

126
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:11.750
things that came from that was that there was just nothing on the market that

127
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:16.190
really targeted a woman who was active.
It was a modern person basically.

128
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.640
You seem to be like 80 from the ATS.
Yeah.

129
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.210
I think that the overwhelming response was we were using products are women were

130
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.060
using products that were there because that's all they had.

131
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.230
And there wasn't really anything that had kind of innovated forward.

132
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.390
And it was that moment for me where I was like,
why can't it be me then?

133
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.790
Like why can't I be the one to change it?
Um,

134
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.140
and that is not to do down any of the products that were out there,
you know,

135
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.620
mum's net babycenter,
what to expect.

136
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.340
All of these amazing platforms did something amazing 15 years ago,

137
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:53.120
which is they gave women a voice who are mothers and we didn't have it before.

138
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.950
So I would never ever knock that.
It was just,

139
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.920
I was looking at doing something different.
Yeah.

140
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.880
<v 0>So you had this idea,
you have this deck.
Yeah.
How do you,</v>

141
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.350
where do you go from there?
Like who are you,

142
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.340
who are you shopping it around to you and how do you get your first investors on

143
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.740
board?
And what was that process like?

144
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.220
Especially since there wasn't anything exactly like what you were describing on

145
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.090
the market and you're going to a lot of investors who I'm assuming don't

146
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:22.650
understand that particular psyche and that particular loneliness that comes from

147
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.100
adulthood.

148
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.850
So how do you kind of go through that process of convincing them that this is

149
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:28.920
something that there is a market for.

150
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.780
<v 2>That part is challenging.</v>

151
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.870
So in terms of how you identify it's very different or how I did it this time

152
00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:41.810
round and how I would do it going forward.

153
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.500
And if I were doing it again is very different to how I did it.
You know,

154
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.040
I'm completely naive,
Lee and an experience layer,
which is,
I spoke to everyone.

155
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.860
If someone said,
I'll give you an intro.
I was like,
great,
I'll take the intro.

156
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.610
And I was nondiscriminatory and who I spoke to.

157
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.210
And I suppose the upside of that is I learned a lot.

158
00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.920
So I learned when things,
um,
what conversations not to have.

159
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.330
Um,
what the difference between a late stage,
the early stage fund is.
And all,

160
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.330
you know,
when someone says to you,
we're at the end of our fund,

161
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:14.300
but if you can hold off until we're at the beginning of our next fund,

162
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.680
what does that even mean?

163
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.560
Like all of those things that I just work complete minefield.
Um,

164
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.830
and this time I have been much more kind of targeted and I want to speak to you

165
00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:28.100
cause I think you understand the market or whatever it might be.
Um,
I,

166
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.410
I spoke to everyone and that is tough.
Yeah.
Um,

167
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.050
I shamelessly ask for interest to people.
Yeah.

168
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.770
And yeah,
that's it.

169
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.800
And I asked friends and friends of friends and um,

170
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.340
I met any eighth through,
um,

171
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.060
Whitney at bumble and that was the kind of starting point.

172
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.580
And from there anyone I spoke to,
I would always say at the end of it,

173
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.110
thank you so much for your time.

174
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.190
If you can think of anyone else that you think I should be speaking to.

175
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.260
And I always ended like that.
I don't think that's necessarily the right way,

176
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:11.030
by the way,
do it,
do your own research and you can be like more targeted,

177
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.680
targeted because it's important for you to,
it's like a marriage,
right?

178
00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:17.810
You're getting into a relationship with this person.

179
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.210
They're going to be in your business.

180
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.770
<v 0>So how did you approach things differently with your second round?</v>

181
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.910
This is your seed funding round.
She just closed.
It was in the,

182
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:31.720
on the front page of the Times.
I don't know if anyone else saw it.
Um,
uh,

183
00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:33.940
so yeah.
That's fantastic.
So congratulations on that.

184
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.510
So how did you approach it differently?
Did you target funds and say,

185
00:11:37.511 --> 00:11:42.511
I'm going to go after you for your life because I believe that you'll understand

186
00:11:42.641 --> 00:11:43.540
this market a little bit,
that

187
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.210
<v 2>better.</v>

188
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:49.210
It was obviously easier because before I was pre product I was kind of pre-team.

189
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.680
Actually Greg and I haven't at the point that I was starting to,
to investors,

190
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:57.060
Greg and I hadn't decided to work together.
He's my co founder.
Um,

191
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.120
and so it was very,
very early.
Um,
this time,

192
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.540
obviously our product is out there and we have metrics.

193
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.390
We have a team we can go out and it was,
you know,

194
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:11.160
it's much easier to speak to people.
And um,

195
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.530
I was much more kind of purposeful about who I was speaking to and why.

196
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.823
Um,

197
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.900
and so we have two joint need investors on this round and they both bring

198
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.070
something different that I'm really excited about.

199
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:28.210
Sweet capital who are the founders of king.com.

200
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.930
So candy crush,
um,

201
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.270
which was really exciting for me from a product perspective and their insight

202
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:39.190
and their understanding of women spending time on candy crush and all of those,

203
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.611
you know,

204
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:43.930
that was valuable for me and I really was excited to have them on board and the

205
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:48.750
female founder's Fund in New York obviously exciting for me to have,
um,

206
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.090
a kind of female VC with that kind of overview and understanding of the female

207
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:54.760
market.
So,
um,
I was very,

208
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:58.330
very specific about who we spoke to.

209
00:12:58.331 --> 00:13:02.260
I'd also kept in contact with people like Greg Kraft who I'd met first time when

210
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:05.650
I was doing our pre seed.
And so when I was like,
look,
we're doing our seed,

211
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.140
obviously I'd built a relationship with them over a year.

212
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.010
So then it was easy for them to say yes,
you know?
So,
um,

213
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.240
I think that's how it was different.
It was definitely more,
um,
targeted.

214
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.100
I think probably,
um,
naivety made me a bit fearless.

215
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.680
It's time,
but also,
you know,
your waste a bit of,

216
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.640
you do waste a bit of time in that way.
And if you're doing it ever,

217
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.950
you can be selfish.
Your time is precious too.

218
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.440
And maybe it's not the right time to take that introduction.

219
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:35.170
If someone says to you,
amazing weight right now,

220
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:38.020
I'm just going to introduce you to,
it's okay to say,
actually,

221
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:41.230
can I come back to you when I'm ready for that introduction because you don't

222
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:43.570
want to waste it,
but to be like an amazing intro,

223
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:45.340
but do it at a time that suits you.

224
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.140
<v 0>Yeah.
So you,
um,</v>

225
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.740
so if I go like good back a little bit for when you first launched.

226
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.870
So you want to sort of make a big splash,

227
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.550
but I assume you don't want a bunch of people kind of downloading this app and

228
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:58.660
no one else's on there.

229
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.890
And I was listening to an interview with the Tinder founder and he was like,

230
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:05.590
he basically like ran from one room to the other.

231
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.590
I'm in a college campus and was like,
women are there.

232
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:10.540
And then he ran to the other room and was like,

233
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.740
get on that because men are there and he had to kind of get those first people

234
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:17.810
online before you could actually get sort of big traction.

235
00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:19.120
So how did you get those,

236
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.710
that first kind of critical mass before you can make a big splash in the market?

237
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:26.560
Or is that how you did it or how did you kind of interact?

238
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.700
Um,
the idea was cause

239
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.500
<v 2>we would launch in London,</v>

240
00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:38.030
New York simile tediously and we would seed it with some women who we knew had

241
00:14:38.031 --> 00:14:42.230
existing communities,
very small.
It was really proof of concept.

242
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.430
Can you go and test it,
seed it to women that you know,
get,
get their feedback.

243
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:47.264
Let's see.

244
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.070
So rarely in that first week I think we thought we'd be doing really well if we

245
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:57.071
had like 50 people using it and we could kind of see their interaction and we

246
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.270
did do that and then the next day it went,
um,

247
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.370
and the press coverage was insane and very interested.

248
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.940
Um,
and so that kind of amplified.
Um,

249
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.480
but I still kind of was very clear on the fact that if you're building a social

250
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:20.090
product,
you have to feel exactly what you said.
Like there are people around you,

251
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:21.530
you can't open the APP and be like,
okay,

252
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:23.780
so the nearest woman is intelligence that he had that problem.

253
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.120
So we were very focused on it.
But,
um,
we then became very reactive.

254
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:31.100
So we would see,
um,

255
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.210
women using it and Dallas are women using it in la or women using it in Chicago.

256
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.370
And then we would do a small event or a dinner or something to let other women

257
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:41.360
know in that area.

258
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:44.240
You'll have a great user experience of use peanut here because we already have

259
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:49.010
thousands of women using it.
But it was very organic up until that.
Amazing.

260
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.690
So you've sort of talked about,

261
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.460
but you were involved in dating apps and Michelle actually named bumble.

262
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.630
Um,
so you've got a knack for naming thing.
Um,

263
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.310
and we've sort of seen this arc that you also described that dating was online

264
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.410
dating was very weird to begin with.

265
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.130
And now if you are single and you do want to meet someone,

266
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.350
like it's not a question you would be on a dating app.
Yeah.

267
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:18.020
So what does the arc that you're trying to sort of see with peanut?

268
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.060
So my observation,

269
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:23.510
and you could tell me if this is right or wrong cause that loneliness is sort of

270
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.440
the one of the last taboos that we talk about.
And not just for Moms,

271
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:29.780
it's like if you're married or anything,

272
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:32.540
you kind of have to have this bravado about not being alone.
Yeah.

273
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.460
So where do you sort of see,

274
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:38.540
like what is your overarching mission and where do you see kind of peanuts

275
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:42.290
shaping that art?
I think that,
um,

276
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.180
you're absolutely right,

277
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.690
the evolution from dating going from something slightly awkward to everyone's

278
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:54.260
doing it and my friends describing it as Michelle likes and dating Tim Michelle

279
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.390
Lakes and data.
Um,

280
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.730
I remember it so clearly and I think that there is a lot of discussion around is

281
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:04.910
tech and social media making us more lonely.
Um,

282
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.520
and for me it's all about how you use it.

283
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.840
If you're using it in a way that helps you have those in real life connections,

284
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.930
how could that ever be a bad thing?
Um,

285
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.400
so we have tools within peanut that facilitate,
um,

286
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.350
polling and scheduling times to meet.

287
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.070
So it's like having a doodle effectively but within the messaging and three

288
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:26.390
clicks and it's in your calendar.

289
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.800
And for me that was really important because it's about getting that face to

290
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:35.230
face.
But what's more scary kind of sitting,
looking at your phone and,

291
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.900
and kind of watching everyone else's life or then sending a connection to meet

292
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:43.310
someone in real life?
Well,
it's more scary just watching the world pass year.
Um,

293
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.760
so I think that we will see more,

294
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.190
there is a lot more conversation around loneliness.

295
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.660
I know that we have a lot of conversations about on millennials,

296
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.090
the loneliest generation ever in all of these things.

297
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.310
And I think that it's about encouraging tech or using tech to help you meet in

298
00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:04.160
real life and to facilitate in real life.
Um,
and I think that the,

299
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.430
the taboo,

300
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.150
the last taboo that we need to break is actually being able to come out and say

301
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.050
as a 30 something,
yeah,
I'm lonely.
Or yeah,
this is tough.

302
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:17.070
And it's not everything that everyone told it told me it would be,
or um,

303
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:18.660
yes,

304
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.230
sometimes it's 2:00 AM and I felt like the whole world's asleep and I'm awake

305
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:26.010
feeding this baby and no one else understands me or whatever it might be.

306
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.870
And that kind of being able to have that contact with someone and support and

307
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:32.010
network is really important.

308
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.280
Do you find that that's sort of your biggest barrier to growth is that people

309
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.370
kind of download the APP and then they're nervous about actually contacting

310
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:42.030
other moms and do sort of see a massive difference between like you've launched

311
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:45.990
in the states obviously and how they've adopted the product very differently

312
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:46.824
from here?
Yeah,

313
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.890
so I think that there is a difference between the US and the UK behavior we're

314
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:55.110
in,
in the US and the UK.
Um,
culturally,

315
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:58.740
I don't know how terribly British it is to speak to people.
We don't know.

316
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.490
I don't think we're madly good at it versus in the states where people are

317
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.210
perhaps a little bit more,
um,
open to giving it a go.
Um,

318
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.360
and so I do think that,
um,

319
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.360
we can see a little bit of a difference.
Again,

320
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:16.110
it kind of depends on your stage of life as well.

321
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.780
If you used a dating app to meet your partner,

322
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.910
of course this doesn't seem like a hurdle.

323
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.550
What of course it would be a natural thing that you're going to use an APP like

324
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:26.730
this to meet friends.
Um,
so there were all different,
you know,

325
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:28.830
it's very personal in that way.
Um,

326
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.440
I think that we do see women who,
um,

327
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.620
use the happen and watch a bit of watching.
I'm a lurker too,

328
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:42.120
so I totally get it.
Um,
so watching before they do it.

329
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:46.110
And then I sometimes get messages from women,
what,
what can I say?

330
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:49.680
I don't know what the best message to send us or whatever it is.
Um,

331
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.630
and for me,
I just say anything,
say hi,

332
00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:58.410
say what you're eating,
whatever.
It doesn't matter.
Um,
but it's,

333
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.640
that's much less scary sending that message as much less scary than spending a

334
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.820
week on your own without a grownup to talk to you.
Yeah,
absolutely.

335
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.390
So I'm going to open it up to the,
to the floor in like one question.

336
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:13.650
So keep them already.
Um,
before I do that.
So at Google,

337
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.830
I mean we obviously started out with the two people in a garage and one of the

338
00:20:17.831 --> 00:20:21.730
sort of principles that we try to stay to true to you at least is um,

339
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.900
being very scrappy and like that less having less will force you to be smarter

340
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:30.810
and do better.
So you're obviously small still.

341
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.620
So how are you thinking?
You've got ambitious plans to peanut,

342
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.600
but you're still a small team.

343
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:40.410
So how are you prioritizing and how you're thinking about your next growth stage

344
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.810
given that constraint?
Um,

345
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.780
so that you kind of propel yourself in the best way possible to grow?

346
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.063
I think it's really,

347
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.340
I do believe that having little makes you scrappy cause you have no choice,

348
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:53.410
right?
You and it's,
it's do or die.

349
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:57.010
I have to go out there and I have to establish that the product is firstly

350
00:20:57.011 --> 00:21:01.210
viable.
And secondly,
we've got traction.
Otherwise we have no product.
Um,

351
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.900
so I do,
I do believe in it.
We are a team of six,
so we're very small.
Um,

352
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.160
and every decision I make,
I equate to headcount.

353
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.600
So if I'm going to spend x on a really nice office,
for example,

354
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:16.110
and I'm not currently,
I'm squatting,
um,
but I'm,

355
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.060
I'm going to send x on office space,

356
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:22.890
we'll that's like two extra people in the team that could make us go,
you know,

357
00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.880
reach that part of our roadmap three months ahead of,
of plans.

358
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.060
So I always equate it to,
to head count and the ability to go faster.

359
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.170
Um,
I cheekily asked for favors.

360
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.410
People have asked me for favors in the past and I've always liked helped where I

361
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:41.830
can.
So I don't think anyone should be shy to ask for favors.

362
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.280
They actually might be really excited to work with you.

363
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.290
And what's the worst they say?
No.
Okay.
No,
it's,
it's no,
it's no bother.

364
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.370
Um,
so I,
I shamelessly ask people and,
um,

365
00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.600
I think what we now need to do,
we're,
we're building a new feature at the moment,

366
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.460
um,
which is very kind of like head down,
product focused.
Um,

367
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.830
and then we really have to go out and amplify it.

368
00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:10.420
And that's quite scary because I have to go and let all of our existing users,

369
00:22:10.421 --> 00:22:11.710
no fine,
that's not a bother.

370
00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:16.711
But now it's really like kind of sharing it more widely and we have a limited

371
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:18.700
budget and we have,
you know,

372
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.330
a certain time to establish it in and we'll have to learn as we go.

373
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.980
And probably because we're a team of six,
we can be quite agile and say,
okay,

374
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:29.880
that didn't work,
scrap next.
Um,
yeah,

375
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.540
we do a bit of test and dump test.
It didn't work,
go next.
Um,

376
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.920
and um,

377
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.720
I think not being precious and not being too tied to your idea of,
you know,

378
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.670
this will work and being prepared to sit okay and on with the next,
um,

379
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.720
is helpful.
But I've made mistakes along the way.
Like of course we all,
we all do.

380
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:51.460
And it's,
I mean,

381
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:53.950
in hindsight at the time it's the most painful thing in the world.
You're like,

382
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.551
oh my God,

383
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:59.470
that was 5,000 and then it's five k that I will never waste again.

384
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.040
So.

385
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.610
<v 0>Absolutely.
So I'm going to open it to floor anyone with questions?</v>

386
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.220
Okay.
Sorry.
Quick question.
Two quick questions for you.
One,

387
00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:12.080
founders are Casandra's are really important,
um,

388
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.820
because after your kind of seed funding for all of the rounds that do,

389
00:23:15.821 --> 00:23:20.200
it was really important to investors.
So how did you pick your cofounder?

390
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.550
And the second question is,
did you find what you were looking for out of peanut?

391
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.050
<v 2>Yup.
Um,</v>

392
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.500
so Greg is my perfect opposite.
Um,

393
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.100
he is,
um,
brilliant,
um,

394
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.080
not,
but I'm not brilliant.
Sounds awful.

395
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.370
<v 0>Um,
confidence or shell,</v>

396
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.850
<v 2>but he is,</v>

397
00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:47.850
he's very focused and he is a brilliant technician and he is very logical and

398
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:52.760
I'm always thinking over here and he's thinking about kind of how we're going to

399
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:57.740
get there.
Um,
I found,
um,
Greg purely by accident.

400
00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.280
Um,

401
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.170
I was speaking to a friend that we had in common and saying that I really needed

402
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:06.320
to hire,
but I couldn't hire anyone from Vudu or Bumbo.

403
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:11.321
I was under restrictive covenant and so my usual pool was out of bounds and she

404
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:14.810
said,
oh,
you should speak to Greg.
He's just left delivery.
He'll,

405
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.490
he'll have an idea of like the market.
And,
um,

406
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.620
so I was waiting for the introduction and I got really impatient.

407
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.350
I was taking a long time,
so I just emailed him and I was like,

408
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:27.840
so I'm waiting for this introduction from our friend.
Um,

409
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.120
can I pick your brains about the market and,
you know,
whatever.

410
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.030
And we started speaking and he was like,
actually,
I love the idea,

411
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:38.740
I'm going to do it with you.
So it was kind of fell into it and that way,
um,

412
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.100
he has a little girl and had to kind of understood the issues surrounding it.

413
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.140
Um,
and so I was very lucky in that way.
And um,

414
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.470
he's definitely,
you know,

415
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:57.130
probably the better half of peanut m and in terms of have I got out of peanut

416
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.660
what I wanted,
it is the best feeling in the wild.

417
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.540
When someone messages you to say,

418
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:10.700
I've just met my ex best friend on peanut or I was having a really tough time

419
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:14.060
and I can see light at the end of the tunnel because I've got a,
you know,

420
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.200
a drink with a girl I've met on Friday,
whatever it might be.
Um,

421
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:22.160
because that's what it's for.
Right.
And my favorite thing,

422
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:25.250
it's like a weird get off a plane,
wherever I am,
open peanuts,

423
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:30.170
see like women around hi,
speak to them psycho,
um,
just to,

424
00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.820
to kind of see what they're doing.
And it's amazing.

425
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:35.720
I can find out like where they go to eat or where's like a kid friendly place,

426
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:39.560
whatever it is.
And it's that kind of community and hyper community.

427
00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:41.990
It's amazing.
So yeah,
I'm very proud of it.

428
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.790
<v 0>Um,
my name is Camila.
I'm super excited to have you here.
Um,</v>

429
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.610
so the question is,
you're,
you're being a lawyer.
I'm,

430
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.540
I'm assuming you did have some exposure to technical terms and stuff in your

431
00:25:54.541 --> 00:25:58.650
previous careers,
but still building an APP is very technical.

432
00:25:58.651 --> 00:26:03.030
So how did you overcome,
you know,
how deep was your knowledge?
Did it have to be,

433
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.120
or you probably had your cofounder to help without,

434
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.010
basically the fear is can you actually learn all these things and do you have
to,

435
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.840
as a founder,
yeah,
and we,

436
00:26:12.841 --> 00:26:16.500
I think most of the people in this building are on the business side.
Yeah.

437
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.260
And so when we talk to engineers,
there is like a little bit of a,
uh,

438
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.900
a disconnect.
So how do you kind of like the sort of extension of that is,

439
00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:26.090
how do you like the talk,

440
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.840
make your preferences known so that they kind of interpret it into what is now

441
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:31.680
really a beautiful app?

442
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.510
<v 2>Um,
I just ask questions all the time and I,</v>

443
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.990
I,
I don't think I really have a shame about whether it's a stupid question or

444
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.230
because it would be more stupid if I pretended to know and it turns out wrong

445
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.830
or,
you know,
I haven't been able to express it in the right way.
Um,

446
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.030
I am very fortunate Greg is patient.
Um,

447
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.790
and I do have a brilliant team who I kind of communicate well with.

448
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:04.630
And you're right,
I was working in an industry where I have an awareness,
but,
um,

449
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.760
I will ask and I will,
um,

450
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:13.130
pick and prod until I understand why we can't do something or why it's been done

451
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:15.690
in that way.
Um,

452
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.950
and I just think that you have to be fearless in the questions.

453
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.570
Actually you'll find in the same way that you feel proud about your work every

454
00:27:23.571 --> 00:27:27.780
day.
The engineers are so proud of what they do.
If you ask,

455
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:29.700
they're delighted to share it with you.
Right?

456
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.480
Like everyone in my team of I want to know something that delighted to tell me

457
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:36.720
why.
Um,
it is,
and um,

458
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.240
I suppose if you were so interested in your,

459
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.280
you both care about what you're building,

460
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.300
it's natural that you will ask and they will answer and you'll,

461
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.380
you'll get to that point.

462
00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:50.220
But I don't think you should ever be fearful of what you ask.

463
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.860
<v 3>I think that's the question.
Yeah.</v>

464
00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.690
<v 4>Two things.
The first one needs is a,
Eh,</v>

465
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.880
because in the social network you have that effect that the more people you have

466
00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:05.250
a level of law I want,

467
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:09.010
won't ask about how you picked up the very initial people to shoot it with.
Yup.

468
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.160
Because it's,
you know,
it's,
Eh,
it influence the trajectory.

469
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.340
The second thing that I wanted to ask us about funding show,

470
00:28:15.341 --> 00:28:18.550
where did you go for funding and why?
Since you have a,
you can,

471
00:28:18.551 --> 00:28:20.440
I guess connection if they're of,

472
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.280
I've seen that there are things that fly here and don't fly over there and vice

473
00:28:24.281 --> 00:28:26.950
versa if you have an opinion about it.

474
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.520
<v 2>Um,
so in terms of getting those initial users and getting nice at that initial</v>

475
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:37.521
attraction and that really comes down to me just speaking to a lot of people and

476
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.870
kind of being cheeky enough to say,
so I've got this APP coming out,

477
00:28:41.871 --> 00:28:45.920
can I let you know by when it's like,
we'll test it for me.
You know,

478
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.540
mostly people want to be involved and they want to help you and they want to

479
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:55.010
kind of test something new.
So again,
shamelessly asking people,
we do that,

480
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.140
will you send,
will you share it with your friends?

481
00:28:57.141 --> 00:28:59.280
Were telling your friends when it's ready.
Um,

482
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.840
and using my friends in the states in New York to say,

483
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.750
okay,
can you ask your girlfriends?
So it was really that.
Um,

484
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:14.180
and I think that the more you talk about something,

485
00:29:14.181 --> 00:29:15.800
I,
I've heard people say,
you know,

486
00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:18.320
where things that you mustn't tell anyone your idea.

487
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.660
Don't tell anyone your idea until it's ready.

488
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.350
I just think it's bizarre because how will you ever know whether your idea is

489
00:29:24.351 --> 00:29:28.790
for you or for everyone or you'll never know whether your product has a good fit

490
00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:33.590
or not.
So,
um,
I spoke with Mitch Nice and bought them at a wedding.
Um,

491
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:34.310
I spray it,

492
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.670
I spoke to everyone about it because I wanted to hear more and I wanted to know

493
00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:41.680
what people had to say about it and I wanted to understand how would use it and

494
00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:46.480
why.
So that then when it came to release,
they were excited to test it for me.
Um,

495
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.020
I test it.
I had a group of girlfriends who I was testing colors with,

496
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.290
do you like this color or this color?
Do you like this logo or this logo?

497
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:58.180
Would you press this button or this person?
I mean,
it was really,
um,
like that.

498
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.420
So,
um,
I think if you're doing something social,

499
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.350
you have to find that pool of people who you want to test it with and test.

500
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.720
And in today's kind of environment,

501
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.140
you can create that group anywhere you can create it.

502
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.430
In a Facebook group or a,
you know,
on Twitter,

503
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.300
gather people,
get some people on an Instagram handle and get them to follow you.

504
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:20.051
And then,
you know,

505
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:24.250
there are so many ways that you can test like a get a social group and test it

506
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.300
before you have to get to the stage where you're going to build an apple or

507
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:29.970
whatever it might be.
Um,

508
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.000
in terms of funding and getting the right funders.
Um,

509
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.000
as I mentioned before,
um,

510
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.860
I have got the most brilliant funders and I'm so super proud of all of my

511
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:45.940
funders and they all bring something different as all a different angle.
Um,

512
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.490
I have some who are us and some who are UK,

513
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.560
so I don't have predominantly us or UK.
I have a,
a bit of a split.
Um,

514
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.510
I say UK,
I mean Europe actually.
Um,
so I have a bit of a split.
Um,

515
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.600
and I think that when finding funders,

516
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.300
it's really about finding the right people who understand your business.

517
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:09.880
And really this time round,

518
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.410
I researched so that I knew exactly what businesses they'd invested in before,

519
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:17.890
whether they were analogies to what I was trying to do or whatever it might be.

520
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.710
So,
um,
you know,

521
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.740
it's pretty dispiriting when you speak to people and they're like,

522
00:31:23.741 --> 00:31:27.220
moms don't need that.
They drink coffee all day or,
um,

523
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.240
but I'm not showing my wife that she spends enough time on her phone or whatever

524
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:34.310
other months and stuff and I've heard it all.
Um,

525
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:38.650
and then you here you meet someone and they're brilliant and they say,
okay,

526
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:40.450
so what's the size of the market?
Okay,

527
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:44.020
so why is what you're doing different to how you're gonna monetize?
Okay.

528
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:47.140
So where do you think the barrier to entry is an all of these smart questions

529
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:48.670
cause they're not seeing it as you,

530
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:51.390
as a woman who happens to be a mother and creating a mothering out.

531
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.450
They're seeing it as a business and a market potential and it's finding those

532
00:31:55.451 --> 00:31:59.380
gems and they are there.
And I think that we,
at the moment,

533
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:04.270
there's a lot of bad press around the funding and vcs.
And,

534
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.690
um,
that's probably deserved for those who deserve it.

535
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:08.980
But there are some brilliant,

536
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.790
brilliant minds out there and it's just about finding them and being relentless

537
00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:14.680
in your search to find the right partner for you.

538
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.940
<v 5>You found funding pre-revenue?
Yes.
Okay,
thanks.</v>

539
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.790
Pre-Product play.

540
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:28.030
So what's changed for you now that you run your own business versus being CEO?

541
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.420
Someone else's business?

542
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.740
<v 2>It's like Jbs to have that dream.</v>

543
00:32:33.741 --> 00:32:36.290
When you go into school and you're naked and everyone's laughing,

544
00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:38.090
you don't know why and then you let down your naked.

545
00:32:38.091 --> 00:32:40.340
It's like that dream every day.
Um,

546
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.020
it was like that at the start.
It's very scary,
you know,

547
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:49.670
there is strength in numbers.
And when,
you know,
when I was at Purdue,
um,

548
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.300
I really felt like I was part of something huge but a small part of something

549
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:59.510
huge.
But,
um,
there was that safety and when you're doing it on your own,

550
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:04.520
it's all on you.
And it's really scary and it's personal because,
you know,

551
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.400
I always cared about my job and it was a huge part of my identity,

552
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:12.020
but I care so much about peanut because I don't want to let my team down,

553
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:15.920
my investors down,
my users down,
like women down like this.

554
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.950
There's so many huge pressures that I just don't want to let that fall.

555
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.600
Um,
and so there is a huge burden of responsibility.
Similarly.

556
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.980
Um,
I feel that,
um,

557
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.900
the highs are extraordinarily high because you know,

558
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.630
every single ounce of when you moved that,
you know,

559
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.391
tiny,

560
00:33:41.391 --> 00:33:46.391
tiny icon 0.2 millimeters to the left and you know that there was a real thought

561
00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:48.590
process behind it and you know,

562
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.940
all of a sudden your conversion increases and you're like,
Huh.

563
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.380
And no one else knows that,
but the highest so high from that,
um,
that,

564
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.540
um,
it makes it all worthwhile,

565
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.500
but it's extraordinarily hard work and,
um,

566
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.880
which it was before,
but it's a different kind of work and pressure I think.

567
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.213
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

568
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.960
<v 0>Am I have a few questions.
Um,
one is the,</v>

569
00:34:13.961 --> 00:34:17.920
how did you get your roadmap and how,
um,

570
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.280
in terms of company growth,
what,
what do you see in the future and,
um,

571
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:26.890
how would you kind of realigned that when things change?
Um,

572
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.980
my second question is I guess having a startup and being so passionate about it

573
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.570
and um,
having a successful career that you've had,
how do you,

574
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:41.730
um,
you almost become consumed by your idea because it is,
you know,

575
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.160
and it's good to be because he's so passionate.
But how do you find,

576
00:34:45.161 --> 00:34:48.850
keep yourself sane in terms of working hours and you know,
this,
um,
how,

577
00:34:48.851 --> 00:34:51.550
how'd you do that?
I think that's one of my main questions

578
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.020
<v 2>cause otherwise I'll forget them.
What was the first one?
So in the US,
and again,</v>

579
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:56.860
it was around the roadmap.

580
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.920
So the roadmap was,
um,

581
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.780
I suppose it was like this very kind of broad vision of peanut has to be like

582
00:35:09.001 --> 00:35:12.060
modern motherhood and that's what we want it to represent.
And,

583
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.050
and here are all the facets of modern motherhood that we could cover.
Okay.

584
00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:19.020
I don't want that.
We don't need to be that someone else is doing that.

585
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.720
And really kind of boiling it down in that way.

586
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.990
And then thinking very specifically about

587
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.840
where we really felt like that the opportunity lies lay and,

588
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:34.510
and how we can kind of unpack it and get,
get through that.
Um,

589
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:39.020
and I would say that the roadmap is ever,
and sometimes we have,
uh,

590
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.610
an idea and we all love it,

591
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.850
but we know it's not a priority and it kind of gets shuffled to the back and

592
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.660
it's that sad kind of item and Jay are that will maybe never like come to the

593
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:52.550
forefront.
Um,
and we hope it will but probably won't,
you know,

594
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.580
until we kind of doubled in size.
Um,
and sometimes,
um,

595
00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.230
it is imperative that we deal with something because it's impacting on the way

596
00:36:01.231 --> 00:36:03.410
users are interacting with the product.
Um,

597
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.400
so I think it's just being on your toes all the time and not being wedded to it

598
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:12.240
so that you're prepared to change.
And we have an idea for,
you know,

599
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.320
our subsequent feature to the one we have,
but it might change.

600
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:19.680
We have to wait and see how users use our next feature first before we can

601
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:20.760
really see,
okay,

602
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:23.760
it's not going to be the right direction or maybe we'll discover something brand

603
00:36:23.761 --> 00:36:24.450
new.

604
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:29.450
So I think a lot of it comes from watching like user behavior as well and your

605
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:34.800
analytics and really like being so grateful for all the amazing data where you

606
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:39.630
can kind of watch the behaviors,
um,
balance and work.

607
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:44.220
Life balance doesn't exist just in case anyone was interested.
So lie,

608
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.300
um,
I think it's a juggle,
right?

609
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.960
And some days you're amazing at juggling things and Sundays you're terrible at

610
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:55.880
juggling things and some days you're an amazing partner and sometimes you're a

611
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:59.400
horrible partner and sometimes you're amazing boss and sometimes you're the

612
00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:03.990
worst and you just have to be a little bit of peace and you kind of juggle it.

613
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.550
Um,
but if you're going to do something that you love,

614
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:10.260
you have to be a bit obsessed by it.

615
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:14.750
I think it literally all of my friends and family or peanut.
Okay.

616
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.990
Um,
that's all I can talk about.
And,
um,

617
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.440
I think you have to be like that because it's what makes you get up out of bed

618
00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:26.700
at 6:00 AM to,
you know,
do some work before my little boy gets up to get ready.

619
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.470
You know,
it's,
it's the drive.

620
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.380
<v 4>Um,
I just want to do that.
I guess there's a problem that you thought,
right.</v>

621
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:34.910
I can fix this.
Um,

622
00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.950
to me it seems like the big difference in entrepreneurship today compared to say

623
00:37:38.951 --> 00:37:43.540
like 30 years ago is the need to monetize and,
and where that comes in.

624
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.680
So I just wonder,
it's when you started thinking about that and,

625
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.530
and what pressure you got from funds about how developed your thinking had to
be.

626
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:51.610
Yup.
Yup.

627
00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:56.140
<v 2>Um,
there was an amazing,
um,
uh,</v>

628
00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.470
deck for the linkedin series B race.
Um,

629
00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.630
I think it's on the gray lock website anyway.
If,
if you haven't read it,

630
00:38:04.631 --> 00:38:05.650
you should go and have a look at it.

631
00:38:05.651 --> 00:38:09.490
Cause it's amazing because it's actually a critique by one of the cofounders of

632
00:38:09.491 --> 00:38:14.491
his own deck as a like looking at it from a VC perspective,

633
00:38:14.651 --> 00:38:19.651
having been the entrepreneur and in that he kind of identifies three lines of

634
00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:22.900
possible revenue.
And his critique is,

635
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.020
you shouldn't be talking about three lines of revenue should really be only be

636
00:38:26.021 --> 00:38:29.050
talking about one and but we didn't really know.
And you know,

637
00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:34.350
so it's really interesting to see his kind of own critique of his own work

638
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.610
effectively.
Um,
and it's also,

639
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.470
I mean read it anyway cause it's really fascinating to see like what their

640
00:38:40.471 --> 00:38:43.090
predicted growth was,
where they were and you forget,

641
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:47.860
I think we forget like how,
not how slow,

642
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:51.400
but it was an incremental growth.
It wasn't all of a sudden just bang Linkedin,

643
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:54.040
you know,
it took time.
Um,

644
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:59.310
so obviously I had thoughts and ideas on monetization.

645
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:02.550
I've come from a world where,
you know,

646
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.550
Purdue monetized extreme and monetizers extremely well.
And um,

647
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.280
so I had ideas.
Um,

648
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.360
I think probably my main stress point,
and it's,

649
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.890
I think it's specific to my market is everyone assumes I want to do advertising.

650
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.540
It's women,
they're moms advertising.
Is that your model?
No,
absolutely not.

651
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.720
You know,
it's that.
So for me it was more about here are some other,

652
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:27.580
I like possible streams.

653
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.750
I don't know which ones are right cause I need to see how people are engaging

654
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:36.070
with the product before I can definitively say,
but here's some ideas and no,

655
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:39.410
not all of them revolve around an ad model.
Um,

656
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.530
but I think having

657
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.250
some smart thought around how you could see it progressing even if it doesn't

658
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:51.250
end up going that way,
but to show that you've given it consideration,

659
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.820
it's a good idea.
Um,
but you know,

660
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.440
linkedin started with three strings on their deck is good enough for them.

661
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.180
I think we had time for them.

662
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.680
<v 0>One more crispier.
Okay,
good.
Hi Em.</v>

663
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.610
Supply at a time you launched mustard also just launched something.

664
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.640
How you handled that and your investor presentations and they start was a kind

665
00:40:11.641 --> 00:40:13.470
of pushback from potential investors at all.

666
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:19.330
<v 2>Um,
I think that any,</v>

667
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:23.890
anyone who is doing something in the same space as you or the same market as
you,

668
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.020
it is,
um,

669
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.800
confidence that there is a market and all it does,
you know,

670
00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:31.850
there wasn't just one dating app.
Um,

671
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:36.370
there isn't just one type of cola drink.
Um,

672
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.430
there was probably just one search engine,
but,
uh,
um,

673
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:46.590
but you know,
I think all of those,
um,
having the ability to have um,

674
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.770
someone else in the market,
um,
just as a establishes a,

675
00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.870
a proof of the validity in the market.
And I think that's important.
Um,

676
00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.180
I think that what's,
what will be your differentiator is how you execute,

677
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.430
how you see the market evolving,
how you see your product devolving,

678
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:08.700
how you see differentiators.
Um,

679
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:14.130
and there for me there are just lots of different ways to solve the same problem

680
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.210
and it's all about how your,
your answering that problem and what,

681
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.710
why you're the right person to solve the problem that in the way that you see
it.

682
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.310
Cause everyone will,
will take a different approach.
Um,

683
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.720
so in terms of how I responded to it,

684
00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.040
didn't really,

685
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.500
<v 0>or not,
and what we were doing.
Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

686
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:44.960
I think we've run out of time,
so I'm going to thank Michelle for joining us.

687
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.920
It was amazing.

688
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.650
Thank you so much for coming in and let's get her a round of applause.

689
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.290
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
