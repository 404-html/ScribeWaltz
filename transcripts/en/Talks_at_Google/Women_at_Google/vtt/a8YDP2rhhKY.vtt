1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.080
I'm super excited to have a Robin Louis today that has joined us to talk about

2
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:16.840
her game changers book.
And,
uh,
both Google,
Google and Gigglers,
uh,

3
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:21.140
are happy to welcome you and I know she's going to give her life story.
So,
uh,

4
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.730
without further ado,
Robin,
thank you.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.730
<v 1>Just say,
Gosh,
what a pleasure.</v>

6
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.460
What a pleasure to be here with you guys.
Um,
let's see.

7
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:35.400
I wanted to just start out with a quick introduction.
My name is Robyn Lawley.

8
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.490
Yeah,
she said,
and um,

9
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.680
I started this blog called a pocalypse smart lesbian commentary about eight

10
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.750
years ago.
Just inviting,
uh,

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.880
lesbians to like tell their stories and um,

12
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.640
I publish events and just interesting things,
authors,
things like that.

13
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.390
So it kind of led me to the book,
but before we get started,

14
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.280
I wanted to just ask your advice about,
um,
about my Halloween costume.

15
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:01.900
I had two choices.

16
00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:05.290
One is the clowns and these are clown candidates.

17
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.210
It says,
you know,
vote flappy and crappy for Congress.

18
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.600
That was pretty funny.
So we tried that one on and we tried on the cat costume.

19
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.450
So which,
which do you think we should do?

20
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.590
Oh,
you like clowns.
That's so good.
So they scare people.
Anyway.

21
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.180
I like to be a little scarier than,
you know.
I don't know.
Anyway,

22
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.660
so I'm okay.
Yeah,
maybe we'll do that.

23
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.210
So this is the agenda today.

24
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.110
We're just going to talk a little bit about me and,
um,
a few other things.

25
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:45.850
You can take a look at that
and we have some good giveaways.
Okay.

26
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.900
So growing up I didn't have any role models really.
Um,

27
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.630
it was a pretty scary time in the sixties and seventies.

28
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.680
And when I first moved here to California from Chicago,

29
00:01:56.681 --> 00:02:01.681
I was about seven and I rode my sting ray around it.

30
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.900
Look just like that actually.
And without a shirt on,

31
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.220
until that just wasn't okay anymore.
And what,
what we did was,
um,

32
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.080
what I did was like beat up boys after school.
Um,

33
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.530
we'd sneak out at night,
we were just trouble.
My friends and I,

34
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.030
and you know,
it became evident early on that,
um,

35
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.680
that I really liked girls and I was just,
um,
I would,

36
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.940
I would stand in front of the mirror and like flex my muscles.
And,
um,

37
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.970
I had two ideas in my head that I was sure about,

38
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:37.330
one that I was never going to marry a man and to that I was never going to have

39
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:41.350
a baby.
So those things ended up,
one of them ended up changing,

40
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.580
but I was so,
I couldn't have been more sure of anything in my life.

41
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.470
Now I also was a big sand lot,

42
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.060
a softball player,

43
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:56.590
baseball player and I wanted to play little league so bad and I was really good.

44
00:02:56.591 --> 00:03:00.070
And um,
at that time,
and this was pre title,
if you can imagine,

45
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:04.330
they didn't have to let girls play so I wasn't allowed to play.
Um,

46
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.460
so I joined Bobby sock softball team,

47
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.550
which was called the great American girls.

48
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:14.551
And we had a coach who was kind of a butchy mom type and we all had big brothers

49
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.790
and we,
we played so hard,
we were sliding into home.

50
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.750
And saying no batter and we handily won the championship.

51
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.440
And then at the end when they were passing out the trophies,

52
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.810
it ended up that they said,
I'm sorry,

53
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.180
but the Great America American girls are disqualified.

54
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.500
We're going to give the trophy to the buttercups,
uh,
because the,

55
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:38.140
the great American girls did not play in a lady like manner.

56
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.950
So if you can imagine a time when it was not okay to be competitive or a Tom

57
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:49.000
boy.
So that was the message I was getting pretty loud and clear.

58
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.350
Okay.
And so then when I became a teenager,

59
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:56.290
I applied to be a park ranger and I became the first park ranger.

60
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.310
This is a shot of me with a current park ranger that I ran into and I didn't

61
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.220
have to wear the man pants in the man boots at the time.

62
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:05.710
I could wear like cute tennis shoes and really tight pants,

63
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.711
like the kind that you lay down and zip up and a big old shirt with badges and a

64
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.041
big key ring.

65
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.340
And I just thought that I was so cool and I would stand around daydreaming about

66
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.070
the girl I was crushed out on.
Um,

67
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.410
then I got to high school and I really tried hard to be straight.
Um,
I,
you know,

68
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.240
I had a very feminine look and I just,

69
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.470
I got a lot of attention from men and so I just didn't know what to do.

70
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.290
So I tried really hard and it didn't work.
Um,

71
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.070
when I got to college,

72
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:41.071
I went to a summer in Europe where I met another woman who was also,

73
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.963
um,

74
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.060
had never been with a girl and we both were stumbling around.

75
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:49.930
It was a very awkward time,
but we got through it.

76
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.090
And then after that I finally moved to San Francisco where I finally found my

77
00:04:55.091 --> 00:05:00.091
people and we lived on Castro street in 1982 I met this woman and we started a

78
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.590
family.
After about seven years,
um,

79
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.870
we each had a boy.
My brother was the donor for the older boy,

80
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.170
and then she couldn't get pregnant again the second time we wanted to.

81
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:22.000
And so I had to step up and it was terribly difficult as an athlete to be

82
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:25.060
pregnant.
And that picture on the bottom is my son and I,

83
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.040
we look exactly the same.

84
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.180
I got to say it's one of the most empowering things that I've ever been through.

85
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.220
Like an Amazon,
like to give birth.

86
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:36.840
Like here I was a little kid thinking I can never do this.
And um,

87
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.260
it ended up being really awesome except for ruining my body.
And

88
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.570
he cried for five years straight,
pretty much.
Um,

89
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.870
but when he got a little older and it was cool because I couldn't have really

90
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:54.810
had a baby with a man,
I wasn't really that great with infants.
And My,

91
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.580
my ex partner love to just stay home.
She,
I worked really hard.

92
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:02.660
I was so happy to go back to work and she took care of the infants and,
um,

93
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.070
so they're really good kids.

94
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.890
So then at this time we had to this,
okay.
We were the first wave of parents,

95
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.570
um,
other people that were having children that were older than us,

96
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:16.310
but there was no real group of parents.

97
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.930
So we were in San Francisco at this time when we had like a gay PTA and we had a

98
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:25.220
very inclusive campus.
Um,
and it was just,

99
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.180
it was nice,
you know,

100
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:30.920
but we still had to do this thing where we adopted each other's kids because we

101
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:35.030
couldn't be legally the parent of our own child or I couldn't be the legal

102
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.030
parent of the child she gave birth to and vice versa.

103
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:42.530
So we had to literally give up our children to each other and the judge would

104
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:43.250
just,

105
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.070
I remember we had to go to court twice and he would just like point at us and

106
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.340
say,
are you sure you want to give up your child?
And I'm like,
oh my God.

107
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.760
It was really intense.
Um,
and then we got married,
we,
uh,

108
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.190
went down to city hall.

109
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.390
Gavin Newsome made it okay to go down and we ran down there and um,

110
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.520
it was exciting.
And My,
my youngest was eight and he was like,
oh,
Yay.

111
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:07.190
This means you'll be married forever.
You'll always be together.

112
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.990
And unfortunately that wasn't the case.

113
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:13.460
But what happened that was cool about that was that he,
you know,

114
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.400
he just felt so validated by us being able to be married.

115
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.650
So I feel like that's such an important,
um,

116
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.340
it's just an important thing when you think about,
um,

117
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.860
the whole right for same sex marriage,

118
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.890
that the kids are the ones that are being hurt by it so much.
And

119
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.730
so we,
um,
got,

120
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:36.731
are a marriage certificate mailed back to us after about,

121
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.350
I think it was less than a month later,

122
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.370
it arrived in the mail as a node because the law didn't stick.

123
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.800
So then at that point we moved to Marin county.
That's where I grew up,

124
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:52.250
as you saw.
And I wanted my kids to have a more rural existence.

125
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.800
So I brought them to Marin and my oldest came home saying,

126
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.910
uh,
God,
Mommy,
why is everybody saying you're so gay,
you fag?

127
00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:06.800
And he just didn't understand.
It was shocking for him.
And I was like,
well,

128
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:11.160
we're not living in San Francisco.
It's not a bubble anymore.
So he became a,

129
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.820
the kind of kid who told his friends,
look,

130
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:16.710
I'm not going to be your friend if you say stuff like that.
And you know,

131
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.840
I don't know.
I got,

132
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.170
I got motivated to go into the schools and become a speaker for the LGBT

133
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.970
speakers' bureau to be a coach for the little league team,

134
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.140
the coach for soccer,
and just be visible and like help them.
I mean,

135
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:34.640
like things would happen.

136
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:37.490
Like I'd have kids over for the soccer party and I'd say,
Timmy,

137
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.240
what are you doing out there?
And he'd say,
Oh,
we're playing smear the queer and,

138
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.770
you know,
in the backyard.
I'm like,
what?
And you know,
so,

139
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.350
and it just went on and on.
Some of the dads would say,
wow,

140
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:51.110
you really remind me of Ellen.
And I'm like,
why?
I don't look like her.

141
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.240
And we just had,
um,

142
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.370
there was a lot of homophobia in Marin.
And,
and,

143
00:08:57.371 --> 00:09:00.570
and I think about all the people in the outlying areas right now.
I mean,

144
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.730
we live in such a bubble.
Um,

145
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.850
so I got the idea to write this book,

146
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.680
which is about lesbian heroes of my generation.

147
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.940
And,
and the women that they looked up to weren't,

148
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.440
it wasn't like they were bad,

149
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:18.780
it was just that the role models weren't very positive.

150
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.870
So they passed a law called the fair education act kind of recently.

151
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.190
And it really got me excited.
Like this was something that I could contribute to.

152
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.730
I could,
I'm a graphic designer and an editor and a curator and I,

153
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.760
I have a huge circle of people that I know and I,

154
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.910
I just thought I could make a really fun book that teenagers are gonna love.

155
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.380
And so,
um,

156
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.370
what this law does is it requires a LGBT education,
uh,

157
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.150
as far as history and social studies in the public school curriculum in

158
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:51.310
California.
And there's right now there,

159
00:09:51.311 --> 00:09:53.430
it's not really like the curriculum exists.

160
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.670
It's not like really there's resources for them.
Um,

161
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.350
I attended a symposium last week where,
or two weeks ago where we,
we,

162
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:01.890
um,

163
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.710
got in a room and did a whole big think tank about how we're going to get this

164
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:05.341
to happen.

165
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:10.020
And it's clearly a couple of years out before they'll really be a lot of things

166
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:14.910
available to students.
And especially public schools don't have a lot of,

167
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.610
uh,
resources to spend on stuff like this.

168
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:22.110
So I got it in my head that I wanted to make this book and donate it to the

169
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:25.170
public high schools in Marin,
San Francisco,
Oakland,
and Berkeley.

170
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.270
So what I did was I decided to go crowdfunding and I got to say,

171
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:32.730
if you're a little insecure and you have a full time job,

172
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:36.310
this is a brutal way to go.
Um,
I was,

173
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.820
it was so excruciating.

174
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.320
I went at it to two different runs at it each for about 10,000,

175
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.530
and I'm,
no,
the money's not all from my family.

176
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:49.740
It really did get spread out amongst about 200 people.

177
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:53.250
I had an average of about a hundred each.
Um,
it required,
you know,

178
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.920
live Facebook videos,
you know,
Yay.
You know,
it's so scary.
Um,

179
00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:58.381
anyway,

180
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:02.340
so I got all that money and then I was able to print the books and I was able to

181
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:04.560
deliver them to the 48 public high schools.

182
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.170
And it serves about 49,000 students now.

183
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.770
And these schools have invited me in to talk in their classroom.

184
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.720
I've been able to,
um,
just share with these kids and hear their stories.

185
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:20.460
And I had one girl come up to me just in tears saying,
oh my God,

186
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:22.960
I can't believe you're really here.
And she had,
um,

187
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.490
I had these books kind of sprinkled around some bookstores too,

188
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:30.300
like in the Castro and she said,
I got your book in the Castro and I'm,
I'm just,

189
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:33.000
I can't believe it,
you know,
and she was hugging me and crying.

190
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:35.790
It was like so gratifying.
Um,

191
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.980
so I wanted to show you my crowdfunding video,
see if I can get this to play.

192
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.140
<v 2>My name is Robin Liliana.</v>

193
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:51.080
I've been curator and editor of apocalypse smart lesbian commentary in the past

194
00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:55.760
six years,
pioneering lesbian
mom of two grown sons.

195
00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:00.470
I turned to my youngest Sam Age 20 to talk about what this book means to him

196
00:12:00.471 --> 00:12:04.850
personally.
I was raised in Marin county by two lesbian moms.

197
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.180
As I grew up and went to elementary and middle school,

198
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.780
I noticed that we were never taught about gay people or their history.

199
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.210
So because of that lack of education,

200
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.040
gay slurs were rampant around campus and it was always kind of a struggle for
me.

201
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.060
I think you can help not only heterosexual students that are unclear about what

202
00:12:23.061 --> 00:12:27.470
being gay really means as well as kids that might be coming out of the closet

203
00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:30.290
and just want to find their own place in the world and be accepted.

204
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.160
And if you could spread the word to your network,
it would be a great help.

205
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.630
So thank you so much for your time.

206
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:39.880
<v 1>Anyway.
Um,</v>

207
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.260
I asked him to say that in his own words and he kind of gave me a hard time.

208
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.010
He's like,
I'm not going to,
I don't mommy,
I don't know what you know.
And,

209
00:12:47.011 --> 00:12:51.580
and I was like,
oh no.
And then I just,
it and then one day he goes,
okay,
I'm ready.

210
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.030
And I just went outside and filmed him with my iPhone.

211
00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:00.760
I got pretty lucky there.
That's a good boy.
And he's just not,
he's,
yeah.

212
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.350
Anyway,

213
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.350
so then I also got books ordered from schools in libraries all over the United

214
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.920
States.
People were hitting me up in like North Carolina and Texas and um,

215
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.920
it was just,
it's been super exciting.
I'm down to my last few books,

216
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:19.650
which I brought for you guys to raffle off,
so you're pretty lucky.
Then I won a,

217
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.130
an award for the best Lgbtq book by this,
um,

218
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.020
next generation indie book awards,
which was quite a,

219
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.980
it's quite an honor and I really didn't understand that.
It was such an honor.

220
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:31.300
I was kind of like,
Oh,
I got this award.

221
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:34.450
And then someone told me I've been trying to win that for years.

222
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:39.370
I can't believe you.
Anyway,
so here's a brief history of queer culture.

223
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.140
I just want to back up a little bit and talk about that.
The women in the book,

224
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.230
these are,
this is the kind of world that,

225
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.770
that I was a little girl and they were little girls in.
This is what we had.
Okay.

226
00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:53.920
So there's Sappho who obviously was the first,
uh,

227
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.040
written word of a sonic to another woman that is arguably like the beginning of

228
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:00.124
Lesbian Ism.

229
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.220
And then Radclyffe hall came along in like 1929 and she,
um,

230
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.160
wrote a book called the well of loneliness.
It was,
um,

231
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.920
it was in the court system in the UK for a long time for obscenity,

232
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.470
and it finally made it to the u s um,

233
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.530
there was no explicit sexual content in this book whatsoever.

234
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.350
It was just that there was a mannish heroine who was,

235
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.870
I guess she liked the girls.
And then Gertrude Stein was in the 1930.

236
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:30.100
She was the first visible lesbian here in,
in America.
Um,

237
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.030
she was from Oakland and she wrote those famous quotes.

238
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:38.170
A rose is a rose is a rose and there is no there,
there in regards to Oakland.

239
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.490
And,
um,

240
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.490
she ran a salon like in Paris with people like f Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest

241
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.360
Hemingway and Matisse,
Picasso.

242
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:51.860
All these big speakers at the time would sit around.
And,

243
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.940
and then she got famous for writing the book about her partner,
Alice B Toklas,

244
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.900
uh,
called the autobiography of Alice B Toklas,
which is kind of random.
She,

245
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.730
she did it in the voice of her partner.
Um,
and just as an added fun fact,

246
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.740
my parents named our cat Alice.

247
00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:11.360
And then later it came to light that his name was,
her name was Alice B Toklas.

248
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.950
This is when I was a little girl.
So that happened.
Okay.

249
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:20.810
So then this John recalled pulp fiction emerged and it had to do with just cheap

250
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:22.400
paper.
That's where they called the pope fiction.

251
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:25.870
And it was the first time that America could by just,
uh,

252
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.420
paperbacks cheaply at a news stand.
And,
you know,

253
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:31.070
you might finish reading it and leave it on your,

254
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.580
on your seat on the bus and someone else would pick it up.
And so it was,

255
00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:38.150
it was just a way to get masses to be reading literature and,

256
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.130
and then within that genre became lesbian pulp fiction and,
oh,

257
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.480
my notes,
could you grab those from you Jane?
Anyway,
so,

258
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.450
um,
if you wrote this book,

259
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:54.440
a lot of times the women had pseudonyms that were men's names and you,

260
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.770
the publishers were required that you,
um,

261
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.050
had to say you literally had to have the heroin either die.

262
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.580
These are not with them.
It's in my bag anyway,

263
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.800
back to back to the lesbian publication.
So,
um,

264
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.570
you had to have the heroin either die,

265
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:18.500
go back to men or go crazy just like the films at the time.
It was,
it was,

266
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:22.580
this is what we had to look up,
dude.
This is what we saw.
Yay.
Thank you,
Jane.

267
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.430
Okay,
so,
um,

268
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.600
I want to just read you a quote of a woman who was a kind of an interesting

269
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.310
writer.
She's probably 80 now,

270
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.540
so she said a lesbian pulp fiction paperback first appeared before my

271
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:38.630
disbelieving eyes in Detroit,
Michigan in 1957.

272
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.510
I didn't need to look at the title for clues.

273
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:43.700
The covered leapt out at me from the drug store rack.

274
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.930
A young woman with sensuous,
sensuous intent on her face,
seated on a bed,

275
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.930
leaning over a prone woman,
her hands on the other woman's shoulders.

276
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.250
Overwhelming need led me to walk a gauntlet or fear up to the cash register,

277
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.770
fear so intense that I remember nothing more.

278
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.950
Only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew.

279
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:04.040
I must have a book as necessary to me is air.

280
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.510
The book was odd girl out by an Bannon.
I found it when I was 18 years old.

281
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.210
It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was.

282
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.990
And it led me to other books that told some of us who we were and how some of us

283
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:15.824
live.

284
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.630
So it just to imagine a time where it this something like this would be so

285
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:25.010
forbidden and so awesome to like not have any vision of yourself out in the

286
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:26.390
world.
And then,

287
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.370
then you got this kind of one that wasn't so great because you didn't have to

288
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:34.040
die or go crazy.
So in this one,

289
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.440
things started to change a little in the 50s.

290
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.490
Women's barracks actually was about,
um,

291
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.080
a real couple with a real relationship a little bit.

292
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.660
And so if it came under the scrutiny of the,
uh,

293
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.870
house UNAMERICAN activities committee where they,
um,

294
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.890
they had it up for it obscenity and they,

295
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.960
they said Lesbian Ism was a social logical disease in a cause for grave national

296
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:58.920
concern.
It could not be cured,
but it must be understood as a tragedy.

297
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.310
So it was accused of promoting more moral degeneracy.

298
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:05.400
This is because they crossed that line where they weren't having an unhappy

299
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:09.360
ending.
And I'm,
I mean,
I'm actually not sure about the ending,

300
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:13.230
but the fact that there was a real relationship was just too much.
Um,

301
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.830
this is kind of the McCarthy era too.
We're a little later,
but anyway,

302
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:20.190
but it helped really increase the sales and they sold like 4 million copies of

303
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:24.690
that.
Uh,
so this other book,
the price of salt,

304
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.470
this was,
did you see the movie Carol that came out a couple of years ago?

305
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:32.040
This was the movie,
um,
with Cate Blanchett,
I guess.

306
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:35.190
And this was the movie that they wrote it about.

307
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.270
And that one has sort of had a happy ending where the women got to stay
together.

308
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:44.100
She lost her child,
but
it wasn't all rosy.

309
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.800
Anyway.
So during that same time was an underground gay bar culture.
And um,

310
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.980
I guess it's saying that gay men and lesbians were now seen as a group to cure,

311
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:54.570
convert and suppress.

312
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.930
So the American public started to get wind of this thing and they got,

313
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.930
they were getting really mad.
You can't be out in public.

314
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:05.900
And so they were rounding up people.
This is around the time of stonewall.
Um,

315
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.590
so these women here,
you know,

316
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:12.390
there was a very butch and femme culture and like you,
if,
if you,

317
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.290
you could get caught for not wearing three,
um,

318
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.390
things have the same three articles of clothing,

319
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:20.550
of the assigned gender that you are,
you could be thrown in jail.

320
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.930
So I'm not sure if I would be thrown in jail.
Hopefully not.
Um,

321
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.690
but they had a little signals,

322
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:31.200
like they'd flashed the lights and everyone would switch to the opposite sex

323
00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:33.840
partners so that they wouldn't be like thrown in the patty wagon.

324
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:37.650
But they were risking everything,
their jobs,
their lives,
their families,

325
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.180
just to be able to congregate.

326
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.400
Now at that same time was this thing called a couple of different secret

327
00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:47.460
societies,
daughters of Bilitis.
This is Phyllis line and del Martin.

328
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.060
And their thing was that they were kind of the intellectual set and they didn't

329
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:55.990
really want to be associated with like the working class voters FREMM scene.

330
00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.150
They wanted to be able to have a literary magazine they could send around.

331
00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:03.690
And so they send it in like a brown paper bag.
And,
um,

332
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.230
so people all over the country,
we're getting some culture now finally.

333
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.490
So now I'm gonna talk a little bit about my game changers in the book.

334
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.980
So the way I set this up was I chose women who,

335
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.220
uh,
are not famous in the world at large.

336
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:24.570
They're famous amongst the gay and lesbian community.
So we have authors,

337
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:28.710
business women,
promoters,
actors,
publishers,
entertainers,
lawyers,

338
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.770
everybody that I could gather together that was connected to me on some first or

339
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:35.290
second degree,
um,

340
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.790
that was willing to give me all these pieces I needed to pull this book
together.

341
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:42.900
So you don't see people like Ellen and Rosie O'donnell and stuff in here because

342
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:44.790
they're already famous.
But it's,

343
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:48.940
it's more like our heroes that actually created real changes to the culture for

344
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:53.470
the young people today to know about.
Um,
so this woman,
uh,

345
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.870
Monica Palacios,
she was named,
um,

346
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:02.130
they had Monaco Palacios stay for her 30 year career as that you kind of lesbian

347
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.610
a performer and writer.
This is Judy delegates.
Um,

348
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.450
the,
she,
um,
is the Olivia person,

349
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.320
so they started Olivia and 73 as a music company and then now it's like a

350
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:19.120
multimillion dollar corporation.
And,
um,
she's doing really well.
And,

351
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:22.900
and you know,
I've been on a lot of these trips and I always find it fascinating,

352
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.560
women from across the country that don't live in our bubble save up all year

353
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.160
long to be able to afford this one week to be able to hold their partner's hand

354
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:36.430
and be out for a week.
It's,
it's incredible.
I,
it's,

355
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.890
I always forget just how lucky we are here.
Um,

356
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.370
and this woman crystal Jang is really interesting.

357
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:47.410
Each person had a page also that had like a pullout card,
which I'll show you,

358
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.810
but crystal,
um,

359
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.250
she was born and raised in China town and as a young woman,

360
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.320
um,
in the 70s,

361
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.160
during that time the health department was sending people out to different

362
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:02.740
communities to talk about,
wow,

363
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:06.070
there's gay and lesbian people in the community and you need to address this.

364
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.690
And so when they got the Chinatown,
I guess the mayor of Chinatown Guy says,
look,

365
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:14.770
we don't have any gay people in Chinatown.
And so crystal,
um,

366
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.830
was just a young,
I think she was an educator.
She could lose her job.

367
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.810
She stood up and she said,
my name is Crystal Jang.

368
00:22:20.811 --> 00:22:24.130
My parents are Esther and homer Jang and I'm a lesbian.

369
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.490
And it just like brought the house down and people were crying and coming up to

370
00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:30.400
her.
And so she was the first one to like stand,

371
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.610
take a stand in the Chinese community and it's just so important.

372
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:38.350
She brought together the whole Asian community in one,
you know,

373
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.970
as a,
as a force in the gay and lesbian community within that.
And jewelle Gomez,

374
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:44.890
this is the fun fact cards that are in the book.

375
00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:48.280
They're like little baseball cards.
She's a playwright of uh,

376
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:53.220
she does lesbian vampire novels and,
um,
she does,
you know,
uh,

377
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.300
James Baldwin inspired plays.
She's fantastic.
Uh,
this is,

378
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.040
uh,
the Dyna.
Um,

379
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.840
this is Mariah Hansen and what people don't know so much about her.

380
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:08.050
I don't know if you know about the Dinah,
it's the largest lesbian event in the,

381
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.340
in the world,
I guess.
And um,

382
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.220
zillions of lesbians descend on Las Vegas.
Uh,
I mean,
uh,

383
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.820
palm springs once a year and she has discovered acts like Lady Gaga,

384
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.160
Katy Perry.
She's the first one to have them out.

385
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:26.770
And so that is really a big hotspot for culture.
Um,

386
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.630
Kate Kendall who win as the leader of Nclr,
she,

387
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.640
um,
they are the ones that that brought,
um,

388
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.610
gay marriage to be legal.
They're the ones that fought the fight.
Uh,

389
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.150
this is an interesting one.
This Diane Anderson.
Mitchell.

390
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:45.170
She's a woman I worked with years ago.
Um,

391
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.030
and she had a partner that Susie just kind of a average kind of quiet gow.

392
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.991
And then,
um,

393
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.760
over the years Susie transitioned to Jake and Jake is this swaggering handsome

394
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.630
dude now and they are still married all this time.
And then,
you know,

395
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:02.600
this interests me because it begs the question and she still lesbian.

396
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:05.960
Well she thinks she is.
I think she is.
So she belongs in there.

397
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.160
And this is Margaret Gomez who I got up,

398
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:14.210
I heard that this spit take thing became like the most famous meme on the

399
00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:16.520
Internet and my son and one of the video called me up.
Mommy,

400
00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:21.290
I keep seeing Marga on,
on video,
I mean on as a meme on online.

401
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.990
So she's managing to stay relevant.

402
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.000
She also has a show right now in Berkeley called,
um,

403
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.690
I forget the name but it's um,
it's really Latin standards.
Yeah,

404
00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:33.680
you should definitely go see that.

405
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:36.530
If you get a chance is playing there right now at the marsh.
It's fantastic.

406
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.600
She plays her dad and her mom.
And,
and this is Jenny Olson,

407
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:45.800
who is the person who started planet out,
I dunno if you know about that.

408
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:49.670
That was one of the very first websites that meant so much to all of us that are

409
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:50.710
a little older.
Um,

410
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:55.240
it was the first place where you could have a hub of all things gay.
And,
uh,

411
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.870
my mom takes a look at this and says,
is that a man?
Then I say,
no,

412
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:04.710
that's Jenny.
And she's cute.
Okay.
So what's next for game changers?
Um,

413
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:10.280
well,
I'm hoping to get it in to 267 more schools,

414
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.270
which would serve an additional 22 over 200,000 students.
And that,

415
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.100
that means every county in the barrier,

416
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.750
every public high school would get a book and we put it,
I,
you know,

417
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:24.710
I put it in the wellness centers and the libraries I've heard from the wellness

418
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:26.720
center people in,
in my hometown,

419
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.290
how much it means to those kids to just walk in and like see that on the table.

420
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.240
Because that's who's typically going into the wellness center.

421
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.550
Someone who's being bullied or feeling a little awkward,

422
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:38.780
and if they can just pick this up and have it not be a big deal,
it's huge.

423
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.540
Um,
and this is why it's so important because it's not just the gay kids that are

424
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:48.560
going to benefit.
It's the straight kids.
It's like,
Gosh,
I don't know.

425
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:51.980
When I was little,
we didn't have like a poster of,
um,

426
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.590
we didn't have black history month.

427
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.710
We didn't have Martin Luther King and every classroom,
but now they have that.

428
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.950
So like I was picturing soon in a few years,

429
00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:03.470
they'll probably have a picture of Harvey milk and every classroom a poster and

430
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:06.410
that's all great.
But like,
I want to make sure the lesbians are included.

431
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.640
That did great things because women are always left out of stuff.

432
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:14.510
And like the history history is always about the context with which you tell it.

433
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.700
So now,
oh,
we lost it,
ted.
Uh,

434
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.750
so the reasons that it's so great obviously is reduces bullying,

435
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.210
increases visibility and fosters pride and dignity.

436
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:29.660
Like that girl who just was so touched that I brought it in.
It just,

437
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.120
it's so important for people to see themselves.

438
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.160
Otherwise you just feel invisible.

439
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.290
So I'm just asking you guys to help spread the word today and I have a signup

440
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:43.980
sheet over there if you want to keep in touch.
No.
Hello.

441
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.870
Did you see any challenges?
Describe the books.

442
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.240
She asked if,
if we,
okay.
She asked if we,

443
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:58.740
if I face any challenges when trying to distribute the books and yes.
Um,

444
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:03.510
I got a couple of books mailed back and then,
but mostly no,

445
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:07.710
everyone was thrilled to get it and I,
I either mailed it or personally sent,
uh,

446
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.700
walked into these schools and gave it to him and I got all the right names from

447
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.400
some educator friends.
So it was going to the right people.

448
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.273
<v 3>Hi,</v>

449
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.400
<v 1>this isn't about your book,</v>

450
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:28.401
but your experience of the challenge of parenting in those situations.

451
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:33.591
And do you have any advice on handling those situations where you have other

452
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:39.111
parents that are not as open minded and well that's a really good question.

453
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:45.280
And how you've navigated that overtime at,
well,

454
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.770
I can only think of an anecdote that's pretty funny.

455
00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:50.990
When my partner and I first moved to Marin,

456
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.290
some parents said to me,
Oh,

457
00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:56.260
we always wanted a lesbian couple in our circle of friends.

458
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.410
We were like,
wow,
that's,
that's exciting.
Oh

459
00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.950
yeah.
I don't know.
I mean I guess I just,
um,
you know,
my son is actually,

460
00:28:08.951 --> 00:28:13.210
my older son is a real big advocate for that hip.
He'll say,
he'll just say,
oh,

461
00:28:13.211 --> 00:28:16.900
so you're against it.
I mean like you think if I got hurt,

462
00:28:16.901 --> 00:28:19.900
my mom shouldn't be able to pick me up from the hospital.
Like,

463
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.590
like just point out real facts about the discrimination and

464
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.350
I don't know,
it's a hard one.
It's very personal.
I guess.

465
00:28:29.351 --> 00:28:34.150
I tried to steer clear of it as much as I could and give my kid the tools to

466
00:28:34.151 --> 00:28:39.151
just be proud of himself by surrounding him by a positive environment and being

467
00:28:40.991 --> 00:28:43.810
proud.
Like I,
I'm really proud that both my kids are feminists.

468
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.110
Like they just really get it about the discrimination and they see,

469
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.790
they consider themselves queer.
They're both straight,
but they,
um,

470
00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.300
they know they were raised by two women and that has changed and that has made

471
00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:57.910
them better.
Men,
I was thinking,
Oh God,

472
00:28:57.911 --> 00:29:01.210
you're bringing two little white boys into the world and you know,

473
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.010
at least they've got this thing that makes them understand that,
you know,

474
00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:08.380
it's not the same level playing field for all of us.

475
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.020
It's really important to know that.

476
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.993
<v 3>Anything else?</v>

477
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.180
Oh sorry

478
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.770
<v 1>you had another question.
I did
keep it going.
I'm dominating this.</v>

479
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.380
Okay.
It's okay.
Um,
do you uh,

480
00:29:27.381 --> 00:29:31.610
do you have any recommendations for us if we want to approach schools as well to

481
00:29:31.611 --> 00:29:36.080
help distribute your book?
Well,
you could contact me afterwards.

482
00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:38.000
I would love,
I would love some help with that.

483
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.550
Especially when it comes to delivering it down here.

484
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.760
I've for a couple of grants and I'm also looking for people to step up and help.

485
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.520
So anyway,

486
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.770
you can help if it could be distributing and something like that would be

487
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:51.604
fantastic.

488
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.160
Or giving me the right people and yeah.

489
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.010
So you could sign up over here and I'll be sure to be in touch.

490
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.400
I did have somebody pinged me with a question,
which is,
first of all,

491
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.540
thank you for being here.

492
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:08.230
It's such an important publication and for documenting our history.

493
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.730
What are your thoughts on how millennials tend to identify more as queer that

494
00:30:12.731 --> 00:30:17.290
the word lesbian could be fading from our lexicon?
Oh,
that's a great question.
Um,

495
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.960
I will say that when I came out and the women around my age,

496
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:27.610
we didn't have a choice.
It wasn't a choice of some version of queer.

497
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:31.180
It was,
it was you're a lesbian or you're not,
you like women or not.

498
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.480
And if we were going to choose that the harder way,
you know,

499
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.130
then we were going to claim it.

500
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:41.131
And so now that it's become kind of an on PC word to use in general for the

501
00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:45.730
youth,
um,
I just have to question it.

502
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.490
I got a lot of 'em actually flack.
I got people emailing me saying,

503
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:54.880
do you have to use that ugly word?
Can't you just say queer?
Uh,
and I was like,
no,

504
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:58.090
cause it's about the lesbians.
I mean that's the whole point.
But um,

505
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.410
it's an interesting part of history.
And it will fade and it is fading and,

506
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.310
and that's okay.
It's just,
um,

507
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.950
it's important to at least understand why it was there,

508
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:11.250
what happened and why we have the freedoms that we have today to choose some

509
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:16.390
version of,
of gay,
queer,
whatever fluid.

510
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.630
Yes.
My experience growing up in Toronto,

511
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:22.360
when I started to try and tell people,

512
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.210
I found it hard to sell as a lesbian.
And I would say,
you know,

513
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.300
um,
so I would say I'm gay.

514
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.050
Like there's something about the stigma of,

515
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.710
of saying you're a lesbian and it started from the beginning.
Good point.

516
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:43.150
So almost in a way,
we're still not comfortable saying we're lesbians,
right?

517
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:45.820
It's a,
it's a misogynistic thought.
If you really think through,

518
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.190
why is it so uncomfortable to talk about the woman part of the gay thing and

519
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:53.500
identify as strictly as that and,
and when,

520
00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:58.370
when the word gay is such a happy word,
and lesbians like,
Oh yeah,

521
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.740
thank you so much.
I really resonate with that.
And yeah,
it's,
it's,

522
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.960
it's so interesting how there's a,
there's that little hurdle about lesbian.

523
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.200
So I you started asking what we were going to come to Halloween as and I figured

524
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:17.050
it out.
I'm going to come as,
as a lesbian.
You should know.

525
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.090
And I wondered if you had any thoughts about what my costume should look like.

526
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.090
I dressed as a lesbian once for Halloween.

527
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:30.110
I wore a very misshapen pillow here and then a big old fanny pack and a mullet.

528
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.640
This was years ago.
I can't believe I did that.
But that's different than lesbian,

529
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:39.440
you should know,
right?
Of course.
Um hmm.

530
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:45.790
Maybe Bertrand style where you could hit your chain was in a friend way where

531
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:50.810
she played,
she,
there was a play called all these different Gertrude's and chain.

532
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.660
Literally cut her hair for the part that night.
I gave him a deal.

533
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.030
Worst haircut I've ever seen.
Fringe.
Okay.
That's a deal breaker.

534
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.520
I'm going as Amelia Earhart.
Oh,
nice.
Well,

535
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:09.280
we don't know about her.
No,
we'd have to wonder.
There's some letters.
Is there.
Oh,

536
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.320
nice.

537
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.520
<v 4>There was a man that was an African American for a really long time.</v>

538
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.400
And she finally,
she kept saying,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
And then,

539
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.190
and there's all these letters back and forth about it,
and she finally said,

540
00:33:20.191 --> 00:33:24.960
at some point,
she's like,
listen,
we all know that I'm not interested in this,

541
00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:28.170
but I can't take the pressure of expectation anymore.

542
00:33:28.171 --> 00:33:30.300
So if we're going to do this,

543
00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.320
you have to understand that I'm going to go do my own separate thing.

544
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:39.120
And then she was in a horrible,
plaintiff didn't have to ever marry anybody.
Wow.

545
00:33:39.121 --> 00:33:43.000
I wonder if that was rigged.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Any other question?
Questions?

546
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.820
<v 1>All right.
Or thoughts?
Let's thank Robin for coming today.
Thanks.</v>
