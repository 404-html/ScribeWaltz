Jessica is an award winning journalist and critic who writes on gender,

2
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.560
sexuality,
and Culture for the New York Times.

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.960
She's covered sexual assaults on campus,

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.800
spent time with Hillary Clinton's childhood friends and was the first journalist

5
00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.750
to profile Monica Lewinsky and a decade.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.580
She also writes a regular column on digital language.
Jessica's first book,

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.690
Feminist Fight Club,

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.400
a survival manual for sexist workplace has been hailed as the millennial lean in

9
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:34.000
by the New York Times and a must read by the Guardian and yes,

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.890
she's in a real life fight club.
We're going to get started with a quick video

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

12
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.200
<v 0>I'm glad that you brought up millennials.</v>

13
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.470
Our total marketing reach with millennials has gotten out about 60% of our

14
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:08.090
overall website visits have also been up about 17% the way that we can actually

15
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:11.390
change things.
Focus.
You guys read that email?

16
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.110
I think that our primary here,

17
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.850
our total market now range grew by 50% overall website.

18
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.120
Any five
which is really awkward

19
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.090
getting reach up by 16% last year.
The point Amanda,

20
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.400
thank you.
Whew.

21
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.333
<v 2>Huh.</v>

22
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.060
<v 0>You know that our goals for Q four are about the roadmap and the diversity and</v>

23
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:04.360
the progress of our company,
our company.
If it's about anything,

24
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.820
we really represent hashtag progress.
It's really where we draw our core values.

25
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.000
Brittany,
do you mind taking notes on this?
So we,
so we get everything.

26
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.863
We get everything down.

27
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.160
<v 5>Oh,</v>

28
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.160
<v 0>you know,
it was really great at taking notes.
Is Is Josh?
Wait,</v>

29
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.960
what?
Fake telogy.

30
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.140
Hey Pj,
we did you talk about the quarterly sales report.

31
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.860
Your team is down about 60% from last quarter.
Yeah,
just

32
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.760
<v 6>guys,
guys</v>

33
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.970
<v 0>nailed right in the balls from that was hilarious.
So Bj,
this is a huge deal.</v>

34
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:01.570
I have to take this as CEO.
You understand?
Like what?
It's like,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,

35
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.530
whoa.
You need to chill acts a little bit.
If freaking us out,

36
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.150
you're acting kind of insane.

37
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.640
I think it's that time of the month is that time of the month.

38
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.263
If

39
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.550
you're talking about the time of the month when I do your performance review,

40
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.410
then you're right and you're screwed.

41
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.253
<v 2>Sure.</v>

42
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.963
<v 3>Okay.</v>

43
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

44
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.773
<v 3>Okay.</v>

45
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.020
<v 0>Hey guys,
this is Stephanie.
She's the newest member of our team.
Hi.</v>

46
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.710
Nice to meet you.
Got a lot of this check.

47
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.390
What is this woman staring at?
It's like the Ann Taylor didn't try.

48
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.080
What is her problem?
I'm a female on the team.
You're placing me.

49
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.860
You should be threatened by me.
I love her suit.
Just can I have eyebrows?

50
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.073
<v 4>Right.</v>

51
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.203
<v 3>Cool.</v>

52
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.760
<v 0>Hi,
I'm Stephanie.
Nice to meet you.</v>

53
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.490
Nice to meet you.
I can kind of be a sausage fest in here,

54
00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:22.580
so I'm really happy to have another woman in the room.
Thanks.

55
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.643
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.360
Yes,
feminism.

57
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.503
<v 1>That's fucking hard.</v>

58
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.430
Can you give us a backstory on what led you to write feminist fight club and

59
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.900
also how you came up with all the amazing nomenclature in the book?

60
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.620
I really like puns.
Um,
as you will see,
um,

61
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.900
so as Melissa mentioned in my very long,

62
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.230
maybe two long bio,
uh,

63
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.170
I'm in a real life feminist fight club and a number of the women are,

64
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.040
are in the video,
but it's essentially a group of creatives.

65
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.090
We are journalists and writers and comics.

66
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.660
And we began meeting about a decade ago when we were just starting our careers.

67
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.950
We're all in New York City and most of us were in very white male dominated

68
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:49.090
fields and we were struggling.
We were frustrated.

69
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.270
We didn't know what we could be doing better to get ahead.

70
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.630
We often questioned whether what we were experiencing was actually sexism or

71
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.350
something more individual or personal.

72
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.710
And so we would gather about once a month in one of our members parents houses

73
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.850
because we couldn't put that many people in any of our tiny studio apartments

74
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.010
and we would just talk about what was going on for us at work and try to provide

75
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:20.990
support and offer each other advice on how we might try it to combat some of the

76
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:21.824
issues.

77
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.420
So the feminist fight club was real and back then the first rule of the fight

78
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:30.320
club was like in real fight club that you didn't talk about the club.

79
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.450
And that was funny,
but also for real reasons,

80
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:38.420
which were that a lot of the women in the group who were working at media

81
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:43.220
outlets and different organizations did fear that if word got out,

82
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.910
that they were in what was essentially a feminist consciousness raising group,

83
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.360
they would be either stigmatized or potentially penalized.

84
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.430
And so we didn't talk about the club,
but lo and behold,
here I am.

85
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:57.200
So the rules have changed.

86
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.890
And now the first rule of fight club is you must talk about the fight club.

87
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.290
Love it.
So at the beginning of the book,
you,

88
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.140
you kind of admit that the tone of the book is really light and you know,

89
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.980
it's very friendly and casual.
There are a lot of swear words.
Um,

90
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.610
so I'm just wondering,
you know,

91
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.690
and that's not to say that it's lacking in data or substance or seriousness of

92
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:21.200
subject.
So why did you decide to write in this tone?
Yeah,
I mean,

93
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:22.910
on the one hand it sort of is my tone.

94
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.490
Like I can't speak without swearing apparently.
Um,

95
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.810
and as a journalist,
I've sort of come up on the Internet.

96
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:34.490
So I wanted to speak to young people in their language,

97
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.840
which is also my language.

98
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.870
And I felt like I had been working on and writing about these issues for number

99
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:45.230
of years,
but I often was focused on the problem,

100
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.110
not on the solution.
And you know,

101
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.540
throughout my work with lean in and other outlets,

102
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.220
I always end up reading all of these academic studies that buried somewhere in

103
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:55.670
the,
you know,

104
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.670
page 19 there's like some little fight move or solution for how to combat a

105
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:05.720
mantra Reptar or a mansplainer,
but it's not used in that language.

106
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.460
And so I kept thinking to myself like,

107
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.240
if there was some way to just pull this stuff out and put it into a format that

108
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:15.530
was fun to read and they just double but also really practical and rooted in

109
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:18.950
research,
then it would provide a service that frankly,

110
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.220
I wish I had when I was starting my career.
And so,
you know,

111
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.250
I hope that there's something in this book for everyone,

112
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:28.670
but I want it to speak in a language that was light and you know,

113
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.480
sexism is not a fun topic,
but it can be fun to read about.

114
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.880
So I'm speaking about those tactics.

115
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:38.950
Those are sort of more of those individual or personal tactics,
um,

116
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.510
versus policy or institutional changes.

117
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:45.620
Why did you decide to focus on those individual level tactics?
Yeah,

118
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:50.060
I mean I think that ultimately like dealing with gender equity needs to come

119
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:52.370
from every level.
So it needs to happen on a,

120
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:57.371
a policy standpoint though currently in our leadership in this country,

121
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:59.670
I'm not very optimistic that that's going to happen.

122
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.000
It needs to come from a business and a company standpoint.

123
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.300
But I also think that I have felt in my career for many years that I was

124
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:13.341
frustrated and I didn't want to wait around for like HR policies or legal

125
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:18.300
policies or you know,
politics to solve these problems for me.

126
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:23.301
Not to mention that a lot of the forms of sexism we face today can't actually be

127
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:27.300
prosecuted in court or legalized for.

128
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.940
So what do you do?
Well,

129
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.290
there are actually ways that we can fight back against some of this stuff in our

130
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.620
everyday lives.
And it doesn't have to feel overwhelming.

131
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.480
Some of these are small things,

132
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.220
but we can do it on behalf of ourselves and we can do it on behalf of our fellow

133
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:45.054
women.

134
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.120
And so I wanted something that felt like I had agency that would allow me to

135
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:54.900
engage and try to work towards a larger,

136
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.800
more equal world and more equal workplace that I could do every day.

137
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.460
And so I certainly recognize the need for policy change and change from a

138
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:05.311
corporate level.

139
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:09.990
But like if you feel overwhelmed in your daily environment and you're constantly

140
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:13.530
being interrupted when you speak,
like there are things you can do to solve that.

141
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.580
So I want to talk a little bit more about those forms of sexism that you talk

142
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:18.540
about a lot in the book.

143
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.770
You call it death by a thousand cuts type of sexism.
Um,

144
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.210
it's the insidious casual,
politically correct,

145
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.860
even friendly sexism or racism that people experience.

146
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.250
Um,
and that is in contrast with an overt,

147
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:39.450
clear cut discrimination.
Like you said,
that has a legal definition.

148
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.540
So why is this kind of subtle sexism so much harder to report,

149
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.840
so much harder to fix and so much easier to dismiss?

150
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.430
I think because often we've internalized it and a lot of ways,

151
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:57.330
I know this is silicon valley,
we talk about unconscious bias a lot here.

152
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:01.170
I probably don't need to define that for the people in this room,
but you know,

153
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:06.171
once upon a time sexism was very overt and so I began my career at Newsweek as a

154
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:11.451
young writer and while I was there I started facing things like pitching an idea

155
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.040
and having it be turned down and then seeing it appear on the pages of the

156
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:22.041
magazine under a man's byline a few weeks later or feeling uncomfortable

157
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:27.411
speaking up in very white male dominated meetings or feeling like if I

158
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:33.381
negotiated for more money after finding out that a man with the same job title

159
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:37.800
and description was making thousands of dollars more than me,

160
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.240
that I would be perceived as pushy for wanting too much.

161
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.380
So it's the subtle things.
Whereas the generation prior,
while it wasn't Newsweek,

162
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.760
I found out about the women who had actually sued that company for gender

163
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:53.800
discrimination in the year 1970.
Um,

164
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.250
there's an Amazon series now about these women called the good girls revolt.

165
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.050
But at the time,

166
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.440
this was the first case of its kind and women who worked at Newsweek were told,

167
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.070
yes,
you will be hired,

168
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:09.610
you can do all of the job duties that a man can but you're not allowed to write.

169
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.890
We don't allow women to have fine lines.

170
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400
And so at the end of the day they would hand over their notes and probably a cup

171
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:22.741
of coffee as well to a man who would get the credit and they sued and they were

172
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:27.100
able to sue because it was clear that this was discrimination.

173
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:31.120
They were saying outwardly that women are not allowed to right here and men are.

174
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.950
And so this prompted lawsuits at the New York Times and Time magazine and sports

175
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:39.610
illustrated like these women paved the way for female journalists.

176
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.160
And yet 40 years later here I was,
I was a writer.
I had the title to prove it.

177
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:50.380
And yet I was still facing some of these subtle things on a daily basis that

178
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.210
frankly,
like HR policies can't really solve for.

179
00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.240
Like if you're the default note taker in a meeting or you're constantly being

180
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:04.450
interrupted or you're perceived as bitchy or Bossy,

181
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.670
when you make a command,

182
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.420
when that is what is expected ultimately of leaders,

183
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.560
what's HR going to do about it?
You know,
like the,

184
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.880
some of this stuff is internalized and for what it's worth,

185
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:19.630
it's not just internalized sexism that men possess.

186
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:23.990
It's women as well.
Yup.
You include a ton of data in,

187
00:13:23.991 --> 00:13:28.960
in the book to back up the type of the type of sexism and discrimination that

188
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:29.794
you talk about.

189
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.570
So what sort of practical advice would you give to someone who wants to start

190
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:38.720
sharing this type of data with their teams?
Um,
to,
you know,

191
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.300
educate and empower them with,

192
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.190
with what we have after reading the book without coming off,
you know,

193
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.680
in that way.
Yeah,
totally.

194
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.520
Which will just point out like it sucks that we have to worry about that and we

195
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:56.200
shouldn't have to.
I'm so lucky for you.
There is a book,
um,

196
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.580
it's for sale on the back and you can just like leave it underneath bosses
doors,

197
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.330
put one in the ladies room who won in the men's room,
like whatever.

198
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.660
You can tear pages out of it,
like do your thing.
Um,

199
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.730
and then you can blame it on me.
So it doesn't have to view no,

200
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:17.731
but actually there is research showing that if you can present an idea on behalf

201
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:20.080
of the group rather than on behalf of yourself,

202
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.350
it's more likely to be accepted or taken in a way that you know,

203
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.790
doesn't make leave you feeling like you're being too demanding.

204
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.790
So I literally to help people to like print out studies and bring them up in

205
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.200
whatever the scenario is.
So okay.

206
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.790
Women are actually more likely to be interrupted than men twice as likely and

207
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:41.470
more so if they're a woman of color.

208
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.680
Obviously in workplaces where meetings are such a huge part of it and ideas are

209
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:50.200
such a huge part of it,
if you're being interrupted every time you speak,

210
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.530
you're not contributing ideas and you're not ultimately getting credit.
So,
okay.

211
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:56.300
How do you stop that?
Well,

212
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.300
you can like tell someone to shut up when they interrupt you.

213
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.750
I can tell someone that I want to hear what you have to say when you're being

214
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.770
interrupted so that it doesn't make you look like the bad guy,
bad guy.

215
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.480
I guess guys agender turn the bad Carson.
Um,

216
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.830
but also if you want it to casually bring up that women,

217
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:19.490
in fact data shows are twice as likely to be interrupted as men.

218
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.430
Like there's a study you can print out and there's a footnote in the back of the

219
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:23.870
book to do that.

220
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.640
And then it's putting it on data and research not on you being like too

221
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:30.130
emotional,
um,

222
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.040
or touchy and offended by a certain behavior.

223
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:37.220
So I say like whenever you can blame something on the data,

224
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:39.190
it's actually really effective.
And,

225
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.020
and part of the reason why the book is so reliant on it,

226
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.710
in addition to me not liking to just give personal advice cause I'm a journalist

227
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.090
and I'm trained to not do that.

228
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:52.420
But it means that you can always refer back to like a Harvard business review

229
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:55.310
study that can't be argued with.

230
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.640
Like these are all things we should do because they're the right thing to do.

231
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.390
But it can be hard to tell people that this is the right thing to do.

232
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.260
So you can tell them that they should do it because it's actually better for

233
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:11.120
business.
And companies with more gender equality have higher returns,

234
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:13.430
there are more profitable,
more collaborative.

235
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.660
And so there's all of these really datadriven reasons why it makes sense.

236
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.180
So in one of your previous comments,

237
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:25.181
you mentioned unconscious bias and unconscious bias training has seemingly taken

238
00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:29.720
over silicon valley.
Can you share some of your thoughts on,

239
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.400
on implicit bias and what it means to,
um,
a,

240
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:38.660
become aware of it and B,
you know,
go through a training program to address it.

241
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.810
Yeah.
And so for what it's worth,
I did the,

242
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.230
I think it was MIT has an implicit bias test where you can take it and see if

243
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:49.580
you're bias and I,
yes,
I too am biased.

244
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.890
So I think it's very important to talk about this.
And the fact that,
you know,

245
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.500
implicit bias is a word that's being tossed around now.

246
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.910
And people know what it means.
It allows us to recognize that we all have it.

247
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.320
And I think that recognizing that we all have it is the first step toward

248
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.200
overcoming it.

249
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.030
I think that some of the problems with some of these training programs is that

250
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:13.610
they don't necessarily offer solutions.

251
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.870
And so I think while the first step in the very important step is recognizing

252
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:22.610
that we have bias and being able to notice it or check forward in the moment,

253
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.820
we have to also think about changing our behavior.

254
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.190
And so in the moment when you notice it,
like what can you do to stop yourself?

255
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:36.050
Or how can you point out when someone else is exhibiting bias?
Um,

256
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.300
and,
and for what it's worth,
you know,

257
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:43.301
I was in a meeting recently and a man and a woman walked in and I caught myself

258
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.640
in a moment of,
of bias,
assuming that the woman,
the assistant to the man,

259
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.690
and in fact,
she was his boss.
And this is like,
I wrote a whole book about this.

260
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:56.550
I talk about these issues all the time,

261
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.570
but it's like our brain takes these cognitive shortcuts that we have

262
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:01.620
internalized over.

263
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:05.220
I mean literally thousands and thousands of years of us being taught that it is

264
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:08.400
white men in charge and women who are supporting that.

265
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.170
And so I feel like if I have it like at,
we all haven't.

266
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.300
And so I think it's really important to talk about it.

267
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:17.910
And I think that there is no downside to these training programs.

268
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:21.630
But I also think that like,
especially here in Silicon Valley,

269
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.450
the idea of diversity and inclusion and bias trainings,

270
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.320
these are like words that are tossed around a lot and we can't just talk about

271
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:34.710
them.
We need to also have action associated.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

272
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.940
Because only talking about them and learning about them tends to normalize them

273
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:44.070
and then no,
you know,
nothing gets done as a result.
Um,

274
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.480
so,
uh,
on the cover you,
there's an asterisk note for men.

275
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.090
So what is your message for men?

276
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.150
So for those that don't have the cover in front of them,

277
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.310
there's a little ass stuck right here.

278
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:59.220
And then it says book is 21% more expensive for men.

279
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.660
It's not really,
that would be illegal.

280
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.370
And actually it should not be 20% because we gained a penny.
Yay.

281
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.780
Um,
no,

282
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.400
my message is for men is ultimately that we need you and we cannot fight for

283
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:22.020
equality without men by our side.
They are so important to this battle.

284
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.270
And yet I try to use humor as a way into some of these issues.

285
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.570
And so the 21% supposed to be joke,
ha ha.
Um,
and,

286
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.220
and in fact I've seen it be effective in the sense that I,

287
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.570
I've seen men perusing the book and then seeing that Astrick and,

288
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.120
and sort of chuckling and then opening it up.
So hopefully that's a way in.

289
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.150
And I try to use humor as a way to talk about really tricky issues.

290
00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:50.910
You know,
this stuff is hard and sometimes it's really uncomfortable.

291
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.180
And I think that sometimes men understandably feel uncomfortable engaging on

292
00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:58.830
these topics or knowing how to be an ally.

293
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:04.200
And so I think it's so important to include them in the conversation and,

294
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.290
and you know,
let them know,
and not just men,
but women too,

295
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:09.660
that we are actually going to screw up sometimes.

296
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:12.900
Like we're not going to be perfect talking about this stuff all the time,

297
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.470
but like with a commitment to be better,

298
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.130
then we can screw up and correct for it.
And at the end of the day,

299
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:22.020
like men are half the population,

300
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.110
we cannot achieve it quality without their support.
Absolutely.

301
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.150
So speaking on the topic of inclusion,

302
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:32.330
I want to talk a little bit about intersectionality and just sort of get your,

303
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.520
your view on intersectionality and how it maybe has changed or evolved,

304
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:40.680
especially in our current climate.
Yeah.

305
00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:45.681
So intersectionality for those who don't know the concept that feminism must be

306
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:48.790
interest sectional,
it must also look at the cross section,

307
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:52.420
the intersection of race,
of class,
of gender,

308
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:54.040
identity of sexuality,

309
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.840
and that really feminism is not feminism if it's not intersectional.

310
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.490
And that's certainly my belief.

311
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:03.520
This stuff needs to be incorporated and we need to be thinking about it all the

312
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:08.230
time.
I think that traditionally the mainstream women's movement,

313
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:12.070
at least the public part that you learn about in history books or you read about

314
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:12.904
in the press,

315
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.560
has not done a great job of taking intersectionality into account.

316
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:22.561
Like primarily the 1970s movement of Women's liberation was white.

317
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.690
And there were all sorts of really amazing subgroups,

318
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.210
women of color that were also rising up,

319
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:29.950
but they just weren't talked about as much.

320
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.250
So I do think that right now what we're seeing is a much more intersectional

321
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:40.210
view of all of this.
Like this is something that we're talking about regularly,

322
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.390
mainstream publications that,
you know,

323
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:47.490
don't assume any knowledge of feminism are using that word intersectionality.

324
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.170
The New York Times recently did it,
which was like a great thing for them,

325
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:51.370
I think.
Um,

326
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.530
and it's also important that some of the new emerging leaders we're seeing

327
00:21:56.531 --> 00:21:57.460
talking about this,

328
00:21:57.461 --> 00:22:01.840
the women of the women's march are of every race.

329
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.100
And so I think that it's so important because I think that ultimately like you

330
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:09.100
can't be a feminist if you don't also care about these issues.

331
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:13.660
Like feminism is intersectional.
So I want to talk about,
um,
one of the,

332
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.230
one of the pitfalls that,
that you mentioned in the book that really affects me.

333
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.070
Um,

334
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:23.070
so I can say I am an ever faithful and that means that I want to believe that

335
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.740
everything is fair,
that career and the workplace is a meritocracy.

336
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.720
So what advice would you give for people like me who still want to believe in

337
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:38.620
America,
meritocracy and behave as if we,
you know,

338
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.490
exist in one,
despite all the research that disproves that?
Um,

339
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.920
I would say that loyalty does not pay the bills.
Um,

340
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.920
and I think that as women,

341
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.450
we too often put our heads down and do good work and expect to be recognized for

342
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:57.790
it.
And that's not our fault.
Like,

343
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.870
typically it is harder for women to self promote and call attention to the good

344
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:03.850
work that they're doing.
Because when we do,

345
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:07.360
we're perceived as too braggy or we're just liked for it.

346
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:12.070
And so we sort of internalize these structures that have told us over,

347
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.600
you know,
years and years and years that we're supposed to be modest.
And so yes,

348
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:20.440
I would like to believe it's Ameritocracy too.
But I think that,
uh,

349
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:21.820
I'm too cynical for that.

350
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.480
And so any moment you can take to call attention to your accomplishments is not

351
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:32.110
a bad thing.
And if you feel uncomfortable doing it and list someone else.

352
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:35.020
There's a term I have and the book called Boast Bitch.

353
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.360
And this is a person who brags on your behalf and there's a real reason for
this.

354
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:43.300
It's because women are disliked when they brag about themselves.

355
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:46.430
But of course like we're working in office environments.

356
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:50.420
We need to draw attention to the work that we do.
So like you and I are both,

357
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:54.350
but just we have an unspoken or spoken agreement I bust for you.

358
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.110
You boast for me.
Like every time you do something great,

359
00:23:57.111 --> 00:24:02.111
I s I send an email to our entire team and cc you on it and then you can look

360
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.400
completely humble.

361
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.620
I'm going to look like a great colleague and everyone gets credit.
So,

362
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.970
you know,
meritocracy,
like yes,
it would be great if that existed,

363
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.880
but I think that the numbers show us.
Otherwise,

364
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.300
I think we need to create a marketplace at Google for boast bitches.

365
00:24:20.301 --> 00:24:23.930
You can sign up to be one or if people are uncomfortable with the word bitch,

366
00:24:23.931 --> 00:24:26.150
you can call it like a boast bay,
whatever.

367
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.510
And for what it's worth in the sense that,

368
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:33.740
I mean most of which can be a man or a woman like and anyone can be a bust,

369
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:37.270
which is just someone who has your back.
Awesome.
Um,

370
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.730
another of the chapters that I thought was really powerful was the one on

371
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:44.730
negotiation and I especially loved the piece of advice is to,

372
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.130
to view your ask in shades of gray,
not black and white.
Um,

373
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:54.080
can you share your point of view on negotiation and how women and men approach

374
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:57.590
negotiation differently and therefore get different results?

375
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.450
There's a lot of research around the issue of negotiation and what the newer

376
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:07.451
research is finding is that women who do negate negotiate are often viewed as

377
00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:11.810
aggressive or pushy and it makes them less likely to actually get the raise.

378
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.140
So all right,
like,
well,
how are you supposed to overcome that?

379
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.250
Like there's no real solution to that other than like keep asking and it will

380
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:24.020
become normalized and then we won't view a woman who asks us pushy or
aggressive.

381
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:29.210
But in addition to that,
women are often less likely to ask.

382
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.830
And so I know that in when I was starting my career,
I never,
I never asked,

383
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:37.250
I would've felt so incredibly lucky to have a job.

384
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.060
This was when I was at Newsweek,
um,
in the early two thousands,

385
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:43.490
and like journalism was imploding everywhere.

386
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:47.930
So I was in a way lucky to be employed,
but it caused me to,

387
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.370
to not ask.
And it wasn't until I realized as this other guy who I worked with,

388
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.330
with the same title was making many thousands of dollars more than me,

389
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.810
that I was like,
okay,
I have to go in and ask.
And,

390
00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.440
and so what I did is I tried to be very data driven about it.

391
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.440
Like I didn't want to go in and tell them that I felt I deserved it or that I

392
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:11.330
needed to pay off my student loans.

393
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.530
I want it to come in with a list of statistics about the work that I'd done.

394
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:20.240
So like I added up every possible conceivable statistic you could find in a

395
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:24.260
field like journalism where there's not really metrics but to things like page

396
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:27.270
views on articles,
number of articles written,
um,

397
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.000
perceived value of like press hits that I'd done on television.
Um,

398
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.850
what else?
Like anything else I could find.

399
00:26:34.851 --> 00:26:38.220
And I in fact then wrote it up like a buzzfeed listicle,
top 10 lists,

400
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.420
like why you should give Jessica vented arrays.
Um,

401
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:46.810
and I went in and I tried to express this and naturally I was like stuttering

402
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:49.620
and stumbling over my words.
And bright red,

403
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:51.510
but then I followed up with the email.

404
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.260
So I think it's important to be really data focused and data driven.

405
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:59.430
I think it's important to know that women do struggle with this and they're

406
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:01.320
often penalized more so than men.

407
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.650
But truly the way that we're going to make this equal is by continuing to ask

408
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:08.560
and,

409
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.260
and I think that what companies can do as well as well as look at salary parody.

410
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:15.240
I think Google is doing something around this,

411
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:20.190
but comparing is there a gap in your company between men and women and if there

412
00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:24.360
is solving for it.
Yeah,
definitely.
That's great advice.
Thank you.

413
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.480
Um,
so the,

414
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:30.840
your feminist fight club is largely outside of work,
um,

415
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.060
but obviously made up of professional women,
but inside of the workplace,

416
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.950
um,
you know,
would you,
would you recommend a feminist fight club,
uh,

417
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:44.070
made up of,
of colleagues and,
yeah.
Um,

418
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.700
what do you think are some of the strengths and some of the limitations of that

419
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:50.370
sort of environment taking place at work?
Yeah,

420
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:54.540
I mean anyone can form a feminist fight club and there's a guide at the back of

421
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:58.090
the book on how to do so,
which basically is like do whatever you want.
Um,

422
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.750
and many people in fact have forms of feminist fight clubs like we called ours

423
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:07.020
that and we also had a top secret name that I cannot reveal.
Um,

424
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.000
but you know,

425
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.120
we thought it was important for our group to have a mix of women in creative

426
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:18.180
industries but not all in the same field because we wanted to have a diversity

427
00:28:18.181 --> 00:28:22.950
of voices.
And so we sort of hand picked based on that.

428
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.510
But a lot of it was also random.

429
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:29.511
Like I ended up there through a mentor whose daughter was in it and a lot of it

430
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.590
just came organically.

431
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.800
But I think the talking about these issues at work can be so important.

432
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.700
Like lean in circles are now in companies all over the world and I think it's

433
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:42.150
been really effective to talk about them with colleagues.

434
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.860
And so forming a feminist fight club.
Yeah.
Like basically by being here,

435
00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:50.910
you are all members of the feminist fight club.
Welcome,
lifelong membership.

436
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.120
There's no dues like you're in.
Um,

437
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.020
but you can also form smaller groups.
And I don't know,

438
00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:03.021
for me like having a group of women who I knew were unconditionally supportive

439
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.450
and I could always turn to if I had a problem,

440
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.780
has truly helped me grow in many ways throughout my career and even my personal

441
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:14.700
life.
And I think there's no downside to it.

442
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:16.680
I think that we need to help each other.

443
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.810
The third rule of the new feminist fight club is we fight patriarchy,

444
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:26.100
not each other.
So the idea of treating other women as allies,
not as enemies,

445
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:29.400
we don't need to be competitive.
We are more powerful together.

446
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.930
We can lift one another up.

447
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.820
One of the pieces or one of the chapters that contained a ton of great advice

448
00:29:35.821 --> 00:29:37.110
was what would Josh do?

449
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.620
And this was sort of advice to think like Josh,

450
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:45.280
who's a male colleague with Chutzpah,
meaning,
you know,

451
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.970
shameless audacity not to be confused with utter bullshit.

452
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.750
So I'm just wondering,
first of all,
how do you distinguish between those two?

453
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.270
Because I think,
you know,
I struggled with that chapter because you know,

454
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.770
some of the advice felt like would I be going against what is sort of natural to

455
00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:06.250
me and how much sort of do I need to work on that?

456
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.890
So yes,
the chapter's called WWJD Wa the other Jay.
Well with Josh,

457
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:15.940
do you carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man?

458
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.350
And Josh in fact is the real,
is harder than it sounds.

459
00:30:21.351 --> 00:30:24.430
It's not named Josh and he's a lovely individual and a good friend of mine.

460
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.830
But we used to share a wall at Newsweek.

461
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:30.520
We sat next to each other and so I got to sort of observe him in all scenarios.

462
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.770
And we had similar jobs except that like every time there was a meeting I would

463
00:30:35.771 --> 00:30:39.310
be like in my office with the door closed.
This was back when people had offices.

464
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.370
Um,
I'll never have an office again now I just work in my bed.

465
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.490
But I would be like,
you know,
studying up for a pitch meeting,

466
00:30:46.491 --> 00:30:51.340
like determined to have every fact,
right.
So nervous being so prepared.

467
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:54.580
And he would be like in his office with his feet up on the desk,

468
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.790
just like ready to go in and bullshit his way through.

469
00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:02.500
And in his case he was also very smart.
So his bullshit was educated bullshit.

470
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.950
But what the research shows is that actually we mistake sometimes confidence for

471
00:31:08.831 --> 00:31:09.890
competence,
right?

472
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:14.830
And so the way that he was delivering it with such confidence was almost as

473
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:16.990
effective as my really studied,

474
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.840
but unconfident pitches as well.

475
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:25.000
And so it allowed me to observe him.
And so throughout the chapter I advise,

476
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:25.541
you know,

477
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:30.541
asking yourself in various scenarios WWJD or ww MD,

478
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.990
what would a man do?

479
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.520
Not so that women can start mimicking bay male behavior,

480
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.090
but because we often underestimate ourselves.

481
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:45.120
And so I know that for me in a scenario where I was feeling nervous or wasn't

482
00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:50.710
sure how to go about something,
I would ask myself what would Josh do?

483
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.040
And then I would end up somewhere in the middle like,
Joshua do this.

484
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.580
I would naturally do this,
I would end up here.

485
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.400
And so often we underestimate ourselves or you know,

486
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.930
we have faced imposture syndrome where we don't feel like we deserve to be there

487
00:32:04.931 --> 00:32:05.681
or belong.

488
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:10.681
And so a little bragging like actually may get us to the point where we should

489
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:14.890
be,
where we're not underestimating our abilities in our accomplishments.

490
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.900
So yeah,
I,
I proudly carry myself with the confidence of a mediocre white.

491
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.150
I love it.
Um,
so last question.
You know,
you,

492
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.960
you sort of described yourself as a cynic,

493
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:30.990
but I'm holding out hope that you're still hopeful and so I'm wondering how,

494
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:35.710
how do you remain hopeful and humorous and encouraged when,

495
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.820
when,
you know,

496
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.880
digging into this research that's really sort of challenging to confront,
um,

497
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.460
and ran in what's happening in the world?
Yeah.
Um,
yes.
Uh,

498
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.310
so I try to have a sense of humor about it.
Like if I,

499
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.600
if I couldn't laugh about some of this stuff,
I think I would just be depressed.

500
00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.620
Yeah.
So I still try to find humor in some of these things.

501
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.640
Feminists in fact,
are really funny.
Um,
we do have senses of humor like that.

502
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.320
There's a joke,
how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?

503
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.590
And then it's like,
that's not funny.
But actually it is funny,
I think anyway,

504
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.410
like we laugh about this stuff.
It's serious.
Yes,
it's serious.

505
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.140
But we can laugh and I also find a lot of hope in the younger generation.
Yeah.

506
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.270
Like a lot of the women that I work with and,

507
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.440
and talk to you for stories and who helped me on feminist fight club,

508
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.280
social media,

509
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.990
our college women and college men and the way that they talk about and think

510
00:33:32.991 --> 00:33:37.250
about these issues is so much further along than I was at their age.

511
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:38.930
Like the way that they think about,

512
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:42.200
they approach this intersectionally and the hope that they have.

513
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:47.030
There's a study that came out recently about how Gen z and younger millennials

514
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:50.750
are actually much more hopeful than the rest of us.
So like,
you know,

515
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.740
look to the youth.
The kids are all right.
Um,
and,

516
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:59.210
and so I go to them whenever I needed a dose of bringing me up.
I love that.

517
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:03.470
Thank you.
So now I want to open it up to questions from the audience.

518
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.240
And Lizzie has a microphone.

519
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.320
<v 8>Um,
so we were just talking about this before.</v>

520
00:34:07.321 --> 00:34:11.070
Every now and then something happens where a man does something that's well

521
00:34:11.071 --> 00:34:12.750
intentioned but tone deaf.

522
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.890
So recently we got an email from some men inviting us to a mixer for women.

523
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.960
And I thought,
why are the men inviting us to this?

524
00:34:18.961 --> 00:34:22.290
Why is there not a woman throwing the mixer and why are the men even part of it?

525
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.550
And so I asked my boss like this is pretty tone deaf in his response was yes,

526
00:34:26.551 --> 00:34:29.770
but it was well intentioned.
How do you respond to that?

527
00:34:29.771 --> 00:34:32.700
Because I feel like a message could maybe should get to the men who sent it,

528
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.220
but it was well intentioned.
And so why do we want to bring it up?

529
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:39.550
<v 1>I mean,
I would say that you have to call these things out.
Like you know,</v>

530
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.140
you don't have to be a bitch calling this stuff out,

531
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.400
like or be perceived as a bitch.
It's important to talk about it.

532
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.020
And so if it is tone deaf,

533
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.290
then he should let them know and so I don't know it all,

534
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.300
you know so much of this stuff is so individual.

535
00:34:53.301 --> 00:34:56.420
It depends on your power within the organization.
Is this person your boss?

536
00:34:56.421 --> 00:34:58.280
Like do you feel comfortable speaking up?

537
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.970
And I always fall back on if it's not just you,

538
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:05.660
if it's a number of women part of that group who are asking for something to

539
00:35:05.661 --> 00:35:06.350
happen,

540
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:11.350
then not any individual can be singled out and so perhaps the response would be

541
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.890
for multiple of you to go back and say,

542
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:21.250
I totally understand and I appreciate you passing this information along or

543
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:24.020
whatever.
Maybe because yeah,

544
00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:27.740
a lot of this is tone deafness and some and we make mistakes but no one's going

545
00:35:27.741 --> 00:35:32.300
to learn if they don't know that there are tone deaf and so the message needs to

546
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:37.010
make it back to those people.
I think my question is around the,

547
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.830
<v 9>that have sort of played out at Uber,</v>

548
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.620
which have become pretty well known,
I think,

549
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:45.960
especially here in Silicon Valley over the last few weeks.

550
00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:50.961
And I think obviously that was an extreme case that the writer sort of talked

551
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:54.750
about and in her article on medium.

552
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:58.950
But I think for a lot of us that work in Silicon Valley's women were like,

553
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.580
of course these subtle daily acts of sexism happen every day.

554
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:05.230
Like why is this so surprising to people?
Um,

555
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.090
but I think one thing that made me start thinking was one of the followup

556
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:13.500
articles was talking about how Uber's performance system is a bell curve and how

557
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:18.501
they have five performance buckets and it sort of encourages people to undercut

558
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.960
their,
their teammates.
Um,

559
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.110
or because of things like imposter syndrome,
it,
you know,

560
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.280
encourages the men to shine and the women not to shine.
And then,
you know,

561
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.190
I think that their performance system is probably directly modeled after

562
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:34.680
Google's or it's very,
very similar from what it sounds like.

563
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:38.820
So my question to you is like,
have you read anything about that?

564
00:36:38.821 --> 00:36:41.190
Or have you thought about that or do you have any sort of date,

565
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:42.780
and I haven't read it yet,
but I'm excited too.

566
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:47.850
But data that sort of supports this idea of like performance and the best ways

567
00:36:47.851 --> 00:36:48.810
to measure that.

568
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.640
So it's not a systemic problem for men versus women succeeding in a company.

569
00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.753
<v 1>Right.</v>

570
00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:00.400
Well I think that one very important thing is setting really clear criteria for

571
00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:01.754
success.

572
00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.590
So lean in and Mckinsey put out this study every year of women in the workplace

573
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.950
and this past one they,

574
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:15.010
they found that something like 78% of companies said that they support gender

575
00:37:15.771 --> 00:37:20.370
equality or the it was the employee is saying that they believe their CEOs

576
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.350
really supported gender equality and yet like 50% of the managers in those

577
00:37:24.351 --> 00:37:26.480
companies didn't actually know what to do.

578
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:32.080
And then only 38% of those companies actually set clear criteria for things like

579
00:37:33.291 --> 00:37:37.760
hiring.
And what we know is that at least as it pertains to hiring,

580
00:37:37.761 --> 00:37:41.030
but I imagine it pertains to performance reviews as well.

581
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:46.510
Women are often judged based on their past performance and men are judged based

582
00:37:46.551 --> 00:37:47.480
on their potential.

583
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:52.460
So literally like we have to have a line item on our resume and looking at a man

584
00:37:52.461 --> 00:37:55.610
and you're like,
oh,
he could do it.
Like I can see him as a future leader.

585
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.960
And oftentimes if people seeing those people as future leaders are also men.

586
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.040
And so,
you know,

587
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:06.110
the reality is it's sometimes easier to see someone who looks like you rise up.

588
00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.170
So what can you do?
Well,

589
00:38:09.171 --> 00:38:12.650
if you have very clear criteria and you know that that's existing,

590
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:17.830
then you can set metrics for it and you can make sure that you're not hiring or,

591
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:23.360
or reviewing based on what you think a person's potential may be.

592
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.430
Um,
I don't know specifically what companies have done to try to,

593
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.850
I don't know,
I guess solve for that bell curve,

594
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:37.120
but I have to think that having more women in leadership to talk about these

595
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:40.840
things,
I mean,
it's like the same reason why we were talking about earlier.

596
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.140
Our microphones don't clip onto the back of it just because they were made by

597
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:49.240
men and they were made for men.

598
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.550
And so you see this across the board,
um,

599
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.850
in small things and large things.

600
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:59.851
And if women are involved in the decision making process about how people are

601
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:06.310
judged or about how whatever this may be in this case,

602
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.690
then I think that they can elevate some of these,
these issues.

603
00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.780
Um,
so that's not a perfect solution on how to do it.

604
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:18.781
But I think like all of this stuff is so interconnected and until half of the

605
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:21.730
leaders are women,
like we will continue to have these problems.

606
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:25.690
But I also think it's important that people are speaking out and talking about

607
00:39:25.691 --> 00:39:29.710
it.
Like that woman writing that piece that went completely viral has sparked a

608
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:33.580
conversation that yes,
I totally agree.
Many of us were like,
yeah,
Duh.

609
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.670
Like obviously this is happening,
we know this,

610
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.140
but it appears that a lot of people didn't know it and it's getting mainstream

611
00:39:41.141 --> 00:39:43.900
press attention now,
which is a good thing.
And you know,

612
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.410
we're obviously under scrutiny to change some of its policies.

613
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.520
And so I think that,
or I hope that we'll see a ripple effect there,

614
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.230
but oftentimes it does take someone speaking out and going out on a limb,

615
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.810
which is where I go back to power in numbers.

616
00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:00.760
Like she wasn't working at the company anymore,

617
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:04.390
so she felt comfortable speaking out.
But for those who are inside,

618
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:09.310
sometimes it helps to band together and approach it as a group because you can't

619
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:13.630
be penalized.
You're more powerful.
And if you're experiencing something,

620
00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:18.631
probably someone else's to any resources to share about language,

621
00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:22.330
to pushback on disempowering praise.
I recently got,

622
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.000
she's a smart cookie on a project I'm leading.

623
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.350
I have a phd in neuroscience and eight years of industry experience.

624
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.880
I am not a cookie.
I am an expert.
Any advice,

625
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.820
um,
call it out like you're yeah,
you're not,

626
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.690
I call that the undermine her.
Um,
the person who's like,

627
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:47.350
great job Kiddo,
or thank you honey or cookie,

628
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:51.130
like all of those little language pieces that are so tiny.

629
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.960
But there's so undermining.
Like,

630
00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:56.380
if you're standing there and your team sees you being called a cookie,

631
00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.030
but some other leader,
like are they going to respect you?

632
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.440
So I think calling it out,

633
00:41:02.441 --> 00:41:05.560
sometimes we may have to take that person aside and be like,
hey,

634
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.850
we're all in this for the same thing.
I think it actually benefits you for,

635
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:13.970
for our team to see me as a leader.
And when you call me cookie,
um,

636
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.030
it undermines my authority.
So calling out the behavior.
Um,

637
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.410
and you know,
the,

638
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:24.490
I think that we're being more cognizant these days of speech patterns.

639
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.190
So you know,
from things like that too,

640
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:32.200
the way that so much of our language is his gender.
Like I've started,
um,

641
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.170
trying find an alternative when I say you guys.
Um,

642
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:41.030
but even things like there's a,
there's a dictionary in the book,
an a to z.

643
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.310
It's a how,
not to be a dictionary

644
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:49.250
guide to nonsexist language,
but like things that I had never realized,

645
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:52.670
like the words Seminole,
it comes from seaman.

646
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.730
Like that is a male derived term and that is what we use to describe great

647
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:02.210
works.
Right?
And so there's stuff is so,

648
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:07.270
so ingrained into every tiny bit of our culture and sometimes it's a matter of

649
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:12.450
calling it out when we see it because people do not even realize it.
Yup.

650
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:17.780
And for what it's worth,
like would you call a man cookie?
No.

651
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.690
Like you can pretty much apply that question to anything.

652
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:24.710
Like would I view her as bossy if she were a man?
Probably not.

653
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.570
So asking that question as well,

654
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.780
<v 10>trying to formulate this question.
I guess this is about,
um,</v>

655
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.790
any lessons learned from male allies and I guess I'm seeing this through the

656
00:42:33.791 --> 00:42:35.150
lens of anxiety.
You know,

657
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.230
anxiety is important because it pushes people to change,

658
00:42:38.231 --> 00:42:42.670
but it can also prompt a backlash.
And I liked the language that you used about,

659
00:42:42.671 --> 00:42:46.870
hey,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm actually trying to be helpful to us.

660
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.330
So just any thoughts that you have?
Again,

661
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.100
like things that you feel like have been successful in sort of recruiting allies

662
00:42:54.101 --> 00:42:58.390
are getting mindshift in allies to,
to see common cause,
anything like that?

663
00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.650
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean,</v>

664
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.100
I think just talking more openly is really step one because I think we're

665
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.770
hesitant to talk about these issues and we're fearful that we're going to screw

666
00:43:08.771 --> 00:43:11.170
up.
And you know,

667
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:14.500
I wrote a whole book that has language like mansplaining and mantra option and

668
00:43:14.501 --> 00:43:19.270
broke appropriation everywhere and on some level that can make men feel
targeted.

669
00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.373
Um,

670
00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:25.420
I'm also trying to use it as a way to have humor to open up some of these
issues,

671
00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:29.890
but I think we have to get over our fears about talking about it and just

672
00:43:29.891 --> 00:43:32.800
discuss more openly so that the stigma goes away.

673
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.850
<v 10>A followup to that is,
um,
you know,</v>

674
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.800
basically they have this notion of sort of lowering the cost for screwing up.

675
00:43:41.801 --> 00:43:44.140
I mean,
I guess it's proportional to the screw up.

676
00:43:44.141 --> 00:43:48.290
Like in some ways we'd have to raise the cost,
but,
but for those,
uh,

677
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:52.780
like maybe micro aggressions should have a Mike Rowe price.
Um,

678
00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.790
and it's basically like,
look,
you know,

679
00:43:54.791 --> 00:43:59.791
like I appreciate that we're all working together and like making it less like,

680
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.930
um,
you know,
I read an article that was like,
like,
um,

681
00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.040
basically implicit bias is the new way to say that you're a racist.

682
00:44:09.041 --> 00:44:12.760
And the person was just like,
oh,
I'm not a racist.
And it's like,
no.
Oh my God.

683
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:17.500
It's the exact opposite.
It's trying to say we all,
because of us as primates,

684
00:44:17.501 --> 00:44:21.760
we have these cognitive shortcuts.
It's meant to know,
you know,
to say,
look,
we're,

685
00:44:21.761 --> 00:44:26.230
you're in good company,
but it's having kind of the opposite effect.
Um,
yeah.

686
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:31.330
<v 1>I mean I try to talk about the ways that I've screwed up frequently as a way to</v>

687
00:44:32.371 --> 00:44:37.260
let my audience or whomever it may be know that like if I'm doing it to them,

688
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:40.710
we're all doing it and it's okay.
And so maybe one way to approach it,

689
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.700
at least I'm trying to get other people on your side is by beginning with

690
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:49.650
something that you've done that you realized and then maybe they won't feel

691
00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:50.460
attacked.
I mean,

692
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:54.500
it's like we shouldn't have to dance around this issue and walk on eggshells.

693
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.750
But the reality is that like we work in office environments and we want to be

694
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:00.840
respectful and we don't want people to feel attacked or offended.

695
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.580
And I think that the reality is that most men really do want to help and they

696
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:10.280
want to be allies.
And I believe that,
but it's also backed in sorts,

697
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.130
all sorts of data.
And especially young men,
like they want gender equality,

698
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:15.660
they want equal relationships.

699
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.200
But this is like for hundreds and hundreds of years,

700
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.280
men have run shit.
And so there is a learning curve.

701
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:27.360
Like it does take some time to overcome some of these issues.

702
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:28.560
So yeah,

703
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:33.330
I think talking about a way that you've experienced it as one way and talking

704
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:36.760
about things in groups so that one person doesn't feel attacked.
Um,

705
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.200
but also just knowing that like sometimes uncomfortable stuff is going to come

706
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:44.630
up,
but we can still have productive conversations about it.
Yeah.

707
00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:48.520
<v 11>Just to a couple of questions that we'll try to keep short.</v>

708
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:53.980
What do we do about the fact that the f word of feminism turned some people off

709
00:45:53.981 --> 00:45:54.940
immediately?

710
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:59.560
And how do we get those people back into the conversation hopefully and about,

711
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:01.810
<v 1>I'll do that one first.
Um,</v>

712
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.120
so I really do think that the stigma around the word feminism is changing.

713
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.020
I think that celebrities have had a lot to do with this.
In fact,

714
00:46:10.021 --> 00:46:14.130
like seeing Beyonce on stage at the Vma is defining the word.

715
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.960
Um,
that's,
that's like bigger than any other feminist could ever accomplish.

716
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.600
So I think that the stigma is going away.

717
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:25.770
I also think that continuing to talk about what the definition of feminism

718
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.820
actually is,

719
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:31.230
it means that you as a person that believes in gender equality between the

720
00:46:31.231 --> 00:46:34.530
sexes,
and that's like the most benign thing ever.

721
00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:36.660
Like who's going to say they're anti that?

722
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.960
So I think that it's going away.

723
00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:43.350
I also think am of the belief that like if you don't want to call yourself a

724
00:46:43.351 --> 00:46:46.410
feminist,
but you believe in these things and you're going to fight for them,

725
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:48.630
like fine,
that's better than nothing.

726
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.020
And so whether you call yourself a feminist or not,

727
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:56.630
I think it's about working towards equality.
And for what it's worth.

728
00:46:56.631 --> 00:46:59.520
Like when I was pitching this book in the beginning,

729
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.320
which was a couple of years ago,
I said to my mail agent,

730
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.950
do you think we should call this lady fight club because people are going to be

731
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:11.640
so offended by the word feminist.
And you know,

732
00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:13.560
I'm coming from a mainstream news background.

733
00:47:13.561 --> 00:47:15.480
I didn't want to go with a niche feminist press.

734
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:20.160
I wanted this book to reach the masses.
And he to his credit was like,
no,

735
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.790
feminist is a stronger title.
We're going to go out with that.
And so we did.

736
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.950
And I was sort of wary.
I was nervous about what would happen.
And to my surprise,

737
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:33.670
um,
you know,
we had bids from a dozen different mainstream publishers,

738
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:37.540
not niche feminist press's.
And so that to me was very encouraging.

739
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:40.930
And I think that that was still two years ago.
I think that the word has become,

740
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.300
um,
more mainstream since then.

741
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:46.600
But there will always be arguments about the word feminism.

742
00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:49.990
Like for so long this is occurred.
And I don't know,

743
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:53.530
every decade or so there's like a conversation around should we rebrand feminist

744
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:55.330
and like should we call it something else?

745
00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:00.250
And I don't think that's gonna happen,
but you know,

746
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:05.080
if you're willing to wear the,
the title proudly I say like do it loud

747
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:10.770
<v 11>and then just around intersectionality,
um,
I'm off.</v>

748
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.800
I feel like I'm often fearful that I've heard people in other minority groups

749
00:48:17.551 --> 00:48:21.960
who are also women complain that they feel like their voices are not heard.

750
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.380
What advice do you have for white women or anyone who wants to make sure that

751
00:48:28.381 --> 00:48:33.150
they're supporting and raising up those voices rather than potentially

752
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.450
accidentally talking over them or shutting them out of the conversation?

753
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.900
<v 1>I think like first of all,
try not to be defensive.
Um,</v>

754
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.320
because I see this happen online so much where like white women are called out

755
00:48:45.961 --> 00:48:49.770
for some of their behavior and probably much in the same way that men feel

756
00:48:49.771 --> 00:48:53.790
attacked at work.
The immediate response is like defensiveness.

757
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:57.860
And I think that we need to listen more.
Like we need to listen more.

758
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:02.870
We need to respect that these voices have been marginalized for years and years

759
00:49:03.451 --> 00:49:04.140
and years.

760
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:08.520
So even if we may not think in a particular moment that we are drawing them out,

761
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.500
like we have long had a voice,

762
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.370
not as much of a voices as men but a voice and,

763
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.620
and there was a really long history of racism in the,

764
00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:21.390
in the women's movement.
And so I think yeah,
we have to,

765
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:26.220
we have to like be okay with screwing up and be okay with being called out for

766
00:49:26.221 --> 00:49:29.640
it and like try to correct the behavior and move on.

767
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.280
I think you sort of addressed this,
but let's go directly to it.
Again,

768
00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:38.330
one of the senior leaders on my team has recently received a bit of flack for

769
00:49:38.331 --> 00:49:42.710
using guys too often as a blanket term when addressing a mixed gender group.

770
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:47.960
It doesn't bother me yet.
When someone uses ladies to email only admins,
it does.

771
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:53.200
What's your take on sensitivities like that?
I think we need to just right here,

772
00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:55.780
right now come up with a better term for guys.

773
00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.280
Like y'all s feels weird to me folks.

774
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.600
Okay.
Yes.
So maybe,
maybe we have solved this right here.
Yeah.

775
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:12.150
Yes.
Thank you to the Unicorn in the room.
One of Tim,
you all?
Yeah,

776
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:13.483
I mean

777
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:19.630
it's so progressive.
Yeah.

778
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:24.580
I think that this stuff is like so entrenched in our language and yeah,

779
00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:30.590
I need all of you to focus this site.
You know,
what are,
you know,
um,
yeah,

780
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:34.070
I mean I need to get more comfortable with folks.
Yeah.

781
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.230
Yeah.
Where we are,
we come up with anywhere humans,

782
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:46.100
basically all language a census if you really get down to it.

783
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:51.930
<v 9>Oh,
about a year ago I had an incident with a friend,</v>

784
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:56.300
like a good friend who uh,
was talking about,
um,
like the,

785
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.340
the efforts going on for hiring diverse people.

786
00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.480
And this is a very respectful person that I am on good terms with.
But he said,

787
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.950
uh,
you know,
that the,
to use his words,
and I still remember this,

788
00:51:07.951 --> 00:51:12.951
the pendulum has swung too far and like people are being hurt by like these

789
00:51:14.131 --> 00:51:14.821
efforts.

790
00:51:14.821 --> 00:51:19.230
Like basically good people are not being hired because like something something

791
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:23.670
good.
We're looking for diverse candidates,
implying the woman thing.

792
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.660
And I dunno,
like I didn't know how to respond at the time,

793
00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.970
which was going to be like not,
I didn't,

794
00:51:29.971 --> 00:51:34.080
I didn't want to like say blah blah blah feminism there.

795
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:39.270
I did want to say that I wanted to say that,
but I also just,

796
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:43.090
it's not going to solve the problem and I don't know how to address it.

797
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:44.580
Advice please.

798
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:49.640
<v 1>Yeah.
And I feel like,
feel free to chime in if anyone else has advice to,
um,</v>

799
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:54.420
well when,
as you were saying that I wanted to do like Rah Rah,
Rah feminist,

800
00:51:54.421 --> 00:51:59.120
some things too for the record.
I mean it's tricky.
It's like,

801
00:51:59.480 --> 00:51:59.751
yeah,

802
00:51:59.751 --> 00:52:04.751
well welcome to like history where these people have been marginalized and not

803
00:52:05.571 --> 00:52:09.830
hired for years and years and years and we have to correct for that somehow.

804
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:14.300
But I think that also,
I don't know,

805
00:52:14.301 --> 00:52:18.530
I mean throwing the numbers back in that person's face,

806
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:23.590
like probably they're referencing a team or a company that is still a majority

807
00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:24.740
white male,

808
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:29.090
even if this person feels that the pendulum has swung too far and then

809
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:34.150
potentially I'm making note of the fact that actually it's a better for the

810
00:52:35.931 --> 00:52:40.700
company to have a more diverse team and like listing off all those stats about

811
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:45.701
how teams with more diversity or more collaborative and more successful and

812
00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:51.131
companies with more women on the board have higher returns and even things like

813
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.700
in a room,

814
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:58.030
in a meeting where there are at least 25% women,

815
00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:02.540
which is what social science calls the point of critical mass.

816
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:07.870
Then those women in the room will a feel more comfortable speaking up and be

817
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.630
what they are saying,
we'll actually be hurt more.

818
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:16.870
It's sort of this point where we stopped viewing that 25% as a minority group or

819
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:21.680
a speaking on behalf of women or on behalf of their race and just view them as

820
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.800
experts who are in the room.
So that's not a perfect answer,

821
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.230
but trying to remind that person.

822
00:53:28.231 --> 00:53:31.760
Does anyone else want to chime in with their thoughts?
Um,

823
00:53:31.761 --> 00:53:34.730
so moving on to kind of a different note,
you brought up imposter syndrome,

824
00:53:34.731 --> 00:53:38.690
which I think a lot of people in this room can identify with,
myself included.
Um,

825
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:43.480
you know,
it,
it,
you know that you're good at your job,
logically,
you,
you,

826
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.120
you understand that you do a good job every day and like an email comes in on

827
00:53:47.121 --> 00:53:50.540
Friday afternoon with your manager asking to meet with you and you like panic,

828
00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:55.020
right?
Because you're like,
oh,
I'm totally in trouble.
Like there's no doubt.
Yeah,

829
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.430
I'm totally getting fired.
In fact,
I'll just quit.
Right,
exactly.

830
00:53:58.431 --> 00:54:02.030
Like maybe I'll just put on Friday afternoon so I don't have to have anxiety all

831
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.840
weekend about it.

832
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.920
What are your tips for dealing with that and trying to kind of like deal with

833
00:54:06.921 --> 00:54:08.270
the internalized sense of like,

834
00:54:08.271 --> 00:54:11.720
I'm a failure or I'm going to be a failure or it should be a failure.
Right,

835
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.013
right.

836
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:17.350
I think first like knowing that you are not the only one to feel this way.

837
00:54:17.351 --> 00:54:19.780
Like imposter syndrome,
this sense that you don't belong,

838
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.090
that you don't deserve to be there,
that you're not good at your job.

839
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.560
This disproportionately statistically affects women and minorities.

840
00:54:26.561 --> 00:54:28.360
So LGBT,

841
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:33.630
racial minorities and oftentimes it's because those groups of people have this

842
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:39.870
added pressure of accomplishing firsts or needing to not fuck up because

843
00:54:40.061 --> 00:54:43.060
there'll be judged on behalf of their gender or their race if they do.

844
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:44.980
So first off,

845
00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:49.981
knowing that like literally I power pose before I go onstage and I was speaking

846
00:54:50.651 --> 00:54:54.640
at a law firm on Monday and it was a paid gig and I was like,
why?
Literally,

847
00:54:54.641 --> 00:54:58.330
why are these people paying me?
Like I should pay them?
Like I can't believe.

848
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.800
And it was like a welfare and I was like,
I don't just serve this knife.
So okay,

849
00:55:02.801 --> 00:55:06.820
so we all experience it so you're not alone.
Second,

850
00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.360
you can try to trick your brain and this has been found to be effective so that

851
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.150
instead of focusing on how you feel,

852
00:55:16.151 --> 00:55:20.800
you focus it on the issue of imposter syndrome.
Like,
it's not me.

853
00:55:20.801 --> 00:55:25.801
It's the imposter syndrome talking and literally like saying that in the mirror

854
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.730
has been proven to be effective and trying to overcome it because it makes it an

855
00:55:30.731 --> 00:55:32.170
issue,
not your issue.

856
00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:36.760
I also think that having friends and allies and members of your feminist fight

857
00:55:36.761 --> 00:55:40.180
club or whomever it is to remind you that like,
you're not getting fired.

858
00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:43.750
You don't suck.
It's going to be okay.
I'm like,

859
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.960
I know that you're good at what you do.
Can,
you know,

860
00:55:46.961 --> 00:55:50.350
be like the voice that you need inside your head to support you.

861
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.220
There's other things you can do to like power posing or there's a,

862
00:55:54.221 --> 00:55:57.970
there's a list of them in the book.
But I think that like,
remembering that,

863
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.380
you know,
Sheryl Sandberg says she felt like a fraud and Meryl Streep,

864
00:56:02.381 --> 00:56:06.370
the woman with the most Oscars has said that every time she wins an award,

865
00:56:06.371 --> 00:56:10.420
she thinks they must have made a mistake.
And so it's,

866
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:12.210
it's all of us.
Um,
