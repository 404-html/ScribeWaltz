Thank you very much for coming.
Thank you for having me.
Totally.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
Okay.
So I thought it would be fun to start with some rapid fire questions and,

10
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.920
uh,
did you introduce yourself?
Oh No,
I did it.

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.480
I'm Michael Baloney.
No,
I work at Google.

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.830
I do marketing for Google docs and thank you.
Yeah,
that's so cool.
All right.

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.210
Now that,
that's out of the way,
um,
your favorite New York City's season?

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.760
Um,
spring.
Okay.

15
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.780
The fashion trend that you hope is dead fashion trend,
uggs,

16
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.170
the favorite place that you've been on vacation.

17
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.810
<v 2>Um,
this has to be going home to Hawaii.</v>

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.750
<v 0>Okay.
And the last place you want to vacation Sarasota,
right?
Um,</v>

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.470
dogs or cats or other dogs.
Okay.
Um,

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.280
the golden girl you most relate to?
Oh my God.
Sophia [inaudible]

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.580
a living person that you haven't met that you dream to meet?

23
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.783
<v 1>Hm.</v>

24
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.273
<v 2>Toni Morrison.</v>

25
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.440
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
do you have a current TV show addiction?</v>

26
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.440
<v 2>Oh my God.
I'm like trying to figure out which ones I just finished.</v>

27
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:39.650
True detective.
I'm not obsessed with it.
Okay.

28
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.170
But I think one of those like revenge,

29
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.830
which just kind of a bizarre obsession because it's like so bad,

30
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.693
but it's so good.

31
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.630
<v 0>Totally.
No.
Yes.
Okay.
Um,</v>

32
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.310
Aretha Franklin or Patti labelle.
Patti.
Okay.
Uh,
I saw that shade.
Yeah,

33
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:00.380
that's what I see through.
And her,
she was like,
I'm not touching your hand.

34
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.290
You're on and Patty's team.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
And uh,

35
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
for breakfast we are savory and sweet.
Okay.

36
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.340
And then your favorite Janet Jackson album that is not the velvet rope.

37
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.680
Um,
control.
Okay.
Excellent.
All right.
Now that,

38
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.850
now that that's out of the way,
um,
let's talk about,
well,

39
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.590
I think it was super exciting for you right now.

40
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:27.780
So before we talked about the book itself,
um,

41
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590
you've been obviously the New York Times best seller just happened.
That's huge.

42
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.210
Um,
personally it was just your birthday.
So happy birthday.
Um,

43
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.730
the books doing amazing.
Um,
you know,
what,

44
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.370
what do you think is the highlight in the last few months for you personally?

45
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.700
<v 2>I think it's meeting people around the country and kind of sharing space and</v>

46
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:51.020
stories and intimacies with strangers because I think that the bizarre thing

47
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:56.021
about writing in a genre like memoir is that everyone knows so much about you,

48
00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:01.630
but you know,
no one I think about else.
Um,
and so I think that there's this,

49
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.960
um,
and it's especially with just the platform of books,
period,

50
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:06.430
there's such intimacy there.

51
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.390
You have to really engage with it for long periods of time,
right?

52
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.140
Like you have to,

53
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.230
it's not like an article that you can skim real quick and kind of read the

54
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.170
headline and maybe read the first two paragraphs and be like,
I really got that,

55
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.460
you know,
like a book.

56
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.630
You have to really sit there with it and share space with it.
And,
um,

57
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.860
I think a book is open as mine is in terms of intimacy.
It builds this,

58
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.950
it's real,
it's an authentic sense of intimacy.

59
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.100
But when you're sharing space with people and you don't know anything about them

60
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.660
and they know so much about you,

61
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.660
you know that they can remember your best friend from childhood and you're just

62
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:39.820
like,
okay,
you know.
Um,

63
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.000
and so hearing people come back to me and telling me about themselves,

64
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.230
writing letters to me,

65
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.470
I'm telling me the points of intersection of resonance in the book with them.

66
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.190
Um,
that struck them.
That's always,
that's been the most valuable,

67
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:58.750
I think interactions and exchanges after post writing the book.

68
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.440
And I'm sure there's a ton of that.
I mean,
I know just sitting with you earlier,

69
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.770
we were already hearing from lots of people since you've been here.

70
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.490
It's pretty incredible.
Um,

71
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.570
so let's talk about now the process of writing the book.

72
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.260
How did it start?
Are you a journaler?
Like do you like how did,

73
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.080
what's your process?
It definitely started through journals,
I think.
Um,

74
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.890
before it was redefining realness.
It was just kind of my daily thoughts about,

75
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.770
um,
stories from my life and memories.

76
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:29.590
And so they weren't really even stories that they were just like fragments of

77
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:33.610
memories that I knew that I wanted to like have a record of.
Um,

78
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:38.611
and so there are also informed by my daily interactions with self meaning,

79
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.770
um,
this is before I stepped forward and Mary Claire,

80
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:45.280
which I did in 2011 and kind of told part of my story.

81
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.260
And so sitting there telling myself my own stories,
um,

82
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.940
was a way for me to,
I guess,

83
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.410
strengthen myself a little bit and get ready for public consumption that comes

84
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:58.990
from the public space of being visible.

85
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.470
And so it very much started from daily journals.
And I was,

86
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:06.070
at the time I was reading something called the artist's way.
So it was,

87
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.790
I dunno if anyone knows Julia Cameron's book,

88
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:11.410
but I was doing morning pages like faithfully.
And I was single at the time,

89
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.970
so I had lots of time to myself.
So girl was naval gazing for days.
Um,

90
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.550
and so it was very much from that process.

91
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.430
And then it grew to not only wanting to write my story,

92
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:23.560
but then talking to people in my life,

93
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.520
my boyfriend who came into my life at the time,
um,

94
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.460
my best friend opening up to her,
then the next level was Marie Claire.

95
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.840
And then it was also politicizing my,
um,
experiences through,

96
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.500
well contextualizing them through a political and social landscape and really

97
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:40.240
making it more than just me.

98
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.740
So this memoir is very much birthed out of my process over the last four or five

99
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:49.130
years and then it finally came forward.
Okay.
No,
that makes total sense.
And I,
I,

100
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.620
I think that for me,

101
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:54.310
reading the book that people that I encountered were such a huge part of the

102
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:57.100
story.
Like you said earlier.
And I remember you mentioning,

103
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.430
think in the introduction

104
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.930
<v 0>perhaps that you talked to a lot of them before you wrote for the book came out.</v>

105
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.310
And so,
um,
what,
what does that like to have a conversation with someone?

106
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.610
I mean you deal with a lot of challenging relationships in the book.

107
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:15.590
So how does that,
was it particularly hard for someone,
um,

108
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.400
for you to talk about them in the book or just help us understand that process

109
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:22.640
of like publicly,
um,
telling your story that involves someone else?

110
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.920
<v 2>Yeah,
I think for me,
like my parents were fair game because I,</v>

111
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.350
because I could,
I did not get to choose them.

112
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:35.351
So I felt like that it was completely fair for me to write very openly about

113
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.550
their lives and their interactions with me.

114
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.440
My siblings felt a little more shaky for me.
And so I think I felt the most,
um,

115
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.400
obligation probably to my brother Chad because he spent so much of it.

116
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.760
We're only a year and 13 days apart.
So we're born,
you know,

117
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.300
very closely or belt birthdays are always celebrated very closely.
Um,

118
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:56.690
and so I felt the most obligation and sensitivity towards him.

119
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.590
And so that was like a tricky thing for me to navigate.
So I,

120
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.360
that's why I think that I spent a lot of time,

121
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.920
if I was going to write about someone a lot,

122
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:07.520
I made sure that I had their voice in the book a lot.
So I interviewed my mother,

123
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.850
I interviewed my father,
I interviewed my brother Chad,
um,

124
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.470
and interviewed my best friend Wendy.

125
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.500
And so those were the four people that I felt were very pivotal characters in

126
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:20.800
the book.
But it's weird say characters because they're actual,
you fall,

127
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.480
but for the reader it's a character,
right?

128
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.280
Because they don't really know this person.

129
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:29.060
They know this person through my lens and experience and interactions with them.

130
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.410
And so,
um,
yeah,
that's,
that was,
uh,
the,

131
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.360
the process of writing about people was people you love and care about,
right.

132
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.620
Is also a difficult thing.

133
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:43.160
But I think the one thing I learned with memoir is that it's not so much a space

134
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.140
for venting or revenge.

135
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.330
It's a space to really look at everyone in your life,

136
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.100
even yourself with the same brutal honesty and sharp criticism that you would

137
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:57.530
look at quote unquote villains.
And so in this book,
there's,

138
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.640
there's no antagonist to me.
I think that everyone's a full person in this book.

139
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.510
And I think that when you communicate that kind of nuance and complexity,

140
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.370
it gives a more true experience.
Like my parents,
my parents were like,

141
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:12.310
if you read the,
if you read redefining realness,

142
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.460
my parents were super messy and ill equipped and battled with drug addiction and

143
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.150
abusive relationships and you know,

144
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.870
both had tons of children that they didn't really have the resources to take

145
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.860
care of.
And so,
but I had to really look at how they grew up,
right.

146
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:30.560
In the same sense that I have to give sensitivity to how I grew up.

147
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.120
And so when I could look at my parents as more than just these people who were

148
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:36.470
my mother and father,

149
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:40.970
but as their own people who had their own struggles and failed expectations and

150
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:43.010
heartbreaks,
I could paint some more full portrait.

151
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:48.011
And so I hope to do that with each character or person in the book in which I

152
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.300
wrote it up.

153
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.720
<v 0>Yeah.
I definitely felt like I got to know them very well.
And,
uh,</v>

154
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.200
that was one of the favorite parts from me.
You have the book.
Um,

155
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.590
so after it came out,
had your relationships,

156
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.150
have you sat down and talked about the content about particularly people and how

157
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:07.020
has that shaped,
has it strengthened or hurt any of your relationships?

158
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.400
<v 2>Wow.
Um,
I think that's the bizarre part is that my,</v>

159
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.650
my parents were learning about me as a world,

160
00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:19.651
was learning about me because I had never been so open with them about like

161
00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:22.930
they're learning about their child.
Um,

162
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.370
talking about sexuality,
talking about like creating a space for the erotic,

163
00:09:27.371 --> 00:09:30.460
talking about what she was doing with her body and you know,

164
00:09:30.461 --> 00:09:34.830
the pain that they caused upon her beanie.
Me As still,
even as a memoir,

165
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:38.560
as I still have a hard time with I statements.
It's really bizarre.

166
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:42.580
So I think for my parents it was this weird sense of like,

167
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.900
I'm really fascinated by the story,
but the story is like about my child.

168
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.950
And so I think that's a weird space to be in as a reader.
You know,

169
00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:52.670
someone that's so invested.
Uh,

170
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.190
the first person that read the book in process was my boyfriend Aaron.

171
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.110
And um,
he was just like,
wow,
you really told it all.
You know.

172
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.350
And I think that he also felt there was like this weird sense of like prince

173
00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:09.430
charming ask like abilities that I threw on to him and he was like,

174
00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:13.210
this isn't necessarily true,
but I can see,
you know,
like for him it's not,

175
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.360
it's not how he sees himself.
Right.
And so like,

176
00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:18.280
I think there's this weird for him,
that's what,

177
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.380
that's what he took away from the book,
but he was just like,
oh wow.

178
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:22.750
It was really interesting to see someone,

179
00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:25.570
I love so much their full story through their own perspective.

180
00:10:25.571 --> 00:10:28.240
And I think it was the same kind of thread with my parents.

181
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.650
Like I finally had like a real in depth conversation with my father three nights

182
00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:34.510
ago about the book.
Um,

183
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.420
and I think it was very difficult for him to get through the book because so

184
00:10:37.421 --> 00:10:41.050
much of the first half of it is about his struggles.

185
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.160
And I was writing about it from my perspective as a seven,
six,
seven,
eight,

186
00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:47.440
nine year old,
10 year old,
um,

187
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.640
and also his like gender policing of me as a child.

188
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.700
<v 0>Let's talk about that for a minute.</v>

189
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.020
So the one of the elements of the book that I thought it was particularly

190
00:10:56.021 --> 00:11:01.021
intense or had to be hard for you was when he discovered your,

191
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.230
I guess,
alter ego.
Kesha.
And for those of you haven't read the book,

192
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.140
I mean maybe you want to explain.
Yeah.
Okay.
Kesha was,

193
00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:09.850
and then I'll explain what happened.
Know.

194
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.960
<v 2>So Kesha was,
um,
I invented her I think when I was 10 years old.</v>

195
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.160
Um,
so my father had many different girlfriends and they all had children.

196
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.060
And so this one apartment that we settled in,
there's a teenage girl,

197
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:24.770
she was about 15 and I was about,

198
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:28.910
I think nine or 10 and she would always talk to boys on the phone.

199
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:31.490
And so she would use me to tell them,
you know,

200
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.260
that she's not home to lie to them.

201
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.930
And so one day when she actually wasn't home and there's this boy that she was

202
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:39.620
trying to avoid,
I was like,
oh,
you know,
Mikayla is not here,

203
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.510
but this is Kesha.
And you know,
Mckayla told me to talk to you.

204
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:47.990
And so like I was just kind of telling these tall tells and fantasies and

205
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:51.560
stories of like my would be life as a girl because I,
you know,

206
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:54.940
I was perceive to be a boy throughout my childhood.

207
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.420
And so at the time being this very feminine child,
um,
who,

208
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.670
who didn't yet know that she was trans,

209
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.320
I expressed my girlhood through this character of Kesha,

210
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.210
which felt closer to me than myself,

211
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:09.860
even though I knew that it was very much a role.
Um,

212
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.960
and so Kesha began on the phone and then Kesha went into real life,
um,

213
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.020
during my spring break of like 1994 three it was,

214
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.350
I just remember what a man was on and I really wanted to memorize salt.

215
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:27.600
And pepper is what a man,
which I did by the way.
And,
um,

216
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.460
I will not say any of it here,
but,
um,

217
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.640
and so,
um,
that's a sign don't tangent,
but,
um,
yeah.

218
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:42.560
So I brought key shout to the real world and I was kind of,
you know,
my,

219
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.060
my little cousin Michelle,
who was like two years younger than me,

220
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.360
we went out and I developed a crush on a boy who really liked me and you know,

221
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.270
I had long curly hair at the time.
Um,
and so I was like,
oh,
I'm Kesha.

222
00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:58.360
And we had this little like little flirtation,
very innocent.
Um,

223
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.240
and then one day when my father was picking me up on the last day of spring

224
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.340
break,
um,

225
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.420
the boy Jamie knocks on the door and says,
it's Kesha hair.

226
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.240
And then it creates this whole thing that you have to see play out.

227
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.710
<v 0>Well,
my heart yours when I read that part.
And uh,
yeah.</v>

228
00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:19.700
So then I guess what happens next essentially is that your dad shaves her head.

229
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.990
And I think hair,
I mean,

230
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.030
to me it seems like it represented a way that you could express herself in a,

231
00:13:29.031 --> 00:13:32.810
at a time when you weren't quite sure how or what was okay or comfortable and it

232
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:37.790
was very natural to you.
And,
uh,
so that,
I mean,
how did it feel?

233
00:13:37.791 --> 00:13:38.720
It,
I imagined that it,

234
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.640
it really felt like it stripped you of that identity.

235
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.220
And then I know the process of growing it back and the Gumby you had like,
uh,

236
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.890
someone called you or something.
Um,
just tell me about that.

237
00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:54.470
So like how,
what was your experience after that with your dad?

238
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.130
<v 2>So I think it was the first one.
My father really truly saw me.</v>

239
00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.840
I think he saw me before,
but he like,

240
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.440
it was easy for him to deny it because other people didn't recognize or see.

241
00:14:03.441 --> 00:14:03.711
Right.

242
00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:08.510
So they're having this boy walk up into his sister's space and to say,

243
00:14:08.511 --> 00:14:11.630
I'm looking for Kesha,
this girl,
um,
my father,

244
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.700
he needed to correct that.
And so for him,
he,
you know,

245
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.410
as you just explained,
he shaved my head.
And that was my only sense of,
um,

246
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.340
a physical embodiment of my girlhood at the time,

247
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.930
right of my true identity as how I knew myself into my father doing that.

248
00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:33.020
He thought that he was erasing it,
but hair does grow back.
Um,

249
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.970
even though it was very traumatic at the time,

250
00:14:34.971 --> 00:14:39.110
and I had to really go through it for a year and a half.
Um,
and it,

251
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.950
I think that it was just this moment where he was very confused and he was

252
00:14:42.951 --> 00:14:47.810
battling his self and battling his own ideas of what gender is and what his role

253
00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:51.860
as a father was to raise this child that he as his son,

254
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:55.260
that was his namesake and all of these kinds of things.
And so,
um,

255
00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:00.460
I think that it kind of is symbolic of a lot of our interactions growing up and

256
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:00.831
you know,

257
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.610
that you see those little moments and he even threatens me like years before

258
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:07.430
that he'll cut my hair and it was always the big threat.

259
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:10.550
And so when he actually followed through on that,
um,

260
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.210
I think it was a major pivot for in our relationship.

261
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:18.260
And I think it's great that a year and a half later I basically move with my

262
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:20.750
mother to Hawaii and it's a completely different environment.

263
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.550
<v 0>Right.
Okay.
Well,</v>

264
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.260
<v 2>yeah,</v>

265
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.360
it also shows like also the agency of young people like the lack of agency often

266
00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:31.870
in most homes where you don't have control over,
um,

267
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.250
having the resources and funds to buy your own clothes to say that you want to

268
00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:39.130
do what you want and express yourself in dress,

269
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.010
in hair and makeup or adornments in any way.

270
00:15:42.011 --> 00:15:44.080
And so a lot of times your parents are very much,

271
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.800
at least in the households that I grew up in,
it was very much,
um,

272
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.720
we have $100 $150 allotted to you at the beginning of the school year and we're

273
00:15:52.721 --> 00:15:54.910
not giving you $150 are going with you to shot.

274
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.600
And so for me it was always like this pain time,
right?
Like,
it was like,
oh,

275
00:15:58.601 --> 00:16:03.070
shout out to where all these damn JC Penney polos and like all this stuff that

276
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.400
you know,
and cargo shorts.
And I was like,
oh Lord,
I'd have to wear the stuff.

277
00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:09.280
You know,
cause I have no agency to say that.
No.

278
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.670
And even know voice really to say that I don't feel comfortable in these clothes

279
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.860
and this is not what I want to wear and this is more,

280
00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:18.880
and I didn't feel that safety in both of my homes to do that from,
you know,

281
00:16:18.881 --> 00:16:22.870
until I was maybe like 13 or 14 years old.
Right.
I guess that's

282
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.200
<v 0>no,
almost near the point where you met Wendy.
Right.
So,
um,
and,</v>

283
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.390
and I think you guys together found ways to grab that agency and started buying

284
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:32.720
the clothes that you wanted to buy.
Right?

285
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.660
So tell us a little bit about that inflection point in your life.

286
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.180
<v 2>Yeah.
That was,
you know,
this,
that relationship.</v>

287
00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:40.830
I think it's one of those things where people,

288
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.980
some people just come into your life at certain times,
you don't know why.
Right.

289
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.740
And so Wendy was just someone who really saw me.
Um,

290
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.630
<v 0>firstly at school,
right?</v>

291
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.570
<v 2>Yes.
You saw me at school.
I was picking up,</v>

292
00:16:51.571 --> 00:16:55.470
my brother from school were waiting for my mom to pick us up from the little

293
00:16:55.471 --> 00:16:57.660
playground that's between our two schools.
I was in middle school,

294
00:16:57.661 --> 00:17:00.510
I was in the seventh grade and my brother Jeffrey is six years younger.

295
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:03.180
She is in the first grade and he was just playing and I was sitting on the

296
00:17:03.181 --> 00:17:07.950
swings and when he was walking by with her green Bob and her high,

297
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.170
you know,
her super short shorts,

298
00:17:10.171 --> 00:17:15.171
soccer shorts rolled up at her knee high socks and she just passed by with her

299
00:17:15.391 --> 00:17:18.650
volleyball.
And she was like,
Mary,
are you my who?

300
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.730
And I was just like,

301
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.950
I didn't say anything because I wasn't ready for that sense of like reflection

302
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.940
and like recognition.
Like she really saw me and Molly who's a s uh,

303
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.600
I was in Hona Honolulu at the time.
So Ma,
who is this?
Um,

304
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.010
it's kind of a term that's,

305
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.180
it's like a third space for gender beyond the gender binary beyond male and

306
00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:43.500
female.
There's a space to explore the spectrum,
but it mostly was,
um,

307
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.700
applied loosely if you bring the West are not western colonize sense of what

308
00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:52.230
Mahu is.
It's loosely as transgender,
but that's not really what it is.

309
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:54.330
But it's kind of a space outside of the male female.

310
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:59.331
And it's oftentimes for children that are assigned male at birth.

311
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:04.110
Right.
Based on their parents of their genitals and who are feminine presenting.

312
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.790
And so when Wendy saw me,

313
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:09.560
that's what she saw even though I was wearing these polos and JC Penney.
Yeah,

314
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.100
she basically clocked me.
She spooked me.
She was like,
girl,
I see you.

315
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.830
Um,
why are you trying to pretend?

316
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.540
And I just ignored her and so I was not ready for her yet.
And here she is.

317
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:26.250
So visible.
Yes.
Yes.
And looking for friends and looking for like,
girl,

318
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:30.600
I see you.
I'm going to come follow up later on.
When she did,
she followed up.

319
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.150
What,
what made you ready to talk to her?
I think it,

320
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.090
it's so deep.

321
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.110
I think growing up in a home where I always had this dream image of my mother,

322
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.320
right.
So like if we,
you have to really break down the family chronology.

323
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.500
My parents met a year later,
they got married and had me,
um,

324
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.130
and they already had children from previous relationships and they're fairly

325
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:52.130
young.
They're 23 years old.
Um,

326
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.460
and my mother already had two girls beforehand in my father had three children

327
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:59.670
from highschool,
messy.
Um,

328
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.330
and so then I come along the embodiment of what they believe is going to be

329
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:06.510
their life together,
their first marriages,
you know,

330
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.250
they're going to fulfill the American dream.

331
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.220
And he was a navy officer and she was,
you know,

332
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.120
this woman who worked in Honolulu and he's this black man from Dallas,
Texas.

333
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:19.410
And they meet,
that does not work out because my father's philandering ways.

334
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:24.240
My mother's just too high expectations from someone that she's not fully seeing.

335
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.280
Um,
and so they break up when I'm about three,

336
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.070
me and my brother go and live with my parents.
Um,

337
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.030
I live with my mother in Honolulu.
We stay with her for a couple of years.

338
00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:36.930
Then she sends us,
because we need male influences,
her son's email influences.

339
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.410
So she sends it to live with my father,
who I live with for six years,

340
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:44.240
five to six years.
In that time,
I don't see my mother at all.
Um,

341
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.640
and my parents are both had the same parenting style,
which is out of sight,

342
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:51.000
out of mind.
And so I dreamt of my mother.

343
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.120
I had these huge dreams of who I thought she was.
They were,
you know,

344
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:56.340
Disney prone and very,
you know,

345
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.520
way too much imaginings of this dream girl in my life.

346
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:02.160
And so when I went back to Hawaii,
I thought it would to meet the good,

347
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:07.050
perfect son for her and like butch up and Wendy's like,
girl,
no,
that's not true.

348
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:09.690
I'm looking at you and I don't see that anymore.
And so I was like,

349
00:20:09.691 --> 00:20:12.350
I'm gonna hold onto it for a little while more for my mother.
Right.

350
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.280
Cause I think as children,
that's what we internalize.
We,

351
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.150
if we do the right things,
if we are perfect,

352
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.790
then our parents will truly see us and love us and accept us and give us

353
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:23.730
everything that we want.
And so sorry to interrupt you,

354
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:24.620
but I remember seeing that it worked,

355
00:20:24.621 --> 00:20:26.910
like you did so well at school and that kind of pride,

356
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.860
I think it was in line with what you're saying,

357
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.060
that's part of being the perfect child,
studying and getting good grades.
Oh yeah.

358
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:35.580
For sure.
And,
and so I think that I really,

359
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.750
I began and within that year I began really seeing my mother for who she was.

360
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.650
She was no longer this dream girl image of her.
She was herself.

361
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.040
And I think it,
it did not live up to,

362
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.350
no one can live up to the expectations you have in your head if someone,

363
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.950
and so from my mother there was a sense that she failed me and my child like

364
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:55.360
mine up in my adolescent mind.

365
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.430
And so I decided to just be myself after a while and I was like this pretending

366
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:04.600
to be someone else for her,
um,
is not working for me anymore.

367
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.370
And so that's when I accepted,

368
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:10.390
when these invitations a friendship and that's when we began going to the thrift

369
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:12.130
store and you know,

370
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.270
pulling stunts in the thrift store and like changing price tags for like the

371
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.850
color coded tag sales.
You know,
sometimes when you go on,

372
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.560
it's like the blue tags are 50% off.

373
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:25.090
And so we were very much like scheming and you know,
going in,
it was a mess,

374
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:26.680
but it was great.
You know what I mean?

375
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:29.710
It was like how we found agency with having very little resources.

376
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.480
We could go in with 10 to $15 and leave with tons of little soccer shorts and

377
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.370
high socks and shoulder pads for hip pads and all these kinds of little things

378
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:40.600
that we ended up doing and that we,

379
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.990
we carved out our own space for like womanhood together.
You know,

380
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:47.980
we develop that together.
Yeah.
And so,
and she's still in your life,
right?
Yeah,

381
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:51.350
she's still,
she's still my closest friend.
Um,
and I think it's,

382
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.800
it's very interesting.
We've like had points of,
um,

383
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.640
putting our lives went in separate directions at certain certain points.

384
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.260
I kind of write about it and when we came back to an adulthood,

385
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.710
really seeing each other again.

386
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.350
It's so great to have that shared history with someone,

387
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:11.650
but also just the sense that history also breeds so much intimacy because

388
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.910
there's nothing that I've ever had to explain anything to Wendy.

389
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.320
She just always has seen me and known me and affirm me and validated me and also

390
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:22.830
like nurtured me as a friend and like that's,

391
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.830
and I always think of like sisterhood and just good friendships in any kind of

392
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:27.521
relationships,

393
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:32.521
whether they're romantic or platonic or sisters or brothers or siblings.

394
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:35.120
Um,
that's the kind of relationship she's always had for me.

395
00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:39.010
And I think of what a blessing that was for me to be a 12 year old,

396
00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:43.990
to find that friendship and then to develop it and still have it now as a 30

397
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:45.340
something year old person.

398
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.260
<v 0>Totally.
So in addition to the people in your life,</v>

399
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.280
another theme that I saw come through was music as,

400
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.830
as something that you turned to me.
You already mentioned what a man,

401
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.480
but you know,
we,

402
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.040
I read about Aaliyah and I read about Toni Braxton and,
you know,

403
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.230
the list goes on.
I'm actually curious,

404
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:10.260
who do you think in today's music world would be the equivalent for a trans girl

405
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:13.420
to look up to or

406
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.123
that's important?

407
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.190
<v 2>I think pop culture is so personal.
Okay.
So I think it's hard to say like,</v>

408
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.970
I think some,
you know,
obviously trans girls,
it's,
we're not all the same,

409
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:28.780
so we would all like different kinds of music,
you know,
some may be into punk.

410
00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:32.200
That's not my thing.
You know what I mean?
Like,
so I think for me,

411
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:37.090
I was very like pop B oriented.
So that's why when Destiny's child,

412
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.460
you know,
came out with like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
And bills,
bills,
bills and you know,

413
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:47.030
say my name and independent woman,
like that was like my life,
you know?
Um,

414
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.950
and like I have like,

415
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.470
I basically have a whole chapter dedicated to like my love of Destiny's child

416
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:56.270
and Beyonce because it,
it just shows how like media representations,
right?

417
00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:58.430
Seeing yourself in media and someone else that,

418
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.290
whose experiences are completely different than yours,

419
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.600
but who just have something that resonates with you.

420
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.110
And I think that for all of us,
that's very personal.
But I think that for me,

421
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.950
I wanted to not only be literary in my references,
right.

422
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:14.090
Cause I talk about spending a lot of time in libraries and reading books by a

423
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:17.390
lot of women of color,
um,
like Toni Morrison and Alice Walker,

424
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:22.391
but also like these media representations of like Beyonce and Oprah Winfrey and

425
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:24.140
Diana Ross,
like,
um,

426
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.400
and all of these women just kind of gave me this whole composite of self that

427
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.290
really showed me.
So I think that's very personal,

428
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:33.020
but it's also very like shared to,
you know,

429
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:37.070
like I think we talked a little bit about,
um,
some of the points of pop culture,

430
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.430
you know,
yes.
Resonance for us.

431
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.680
<v 0>Totally.
Exactly.
So,
uh,</v>

432
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.640
have you encountered any of these women,
like since your books come out,

433
00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:48.474
like have you,

434
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.360
has there been any kind of like crossover or have you met any of them?

435
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.620
<v 2>No,
not yet.
Yeah,
not yet.
Beyonce.
I have not met Beyonce.</v>

436
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.580
<v 0>This is your chance to make it.
Okay.</v>

437
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.940
All right.
So I think we're,
we're getting a little bit close.

438
00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:07.640
I have a few more things that we could talk about and then we'll open it up for

439
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:09.410
questions.
So,
um,

440
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.890
I want to talk a little bit about your girls like us campaigns.

441
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.990
So tell us a little bit about where that started and where is that today?

442
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:18.610
Yeah,

443
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.820
<v 2>so it started,
um,</v>

444
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.080
it started specifically on Twitter at first.
And so it was,
um,

445
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.950
a Hashtag of solidarity and space to share resources,
stories,
experiences,

446
00:25:29.951 --> 00:25:33.730
and conversations between Trans Women and I started in March,

447
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.340
2012 and since then it's gone onto,

448
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:39.220
of course Google plus and Facebook and everywhere where you can kind of do

449
00:25:39.221 --> 00:25:40.870
hashtags.
And so,
um,

450
00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:43.510
tumbler you'll see a space for it and Instagram and all of these different

451
00:25:43.511 --> 00:25:43.811
spaces.

452
00:25:43.811 --> 00:25:48.811
So it's kind of like the social media campaign to claim space in virtual space,

453
00:25:49.211 --> 00:25:50.410
right.
Which nowadays,

454
00:25:50.411 --> 00:25:54.160
it's kind of real life space for Trans Women in a world where trans women often

455
00:25:54.161 --> 00:25:56.800
it's not safe for them to leave their homes.
I mean,

456
00:25:56.801 --> 00:26:00.260
I think that that's something that people don't often realize that um,

457
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:05.380
these social media platforms can be a lifeline for a lot of people who are

458
00:26:05.381 --> 00:26:07.480
struggling with identity,
who are struggling with self,

459
00:26:07.481 --> 00:26:12.130
who don't have validation and affirmation and real life friendships.

460
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.560
Because my experience is very bizarre that I grew up with a Trenton's
girlfriend.

461
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.230
Like my best friend was trans right at that.
I didn't grow up in isolation,

462
00:26:20.231 --> 00:26:24.340
but most trans women grow up in isolation.
They're often the only ones.

463
00:26:24.341 --> 00:26:29.200
And so to have a space for young and poor and all these different kinds of trans

464
00:26:29.201 --> 00:26:32.440
women to come together and say,
you know what,
in this space on Twitter,

465
00:26:32.441 --> 00:26:33.910
on Facebook,
on Google plus,

466
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.140
we can have a space that's our own that we can go to for a source of like

467
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.500
mirroring and reflections and sharing and sisterhood.

468
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.990
That's what girls like us has always been.
Um,

469
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.650
for me in my idea of what I wanted it to be,

470
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:50.460
I don't know where I'm taking it yet because I feel like there's just so much

471
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:53.220
going on,
but I,
I would like it to still,

472
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.640
I think that for me it would be creating a real life space for it.

473
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.850
And I think that it is still like a girls like us as a name and a,

474
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.140
and a brand is something that I want to have maybe for like a summer camp for

475
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:08.430
young trans girls.
Um,
that would be like my legacy project that I would love

476
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.420
<v 0>to do with that.
Great.
Okay.
And then I guess one more question.</v>

477
00:27:13.421 --> 00:27:17.470
So it seems like a lately,
even in the last couple of weeks,

478
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.080
trans visibility is popping up in the media,

479
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.800
perhaps more than I have seen it previously that you were featured in the New

480
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.010
York Times article last week,
uh,
alongside a lot of other trans folks.
Uh,

481
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.550
we've got Laverne Cox and orange is the new black.
Um,

482
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.290
do you feel like there's some kind of turning point brewing or what do you think

483
00:27:35.291 --> 00:27:38.590
is,
what do you think is next?
What has to happen next?

484
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.830
<v 2>I think what has to happen next?
I think it's like,
um,</v>

485
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.390
actions of true inclusivity,

486
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.270
meaning that Trans people are not these,
um,

487
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:55.300
objects to be gawked at and kind of say,
look at these trends superstars,
right.

488
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:57.070
That's a separate thing from us.

489
00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.800
I think that we really need to have more and more spaces.

490
00:27:59.801 --> 00:28:02.770
I think one that I would like to applaud that I was lucky,

491
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.030
lucky enough to be a part of and humbled to be a part of was the women's history

492
00:28:07.031 --> 00:28:11.830
month.
Google doodle.
Yes.
Right.
Which included two trans women of color in it,

493
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.640
right.
And Asian American,
Trans Women and myself.
And that's,

494
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.040
that's the kind of actions that really need to be happening I think in media

495
00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:24.041
platforms to really think about the points of intersection in which Trans Women.

496
00:28:24.191 --> 00:28:28.120
For me,
trans women are kind of how I sent him a lot of my politic,
um,

497
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.940
how we can include trans women and their different intersections.

498
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.930
And a lot of these spaces because trans issues are not its own separate issues.

499
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.470
It's a human issue,
right?
We all have a sexual orientation,

500
00:28:38.471 --> 00:28:41.770
we all have a gender identity and we really break it down in that way.
We,

501
00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.570
we see people as more complex,
um,

502
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.240
more across the spectrum of just speaking across difference.
And so for me,

503
00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:53.110
I would love for a big media moment to really happen where a media platform

504
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.580
takes,
um,
leadership and really sparking a conversation,

505
00:28:57.581 --> 00:29:02.230
say like a Time magazine creating a cover to say that this is the next civil

506
00:29:02.231 --> 00:29:02.770
rights movement.

507
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.290
This is something that we really need to begin really talking about.

508
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:07.210
Cause a lot of people do it as trend pieces.

509
00:29:07.211 --> 00:29:10.540
Like trans people are having a moment now.
And for me,
my entire life,

510
00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:13.810
trans people have been having moments,
you know,
it's just that you decided to,

511
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.790
you decided to pay attention now.
Yeah,

512
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.920
but like we've been having moments forever.

513
00:29:17.921 --> 00:29:21.990
Like Christine Jorgensen was like around in the 50s and like,
you know,
um,

514
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.690
Carolyn Casie was around in the eighties and nineties on the Arsenio Hall show.

515
00:29:25.691 --> 00:29:29.200
So none of this stuff is new.
Like it's kind of slick,
a call cyclical.

516
00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:32.410
And I think it's just media that says that,
oh,
this is hot now.

517
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.940
And so I think our culture is ready to develop language and to really discuss,

518
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:37.510
um,

519
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.080
discourse with trans people about their actual lives and not so much about what

520
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.050
do to their bodies because that's been tried and true and done.

521
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.620
So I think that a lot of the reason why there's been a lot of discourse lately

522
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:50.700
is because Trans women have been at a point to say that the way that you're

523
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.290
reporting on my life is not cute anymore.

524
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.010
And so this is why there's an issue with this and why it's reductive and why

525
00:29:57.011 --> 00:30:00.310
it's not enough and that,
yes,
and you need to see us as people.

526
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.750
I am a woman and that's who I am.
I happen to be trans and happen to be black,

527
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:06.490
but all of these things are a part of my experience.

528
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:08.140
And if you really want to engage with me,

529
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:13.060
please read my book first and then bring me on your show.
Hashtag shady queen.

530
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.090
Okay.
I,
you know,
this has been really great.

531
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:23.460
I could keep talking to you for hours,
but I won't.
Uh,

532
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.130
so it does anyone here in the room?
I have any questions.

533
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

534
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.660
<v 2>Oh yeah,
please use the microphone so that people on the livestream can hear.
Hi.</v>

535
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.070
I don't really have a question,

536
00:30:37.071 --> 00:30:40.160
but I just wanted to thank you for being willing to be in the spotlight.
Oh,

537
00:30:40.161 --> 00:30:43.160
thank you so much.
Very helpful.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

538
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.290
<v 3>I was just thinking about how you were talking about being seen for who you</v>

539
00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:51.600
really are.
Do you feel like,
uh,
you know,

540
00:30:51.601 --> 00:30:53.340
it's been difficult for people to see who you are.

541
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.340
Have you become very good at seeing other people for who they really are?

542
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.160
Was that difficult for you to,

543
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:00.940
<v 1>okay.</v>

544
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.280
<v 2>I think I can only really see people if they allow me to,
um,</v>

545
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:10.240
share space with their experiences and stories.
Right?
So for me,
I,

546
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.510
what I've learned in this entire process of being very visible is not to make

547
00:31:13.511 --> 00:31:17.830
assumptions about people's identities are lives or pains or points of access,

548
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.650
um,
or exile and oppression.
And so for me,

549
00:31:20.651 --> 00:31:23.530
like I think there's only so much you can tell about a person by just looking at

550
00:31:23.531 --> 00:31:28.210
them.
Um,
and so for me,
I think that as a trans person,
as a person of color,

551
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:29.110
as a woman of color,

552
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.040
I don't make assumptions about people anymore just based on my vein interaction

553
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:37.870
with them or how I may perceive them.

554
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.500
And so that's the one thing that I think that,
um,
I wish that we all would do.

555
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.490
So that's why I appreciate when there's points of conversation in group settings

556
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:47.950
when we say that,
you know,
what are your pronouns are?

557
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.280
You announce those things so that we don't assume what someone's gender is.

558
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.200
Cause you never know just based on looking on people.

559
00:31:53.201 --> 00:31:56.470
But I think that we've been,
we've grown up in a culture where we just kind of,

560
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.370
um,
we just assume people's identities and genders and that's not necessarily

561
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:01.630
something we should do anymore.

562
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.320
And I hope that that's what brings these conversations kind of spark and bring

563
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:07.270
up.
Um,
in terms of myself,

564
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:12.190
I find that oftentimes I'm invited to spaces and only expected to speak about

565
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.300
being trans.

566
00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.380
Whereas I think that my experience is so much more than just transition.

567
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.250
Not that speaking about transits alone is something that I shy away from or

568
00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:22.960
anything like that.
But I'm also a woman of color.

569
00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:24.020
I'm also someone that grew up poor.

570
00:32:24.021 --> 00:32:27.280
I'm also someone that as a teenager engaged in sex work because I didn't have

571
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:30.790
resources to have,
you know,
healthcare and all of these different things.

572
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.380
And I think that I can speak to,

573
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:35.470
but I'm not really called brought to the table to speak about that.
They're like,

574
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.070
Hey,
young woman,
we just want you to talk about being trans right now,

575
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.900
as if that's my only experience.
And most times when I navigate the world,

576
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:43.160
most people don't know I'm trans.

577
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.690
They often take me for a CIS gendered mixed black woman.

578
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.030
And what does that mean to be that kind of a woman,

579
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:53.000
someone that's objectified in the streets and all these kinds of different

580
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:53.990
points of intersection.

581
00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:58.550
And so I hope that we can have deeper conversations about people's identities

582
00:32:58.551 --> 00:33:02.270
and the true and what their lives and lived experiences are,
are actually like,

583
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.920
actually it could you define cisgender for those people who aren't familiar?

584
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.480
Sure.
Well such gendered is,
uh,
um,
so there's trans,
right?

585
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:13.560
I think most people understand what trans is and,

586
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:18.200
and sis is kind of the opposite in terms of a prefix.
So Trans Means,

587
00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:23.060
um,
to cross and sis it's kind of like chemistry terms,

588
00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:27.140
which is interesting,
but this is really getting inside baseball a little bit.
Um,

589
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.970
I don't even know what that means.

590
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:31.520
I just all of the often say that inside baseball cause I didn't even watch

591
00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:32.570
sports,
but uh,

592
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.880
but cis means on the same side of,
and so they're kind of,

593
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.890
so when you're talking about CIS gendered or six sets,

594
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.890
this sexual or transgender transexual trans often means to cross insists needs

595
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.120
to stay on the same side up.
So often we were talking about relationships with,

596
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.100
um,
your assigned sex at birth,

597
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:52.670
which we are all based on the way that our genitals may look when we're born as

598
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:54.530
babies.
You're assigned a sex,

599
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.860
which is often different from your gender expression.

600
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.620
And so that's kind of for CIS people.

601
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:04.700
They oftentimes most likely identify with the sex and gender that they were

602
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:09.400
assigned with at birth.
So they stay on the same side of worse Trans People,
um,

603
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.360
cross that are perceived to cross some kind of invisible barrier that we have in

604
00:34:14.361 --> 00:34:17.960
our culture about gender and sex and sex that's assigned at birth.

605
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.390
So I hope that I explained that well.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay.

606
00:34:21.391 --> 00:34:26.130
Are there any other questions from the room?
Okay.
Hey.

607
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.550
Hi.
First off,
thank you for being here.
This has been really great to watch.

608
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.360
There's this idea in the gay world,
um,

609
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:38.490
of guys or girls who can pass,
who,
uh,
you know,

610
00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:43.410
guys might be masculine or might not look like the stereotypical image of what a

611
00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:46.260
homosexual it looks like,
you know,
to society and whatever that means,

612
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:50.020
whatever that means.
But what it means in,
in day to day life is that they have,

613
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.460
they have to keep coming out in the workplace with new colleagues,

614
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.310
with new friends.
I have to keep saying,
Hey,
I'm gay by the way,

615
00:34:56.311 --> 00:34:59.400
and this is who I am.
Um,
because you can't tell.

616
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.460
Do you feel like you need to keep coming out in your life?
Um,

617
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.520
and maybe now it's a little different cause you're in the spotlight,

618
00:35:05.521 --> 00:35:08.190
but in general,
do you feel like you have to keep coming out about who you are?

619
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.780
Is that tiring for you?

620
00:35:09.781 --> 00:35:13.080
And do you ever just want to just be a young woman and live and not have to keep

621
00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:16.550
explaining who you are in life?
[inaudible] so for me,

622
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:19.940
I think that I write something that's a really great question.

623
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:23.540
I think that what we're talking about is also is,
um,
gender expectations.

624
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.950
And I think that's the link between,
um,
trends and lesbian,
gay,

625
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:32.020
bisexual people is this idea of gender expectations.
If you're,

626
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:36.220
if you're assigned male at birth and you're attracted to men,

627
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.110
that's not following the gender prescriptions that we prescribed in our,

628
00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:41.190
in our culture.
Right?

629
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.630
And so oftentimes that means that to be a gay man that is feminine presenting,

630
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.640
right?
Then people,
oh yeah,
that he's gay.

631
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.820
Whereas you can be a completely straight man and also be feminine presenting.

632
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.850
Right?
But we're talking about gender expectations,
right?

633
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.710
So like when you said that a man who doesn't,
who isn't,
um,

634
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.710
seen as homosexual and as it continued to come out because he presents in a more

635
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.250
traditionally masculine way,
even though he's attracted to men,

636
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:08.340
which often is prescribed as something that women do,
not necessarily men,

637
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:11.970
which is very simplistic.
Right?
Um,
and so for me,

638
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:15.880
I do have trouble with that and I come out,
um,

639
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.460
and I disclose my identity as a trans woman for political reasons,

640
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:25.660
often my personal life,
I don't,
it's not something that I do every single day.
Um,

641
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.680
I don't feel like it's people's right to know my story,

642
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.390
that my story is mine to towel in spaces of intimacy and relationship.

643
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.700
And if I feel like telling someone,
then I do.

644
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:40.440
But I never feel an obligation to often in public spaces I do if the,

645
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:45.270
if the context is to talk about or to place me sometimes as trans.
So it's like,

646
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.180
so why are you in this LGBT space with this man?

647
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.370
Because you look like a straight woman.
It's like,
well,
I am a straight woman,

648
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:53.760
but I am a trans woman.
And so it's like really unpacking that for,

649
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.690
for people oftentimes.
But I don't feel an obligation politically.
I do.

650
00:36:57.691 --> 00:37:00.810
And so I think that coming out or inviting people into your life is a

651
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:04.020
politicized movements that we all do in our personal lives.

652
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.170
And I choose to do that in certain strategic spaces,

653
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.280
but oftentimes I don't feel the obligation.

654
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.200
<v 0>Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.</v>

655
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.030
It doesn't look like there are other questions.
So I want to thank you,
Janet,

656
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.873
again,
for coming.

657
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.930
I want to let everyone know that redefining realness is available everywhere.

658
00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:26.730
Books are sold,
and I encourage you to read it.
I read it twice.
It's excellent.
Um,

659
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.520
yeah.
So thanks again,
Jennifer coming.
Thank you for having me.

660
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.570
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
