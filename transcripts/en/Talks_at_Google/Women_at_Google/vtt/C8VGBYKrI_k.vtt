1
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.020
All right.

2
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.020
So New York Times bestselling author and Co Creator of the whole 30 program has

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.970
helped millions of people,
uh,
achieve the weight loss and health goals.

4
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.620
And we're really excited to have her here today to talk hot on the heels.

5
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:28.040
I've heard at latest book release,
uh,
food freedom forever,

6
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.570
letting go a bad habit,

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.080
guilt and anxiety around food only released yesterday.

8
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.770
So we are right at the cusp of it and we're excited to have her here to talk to

9
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:41.180
us about what that's all about with the whole 30th and answer all our questions.

10
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.570
So please join me in welcoming with that to talk the Google.

11
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.603
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.950
<v 1>that's a pleasure to have you here today.
Thank you.
I'm really excited dated.</v>

13
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.450
I'm very excited.
Yeah.
Um,

14
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.600
as a person who's always super interested in all like the latest food crazes and

15
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:02.270
exercised phases as most of us are,
um,
it's really great to have you here.

16
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.720
I said you can kind of navigate things,

17
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:08.240
Beth and pal if you buy your eyes and all of that,
but I'm excited.
Perfect.
So,

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.650
I mean a lot of these people,
I already know all that,

19
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:15.180
the whole 30 am it's a very well known program and uh,
pretty amazing.

20
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:17.340
But tell us a little bit about it just to get us gun.

21
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.030
<v 2>Sure.
So you can think about the whole 30 like pushing the reset button with your</v>

22
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:23.490
health,
your habits,
and your relationship with food.

23
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
So for 30 days you'll eliminate foods that the scientific literature and our

24
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:31.530
clinical experience have shown to be really commonly problematic to varying

25
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.450
degrees across the broad range of people.

26
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.440
So you pull that stuff out completely for 30 days and you're going to evaluate

27
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:42.060
what changes,
energy,
sleep,
digestion,
mood scan,
athletic performance,

28
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:46.410
recovery cravings,
any kind of symptoms,
migraines,
asthma,
allergies,

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.191
all of this stuff.

30
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.280
You're going to see what happens in the absence of some of these potentially

31
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:53.220
problematic triggers at the end of the 30 days.

32
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.220
You then put those foods back in very carefully and systematically,

33
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:56.941
one at a time,

34
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.600
like a scientific experiment and you pay attention to what changes.

35
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.680
So does your digestion and get worst as your skin breakout.

36
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.880
Does that like shoulder pain comeback?

37
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.560
It allows you to figure out how food impacts you individually because there's no

38
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:14.820
one size fits all and it lets you create the perfect diet for you going forward.

39
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.210
<v 1>So who is the whole 34 is that for anyone?</v>

40
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.320
Like anyone can do that.

41
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.430
<v 2>I think everyone in the whole world to do the whole 30 but that's just me.</v>

42
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.901
You know,

43
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.740
we have a lot of medical doctors who are using our program with their patients

44
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:33.350
and seeing amazing results with things like high blood pressure,

45
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:36.290
high cholesterol,
type two diabetes,
autoimmune conditions.

46
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:40.370
But you don't have to be sick to benefit from the whole 30 so if you're just

47
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:42.800
looking for improved energy,

48
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:47.390
managing your cravings through reducing digestive distress or weight loss,

49
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.110
even though that's not the main focus of our program,
the whole 30 is for you.

50
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100
And so tell us a little bit more about what we can have on the whole authority.

52
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.010
We don't go that what we

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.030
<v 2>can.
I like that.</v>

54
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.930
I always like starting with the Kennedys because the list of no's can be a

55
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.930
little intimidating on the whole 30 so let's start with what you will be eating.

56
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.240
And I'm going to paint a really good picture.
So meat,

57
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.090
seafood and eggs ideally naturally raised and fed,

58
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.440
but you can have a animal protein and we encourage a moderate portion with every

59
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.100
meal.
So it's certainly not like meat,
meat,
meat.
It's not a carnivorous plan.

60
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:25.030
It's actually really moderate portions.
You're eating lots and lots of plants,

61
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.530
so lots of vegetables,
fresh fruit,
we're not afraid of things like potatoes,

62
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.070
sweet potatoes or fruit as a whole.

63
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.000
Natural kind of nutrient dense food.
You're eating good healthy fats.

64
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.930
So things like Avocado,
olives,
olive oil,
duck fat,
ghee,

65
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:42.850
coconut oil and coconut products.

66
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.060
And then you're doing herbs and spices and people who do whole 30 recipes like

67
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.340
those who guest post on our whole 30 recipes,
Instagram feed.

68
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.270
Get incredibly creative with these really hardy,
nourishing,
whole 30 minutes.

69
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.170
So if I wanted the Super Paleo double fudge,

70
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.550
whatever,
as long as the ingredients are like fake fudge,
can I,
oh,

71
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:07.870
you're setting me up now,
aren't you?

72
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.820
So there is a rule in the whole 30 that says you're not allowed to recreate

73
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.290
baked goods,
treats,
desserts,
junk foods with technically compliant ingredients.

74
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:22.291
So there is a way to make whole 30 compliant pancakes or muffins or cookies.

75
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.300
But remember the whole 30 is about changing your health,

76
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:28.450
but also your habits and your emotional relationship with food.

77
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.100
And these comfort foods are what make us feel so out of control.

78
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:35.170
We start eating and we can't stop eating them.

79
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.530
So if you're trying to change your habits and your relationship with food and

80
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:40.000
you eat pancakes,
muffins,
and cookies,

81
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:44.110
and then you do the whole 30 and continue to eat pancakes,
muffins,
and cookies,

82
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.120
how much are those things going to change?

83
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.950
So we do have a rule that says that's a no,
no.
So what about,

84
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.030
so you said we can have grit.
Yay.
I have this thing about fear.

85
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.590
I have a friend who says that.
Um,
no,

86
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:58.660
I never got that off of fruit that you're fine.

87
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:02.200
But if you found my fruit now and I have every morning and every afternoon

88
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.610
working here,
you'd be like,

89
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.930
I think I'm not like the person who might be able to do that as a dessert

90
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.630
replacement or whatever.
So again,
you know,

91
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:13.600
we don't generally encourage dessert replacement because even if it's a

92
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:17.110
healthier choice,
but we want to do is get you out of the habit of dessert.

93
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.560
Like I don't want you to feel like you have to have something sweet before the

94
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:24.690
meal can feel complete.
So if you want dessert occasionally,
like great eat at,

95
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.580
that's fantastic.
But I don't want you to feel like it's necessary.

96
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.960
I'm not afraid,
excuse me,
and not afraid of eating fruit,

97
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.560
but I don't want you to do is use fruit to satisfy your sugar cravings.

98
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.100
So if every day at three o'clock are used to having a snickers bar and then you

99
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:41.320
do the whole 30 and everyday at three o'clock,
you're like,
okay,

100
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:43.900
well I can't do a snickers bar,
so I'm going to do a Lara bar.

101
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.180
It's a better food choice,

102
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.110
but you're still feeding your brain the sugar that it's throwing a temper

103
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:53.230
tantrum for.
So you're not actually changing anything in that pattern.

104
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.210
So it's not just about what you're eating,

105
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:59.060
it's about why you're eating it and some of the emotional reasons behind that

106
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.480
relationship with that particular food.
So how does the whole 30 or they,

107
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.000
you get us those emotional relationships,
what do you,

108
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.970
you just don't eat it if you're having a sugar craving,
what do it like?
Yeah,

109
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.120
well let me know.

110
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.410
You know a lot of these traditional diets just ask you to like white knuckle

111
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:17.870
your way through them,
right?
They don't provide a lot of rationale.

112
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:20.390
They don't provide support.
They don't provide a big community.

113
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.350
They're not giving you alternatives to not eating the cookie at nine o'clock at

114
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.460
night.
So all you're doing is like willpower white knuckling your way through it,

115
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:31.080
thinking about what you're going to eat on day 31 they're like Carb,

116
00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:32.780
a Palooza that you're going to have,
right.

117
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.990
What we do on the whole 30 is provide alternatives.

118
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.890
So because we limit those comfort foods that you would normally reach for and

119
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:44.600
because we've got really strong recommendations against like,
okay,
well yes,

120
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:46.460
they're just homemade plantain chips,

121
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:48.980
but if you feel like you're not in control when you eat them,

122
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.480
is that really what you want for your whole 30 we forced people to find other

123
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:57.230
ways to comfort themselves,
to reward themselves,
to self sooth,

124
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.680
to show love with other people in their lives so that at the end of the program

125
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:03.320
you actually have some new habits to fall back on.

126
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.660
Not just the same habits with different foods.

127
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.790
What kinds of things can we use besides food to South Sudan?
Yeah,

128
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:12.470
you know it's funny,
it is tough,

129
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:16.040
but I said on Instagram the other day and so many people responded to it like

130
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:19.190
you're not looking for a cookie.
You're looking for a connection.

131
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.580
And so often what I find is people who rely on food for those emotional like to

132
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:26.210
fill that emotional hole,

133
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.940
like you're not going to find that at the bottom of a bag of potato chips.

134
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:31.940
And we all know this,
but we don't know what else to do.

135
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.260
So we end because the food is super normally stimulating,
incredibly rewarding,

136
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:40.460
and it's got low satiety factors like we over consume and then we feel even

137
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.390
worse about ourselves.

138
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:44.060
And then we say we're not going to do that again except that we do because we

139
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:45.200
don't know what else to do.

140
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.500
And I find interpersonal connection to be so key in relieving anxiety and stress

141
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:56.030
and having that motivation and that accountability and giving and receiving
love.

142
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:59.090
So I think the next time you find yourself in that situation where you're

143
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:02.510
reaching for food that you don't really want but you don't know what else to do,

144
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.930
reach out to someone else instead go see a friend,
you know,
text message,

145
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:08.210
phone call,
make it as personal as you can.
And I,

146
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.780
I really would find it hard to believe that that didn't relieve or fill you up

147
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:15.530
with what you are looking for.
Right.
And you have a whole,
a whole,

148
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:19.890
whole 30 community right to yes.
To reach out to you.
Yes.

149
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.920
The whole 30 community as incredibly robust,
fiercely loyal.

150
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.510
And I think one of the most positive and welcoming communities online.

151
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.450
We've got almost 2 million photos,
hashtag total 30 on Instagram right now.

152
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.830
I mean,
it is thriving and people are connecting with each other.

153
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:39.620
So if you don't have someone at home or in your community that you're doing the

154
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:40.490
whole 30 with,

155
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.240
you can come to my house and we'll make sure that you stay motivated and

156
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:47.180
accountable.
We'll answer your questions,
we'll provide you with support.

157
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:50.300
I have a lot of people who will snapchat me and say like,

158
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.700
I really want to cook you today.
I don't know what else to do.

159
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:54.650
And sometimes all they need is someone to say like,

160
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:58.560
you're not going out like that.
And they're okay and they keep going.
So I mean,

161
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:03.180
this is how connected I am to our community and my entire team.
So yeah,

162
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.220
I really am super proud of our whole 30 years.

163
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.440
<v 1>That's great.
That's really great.
Um,
so the person who like,</v>

164
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.540
I'm going to have a cookie today,
I can't resist.

165
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.300
They actually do it on the whole 30 program.
Then what happened?

166
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.210
<v 2>So ideally with the whole 30 if you go off plan,</v>

167
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:22.440
you start over and it's not because we're trying to be like a hazing or like the

168
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.900
bootcamp as Paleo because the basis,

169
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:28.110
the foundation of the whole 30 is an elimination diet.

170
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.610
You are eliminating these foods to see whether or not they work for you.

171
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.500
And the analogy I like to use this,

172
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.820
say you have 10 cats and you want to know if you're allergic to cats,

173
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.680
so you get rid of nine of your cats.
Do you feel better?
Like maybe,

174
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.850
but you still have a cat.

175
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:48.030
How are you supposed to know whether or not cats and you,

176
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.260
if you've still got one hanging out?

177
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:52.620
So you want to know if you're allergic to cats,
you have 10 cats,

178
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:53.880
you give up all 10 of your cats,

179
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.630
but like Saturday morning you like kick your heels up with the cat or Friday

180
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.850
night you're like,
I'm just going to have like one little cat,
right?

181
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.080
Whether that's pizza or a beer or whatever it is you're thinking about.

182
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.470
You can't accurately evaluate how these foods are impacting you if you're

183
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:09.540
including them.
Even a little bit in the plan.

184
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.310
So it's 100% elimination for 30 days and give it like a scientific experiment.

185
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.660
And if you do go off plan,

186
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:19.290
I really encourage people to start over both for the the kind of physiological

187
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:19.681
reasons,

188
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:23.550
but also because I want you to honor the commitment that you made to yourself 30

189
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.384
days.

190
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.990
<v 1>So you mentioned,
uh,
obviously Paleo in there.
Is the whole 30,</v>

191
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:32.150
just a Paleo Diet?
Are there differences?

192
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.380
<v 2>There are significant differences.</v>

193
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:37.800
It's based on the general framework of the Paleo Diet because the research

194
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:41.730
behind the foods that are eliminated on a paleo diet are pretty solid.
Again,

195
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.650
we're not saying these foods are good or bad.

196
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.850
We're not saying these foods are healthy or less healthy for you were saying

197
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.610
they're very commonly problematic to varying degrees.

198
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:54.480
And I don't know how they work for you until you do the whole 30 and do this

199
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:57.090
experiment and figure it out for yourself.

200
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.890
So the foods that you eliminate on the whole 30,
like grains,
legumes,

201
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:05.610
and dairy are all foods that are also off limits with the Paleo style diet.

202
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.250
But we do include potatoes in a whole 30,

203
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.040
because there were real nutrient dense food and lots of Paleo people say

204
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:12.090
potatoes don't count.

205
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.750
You're not allowed to do those like egg and banana pancakes that I talked about

206
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:18.300
and some of the Paleo treats and desserts that are out there.

207
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:21.210
So there are some differences.
Our program is for a very good

208
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.200
<v 1>specific purpose.
And so,
um,
when we were talking about,
you know,</v>

209
00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:30.250
we do this whole 30,
if we make it,
thank God,
um,
what happens next?

210
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.630
<v 2>Yeah.
So it can be scary and that's really what food freedom forever is about as</v>

211
00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:35.500
people did the whole 30.

212
00:11:35.501 --> 00:11:38.710
We've had millions of people do it and they have amazing success and they feel

213
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:40.060
like they really changed their habits.

214
00:11:40.061 --> 00:11:42.700
And it's like the first thing that's really worked for them and then they're

215
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:46.270
like,
okay,
now what?
Because I don't want to go back to the way that I was eating,

216
00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:50.200
but I don't know how to not do that,
especially in the face of a holiday,

217
00:11:50.201 --> 00:11:52.000
a vacation,
a stressful event.

218
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.330
So that's really what food freedom forever is about,

219
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:59.290
is it's a three step plan to help people kind of get past that short term

220
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:03.440
dietary intervention and turn what they've learned into a lifetime of health,

221
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.323
<v 1>the habits.</v>

222
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.470
So it kind of stemmed from the terror that people might feel and they're like,

223
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.940
oh,
I have to go back into the real world now.
The real food look like.
I mean,

224
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:16.150
maybe that's excitement,
but I think a lot of people,
it's also terrible.

225
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.940
<v 2>It's like we call it [inaudible] excited.</v>

226
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:20.180
It's like frightened and excited at the same time,
right?

227
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.400
You're excited to get back to some of the foods that you really love and see how

228
00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:23.971
they work for you.

229
00:12:23.971 --> 00:12:27.390
But at the same time you feel so good that you just don't want to mess it up and

230
00:12:27.391 --> 00:12:30.960
you're afraid that if you do let some of these foods back in,

231
00:12:30.961 --> 00:12:34.230
it's going to send you down this slippery slide of like feeling out of control

232
00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:36.120
again.
And so I had a lot of,
you know,

233
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.810
and I've provided a lot of guidance over the years about what to do but never in

234
00:12:39.811 --> 00:12:42.870
a really clear like step by step,
do this,
do that format.

235
00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:46.290
So this came from my community saying,
Mike,
I need more help.

236
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:47.970
I need more help in like after the whole thing.

237
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.970
<v 1>30 yeah.
You mentioned like the carb up Liza,</v>

238
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:54.660
that could happen immediately following your 30 day 31 Yay.

239
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:55.920
I can have all the pasta,

240
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.830
<v 2>but I don't think that's how it works.
All right.</v>

241
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.110
Tell us about the reintroduction.
Yeah,
so we did a survey.

242
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:04.980
I think we had more than like 5,000 well 30 years respond and of those people

243
00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:07.560
who finished the whole 30 and said at the beginning of their program,

244
00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:11.730
they thought they were going to want to eat all the things on day 31 75% of them

245
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:13.380
at the end said,
I actually didn't want to,

246
00:13:13.381 --> 00:13:16.740
I felt so different and things can change so much my tastes and change that.

247
00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:19.940
I didn't want to do that.
But in between the,

248
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.360
the whole 30 and you're sort of food freedom comes this reintroduction period.

249
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.880
Remember you eliminate and then you bring them back in.

250
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.650
So we've got both a 10 day kind of fast track reintroduction outlined in the

251
00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:32.550
whole 30 book.

252
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.180
And then we've got this kind of slow roll option for people who maybe don't want

253
00:13:36.181 --> 00:13:38.280
to bring everything back in within 10 days.

254
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.070
But the reintroduction is like the money of the program.

255
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.420
This is where you learn how these foods impact you and where you learn,
how,

256
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.620
how much and how often and what kinds of foods you can bring back into your life

257
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.110
so that it's delicious and healthy and feels sustainable,

258
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:55.710
but in a way that's not going to mess you up in terms of how awesome you want to

259
00:13:55.711 --> 00:13:55.980
look at it.

260
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.830
<v 1>I feel great.
So,
um,</v>

261
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.000
if we're slowly introducing things,
what does it look like?
Say Okay,

262
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.560
today is dairy day.

263
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.690
Do I go and eat like yogurt all day and top it off with like a dad milk and then

264
00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:11.430
have a brick of cheese and ice cream?

265
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.160
<v 2>Maybe not a brick of cheese.
Basically what you want to do.
Again,</v>

266
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:16.720
think of it like a scientific experiment.

267
00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:20.260
Dairy is going to be your experimental factor in the whole 30 is your control.

268
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:24.100
So your entire diet to the whole day is going to be whole 30 the only thing

269
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:27.670
you're adding back in his dairy.
So you would do your typical whole 30 breakfast,

270
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:29.860
maybe it's some poached eggs,
um,

271
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:34.060
maybe a little bit of avocado and like a veggie medley and some mixed berries.

272
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:36.340
But you're going to sprinkle some cheese on your eggs.

273
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.390
So you're going to add the dairy back in in a way that allows you to evaluate

274
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.220
just the dairy component alone.

275
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:45.040
And then you're going to go back to the whole 30 for two or three days and see

276
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:47.090
what happens in terms of the reaction.

277
00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:49.690
Because sometimes the reaction can take a day or so to manifest,

278
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:50.800
depending on how senator sensitive

279
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.980
<v 1>you are,
you don't</v>

280
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.980
<v 2>want to overdo it but slowly bring your down anytime.
Yeah.</v>

281
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.750
And you have to do enough of it to really see.

282
00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:58.730
So if you just put a drop of milk in your coffee,

283
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:01.490
like what are the chances that you're really going to notice an impact that you

284
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:03.050
want to do some cream in your coffee,

285
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.500
you know some cheese on your Omelette media side of yogurt with your lunch and

286
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:09.290
then at dinner you know some other form of dairy that you really like.

287
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:13.490
What you don't want to do is do you know a giant bowl of ice cream that also has

288
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:15.710
cookie dough that also has talked with chocolate syrup.

289
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.630
Cause then you're not going to know what's impacting you,

290
00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:19.940
the dairy or the gluten or the massive sugar bomb.

291
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.190
<v 1>All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
So what about people who like can,</v>

292
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.560
is there some way to do this if you don't want to go strict whole 30 follow

293
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.530
there.
They're pretty strict guidelines.
I think that they make a lot of friends.

294
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.820
That's a really great to find out.
But some people are like know.

295
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.160
So if I said I want to do this,

296
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.100
but I don't care how alcohol affects me,
I don't care if it makes me blooded,

297
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.180
I care for him.
It makes my skin break out.

298
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.610
I want to try to get rid of all the other things,
bring it all in.

299
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.200
Can I feel do a whole 30

300
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.490
<v 2>doing the whole 30 is a little like being pregnant.
You either are or you're not.</v>

301
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.990
There's no like kind of,
right.

302
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.040
So you know if you're going to do the program the way I'd describe it as like if

303
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.690
you're going to come play my game,

304
00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:05.170
you need to play by my rules and all I'm asking for is 30 days and all I'm

305
00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:07.960
asking is for you to trust me for one month and I've got seven years of

306
00:16:07.961 --> 00:16:12.850
experience backing up my recommendations.
But the whole 30 is not for everyone.

307
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:14.620
So if you're Vegan for example,

308
00:16:14.621 --> 00:16:18.160
you can't do the whole 30 as written because we're basically excluding all of

309
00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:20.740
your plant based protein sources and,
and you know,

310
00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:23.910
the rules are rigid and it's a lot to imagine giving up at once.

311
00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:28.480
It can be a very emotional journey.
So in food freedom forever,

312
00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:31.510
I have outlined several different resets that you can do,

313
00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:35.350
not all of which are as intense as the whole 30 but all of which will get you to

314
00:16:35.351 --> 00:16:39.070
the place where you know how food impacts you and you're in a better balance in

315
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:41.260
terms of your blood sugar regulation,
hormonal balance,

316
00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:42.640
digestion and immune system.

317
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.270
So the whole 30 isn't the price of admission for food freedom,

318
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.360
but I will strongly encourage everyone to do it and I do several times in the

319
00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:50.194
book.

320
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.160
<v 1>Awesome.
So,
um,</v>

321
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.870
if you're looking to do something that your book will give you a few different

322
00:16:55.871 --> 00:16:59.470
options for things,
I think,
yeah,
I did have the question as well as you know,

323
00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:02.390
if I'm that Jan Degan why can't have Phil,

324
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.670
I have Tofu like I would usually highlight on the whole 30 strictly,

325
00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:08.400
but you'd definitely give people the option.

326
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:08.880
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

327
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.360
there is a full vegan out Meegan Reese that outlined here and you're eliminating

328
00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:16.050
the most commonly problematic vegan protein sources.
Again,

329
00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:17.580
according to the literature and the,
and the,

330
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.490
and you know when all of the resets you're pulling out alcohol,
like,

331
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.520
come on guys,
you're going to hold on alcohol for 30 days.
Right?

332
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.520
And all of the resets,

333
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.630
you're eliminating added sugar and some of those process to kind of food with no

334
00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:31.830
breaks and some of those sweet treats and desserts and baked goods like all of

335
00:17:31.831 --> 00:17:35.700
the resets.
That's kind of the very baseline.
I'd be elimination.

336
00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:39.570
There's a basic reset outlined in here that's like as bare bones as possible.

337
00:17:39.571 --> 00:17:43.050
But what I say in the book with all sorts of tough love,

338
00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:45.930
emphasis on the love is if you're not willing to do at least this,

339
00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:46.880
like you're not ready for this,
this

340
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.000
<v 1>program right now.
That's fair.
I liked the top lab and the buckets.</v>

341
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.300
Yes,
of course.
That's very real.
You give a test,
right?
So yeah,

342
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.950
I very much appreciate that.

343
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.540
Have you ever had anybody go through the whole 30 program and do the whole,

344
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.020
the introduction?
I just like,
I don't notice anything different.

345
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.650
Like I don't notice any of my allergies flare up or whatever.

346
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.270
The whole time.
Is it anything like that?

347
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.031
<v 2>Sometimes,
you know,</v>

348
00:18:13.031 --> 00:18:17.890
the whole 30 doesn't work super well for absolutely everybody.
For some people,

349
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.200
food may not be your biggest issue.

350
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.310
If you've already been eating really squeaky clean or close to whole 30 ish and

351
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:26.290
you're already,
you know,
pretty healthy.

352
00:18:26.291 --> 00:18:28.060
Like maybe there's something else going on.

353
00:18:28.061 --> 00:18:30.940
Maybe it's because you're only sleeping five hours a night or your overtreat you

354
00:18:30.941 --> 00:18:34.450
know,
you're doing today crossfit sessions and not recovering actively.
So,

355
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.490
you know,
food might not be your biggest issue.

356
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.940
The whole 30 also can't fix everything.
So if you've got this,
you know,

357
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.690
underlying undiagnosed got infection or you've got an autoimmune condition that

358
00:18:43.691 --> 00:18:46.600
you've been living with and it's been progressing for the last 20 years,

359
00:18:46.601 --> 00:18:49.780
like the whole 30 might give you a good start towards feeling better,

360
00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:53.230
but you may need to work with a functional medicine doctor to make sure you know

361
00:18:53.231 --> 00:18:55.330
that you're getting the treatment that's applicable for you.

362
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.690
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.
Um,</v>

363
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.720
the other thing that I think can be problematic is that whole thing around

364
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:08.150
social networks,
families.
How do you navigate that?

365
00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:11.750
I know like going to my mom and say,
ah,
I'm not even written gay.
I'm not having,

366
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.450
Oh God,
I'm not.
She'll just be like,
oh,
don't come home.

367
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.730
<v 2>Right.
Right.
What do we do?
So not what you just said.</v>

368
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.340
That's a terrible way to do.

369
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.910
I actually have three chapters in food freedom forever about how to talk to

370
00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:27.580
friends,
family and coworkers about food.
Three chapters,

371
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.990
not overkill because talking to friends and family about food is third only to

372
00:19:31.991 --> 00:19:35.290
religion and politics in terms of how divisive it can be.
You know,

373
00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:38.470
you start talking about food and changing your diet and immediately people get

374
00:19:38.471 --> 00:19:41.620
judgmental,
they get defensive.
Like you don't have to do anything.

375
00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:44.950
You can just roll up to the table with your whole 30 meal on the entire table.

376
00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:48.820
All of a sudden it feels like it's being attacked.
So you know what I like to,

377
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.840
what I like to say is a,
don't have the conversation over food,
right?

378
00:19:52.841 --> 00:19:53.770
Have it away from food.

379
00:19:53.771 --> 00:19:58.330
And ideally ahead of time be you always want to lead with all of the positive

380
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:03.331
things and you want to make the conversation as personal as is appropriate for

381
00:20:03.551 --> 00:20:06.610
your relationships.
So if you're talking to your mom and you say,
you know,

382
00:20:06.611 --> 00:20:08.740
I hear the whole 30 is really good for cravings,

383
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.920
that's not going to particularly bring you close together.
If you say,
mom,

384
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.040
you know you sent me home with your chocolate chip cookies the other day and I

385
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:18.370
said I was only gonna eat one and I ended up eating five and it makes me feel

386
00:20:18.371 --> 00:20:21.280
really bad.
I'm on myself that I can't control what I'm eating.

387
00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.030
So I'm going to do this experiment for 30 days where I tried to kind of break my

388
00:20:25.031 --> 00:20:27.250
reliance on sugar and change my cravings.

389
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.640
It means I won't be able to eat your cookies,
but it's only for a month.

390
00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:34.390
And when I get done I'll be able to really enjoy them the way you want me to

391
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.030
write.
That's a totally different conversation.

392
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.420
So make it personal and then make it relatable.

393
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.760
So if your mom is mostly sedentary,
you saying,

394
00:20:42.761 --> 00:20:45.790
I'm going to do the whole 30 and I'm hoping to cut my five k time by three

395
00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:46.624
minutes.

396
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:51.810
Not if you know your mom also suffers from cravings or sleep or energy issues,

397
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.070
you know,
bond with her and that level man,

398
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:57.040
every day at two o'clock my head's on my desk and I feel like I need caffeine

399
00:20:57.041 --> 00:20:59.530
and chocolate.
You know what I mean?
Oh yeah,
me too.

400
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.190
I'm going to do this whole 30 because it's really meant to kind of reset your

401
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:07.000
energy levels and give you that sort of awake feeling without meeting extra

402
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:09.730
caffeine and now she's like listening,
right?

403
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.850
So those are my best tips is that you also say maybe you should do it with

404
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.080
valor.
Tread very carefully with that.
You guys,

405
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:19.990
you know the phrase I like to use as lead by quiet example.

406
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.380
You can ask for her support and I'm,
will you support me in this?

407
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:24.520
If I'm having a tough day,

408
00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:26.890
can I call you and have you tell me what a good job I'm doing?

409
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.010
But you don't want to ever push someone into trying to do it right.

410
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.670
Instead just lead by quiet example.
Look awesome.
I feel awesome.

411
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.060
Talk about your results here.
Non scale victories.
Hey Mom,

412
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:40.660
you know I saw a plate of cookies at the office today and I wasn't even tempted.

413
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:43.750
I feel so good.
What a great you know,
sign that is.

414
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.830
And then just the back because at some point they will say like,

415
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.970
what have you been doing?

416
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.030
Tell me a little more about it and maybe it will take them a while to get there.

417
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:53.830
But you know,
you just do you

418
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.800
<v 1>talk to me a little bit more about non scale victories because I think our</v>

419
00:21:58.801 --> 00:22:03.360
society is really obsessed with like that number that appears on it.

420
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.110
How do you get away from that?
What are the,
what are things to fellows?

421
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.690
I mean that's a good example.
Yeah.
And away from the cookies,
I think

422
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.773
<v 2>it's huge.</v>

423
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.540
And so one of the other rules of the whole 30 is that you're not allowed to step

424
00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:16.530
on the scale for 30 days,
which for sun is the hardest rule of them all.

425
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.490
But it is not a weight loss program and it is not about weight and I am,

426
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.390
you know,

427
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.290
I think we all need a break from letting us like $20 a hunk of plastic hold our

428
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:27.420
self esteem and self confidence hostage.

429
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.470
So we focus on what we call non scale victories and in hole 30 lingo it's

430
00:22:31.471 --> 00:22:35.730
Hashtag Nsbe and what people will do is look for things like you know,

431
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:37.080
maybe some of them are physical,

432
00:22:37.081 --> 00:22:41.580
maybe it's Oh I I'm down a belt loop or the my wedding ring now fits it was too

433
00:22:41.581 --> 00:22:46.050
small and now it fits.
I love hearing that.
Maybe it's a craving thing.

434
00:22:46.051 --> 00:22:49.050
Like I didn't need the cook.
I was able to walk past the cookie year.

435
00:22:49.051 --> 00:22:53.040
I didn't need the candy bar.
Or I finally feel like I'm in control of food.

436
00:22:53.041 --> 00:22:56.460
Maybe it's digestive,
maybe it's skin glowing and clearing up.

437
00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:58.050
We hear a lot of that,
you know,

438
00:22:58.051 --> 00:23:01.860
maybe it's I went to my doctor and my blood sugar is that are managed or I'm no

439
00:23:01.861 --> 00:23:03.120
longer type two diabetic.

440
00:23:03.121 --> 00:23:07.080
But there is this huge list of non scale victories in a pdf we give you on the

441
00:23:07.081 --> 00:23:09.780
whole 30 sheet and it's like check them off people because the more you can

442
00:23:09.781 --> 00:23:12.180
check off,
the more motivated you'll be to continue.

443
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.680
<v 1>And so even after the whole 30,
is it still no scale or you like ethics gal?</v>

444
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.590
<v 2>Um,
you know,
I,
I'm,
I'm anti scale if getting on that number actually matters.</v>

445
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.780
If you like with trepidation,

446
00:23:24.781 --> 00:23:27.360
close your eyes and cross your fingers before you step on that scale.

447
00:23:27.361 --> 00:23:30.480
Maybe it's better to get off the scale.
I have a scale at my house,

448
00:23:30.481 --> 00:23:34.660
I use it to weigh my suitcases,
68 pounds for this trip,
68,
uh,

449
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.340
or two way my son.
And occasionally I'll step on and just kind of see where I am.

450
00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:40.050
But like it doesn't mean anything.

451
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:44.590
So I am okay with weighing yourself before and after because for some people you

452
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:44.760
know,

453
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.810
obviously understand weight loss is a big goal for a lot of people and I don't

454
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:49.700
want to minimize how amazing it is.

455
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:53.510
If you can eat just the tidy and not count calories and still lose weight like

456
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:55.430
awesome.
But you know,

457
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.270
if that number is going to ruin your day or make your day,

458
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.010
maybe you should examine your relationship.

459
00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.060
<v 1>But the scale only pair really fair in terms of other sort of technologies.</v>

460
00:24:06.731 --> 00:24:08.800
I mean we're good,
all we kinda care about that.

461
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.960
Are there things that you're onboard with?
Again,

462
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.840
things that are helpful but fine.
I'll like that.
Fitness trackers.
Wearables.
Yeah,

463
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.850
guys like the posture coach and

464
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.540
<v 2>all of those four that you mentioned in your before.
Yeah,</v>

465
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.770
I don't know about the Hapi fork.

466
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.880
It vibrates to let you know if you're eating too quickly.
So,

467
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:27.840
but it's like 80 bucks.

468
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:30.220
So I'm like maybe you could just stop eating like you're in prison.
You know,

469
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.840
one of my favorite card,
I do like the wearables.

470
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:37.560
If you are the kind of person who is motivated by like seeing your results,

471
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.040
then things that can improve on the whole 30 or that you'll notice is like

472
00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:44.460
naturally your steps will go up because you'll feel better and you'll want to be

473
00:24:44.461 --> 00:24:47.250
more active and you'll park further away and you won't sweat taking the stairs.

474
00:24:47.251 --> 00:24:48.180
So like that's cool.

475
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.570
Your sleep quality can be able to track your sleep and whether you're falling

476
00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:54.990
asleep easy or sleeping longer,
getting more restful sleep,
awesome.

477
00:24:54.991 --> 00:24:58.890
Non Scale victory on the whole 30 so if you can find some of those little kind

478
00:24:58.891 --> 00:25:02.880
of ways to not only track your progress but like tie it to like,
oh wow.

479
00:25:02.881 --> 00:25:06.990
It's stuff that you wouldn't necessarily,
I guess link back to your diet,

480
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:10.800
taking more stuffs.
But if you see a change in that it can be really motivated.

481
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.620
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

482
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.120
I have one last question for you before I open it up to everybody who's probably

483
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.430
dying to ask you things like stop talking,

484
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:23.410
but I'm curious about just changing the whole relationship about good and bad

485
00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:27.860
foods and how do you even like get to that spot?
Because I think it's hard.

486
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.340
It's very hard for people to know that,
you know,

487
00:25:30.341 --> 00:25:32.050
it's not necessarily like this is good for you,

488
00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:35.470
this is bad for you or you're a good person or a bad person.

489
00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:38.860
You talked a lot about the language of food.
How do we change that?

490
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.280
<v 2>Really important.</v>

491
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:43.700
I think the language of food is often what's holding us hostage and our

492
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:48.140
relationship and what I really emphasize in the whole 30 and often feed freedom.

493
00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:51.920
It's like these foods that you're eliminating.
It's not because they're bad,

494
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.230
there's no like good or bad food.

495
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.840
You're pulling them out and putting them back in because they're unknown.

496
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:57.620
That's it.

497
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.400
You just want to figure out how they work for you and you are not good or bad

498
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:03.140
based on the food that you put on your plate.

499
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.010
And I think once we can get past the idea of,
you know,

500
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:12.190
be our self worth being tied to what our body weight is or what size of jeans we

501
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:17.330
fit into or whether we are the exercise or or the healthy person.

502
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.630
I think it makes a huge difference in letting food be more fun and easy and

503
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.290
playful and rewarding and like a joyful,
I'm not trying to take any of that away,

504
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.000
so I write a lot about the idea of a growth mindset and changing your language

505
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:32.834
and just kind of,

506
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.980
it's a real shift or reframe with from the Diet Culture we've had for the last

507
00:26:39.351 --> 00:26:44.280
20 years where it was all about deprivation and restriction and willpower and

508
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.360
good foods and bad foods.
And like,
I want to change all of that paradigm,

509
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.530
<v 1>but learning to kind of think about it in a different way than you do.</v>

510
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:54.300
I mean it just seems so high,

511
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:57.790
but I think that you give a lot of great tips in the buck,
soiled them all.

512
00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.080
But yeah,
I think it's a challenge that that needs to be solved.

513
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.470
So related to like the goods and the bads.

514
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.800
<v 2>Yeah.
But you know,
the more you practice that and,</v>

515
00:27:06.801 --> 00:27:10.040
and I talk about things like leaving postit notes around your house.
Like,

516
00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:14.450
it sounds kind of silly,
but the more you can reinforce the ideas behind,

517
00:27:14.451 --> 00:27:15.050
you know,

518
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:19.400
I'm a healthy person with healthy habits and I'm living a healthy lifestyle and

519
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.700
you know,
this is a scientific experiment.
It's an experiment.

520
00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:27.620
It's not a diet and the more you can kind of reframe and I really emphasize that

521
00:27:27.621 --> 00:27:28.820
over and over again,

522
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.880
I think the better chance you have of that actually sticking and,

523
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.150
and changing your foods and changing your relationship with foods and feeling

524
00:27:35.151 --> 00:27:37.550
like you're building new healthy habits will only serve to reinforce.

525
00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:42.600
<v 1>That's great.
All right guys,
open it up.</v>

526
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.250
We have [inaudible] right.

527
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.840
Hi.
Hi.
Thank you so much for coming.
This is really interesting.

528
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.160
And as someone who's like generally a health focused eater but also kind of

529
00:27:58.681 --> 00:28:00.750
hasn't ever really dieted.
Um,

530
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.360
I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on your last point

531
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:04.710
there about the idea of like,

532
00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:08.430
after you're done with the whole 30 kind of not putting,

533
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:11.370
thinking about foods is good and bad because I know I've,
you know,

534
00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:15.300
I don't know too much about the whole 30 but I've seen periods where people like

535
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.250
on my Facebook or whatever doing it.

536
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.990
And to me it always kind of worries me the idea of saying like,

537
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.380
you can't have these things.
Um,
and you know,

538
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:28.710
it seems a little bit sad if after the whole 30 would end then you still feel

539
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:31.110
like I can't have,
you know,
the cookies I can't have,

540
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.720
even if you end up being okay with dairy and eggs.
Um,

541
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.960
and you know,
eating disorders are also a thing that like happens too.

542
00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:44.010
So I guess what's your perspective on after people finished the whole 30 and

543
00:28:44.011 --> 00:28:47.430
they figured out what they can and can't have then transitioning to be like,

544
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.241
okay,

545
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:51.090
like now we're going to bake pumpkin cookies and like I'm going to have one and

546
00:28:51.091 --> 00:28:52.200
that's okay.

547
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.610
<v 2>That's a really great question.</v>

548
00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:58.020
And that's so much of that all or nothing is the Diet mentality,
right?
I need,

549
00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:01.260
they're on this diet and I'm white knuckling my way through it or on face first

550
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:05.010
in a box of donuts.
And so I start from the very beginning,

551
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:07.800
from your elimination period with the whole 30 saying,

552
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.560
you're not eliminating these foods because they're bad.

553
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.700
They're just unknown and you just want to figure out how they work for you.

554
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:19.701
And it's not the whole three 65 it's the whole 30 so it's a 30 day kind of

555
00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:22.770
scientific elimination period.

556
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.030
And then after that I want you to live in your food freedom.

557
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.720
I want you to figure out what does work for you and what doesn't.
In fact,

558
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:33.000
the goal I propose in food freedom forever is this.

559
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:38.030
I want your diet to be as broad and expansive as possible while still looking

560
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:43.380
and feeling as awesome as you want to look and feel and you get to draw outline.

561
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.740
I'm not drawing it for you.

562
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.210
So I have figured out that I can get away with a couple of glasses of wine here

563
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:49.661
and there.

564
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:53.830
Some Justin's peanut butter cups here and there my mom's chocolate chip walnut

565
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:57.280
cake and like still look just as awesome and I still feel just as awesome.

566
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:01.660
So guess what I do because it makes my life so delicious and healthy and

567
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:06.490
rewarding and happy,
like emotionally healthy.
So I want you to do that.

568
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:10.480
And if you start from the beginning not thinking about these foods as bad and

569
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:11.800
that's why you're eliminating them,

570
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:15.100
then you shouldn't feel the same guilt when you bring them back in.

571
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.190
I don't want you to feel guilty reintroducing these foods.

572
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.450
You may make the wrong choice.

573
00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:23.260
Sometimes I may overdo it on the wine or my mom's chocolate chip while my cake

574
00:30:23.261 --> 00:30:25.360
and I'm like,
wow,
that was a poor decision.
You know,

575
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:28.600
I don't feel as good and my energy's down,
my mood is down.
Okay.

576
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.530
So I learned from that and I apply it the next time that situation comes up.

577
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.940
But I encourage everyone to find that like line,

578
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:41.140
how much can you get away with so that your life is amazing and rewarding and

579
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:46.030
delicious and satisfying and full of your family and friends traditions while

580
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:49.450
still maintaining all of the health benefits you want to maintain.

581
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.150
So yeah,
thanks.
Just to follow up on that,

582
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.740
what if you do overdo it and just like completely fall off after you've done

583
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:04.630
your health?
So one of the steps in food freedom forever,
so it's,

584
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:06.070
you know,
you do your reset,

585
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.150
you live your food freedom and you acknowledged that your habits have slept.

586
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.830
So I have built right into the plan that you will fall off the wagon.

587
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.800
Isn't that relieving?
Because all of these diets are like,
oh,

588
00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:21.460
you're going to do our 21 day detox and then you'll never ever have to dye it

589
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:23.800
ever again.
And like everything's going to be magically changed.

590
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:27.760
And that's completely unrealistic even for a program as good as the whole 30 and

591
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:30.070
it's good and changing people's habits.

592
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.340
Eventually you fall back into old ruts,

593
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:37.090
your trend to overwrite decades of less healthy behaviors and associations and

594
00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:40.180
emotional relationships with food.
You're not going to fix that in 30 days.

595
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.020
So if that happens,
you just come back to your reset,

596
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.950
whether it's a full whole 30 or maybe a whole three or a whole seven,

597
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.630
however long you need to feel back in control and to get that,

598
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.340
you know,
energy and sleep and mood and digestion,
rock and again,
cool.
You know,

599
00:31:57.341 --> 00:32:00.730
it works.
You know how to do it,
you know it's gonna make you feel amazing.

600
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.450
And then as soon as you're done,
as soon as you're able to,
as soon as possible,

601
00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:06.340
because I want you to get right back to your food freedom.

602
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.060
You're back to living in your normal healthy balance again.
It's like simple.

603
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.950
And you continue that cycle literally in perpetuity until ideally you never need

604
00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:18.760
another whole 30 ever again.
I'll probably never do a full 30 ever again.
No,

605
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:23.590
I don't need it right each time.
Of course it does.
It gets easier.
You learn more.

606
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:26.680
You become more selective about what's worth it for you.

607
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.360
You identify foods that maybe don't work for you,
but it's really nuanced,

608
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:34.780
you know,
oh,
I didn't notice this after my first whole 30,
but by my third,

609
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.820
I don't think this is worth it anymore.
Yeah.

610
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.980
It gets easier and it just becomes what you do.

611
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.490
You no longer even have to think about it.

612
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:45.970
<v 1>Yeah.
Cool.
Hey,
my name is Brooke.
Thanks so much for coming.
Um,</v>

613
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:50.240
I'm on day 10 of whole 30 run for Yay back.
Um,

614
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.000
I've done it.
This is my fourth time.
Um,

615
00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.760
I started a year ago and I swear to God,
it's like completely changed my life.

616
00:32:56.761 --> 00:33:00.470
So if anyone's doubting,
like you absolutely have to try it.
Um,

617
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.600
I don't do the gluten or the dairy or alcohol anymore and it's completely

618
00:33:06.301 --> 00:33:08.820
changed my life.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Um,

619
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:13.230
so with all of these resets and then having over the course of the year,

620
00:33:13.231 --> 00:33:14.880
decided to eliminate those things.

621
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.440
The one thing that does change it does kind of keep me going back to old 30 is

622
00:33:19.441 --> 00:33:23.910
the fact that like the sugar thing sneaks in.
So if it's like our fucking,

623
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:28.590
sorry,
I love gummies.
Um,
and I love like,
um,
almond milk,

624
00:33:28.591 --> 00:33:31.050
ice cream and stuff like that.
Yeah.
Um,

625
00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.650
but I noticed that actually interestingly enough,

626
00:33:34.651 --> 00:33:39.210
like I lost a lot of weight at the beginning and then eliminating all the foods

627
00:33:39.211 --> 00:33:43.170
that affect me poorly.
My weight's actually kind of gone back up.

628
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:48.240
I'm wondering what maybe like the scientific reason for that is and if it is the

629
00:33:48.241 --> 00:33:50.700
sugar,
like,
I mean that would make sense,

630
00:33:50.701 --> 00:33:54.960
but like I've heard also before perhaps that like your body kind of like level

631
00:33:54.961 --> 00:33:59.370
sets and like kind of recalibrates after,
um,
you know,

632
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.780
you kind of eliminate all these things.

633
00:34:00.781 --> 00:34:02.400
I was just wondering if you could speak to that.
Yeah,

634
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.250
<v 2>there's like a million questions that would have to ask you.
So,
you know,</v>

635
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.260
do you have a history of Yoyo dieting where you like lose and kind of gain kind

636
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:11.880
of,
uh,
how,
how long were you sleeping every single night?

637
00:34:11.881 --> 00:34:14.550
What are you doing for exercise?
Is it high intensity stuff?

638
00:34:14.551 --> 00:34:17.580
Are you adequately recovering from that?
What is your life stress look like?

639
00:34:17.581 --> 00:34:20.820
Like we would sit down and have like a serious therapy session for me to talk

640
00:34:20.821 --> 00:34:22.650
about.
Maybe it's the food,

641
00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:28.130
maybe you know a food journal can be very helpful in this situation because I

642
00:34:28.381 --> 00:34:29.370
might say,
do you like how are you?

643
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.350
How are you eating after your whole 30 book and you're like,

644
00:34:31.351 --> 00:34:32.220
I'm doing pretty well.

645
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.950
And then if I made you write down every single thing like that,

646
00:34:34.951 --> 00:34:37.500
weighing or measuring,
just write it down.
You're like,
oh wow.

647
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.590
That new bar and almond milk ice creams coming back like a couple of times a

648
00:34:40.591 --> 00:34:43.890
week.
And you know,
we were having a conversation before about the planes,

649
00:34:43.891 --> 00:34:47.670
the bags of plantain chips.
You think they're healthy.
If you Hoover one of those,

650
00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:52.640
it is like 560 calories and it's not,
the calories don't count.
Right?
So you know,

651
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:55.950
it's basically like a mini meal all unto itself.
So maybe a food journal,

652
00:34:55.951 --> 00:35:00.060
maybe it's the food,
but maybe food isn't your biggest issue anymore.

653
00:35:00.061 --> 00:35:03.490
And maybe it's time to look at things like caffeine consumption in sleep or how

654
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.650
what you're doing for training and recovery or what's going on with your life

655
00:35:07.651 --> 00:35:08.041
stress.

656
00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:12.690
I know a lot of people who go on vacation and immediately they lose like 10

657
00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:15.450
pounds even though their eating habits dramatically change.
And I'm like,
well,

658
00:35:15.451 --> 00:35:19.410
shocking.
You have no stress on vacation.
Everything's easy and simple.

659
00:35:19.411 --> 00:35:22.440
So there's just so many factors that kind of play into that.

660
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.710
Consider keeping a journal just for a few days after your whole 30 just to see

661
00:35:25.711 --> 00:35:30.240
if stuff is kind of sneaking back in and then maybe consider going to work with

662
00:35:30.241 --> 00:35:31.290
a functional medicine doctor.

663
00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:34.440
Doing some very basic testing could be an underlying undiagnosed,

664
00:35:34.441 --> 00:35:38.040
got infection for example,
really common in some these cases.

665
00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:41.160
So it could be a number of things,
but it's not always food.

666
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.460
And I find when people do multiple whole thirties they kind of want to tie

667
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.550
everything back to food and like food's a huge part of it,

668
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:51.720
but it's not the only part.
Thank you.
Yeah,
you're welcome.
And good luck.

669
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:52.803
<v 0>Okay.</v>

670
00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:00.770
<v 3>Awesome.
Thanks for coming.
Uh,
two questions.
First one is the simple one,</v>

671
00:36:00.771 --> 00:36:02.300
just when you travel,

672
00:36:02.301 --> 00:36:05.870
how do you prepare for that and what foods do you personally have?
A,

673
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:07.460
the second one is more just like,

674
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:12.140
I'm curious on your journey to actually write this book and like be interested

675
00:36:12.141 --> 00:36:17.120
in this because I had tons of dietary issues earlier and I was placed on the low

676
00:36:17.121 --> 00:36:18.500
FODMAP diet.

677
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.520
It's just like whole 30 but stricter and it was phenomenal change in my life.

678
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.060
Now I'm like very paleo with a side of sugar.

679
00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.260
And so just curious how you got to this point.

680
00:36:30.261 --> 00:36:32.870
Was it like you hit some mark and then you were like,
wow,

681
00:36:32.871 --> 00:36:34.430
I need to change my life?
No,

682
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:38.300
<v 2>I did.
Uh,
I'll answer the first question first about travel.
I,
so I,</v>

683
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:42.320
my bag on the way to for this book tour was 68 pounds and I'm pretty sure six

684
00:36:42.321 --> 00:36:44.990
times and that were meat sticks,
like a Turkey sticks.

685
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.460
So I always pack a ton of emergency food and I've had a really healthy protein

686
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.680
because that's the hardest thing to find when you're traveling.

687
00:36:51.681 --> 00:36:54.050
It's easy to find fruit and nuts and seeds.
But,

688
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.220
so I'm packing like epic bars and wild bars and DNX bars and like the meat,

689
00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.060
you know,
sticks.

690
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.180
I've got literally anyone wants to try one and got like seven in my bag right

691
00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:06.290
now.
Um,
I do as much research as I can ahead of time.
So when I land,

692
00:37:06.291 --> 00:37:08.210
I know where the local health food store is.

693
00:37:08.211 --> 00:37:11.810
I know where the local grocery story is.
I know a few good lunch options.

694
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.440
I've already looked at the menu to make sure I can kind of wing it like anywhere

695
00:37:15.441 --> 00:37:17.020
at this point that I still want to,
you know,

696
00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.320
make it as easy on myself as possible so that when I get there I already have

697
00:37:21.321 --> 00:37:24.800
kind of a plan and I'm not like stuck in rush hour traffic after a really long

698
00:37:24.801 --> 00:37:27.890
flight,
super hangry with no where to go for food.

699
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.820
I make sure that my hotel has a refrigerator so I can stock up on a few things

700
00:37:31.821 --> 00:37:35.720
at the grocery store.
Um,
so those are some tips that kind of make it easier.

701
00:37:35.721 --> 00:37:39.770
I wrote an article called business travel one on one oh one on whole thirty.com

702
00:37:39.771 --> 00:37:44.480
that lays out my incredibly anal retentive travel plan because I travel so much

703
00:37:44.481 --> 00:37:47.210
and it's really important to me to make it as stress free as possible.

704
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.580
As for my journey,
um,
I was not always a really healthy person.

705
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.380
I'm actually a recovering drug addict.

706
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:58.010
I've been clean for almost 17 years and that

707
00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.640
flat for that,

708
00:38:01.641 --> 00:38:05.090
like I got myself messed up so I'm not sure you should applaud me getting messed

709
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.190
up,
but it's,
it is a big deal.

710
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:12.250
And I started in health and exercise and nutrition when I got out of Rehab

711
00:38:12.591 --> 00:38:16.100
because I knew that I had to change everything about my life to stay clean.

712
00:38:16.101 --> 00:38:20.420
I had to adopt that growth mindset and convince myself that I wasn't some

713
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:24.140
degenerate,
worthless loser who couldn't change her life.

714
00:38:24.141 --> 00:38:28.280
So I started exercising and I started eating healthier and I got some fitness

715
00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:32.110
certifications and ran a crossfit gym for a while and did some Kettlebell

716
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:32.691
coaching.

717
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:37.691
And that was really where my path started was through my own transformation.

718
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:41.440
And so if you've done the whole 30 knowingness about my background,

719
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:44.440
like the rules kind of makes sense.
The rigidity kind of makes sense.

720
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:48.280
The sort of steps in the community kind of makes sense because it was all of the

721
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:52.660
things that I needed to get and stay clean 17 years ago.

722
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:56.980
So yeah,
there's a chapter on that here because if you looked at me now,

723
00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:58.510
I think a lot of people would say like,

724
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.600
what do you know about feeling out of control with your food?

725
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:04.690
I've never been overweight.
That's not a struggle or a battle I fought.

726
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.530
But trust me when I say I had fought my battles and drugs and food are not that

727
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:13.420
different in terms of the impact they have on the brain and cravings and reward

728
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:17.680
and your social interactions and your self confidence.
And so I do.
Right.

729
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:24.070
<v 1>Thanks.
Just follow up quickly on the,
um,
the food,</v>

730
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.120
um,
going out to eat vacations,
that sorta thing.
Um,

731
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.310
I think one of the great things about Google,

732
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.630
there's 90 is that we had got a menu every day and we see all of the things

733
00:39:34.631 --> 00:39:38.230
that's a bit better available to us and it gives you all of the allergens.

734
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.060
But when you go to a restaurant,
you don't have that.

735
00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:43.960
So people who are not in this world,
like,
how do you navigate?
Are you,

736
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.880
what do you say?
How do you go out for dinner?

737
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:47.430
<v 2>Yeah,
this is totally my process.</v>

738
00:39:47.431 --> 00:39:49.920
The first thing I do is go on Yelp and I look at,

739
00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:53.790
and I do a search for like American new or grass fed burger or vegetarian

740
00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:57.360
breakfast because for some reason the vegetarian breakfasts tend to kind of lead

741
00:39:57.361 --> 00:40:00.120
me to like the grass fed organic kind of farm to table places.

742
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.090
I look at the menu.
If the menu looks pretty doable,

743
00:40:03.091 --> 00:40:04.800
I'm looking for simple protein options.

744
00:40:04.801 --> 00:40:09.540
So it's like a steak or grilled fish or eggs or a burger.
Like,
cool.

745
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.270
I look at the sides.
Do I have a bunch of Veggie choices?
Like great.
Um,

746
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.740
occasionally if I have to,
I'll call the restaurant ahead of time and say,
look,

747
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.070
I'm walking in like this is my stuff and I don't make a big deal out of it.

748
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.050
I don't eat this,
this or this right now.
Uh,

749
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.650
do you have options that would accommodate me or when I come in,

750
00:40:25.651 --> 00:40:29.550
can I make some requests?
I had a lamb burger at the Breslin last night,

751
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.620
so good.
But they don't do substitutions.
That's very helpful to know upfront.

752
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.370
So I walked in and you know,
I did no been no cheese and they did that,

753
00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:41.430
but they wouldn't substitute my salad dressing for a different dressing cause it

754
00:40:41.431 --> 00:40:42.310
was cream based.

755
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.080
So I just asked for lemon and a little bit of olive oil and they were cool with

756
00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:48.240
that.
But it's good to know ahead of time.

757
00:40:48.241 --> 00:40:52.050
So just do your research ahead of time and then when you get there,
you know,

758
00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:55.170
make your order and be as matter of fact and kind of polite as possible.

759
00:40:55.171 --> 00:40:57.120
The bigger a deal you make about it,

760
00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:00.000
the bigger a deal everyone else is going to make like so don't walk in there and

761
00:41:00.001 --> 00:41:00.781
be like,
oh,

762
00:41:00.781 --> 00:41:03.840
I know it's so weird and I'm going to be your special person and I'm so sorry.

763
00:41:03.841 --> 00:41:07.380
Like,
no,
can I have this?
Then can I not have the button and not have cheese?

764
00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:10.680
And can you sum the fries for,
I see you've got Broccoli in this dish.

765
00:41:10.681 --> 00:41:13.440
Can I just get some Broccoli steamed on the side?
Thank you so much.

766
00:41:13.441 --> 00:41:14.730
And then you tip very generously.

767
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.440
That was actually one of my questions.

768
00:41:19.441 --> 00:41:22.500
But the other question is how do you find the right time to do this?

769
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.510
I always feel like,
oh,
I can't,

770
00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:26.960
this month I have two client events or I can't next month it's,
you know,

771
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.750
thanksgiving or like how do you find or prioritize the right 30 days to start?

772
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.440
That's a really great question.
So first of all,

773
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:36.020
you want to remember that it's not just 30 days,

774
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:39.230
it's 30 days plus reintroductions.
So I see people sometimes we were like,

775
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.320
oh my day 31 is my trip to Italy.
And I'm like,
Ooh,

776
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:44.630
you're really gonna have a hard time reintroducing there.

777
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.900
And if you don't reintroduce,
you're missing a lot of the benefit of the program.

778
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.660
So what ideally you're finding a 40 day block.

779
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.830
I want you to not do the whole 30 ideally over the holidays.

780
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.860
Like that's just right.
That's just like asking for trouble.

781
00:41:57.861 --> 00:42:01.160
Plus during the holidays you've got a lot of these like once a year,

782
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:05.000
really special family foods and I don't necessarily want you to miss out on
that.

783
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:10.100
So find a 40 day block where you don't have like an a level raise or you're not

784
00:42:10.101 --> 00:42:13.250
getting married that month or you don't have a once in a lifetime vacation to

785
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:16.310
Croatia.
But a client event is not a good enough reason.

786
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:20.870
I want you to figure out how to do this and all of life's circumstances,

787
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:24.950
bridal showers,
family dinners,
client events,
business lunches,

788
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:28.340
like you need to figure out how to live in your food freedom,

789
00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:31.130
which may or may not include these foods going forward.

790
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.770
So don't schedule around.

791
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.250
You'll never find 40 days where the only thing you're doing is staying at home.

792
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:39.230
Watching Netflix,
like that's not going to happen,

793
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.770
so make sure it's nothing that's so special.
You won't want to miss it,

794
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.970
but I would include some of those kind of every day,

795
00:42:46.971 --> 00:42:51.230
but still special ish occurrences and then figure out how to make it work.
Right.

796
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.260
You're ordering a sparkling water with lime and your justice festive and you're

797
00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:59.330
just as cheersing and it's just as happy in that hour.

798
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:01.523
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

799
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.670
<v 3>Hi.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah,</v>

800
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.860
three and a half years in counting and loving it and loving every minute of it.

801
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.640
I have one situation that continues to be challenging,

802
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.560
which is at this point,

803
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.340
pretty much everyone in my life knows that I have eating habits that they might

804
00:43:23.341 --> 00:43:25.470
consider a quirky or bizarre or a bit,

805
00:43:25.471 --> 00:43:27.220
get us a convention wisdom or whatever it is.
Yeah.

806
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.550
Occasionally I'm a guest in someone's house,

807
00:43:29.551 --> 00:43:33.300
which happened actually this weekend where,
oh,
you can eat everything.

808
00:43:33.301 --> 00:43:38.301
It's all gluten free and full of honey and artificial sweeteners and rice flour

809
00:43:38.881 --> 00:43:42.930
and all kinds of things that I'm not going near.
Um,
how do you prepare for,

810
00:43:42.931 --> 00:43:44.610
well I know how I prepare internally,

811
00:43:44.611 --> 00:43:48.510
but how do you prepare socially for those situations and handle those with a

812
00:43:48.511 --> 00:43:51.570
well meaning host who is actually going against everything that you want.

813
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.790
<v 2>I totally get that.
And I had that situation at,</v>

814
00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:58.020
at the holidays this past year where I was served to pasta full of ricotta

815
00:43:58.021 --> 00:44:00.670
cheese and was like,
oh,
this is going to be tough.
Uh,

816
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:05.400
are you on the whole 30 during this situation or is this just your food freedom

817
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.180
part of your free treat?
Your,
okay,
so you're not on the whole 30.

818
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.490
So this is one of those situations where you have to kind of way sticking to

819
00:44:14.491 --> 00:44:18.630
your preferences versus really hurting someone's feelings.

820
00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:22.710
Ideally you're having a conversation ahead of time if at all possible.
Hey,

821
00:44:22.711 --> 00:44:24.060
I just want to let you know,
you know,

822
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.070
just like if you were a vegetarian for example,

823
00:44:26.071 --> 00:44:28.710
I just want to let you know that I don't eat this,
this,
and this.

824
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.860
That's going to be a problem with your menu.
I'd be to bring in Dash,

825
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:35.220
let me know what I could contribute when you get there.
You know,

826
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:37.470
if they've gone out of the way and said this is all gluten free,

827
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:39.000
but it's full of this other stuff,

828
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.150
then it comes down to how bad is it gonna mess you up.

829
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:47.180
If it's going to seriously mess you up with migraines or headaches or are as

830
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.250
not,
or whatever,
then you have to politely decline and say,
you know what,

831
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.710
I really would love to and I'm so,

832
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.930
so thankful that you took the time to prepare this,

833
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:58.260
but I really have a bad reaction with artificial sweeteners and if I eat it,

834
00:44:58.261 --> 00:45:01.260
this is going to happen.
So I'll politely decline.
But thank you so much.

835
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.000
If it's just a preference,

836
00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:03.770
<v 0>okay,</v>

837
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:07.490
<v 2>then you have to think about like I might just take one for the team and eat as</v>

838
00:45:07.491 --> 00:45:12.170
little as possible as to be polite,
uh,
share with someone else,

839
00:45:12.171 --> 00:45:15.290
pass your plate onto someone else,
take a bite or two and say,
this was amazing.

840
00:45:15.291 --> 00:45:16.340
Thank you so much,

841
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:19.610
but I'm saving for the next course if you know it's more edible,

842
00:45:19.611 --> 00:45:23.000
but this is where you kind of have to weigh like hurting someone's feelings and

843
00:45:23.001 --> 00:45:27.110
being gracious against what is really just a preference and not an actual like

844
00:45:27.111 --> 00:45:28.010
sensitivity.

845
00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:33.460
So I ate three bites of this pasta with ricotta and I knew the dairy was going

846
00:45:33.551 --> 00:45:36.380
to kill me.
Like I spent the rest of the night not feeling well,

847
00:45:36.381 --> 00:45:40.400
but it was a woman I didn't know.
I didn't have any opportunity to communicate.

848
00:45:40.401 --> 00:45:42.650
I ate a couple of bites,
I passed it along and said,
you know,

849
00:45:42.651 --> 00:45:44.330
I'm really saving for the next course,

850
00:45:44.331 --> 00:45:48.080
which I knew I could totally eat and I stepped it up and took it.

851
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.560
And so sometimes you just kind of have to decide what's worth it for you.

852
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.560
<v 0>Yeah.
Great.</v>

853
00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:58.850
<v 3>Um,</v>

854
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:03.590
my wife doesn't eat eggs and I was wondering what kind of like interesting

855
00:46:03.591 --> 00:46:07.790
options for breakfast that uh,
you would do during that whole 30.

856
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.600
<v 2>I love that question.
We get that question all the time.
In fact,</v>

857
00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:11.470
in the whole 30 book,

858
00:46:11.471 --> 00:46:14.440
there's a whole like intro about what you can eat for breakfast if you're not

859
00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:17.230
eating at [inaudible].
So,
um,
first of all,

860
00:46:17.231 --> 00:46:19.720
I really encourage people to get the idea of breakfast,
lunch,

861
00:46:19.721 --> 00:46:22.630
dinner out of your head.
We just call them meal one,
meal two and meal three.

862
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.930
And for meal one,
I'm just as likely to have a burger as I am to have an Omelet.

863
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:28.870
The other morning I literally cooked in Burger from I get and I like that was

864
00:46:28.871 --> 00:46:32.020
our rec fest and it was amazing.
So,
um,

865
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:37.230
you can have absolutely anything you want leftovers for breakfast or uh,

866
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.880
you know,
cook any kind of protein that you want,

867
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.020
but if you want more of a breakfast,
he feel we do have some really good recipes.

868
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.940
So think things like,
you know,

869
00:46:45.941 --> 00:46:50.941
ground chicken and apples and sweet potato and a few diced walnuts with like a

870
00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:56.530
little apple cider vinegar,
like a warm hash style,
you know,
sausage,

871
00:46:56.531 --> 00:46:58.780
whether it's pork sausage,

872
00:46:58.781 --> 00:47:03.730
ideally pastured organic or some kind of chicken sausage would be a good choice.

873
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.810
Um,
soups in the morning or good.
I also love a good breakfast salad,

874
00:47:07.811 --> 00:47:09.070
which I know sounds weird,

875
00:47:09.071 --> 00:47:11.830
but I got into the habit of eating salad first thing in the morning when I was

876
00:47:11.831 --> 00:47:15.280
in Scandinavia and just fell in love with the idea.

877
00:47:15.281 --> 00:47:18.220
So meeting breakfast salads with some sort of protein on top of that,

878
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:19.560
just feel dip.

879
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.810
So almost so different that it's like cool that you're reading it for breakfast,

880
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.200
but there are a lot of,
you just Google whole 30 egg free breakfasts,

881
00:47:26.201 --> 00:47:28.900
you will come up with a million different ideas from our community.

882
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:30.640
<v 1>Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

883
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.950
Any other questions from the audience?

884
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.120
Not that gives us perfect time for you guys to get the book,

885
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:45.070
get some signing gun and that we want to thank you so much for being here.
Yeah,

886
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.150

This was really fun.</v>
