00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.840
Lindsey is going to be talking to us today about the intersection between food

2
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:15.790
and our emotions.
And I'm super excited for her to be here.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.270
She's been featured on Oprah,
the Lisa Oz show.

4
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:23.020
She's been in real simple,
so we're very,
very lucky to have her.

5
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:27.460
She lives in Pittsburgh with her husband and her pup,

6
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.340
Winnie Cooper,
who is exceptionally cute.

7
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.950
And today we're going to hear Lindsay talked to her,

8
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.650
talked to all of us about some of the concepts in her book.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.110
We are going to have a Q and a at the end.

10
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:42.130
So start thinking about your questions and there is a dory for everybody who is

11

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.990
So go ahead and add your questions and for those of you live,

13
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.840
if you ask a question,
we are going to be giving you away a book.

14
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:57.841
So start thinking about questions and I'm super excited to welcome Lindsay to

15
00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:58.774
the stage.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.070
<v 2>Thank you.
Hey everyone.
Thank you so much for being here.</v>

17
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:09.900
And uh,
we get to fruit and Veggie at up via pantsuit and the stage.

18
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:14.040
So we've got to bring a little fruit and veggie life to Google today.
Um,

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.030
I want to start off by just telling you a story and how it kind of all of this

20
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:22.230
came together for me with food and mood and really how I became the food mood

21
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:25.440
girl and why I care about this.
Uh,
in 2011,

22
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:30.441
I graduated from nutrition school and as a fresh graduate I was so excited to

23
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.970
bring nutrition knowledge to everyone everywhere.
I mean,

24
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:40.710
I was so into healthy living and juicing and eating right.
I mean,

25
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:45.711
I was eating keenwa before came all was cool when it was like $15 a pound,

26
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.110
you know what I mean?
Like you could only find it in a certain specialty stores.

27
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
And with this I decided that I felt the need to educate friends and family,

28
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.140
you know what I mean?
And by educating,
being like,
Ooh,
what's on your plate there?

29
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.980
Pizza again?
What are you eating?
And just,
you know,
I,

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.820
I cared so much about health that I wanted people to have this knowledge and I

31
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.110
wanted people to get excited about,
you know,

32
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.200
eating fruits and vegetables and eating Keenwa and uh,
and all of these things.

33
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.440
And I kind of had this judgmental approach though,

34
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.340
and all of this kind of came to a head in the Pittsburgh airport.

35
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.930
So let me tell you this story.
It was,
uh,
right after I graduated,

36
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.420
I was on my way to a nutrition conference.

37
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.810
So I had just got out of western Pennsylvania,

38
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.150
like the Mecca of meat and potatoes.

39
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.790
I don't know if anyone has ever been to Pittsburgh before,

40
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:42.870
but we put fries on salad.
So I was like,
oh,

41
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.800
I'm going to be with all of my nutrition people,
all of my health peeps.

42
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.140
There's going to be 5,000 of us at this conference.

43
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.810
We're going to be doing cal shots off yoga mats.

44
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:53.430
It's going to get real crazy up in here.

45
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.550
So I'm a recovering type A perfectionist.

46
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.830
So I go to the airport like 10 hours early because I'm like,
am I gonna?
You know,

47
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.664
I don't want to be late.

48
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.530
So I get to the airport early and I was like,
you know what,

49
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.740
this would be a great time to write a blog about this,
you know,

50
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.670
six benefits of juicing Kale and why you need to do it in your life.

51
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.960
So I get to the airport early and I decided to write.

52
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.700
So I look over at this,

53
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a little section in there and there was probably like 10 tables and no one was

54
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.470
sitting there.
And I was like,
oh this is great.
I'll go sit there.

55
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.640
This was perfect.
So I go,
I get my,
you know,

56
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.980
I get my hot water and of course I bring my own tea bag wherever I go cause

57
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.690
can't trust the,
the airport tea.
And so I get my,

58
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.370
get my hot water,
I get my tea,

59
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:44.050
I set up this little station for myself and I'm like,
ah,
writing about Kale,

60
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:44.950
this is so great.

61
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.730
So like five 10 minutes go by and all of a sudden I see people coming out of

62
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:54.670
this door and this little section and I look up and I say,

63
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.810
I see it says employees only.
So I'm in this employees only section.

64
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:01.780
I didn't realize that I was and I was like,
well,
you know what,

65
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.340
I'm not being bothered to each his own.
It's,
it's all good.
We're gonna,
you know,

66
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.400
I'll just stay here.
If someone kicks me out,
you know,
it'll be fine.

67
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.240
So another like five,
10 minutes go by,
and this is early,

68
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:17.980
this is like seven o'clock in the airport and all of a sudden this woman comes

69
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:22.330
out of this door and this,
I'm going to do the best impression of her that I can.

70
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.160
She comes out,
she's on her cell phone and she's like,
I hate this place.

71
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:31.120
This place sucks.
F You.
And I'm like,

72
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.320
oh my goodness.
I'm like,
what is wrong with this woman?
I'm like,

73
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.610
does she not realize I made like a funkshway thing here?

74
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.340
Like this energy is just not good for what I have going on,

75
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.270
but she's just like miserable.
And she comes out of the employee only section.

76
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.540
I'm like,
whatever.
She left,
I was like,
okay,
you know,
to each his own.

77
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.310
I'm going to go back to writing about Kale.
So another five,

78
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:56.590
10 minutes go by and this woman comes back

79
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.210
and this time she had a tray full of food and of all the other nine tables she

80
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:07.990
could sit.
Where do you think she sat
directly in front of me.

81
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.660
But at this point my computer was blocking,
you know,
kind of like blocking her.

82
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.610
But I'm sitting there and I'm like,
she's in a bad mood.
She's miserable.
Uh,

83
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.930
I was like,
I kind of want to know what she's eating because remember I cared.

84
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.720
I cared.
I was,
I wanted to educate people,
so,

85
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.380
so I was like,
should I look?
Shouldn't I?
And I was like,
okay,

86
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:31.870
I'm going to look what she's eating because clearly she was in a bad mood and I

87
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:35.350
need to see what's going on with her,
so my computer's up right.

88
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:36.700
And I can't really see.

89
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:40.930
So I'm like all of a sudden you just see my head like peek out from my computer

90
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.730
to try to get a glimpse of what's on her tray and I could not make this story up

91
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:46.564
if I tried.

92
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.770
This was about seven 30 in the morning now on her tray,

93
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.300
this woman had a large Ben and Jerry's chocolate milkshake.

94
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.750
Some people are like,
ah,
isn't that considered kind of a smoothie?

95
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.340
And I kind of want those for breakfast myself as if that wasn't enough.

96
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:09.341
She then had a large bowl of chocolate ice cream with whipped cream on top right

97
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:13.340
next to the milkshake as if that wasn't enough.

98
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.200
She then had a large Omelette with Hash browns and she's just pouring ketchup on

99
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:23.090
it and this is at seven 30 in the morning and the the health coach in me is

100
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.690
like,
oh my God,
does she not know what she's doing?

101
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.450
Does she not knowing that what she's eating is directly affecting how she's

102
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:33.350
feeling and the reason why she's coming out here and she's so miserable and

103
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.720
she's flipping out is because of all this food.
And I was so angry with her,

104
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:40.010
I was like,
oh,
I want to tell her.

105
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.190
I want to tell her that there's more out there for her.
But I was like,
Lindsey,

106
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.210
you're going with your nutrition peeps.
You're going to be with them.
And like,

107
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.720
you know,
a couple hours,
just calm down,
relax.
You're not trying to get arrested.

108
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:53.180
So I was like,
okay.
So I got the,
you know,

109
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:55.580
I put some essential oils or something on me and was like,

110
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.880
we're going to calm down.
So then five,

111
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:03.800
10 more minutes go by and I hear some shuffling and I'm like,
do I look?

112
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.580
Don't I look?
But then I'm like,
I'm kind of all are already invested.

113
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.260
I need to know what she's doing.
So again,

114
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.300
peeking around the computer at like seven 35 seven 40 in the morning,

115
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.040
this woman now pulls out a lunch box cooler.
I'm like,

116
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.390
are you kidding me?
More food,
like what could you possibly need?

117
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:26.390
And then I'm calculating it.
I'm like,
you just ate 3,200 calories,

118
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.340
87 grams of sugar,
there's probably a 87 chemicals and that that milkshake,

119
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.200
and I'm getting so upset with this woman,
I just,
I'm like,
ah.
So I'm like,

120
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:41.120
okay,
calm down.
But then she pulls out her lunchbox cooler.
I'm like,

121
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:44.930
okay,
I need to see what she has in it.
And at like seven 40 in the morning,

122
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.290
this woman on her tray pulls out five prescription medications and one by one

123
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:53.810
she slurping them down with her chocolate milkshake.

124
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.730
And at this point I am furious with this woman.
I'm like,
oh my goodness,

125
00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:01.490
do you not realize that what you're eating is directly affecting how you're

126
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:04.040
feeling and all of these medications?
You know,

127
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.180
you would have to take them if you would just like eat properly and you know,

128
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.780
you,
ah,
I was just so frustrated.
I could not believe that this was happening.

129
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:15.910
So at this point I like throw my computer to like put my laptop down.

130
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.800
I'm just looking at her like it is on.
But then I'm like,

131
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:23.120
I'm not really going to do anything,
but I was like,
it is on.

132
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.470
And I just couldn't believe that someone could do that to themselves to,

133
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.000
to eat that way and then you know,
think that the medication was going to help.

134
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.100
So at this point I was really engrossed in this woman and I was just like,

135
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.130
I need to know everything and what you know,
what she's doing.
But I was like,

136
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.040
just calm down.
So I was trying to calm myself down and I was just,

137
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:48.620
but I just kept staring at her and then like five more minutes go by.

138
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.630
And then this is when everything changed.

139
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.260
It's seven 30 in the airport and this woman pulls out her lunchbox cooler once

140
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:59.940
again.
And I'm like,
more food,
more drugs,
like what could you possibly need?

141
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:06.300
And at seven 45 in the airport,
this woman sits,
sits back and her,

142
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.360
her chair,
she takes a sigh,

143
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.750
she looks at her food,
she looks at the tray,

144
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:17.370
she looks at the drugs and she looked defeated like,

145
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.720
like the food and the drugs and all of that.
Just one.

146
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.600
She pushes her tray forward.
She grabs her lunchbox cooler once again.

147
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.200
And in the middle of the airport,
this woman opens up the cooler.

148
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.680
She lifts up her shirt,
she rubs herself with alcohol,

149
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.630
and she injects herself with an insulin shot.

150
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.840
And at this point,
I was no longer mad at this woman.

151
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.720
I was no longer frustrated with this woman.

152
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.310
I really was able in that moment to see a reflection of my own self and the

153
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.620
trajectory of the path that I was on.
I thought,

154
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:01.560
what if at the end or the beginning of the day,
this woman,

155
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.730
the only thing she had to make her feel better was that chocolate milkshake.

156
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.860
She clearly didn't like her job.
She was irritated at someone on the phone.

157
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.830
And what if that was the only thing?
And,
and if she was diagnosed with something,

158
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:20.160
being diagnosed with any disease,
um,

159
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.440
and I know personally is,

160
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.070
is a challenge and it's something that you need to work through.

161
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.680
And so when I watched this woman,
I was at first,

162
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:35.850
so judgmental and I realized,
you know,

163
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.590
she was no different than me and I was no different than her.
The,

164
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:42.720
the difference is I was able to,
uh,

165
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.260
to choose a different way and to,

166
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.180
to get on a healthier track because when I was 12 years old,

167
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.660
I suffered from anxiety.
I was actually hospitalized at age 12.

168
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:55.320
I was taken out of,
out of school,
put Ivs in my arm,

169
00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.890
and I too used food to fill a comfort to fill a void that I felt within myself,

170
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:07.290
my low self esteem.
And so when I watched her,

171
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.670
I realized I was no different than her.
And here I had been judging people,

172
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.840
judging my family,
and judging my friends,
judging this stranger at the airport,

173
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.200
uh,
when really what I needed to,

174
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:24.660
to start to understand and foster was real empathy and meeting people where they

175
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:28.350
are because we don't know.
We don't know,
uh,
someone's life.

176
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.890
We don't know what they're struggling with.
Um,
and,

177
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.920
and it's meeting them where they are and actually listening.

178
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.520
So this moment actually changed the entire trajectory of my career because I was

179
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.180
this crazy judgmental person when it came to food and nutrition.

180
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:48.120
Thought I knew it all,
wanted to evangelize everyone I met.

181
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.050
And what I realize is that it's a lot deeper than that.

182
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.660
And so today I kind of want to share with you some of these principles that I've

183
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:57.100
learned not only in my own journey,

184
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:02.101
but through working with people and through seminars and through just hearing

185
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.120
people's stories when it comes to food.

186
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.720
And the first thing that I truly believe when it comes to food is that we were

187
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.000
born emotional eaters.

188
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.860
And I know that's kind of a bold statement because so many of us,

189
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:19.330
when we think of emotionally eating,

190
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.980
we think of the breakup with the ice cream or we think of a stressful day at

191
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:28.030
work and I want pizza or a burger,
fries.
Uh,
and that's,

192
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.640
that is one aspect of it.
And it is a spectrum,

193
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:34.900
but a true are true being are emotional eaters.

194
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:39.730
What does a baby,
a newborn do when they're hungry?
They cry.

195
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.700
What did I do yesterday when I was hungry,
I had cried.
We,

196
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.780
uh,
we're no different from that.
And so,
uh,

197
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.020
because I truly believe that we're emotional eaters,
uh,

198
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.630
and I look at it as really a positive thing.

199
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:57.670
I look at it as something that we can learn from,

200
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:01.810
that we can foster that empathy within others and with our,

201
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.140
in ourselves and learn more about ourselves through realizing that,

202
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.300
which brings me to my next point,
which is listening,

203
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.880
listening to your body.
So many times,
uh,
we,
you know,

204
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:20.170
how many of us have ever been on a diet before?
It's like everyone,

205
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.080
it's like 99.9% of people in the world.

206
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.880
I really want to meet like the 0.01 person that's never been on a diet.
Uh,

207
00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:30.580
but maybe you've done the buddy system.

208
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:33.010
How many of you have done the buddy system where you're like,
yeah,

209
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.090
we're doing this together and you know,
we're,

210
00:13:35.091 --> 00:13:39.100
we're going on this plan and it's going to be great.
And so,
you know,
maybe it's,

211
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:44.030
uh,
maybe it's a partner or a friend or a coworker and you know,

212
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.350
you decided to get on this plan and you're all jazzed about it and you're

213
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:50.200
checking in with each other and you're like,
yeah,
this is going great.

214
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:54.580
And Week One,
right?
Like weak ones the big week.
It's like when you know,

215
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:57.520
you start feeling kind of better and you can start seeing and your friend is

216
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:01.120
like,
oh,
I'm just loving this.
This is so great.

217
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:05.410
I think I just lost like three pants sizes in one week.
This is incredible.

218
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:09.940
I have so much more energy.
And you're like on the scale like,
oh my God,

219
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.880
did I just gained weight?
Like is that possible?

220
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:15.760
Like we're doing the same exact thing.

221
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.500
And that's because every body is so different.

222
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:25.690
And so I think that it's great that there's different diets and lifestyles.
Uh,

223
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.110
but I think what we need to do is take that information from it and learn to

224
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:33.670
figure out what our body needs and what truly is going to fuel our body because

225
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:36.820
they're all so different.
A quick example of this.

226
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.160
When I first got into health and nutrition,

227
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:43.150
we learned all the dietary theories that there are pretty much,

228
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.010
and then there's a lot of them.

229
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.290
And I was really big into uh,

230
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:54.380
the blood type diet and some diets.
And I thought,
I was like,
yes,

231
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:58.940
my body is meant to be vegetarian for like,
this is what it is.

232
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.740
So I was vegetarian for like eight years and then I went vegan and about six

233
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:06.290
months into it I got really sick.

234
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.130
I mean I like passed out in the shower sick and here I am,
this health person,

235
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.580
this health coach that's like,
yes,
I eat fruits and veggies and I'm so great.

236
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.660
And here I was passing out in my shower and it was not,

237
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.110
it was not one a good look and to it,
it,

238
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.490
it proved against kind of what I know now,
which is,
you know,

239
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:29.600
that we're so bio individual and we're so all different.
And so I,

240
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.830
when that happened,
I got really sick and then I was like,

241
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.540
all of a sudden I was craving a burger.
Like that's all I wanted.

242
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.520
I was just like,
I am.
But my mind was so ingrained in being in this one way,

243
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.400
not listening to my body being,
okay,
this is what you are,

244
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:50.060
this is what you're doing.
It almost became like part of who I was,

245
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.620
that I was vegetarian.

246
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:56.000
It was like my label that I wanted to wear and let everyone know and I wasn't

247
00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:59.210
actually listening and all of a sudden I'm just craving this and craving this.

248
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.860
So finally one day I decided,
I told my husband,
I was like,

249
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.780
I think I need a burger.
Will you go with me?
Like it was,
it was a big deal.

250
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:12.080
I was like,
we need to make sure that it's grass fed.

251
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:16.910
Like I need to know the cow's name like we got.
I was like,
we really got to,

252
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:20.180
you know,
be okay with this.
So he's like,
he was so excited.
He was like,
yeah.

253
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:22.720
He's like,
I can't wait to get this on film,
but I'm like,
oh my God.

254
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.800
So we go to this joint and I'm literally,
I kid you not,
I'm walking in like,

255
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.880
I hope no one sees me.
Like,
if they know that I'm good,

256
00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:35.060
I'm just getting the Veggie Burger guys.
And so I go and I ordered this,

257
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:39.020
this cheeseburger and I eat it.

258
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.830
And I felt so much better,

259
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.930
like instantly,
so much better.
And what I realized is,
you know,

260
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:52.490
I was definitely lacking iron and there were certain things in my diet that I

261
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:56.390
wasn't getting and that I needed.
And it was in that instance that I was like,

262
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:57.224
you know,

263
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.090
listening to your body is so important because we put labels on everything and

264
00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:05.360
we want to constantly label things,
including a,

265
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:08.180
including our diet and put ourselves in these boxes.

266
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.590
But our bodies change every six months.
Your taste buds are changing,
uh,

267
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.310
and your body's constantly evolving and adapting and changing.

268
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.900
And so you need to be open and to listen so that you can really see what your

269
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:25.050
body needs.
Uh,
and when it comes to cravings like that,

270
00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:29.420
that red meat craving,
oftentimes we look also at cravings as a really bad thing.

271
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:32.270
We're like,
oh,
I'm craving this.
You know,
I'm so bad.

272
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.210
But cravings are actually the gatekeepers to let our bodies know what they

273
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:42.260
really need.
And the more that you listen,
the more that you understand.

274
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:47.261
And the more that you can truly foster a closer relationship with you and your

275
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:48.080
body,

276
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.410
you won't ever have to diet again because you'll know what your body needs when

277
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:57.700
you know at what times and you'll be able to adapt and flow and change,
uh,

278
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.950
rather than being so restrictive.
And so,
um,
you know,

279
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:06.630
so intense about it.
So the next point,

280
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:11.400
uh,
when it comes to food and mood and emotions and you know,

281
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:16.401
this whole concept is not only listening to your body but also feeling your

282
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:19.170
feelings.
So many of us,

283
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:24.171
the reason why we are quick to grab a snickers bar or quick to grab chips or

284
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.460
whatever it may be,

285
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.910
it's because we don't actually stop and allow ourselves to feel whatever feeling

286
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.930
that we're feeling.
And we're just quick to go to the next thing.
A quick,

287
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.300
another little story about this.
Uh,

288
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:42.780
this was in like 2014 this one day,

289
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:47.781
it was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all of a sudden I got this intense craving

290
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:51.150
for grilled cheese.

291
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.370
And I'm not talking like those highbrow grilled cheeses from like San Francisco,

292
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.061
you know,

293
00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:01.380
where they're like have all these crazy ingredients on them and they're like

294
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:02.700
$25.
I'm talking,

295
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:07.701
I wanted wonder bread with butter and land O'Lakes cheese.

296
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:08.850
Like that's what I wanted.

297
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.430
And so I almost like I had my keys in my hand,
I'm like ready to go out the door.

298
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.810
And then I just stopped and I said,
what's actually going on here?
Like,

299
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.930
let me just sit with this for a minute.
Let me just feel this for a minute.

300
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.040
And so what I had realized is I had kind of this,

301
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.280
this moment of clarity in this moment of being able to feel what I actually was

302
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:32.341
feeling.

303
00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:37.341
And it was grief and it was sadness because my dad passed away in 2012 and when

304
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:43.080
I was a kid on rainy Saturday afternoons,
we would,

305
00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:48.081
he would make me a grilled cheese and we would watch copious amounts of unsolved

306
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:55.110
mysteries,
um,
which as a seven year old,

307
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.220
I was like seven at the time.

308
00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:58.770
Like the parenting choice of letting your child watch,
you know,

309
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:03.030
that's besides the point letting me watch one solve mysteries.
But the point is,

310
00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:07.290
I was in that moment when I was craving that grill cheese,
the,
the rainy,

311
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.000
the raininess,
the Saturday afternoon,

312
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.270
all of that brought the feeling of being with my dad.

313
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.450
And so that's what I really wanted.
That's what I was really missing.

314
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.220
And so at that point I had a decision.
I was like,
wow,

315
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:22.470
I can eat the grilled cheese,
eat it,
appreciate it.
I can make an upgraded one.

316
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.990
I can.
Um,
but then I was like,
Huh,

317
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.980
I wonder if unsolved mysteries is anywhere online right now.

318
00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:32.070
And I did find it on Amazon prime and I was like,

319
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:35.040
I'm going to watch unsolved mysteries this rainy afternoon.

320
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.570
And really honor and feel that feeling and that way.
And let me just tell you,

321
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:44.580
unsolved mysteries as an adult is a horrible show.
I was like,

322
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:47.650
why was I allowed to watch this?
This is so bad.

323
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.530
They actually do these reenactments.
It's a whole thing.
I was like,

324
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:53.900
oh my goodness.
But it actually made me laugh and,

325
00:20:53.901 --> 00:20:56.350
and feeling that feeling and going with that,

326
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.650
it actually ended up being providing me with nutrients and providing me with a

327
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:04.030
sense that the grill cheese never could.

328
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.710
And that's because I had allowed myself to feel.
So,

329
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.860
um,
so aside,
listening to your body,
feeling your feelings,
uh,

330
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.950
and you know,
the,
the,

331
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.410
the last thing with this is to prescribe as necessary.

332
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.890
And what I mean by that is food can greatly help with your emotions and your

333
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:31.630
emotions can dictate,
dictate the food choices that you eat.

334
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.400
And so I think it's important to understand how both play into your life so that

335
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:40.620
you can truly see what you may need at certain times.
For example,
in my,

336
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.370
my new book,
eat your feelings.

337
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:48.130
I actually map out some of the different emotions.
So,
for example,
if you're sad,

338
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.580
your body really wants a serotonin and it could find that and food and carbs and

339
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:58.420
sugar basically.
So pizza and cookies.
So when we're sad,

340
00:21:58.421 --> 00:22:03.421
our initial quick knee jerk reaction is to go to the pizza and the cookies

341
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:07.510
because it's going to give us that quick fix.
However long term,
you know,

342
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:10.990
what your body needs,
like I said,
is just,
is at once the Serotonin.

343
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:15.370
And so incorporating foods such as like nuts and seeds,

344
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.080
um,

345
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.080
it was just one example that actually help your body produce serotonin can give

346
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:25.840
you long term,
longer term benefits rather than that quick fix.
Um,

347
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:27.700
some of the other ones that I have,
if you're sad,

348
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:30.760
if you're stressed a grounding foods,
you know,

349
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:32.200
if you think when you're stressed out,

350
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.900
usually it's all in your head and kind of your upper body.

351
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.700
And so eating foods that are grounding,

352
00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:38.770
that are lower to the earth can actually help ground you.

353
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:42.680
So things like carrots and sweet potatoes.
Um,

354
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:46.330
so if you're sad stress,
if you're tired,
uh,
you know,

355
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:50.020
you want something energizing and uplifting.
So like citrus,
uh,

356
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:52.630
or leafy greens or something like that.
Uh,

357
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:57.631
and if you're hangry when you're so hungry that you become angry like I do many

358
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:00.130
days.
Um,

359
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.420
I always say that you don't care if it was made by Julia child or a child.

360
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:08.620
You just need food and need it now.
So to avoid being hangry though,

361
00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:12.700
you could a fuel up on things like healthy fats and proteins earlier in the day,

362
00:23:12.701 --> 00:23:16.130
so you don't get those 2:00 PM Hanger Shakes,
uh,

363
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.830
and sad,
stressed,
tired,
bored,
or hangry and bored.

364
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.920
If you're bored.
Again,
that's something that,
uh,
your,

365
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.530
your brain actually needs energy when you're bored.
And so,
you know,
if you're,

366
00:23:28.531 --> 00:23:31.480
if you're a board eater where you're just like,
oh,
I have nothing else to do,

367
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.750
trip,
sound right.
And then you're like,
well,
now I need something sweet.

368
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:37.630
So this sounds great.
Uh,
but really what you need is,
you know,

369
00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:38.770
something like a healthy fat,

370
00:23:38.771 --> 00:23:43.771
something to truly feel your brain so that you feel energized and that you feel,

371
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.780
um,

372
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.730
active in your brain and all of those things.
Um,

373
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:53.420
so like I said,
listening to your body,
feeling your feelings,

374
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:55.070
prescribing food as necessary,

375
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.400
all of these things are this really intricate and dams that your body,
um,

376
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.040
we'll work with you on if you,

377
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.480
if you choose to listen and if you choose to really understand those,

378
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.740
the deeper connections that the food and mood plays into it.
Um,

379
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.460
so to kind of put this in full circle and to,
to,

380
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:15.303
um,

381
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.400
to kind of wrap all this together,

382
00:24:20.401 --> 00:24:23.370
I want to read a quick little thing from my book.

383
00:24:23.371 --> 00:24:27.180
It's called the food mood girl femme of Festo.
Um,

384
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.990
and this kind of wraps up everything that we just talked about.

385
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.140
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

386
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.240
<v 2>Your body is a magical machine.</v>

387
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:40.810
It's like a computer program specifically for you and only you cherish it.

388
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.640
Trust it,
treat it with respect.

389
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.410
Talk to your body like you would talk to a really cute dog except not in public

390
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:49.244
because that might be weird.

391
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.660
Take time to eat really good real food that includes leafy Greens and a cookie.

392
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.780
Eat everything with love.
Cook everything with love.

393
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.520
Love is always the secret ingredient.
Ask questions,

394
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.820
be open to growth.
Ask more questions,

395
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.050
be kind to yourself and others.
Release judgments,

396
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.740
challenge conventional norms.
Do something that scares you.

397
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.270
Listen more,
react less.
Laugh your ass off,

398
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.810
preferably in the company of others,
but by yourself as cool to

399
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.270
listen to your gut.
Always listened to your gut.
It's right.

400
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:33.380
99% of the time.
Embrace your body's unique size.

401
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:38.000
No that it will change and evolve.
It might grow and shrink,

402
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:43.220
but it's still loves you.
All the same and above all,
love yourself.
Like really,

403
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:47.120
truly love yourself.
Celebrate and appreciate yourself daily.

404
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.120
And remember this is the only body in life you have,

405
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.040
so love it up the best you can.
And when all else fails,

406
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.540
just Google it.
I had two guys I had to,
sorry,
I just had to,

407
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:01.410
I had to throw something cheesy in there.
Uh,

408
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.670
but I appreciate you all for being here and for listening to this and I love,

409
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:09.410
I think we're going to open it up to a Q and.
A.

410
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:12.620
So if you have any specific questions,
I know we have some coming in.

411
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.170
Love to answer it for you.
Yeah.
Hey,
thanks.

412
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.110
Thank you.
So mine cutesy.

413
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:27.810
<v 0>So we have a couple of questions on the dory so we can take dory questions and</v>

414
00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:29.740
also wide questions.
And as a reminder,

415
00:26:29.741 --> 00:26:33.280
we definitely are excited to give away some books.
Um,

416
00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:36.520
so we want to definitely take it away with questions.

417
00:26:36.521 --> 00:26:39.550
So we'll start with one from the Dory,
which I think is really,

418
00:26:39.551 --> 00:26:44.040
really relevant to what we were just talking about.
So it's uh,
an anonymous

419
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.670
<v 2>question and it says,
how do you suggest combating boredom eating?</v>

420
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.090
It's so easy at Google to stop by our micro kitchens,

421
00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:56.091
which you've witnessed for a snack when all you need is a break or to make food

422
00:26:56.461 --> 00:27:00.540
when you just want to watch TV.
Well,
why don't you take the break or watch TV?

423
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.690
Yeah,
that's a very valid answer.

424
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.840
Sometimes what I find is we overthink things when it comes to stuff like this

425
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:13.890
and health and nutrition,
even something like that.
Like we,

426
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.100
we know what we want to do,
but what is stopping us?

427
00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:19.650
And I think that's where it stopping and really feeling our feelings,

428
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:23.880
being able to say,
wait,
do I just need a break yet?

429
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:26.670
Let me go get some fresh air.
Um,
or yeah,

430
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:29.610
I just want to veg and watch TV tonight.
And that's okay.

431
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:32.100
Sometimes we think we need to be doing something more,

432
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.190
but we need to allow ourselves to have those moments of the brakes.

433
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.120
And I think that that's sometimes why we gravitate towards food because it makes

434
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:41.520
us feel like we're doing something right.
It's like,

435
00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:46.080
well I accomplished a lot today about eating three bags of Doritos,
you know?

436
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:49.170
And it like,
it gives us a sense of purpose almost,

437
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:50.580
but really we just need a break.

438
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:54.300
And so allowing yourself to have that I think is really important.
Yeah.

439
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.660
And I think that's good.
Super relevant for Googlers,
right?

440
00:27:56.661 --> 00:27:58.980
Cause a lot of us work nonstop.

441
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.760
And so that reminder of just letting yourself take that time.

442
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.920
And oftentimes when you allow yourself to step away and take that break,
uh,

443
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:11.430
you'll find that you're more productive later on.
You know,
you find that,

444
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:12.030
you know,

445
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.120
you think that you have a million things going on and that you need to do all of

446
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:17.580
these things and have them.
But if you just allow yourself,

447
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.730
then your energy is more clear,
your,

448
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.560
your mind is more clear and you can go into that situation and,

449
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.430
and you probably even do it at a faster rate than if you would just try to power

450
00:28:26.431 --> 00:28:29.730
through and struggled through it.
I know that from personal experience,

451
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.390
writing a book is not,
it's not an easy thing to do.
You're like,
oh,

452
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:36.690
snacks and laundry when you start doing laundry instead of writing a book.

453
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:39.570
You know,
that's like really bad.
I think we've all been there.

454
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.680
Maybe not the writing the book,
but they're doing laundry procrastinate.
Yes.
Yes.

455
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.040
Do we want to have any live questions?
We have a mic in the back if you would.

456
00:28:49.041 --> 00:28:52.010
Don't mind.
So that everybody thought official.
It really?
Yeah.

457
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.200
So this is kind of similar to the question that was just asked,
but um,

458
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.110
I realized I almost never eat fruit because it takes me like a long time to like

459
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.610
prepare it to like cut it and I want to get a snack.

460
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.260
It's just easier to like grab a bag of chips as opposed to like taking like five

461
00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:12.120
minutes,
like cut and wash your fruit.

462
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.950
So like what tips do you have to feel like more motivated to eat healthy?

463
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.460
So a couple things.
Uh,
one of the,

464
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.490
one of the key things in the book that I talk about is everyone says you are

465
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:25.920
what you eat,
right?
That's like your review eight.

466
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:31.020
I believe you are what you chop.
It's true because you're like,

467
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:34.410
I don't like,
you know,
it takes me five minutes to chop.
And so that's what,

468
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.040
that's what stops you from doing that.

469
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:40.500
Cause it's easier to grab the other thing or how many of you have ever tried to

470
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:43.090
cut an onion and you're still figuring out,
you're like,
wait,

471
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.980
which way do I turn it to get slices?
Verse Dices,
right?
Like that's,
you know,
we,

472
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.930
and so that's what stops us from doing it.
So my one suggestion is don't,

473
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.823
um,

474
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.460
<v 3>okay.</v>

475
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.140
<v 2>Don't,
don't,
uh,
don't feel like,</v>

476
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.870
I guess overambitious you know,
if,
if you got to get the pre cut,

477
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.050
get the pre cut,
you know,
if the precut is going to make you eat it,

478
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.070
get the precut.
Whereas like we think we have these like grandiose ideas like,
oh,

479
00:30:11.071 --> 00:30:14.280
but I need to be doing,
you know,
but I need to actually cut it.

480
00:30:14.281 --> 00:30:19.281
And then we ended up buying like a bag of onions and they rot because we're

481
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.700
like,
well,
I don't really want to just buy the pre,
the pre chopped.
Um,

482
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.310
and then as far as like from the day to day,

483
00:30:26.311 --> 00:30:30.600
if there are fruits and vegetables that are easier,
you know,
that you're like,

484
00:30:30.601 --> 00:30:34.490
okay,
like a banana or [inaudible] for example,
or um,

485
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.600
like a clementine or an orange or something like that.

486
00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:39.710
Something that is faster and you know that.
Um,

487
00:30:39.711 --> 00:30:44.610
but then also checking in with yourself and saying,
why am I,
why am I,

488
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.520
um,
you know,

489
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.820
why is this kind of like sitting with that deeper question of why am I allowing

490
00:30:52.611 --> 00:30:57.611
these other things to kind of stop me from taking the time to do this?

491
00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.000
You know?
And,
and kind of just being a little bit more real with yourself too,

492
00:31:02.001 --> 00:31:05.330
I think,
you know,
it's not,
it's not an easy fix.
You know,

493
00:31:05.331 --> 00:31:07.610
we're co we're complicated,
you know,

494
00:31:07.611 --> 00:31:10.010
where these computer systems that are very intense.

495
00:31:10.011 --> 00:31:12.680
So it's just kind of always checking in with yourself.
And I think that'll,

496
00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.221
you know,

497
00:31:13.221 --> 00:31:17.450
you'll start to realize and then maybe in a month from now we'll see you out

498
00:31:17.451 --> 00:31:22.070
here cutting the,
the apples and being like,
yeah,
I did it.
You know,
it just takes,

499
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.180
take some time.
So hopefully that answered.
Thank you.
Yes,
thank you.

500
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.793
<v 3>Okay.</v>

501
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.700
<v 2>So if you're feeling one of these emotions you mentioned like sad,
uh,</v>

502
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.210
tired,
hangry,
and you try to satiate that emotion with like,
you know,

503
00:31:41.211 --> 00:31:45.230
the recommended foods and it's just not getting there.
Like you're,

504
00:31:45.231 --> 00:31:48.560
you're still feeling that emotion.
What do you do?
Like,
well,

505
00:31:48.561 --> 00:31:50.090
I think that there's multiple things.

506
00:31:50.091 --> 00:31:52.970
So someone asked me this really great question the other day.
It was,

507
00:31:52.971 --> 00:31:57.800
do you think of your method as like prescription or preventative?
You know,

508
00:31:57.801 --> 00:31:59.810
and I think that's kind of similar to what you're saying.

509
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.530
I think some days you just want the chocolate fudge Brownie,

510
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.770
eat the chocolate fudge Brownie,
eat it.
You know,

511
00:32:07.771 --> 00:32:11.820
like some days I find what happens is what,
what we'll often do.

512
00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:14.940
Sometimes there's just,
we want that thing and that's okay.

513
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:19.980
It's okay to have that in to,
you know,
to eat it and feel good about it.
You know,

514
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:23.970
when you eat something that your body,
uh,
let's just say for example,

515
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.310
you really want this chocolate fudge Brownie and you know,

516
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.480
that's what you're craving is.
And you're like,
oh,

517
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.580
but you're like beating yourself up in your head.
You're like,
well,

518
00:32:32.581 --> 00:32:36.990
I shouldn't have that.
I don't want that shunt.
Do it.
Um,
and then you're like,

519
00:32:36.991 --> 00:32:38.610
well,
maybe I'll just have like,
you know,

520
00:32:38.611 --> 00:32:41.570
then the chocolate brownies are right there and you're like,
oh,

521
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:44.060
I'll just have like one bite.
And then you're like,
no,

522
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:46.280
and then your friends are over eating like carrot sticks.
You're like,

523
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:48.260
why can't I be like them?
You know?

524
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:52.160
And then there's like this whole stressful thing in your mind and what you're

525
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:55.670
doing to your body when you stress about eating something like that is

526
00:32:55.671 --> 00:33:00.380
physically,
uh,
that stress is no different than,
than any type of other stress.

527
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:02.480
Like if someone's attacking you,
you know,
your,

528
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.390
your blood rushes to your feet to run to your hands,

529
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:07.400
to fight something off into your brain to think.

530
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:10.280
So the last thing is thinking about doing is digesting that chocolate Brownie

531
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:11.210
that you're stressing about.

532
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.800
So if you really want something or then the other thing we do is we're like,
wow,

533
00:33:15.801 --> 00:33:19.640
I really want the chocolate Brownie but I'm trying to be healthy so I'm going to

534
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:24.020
have some cacau nibs and I'm going to have,

535
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.290
and then you eat the [inaudible] and you're like,
but that doesn't satisfy it.

536
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.080
So then,
and then he's like,
do you have like something kind of bitter?

537
00:33:30.081 --> 00:33:33.260
So then you want something sweet.
So then you're like,
well now I have fruit.

538
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.290
Now that didn't,
now I want something salty,
you know,

539
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.090
you and then you spend all day trying to get the,
you know,
when,

540
00:33:41.091 --> 00:33:42.370
if you would have just ate the,

541
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.250
the chocolate Brownie and like appreciated it and savored it and looked and

542
00:33:46.251 --> 00:33:50.120
looked at it as something like,
I don't want to say I guess precious,

543
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:51.380
like look something at it.
Like,
wow,

544
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:55.250
like this is something I really get to enjoy right now.
I'm going to savor it.

545
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:58.300
I'm going to feel good about it.
I'm going to eat it with love.
I'm going to,
um,

546
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.750
really just bring that into that and then you'll end up processing it.
You know,

547
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:05.000
you'll get any nutrients that are in that chocolate Brownie,

548
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:08.180
you will get them and you'll also digest it differently.

549
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.210
And so I think there's a balance of,
you know,

550
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.550
something like that when you want to craving.

551
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.740
And then also thinking of this as like a preventative as well by eating more of

552
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:21.380
those foods.
It's called what we learned in nutrition school,

553
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:25.910
which is called crowding out.
So,
you know,
by eating more of,
you know,

554
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:30.170
if you find yourself really struggling with depression or anxiety and you start

555
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:32.420
incorporating more foods,
it's not going to happen overnight.

556
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:35.270
But over time what happens is the more that you eat those foods,

557
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.990
it naturally crowds out the other thing.
And so you're,
you start to be like,

558
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:41.930
people ask me all the time,
like,
Lindsay,
how do you just,
you know,

559
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:44.660
have a piece of dark chocolate and you're okay or you don't want these things.

560
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.570
I don't feel like I'm depriving myself,
but naturally just the way that I've,

561
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.410
I've been doing this work since I was 12 years old since I suffered from anxiety

562
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.390
and you know,
started to get help.

563
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.130
And the first thing I did was go to a wellness center in my hometown.
And,
um,

564
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.290
and,
and through that experience,
I started learning about health and nutrition.

565
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.510
And so this has been over half my life.

566
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.280
And so being easy on yourself as well,
but also looking at it as,
okay,

567
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:13.580
I'm going to start eating more of these to naturally crowd out more of those

568
00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:16.040
other cravings.
Thank you.
Good.
Okay.

569
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.180
I think that's just such a fair point.
Right?

570
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:22.850
We all are constantly beating ourselves up.

571
00:35:22.851 --> 00:35:26.810
And I know you've written quite a bit about food guilt,
the last book,

572
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.750
it was all about food.
Yeah.
But I think since that came up,

573
00:35:29.751 --> 00:35:33.290
can you talk to us a little bit about what you recommend for people who are

574
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:37.860
trying to get out of that cycle?
Yeah,
I,
so I,
I did,
uh,
uh,

575
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:43.180
a survey with the Nielsen Group and found that 85% of women in 65% of men suffer

576
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.200
or experience food guilt on a daily basis.

577
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.800
And so I was thinking about that and I'm like going in,
what are they called?
Mks.

578
00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.480
Okay.
Going into the MK learning the lingo going into the mks over there,

579
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.880
um,
or you know,
into your Pantry,
into your fridge,
out at a restaurant,

580
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:05.540
85% of the time women specifically are feeling guilty or feeling stressed about

581
00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:10.980
food.
Um,
and like I said,
that is causing stress on your body.

582
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:13.540
You're not able to digest things as well.
Um,

583
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:18.360
so part of that is being able to go into every situation.

584
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.310
I always say go into every situation with food,

585
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:24.840
whether it's Kale or a cookie with a sense of love and appreciation for that.

586
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.890
I had a client once and I was teaching her this and,

587
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.910
and the one day she's like,
Lindsey,
I was craving a McDonald's cheeseburger.

588
00:36:32.911 --> 00:36:37.200
And I was like,
okay,
like what did you do?
You know,
I was one of the now.

589
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:40.940
And she was like,
well,
I was beating myself up and I was,

590
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.950
I was going to go get it anyway,
but then,
you know,
I was doing that whole thing,

591
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:45.780
but then I remembered what you said.
So I was like,
okay,

592
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.260
I'm going to allow myself to go there to do this.
She was like,
so I,

593
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:53.160
when I ordered it,
um,
I was real nice to the,

594
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.060
to the a drive through people and I was,
you know,
I was like,
thank you.

595
00:36:57.061 --> 00:36:59.910
And I go and pull over and she's like,
and I,

596
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.280
I sit there with my Hamburg and I'm just like,

597
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.420
thinking about the whole process this Hanberger took to get here.
I'm just like,

598
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.490
wow,
the farms that had this week to make this fun.
And,
and she was like,
I mean,

599
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:15.390
she was really going forward and she was like,
I stopped every and appreciate it.

600
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.580
She's like,
and then I ate the hamburger and she's like,
and guess what?

601
00:37:17.581 --> 00:37:20.280
And I was like,
what?
And she's like,
I didn't get sick.
She's like,

602
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:21.300
normally I would get sick.
She's like,

603
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.900
but I ate a Mcdonald's hamburger and I didn't get sick.
So I'm a little worried.

604
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:29.510
But she realized,
you know,
what she did is she was like,
and then,
you know,

605
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.090
I did it and I let it go and I didn't,
it didn't sit with me for weeks.

606
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:35.970
I wasn't constantly thinking about it.
And she's like,
to be honest,

607
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.930
it didn't even do what it normally did for me because now I'm at the point where

608
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:44.160
I'm like,
okay,
I don't,
I don't feel that like I need it or you know,

609
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:47.720
that it's going to provide me with something because I've been able to,
um,

610
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.620
just see it for what it is and not make it a bigger production or bring more

611
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.120
emotional value than,
than what it really is.
And oftentimes we do that,
you know,

612
00:37:57.121 --> 00:37:58.680
because food is very emotional.

613
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.920
<v 4>Yeah.
That makes a ton of sense.
Any live questions?</v>

614
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.860
Yeah,
go for it.
All right.
Woo.

615
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:12.110
<v 2>So when you have craving,
when do you know you should go for it?
Oh,
when she,</v>

616
00:38:12.111 --> 00:38:15.970
you hold back?
That's a good question.
I would say,
uh,

617
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:20.480
you're probably going to not like me for this answer,
but I would say,
you know,

618
00:38:20.481 --> 00:38:23.210
I think you really have to,
that's what it comes to.

619
00:38:23.211 --> 00:38:25.040
Listening to your body and being,

620
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.360
being able to decipher some of the differences,
you know?

621
00:38:29.361 --> 00:38:33.470
And I think it's not going to come by,
it's,

622
00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:35.180
it's not going to come by being perfect.

623
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.980
It's going to come from giving into a craving and being like,
oh,

624
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:43.450
I didn't feel that great because of it.
Or,
um,
it's not even giving in,

625
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.630
allowing yourself to go for it.
And then,
um,

626
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:51.750
and then seeing how you feel like in that moment and taking all of this as

627
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:56.170
information,
thinking a bit like a Google search except for your body.
Ooh,

628
00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.730
there you go.
Look at that.
I'm just really cheesing it up today.
Uh,

629
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.170
but thinking of it as like a search that's like,
okay,
this worked,
this didn't,

630
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:09.370
and asking yourself the deeper questions like,
okay,
well why am I craving this?

631
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.390
Is there something you know,
happening today?
What's my stress level like?
Um,

632
00:39:13.391 --> 00:39:17.350
and I even map out in the book like some different,
some different,

633
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.200
different questions.
Let me see where they're at.

634
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.170
Different questions to ask yourself when you are feeling,
you know,

635
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.630
like you want to,
uh,
you know,

636
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:33.070
have something to,
to really kind of stop and ask yourself.

637
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.860
I can't find it right now,
but it's in here.

638
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.320
The other thing that I just kind of noticed here too is I'm like,

639
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:43.840
look at what I noticed in my own book.
Um,

640
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.750
the other thing that I really noticed is,
you know,

641
00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:51.751
sometimes part of my method and my in this book specifically is going deeper,

642
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:58.900
but then also saying,
okay,
I'm craving,
I'm craving sugar,
I'm craving this.

643
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.470
And then I have a chart in here that says what your body may really need.

644
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.140
And so you'll be able to start putting the,

645
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:06.880
it's like putting the puzzle pieces together.

646
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:08.830
You do the searches and you kind of,

647
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.230
you then you start mapping out and you're like,
oh,
so for me,

648
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.980
if I'm craving a burger,
I know that,
you know,

649
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:18.980
it's probably that time people and you know,
and I,

650
00:40:18.981 --> 00:40:23.170
my irons getting low and I,
you know,
that's just what my body needs.

651
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:27.940
And so I know how to fuel it properly,
but it didn't always come that way.

652
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.780
Um,
so I think that can help.

653
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.210
What's your approach to influencing your friends and family to eat healthier

654
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.980
without becoming that person?
Oh,
girl.
Um,

655
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:47.920
so,
uh,
my approach is,
uh,
just having empathy for people,

656
00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:49.360
trying to meet people where they're at.

657
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.250
When my dad got sick in 2000 2010,
I believe,

658
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.870
um,
you know,
I was like,
dad,
we need to be doing ginger shots.

659
00:40:58.871 --> 00:40:59.680
And you know,

660
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.390
I was like telling him all these things and what I realized is that,

661
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.480
you know,
I had a meet him where he was at.
He was not,
I mean,

662
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.830
he was a drinker and a smoker and loved Mcdonald's.
Like,

663
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.750
I am not going to like,

664
00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:18.340
this man is not going to start doing ginger shots,
you know,
like,

665
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.950
so then what I did is I met him when he was at,
I was like,
Dad,

666
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:23.920
I bet you can't do this ginger shot since he was like a drinker,
you know,

667
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:27.940
I was like,
I like mass them and was like,
I bet this would be too strong for you.

668
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.480
I know you're a Baka guy,
but this ginger,
it's even stronger than vodka dad.

669
00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:34.160
And so it be Kinda came kind a joke.
But,
um,

670
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.700
I think meeting people where they're at,
I think,
um,

671
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.860
one of the things that I try to do is just have that like empathy for people
and,

672
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.030
and tried to foster that because no one has ever,

673
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.510
I have never really met anyone that got healthier because of judgment,
you know?

674
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.541
And if anything,

675
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:54.920
it ends and it leads to horrible eating cycles over time.

676
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:55.580
Um,

677
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:59.720
so something that I try to do is just be the example of myself and bring things,

678
00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:00.740
you know,
bring you need,
you know,

679
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:03.920
I'll bring a certain salad or a certain dish or a bread and like,

680
00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:07.310
let them try it.
And my mom had never tried hummus before

681
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.380
and I like brought it and now she's like,
oh,
oh,
sorry,
I'm from Pittsburgh.

682
00:42:13.381 --> 00:42:15.990
So when I talk about my parents,
I do the gins or accent and I,

683
00:42:15.991 --> 00:42:18.870
it just almost came out because we call ourselves,
people say,

684
00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:22.770
[inaudible] instead of you,
you guys are y'all.
We say him.
So my mom was like,
oh,

685
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.480
just love that.
I just love that Hummus that she has gone,
you know,
and,

686
00:42:27.481 --> 00:42:32.430
um,
that's how they talk.
Uh,
and,
um,
and then,

687
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:36.300
you know,
my father in law,
the one day,
you know,
he knows that I'm in this and he,

688
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.690
this is so sweet.
He was like,
Lance,

689
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.910
I got that Quinoa that you were talking about.
And I was like,

690
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:46.890
yo mean Keema um,
but it showed that they were like interested in it was because,

691
00:42:46.891 --> 00:42:49.530
you know,
this is the way that I live and I'm not going to try to change you,

692
00:42:49.531 --> 00:42:53.760
but I will,
you know,
bring something so that you can try it and enjoy it too.
And,

693
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.020
and so I think with that,

694
00:42:55.021 --> 00:42:59.010
I've seen changes in my own family members through just kind of leading by

695
00:42:59.011 --> 00:43:02.850
example.
And I'm not being,
you know,
not being judgmental.

696
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.231
That's huge.

697
00:43:04.231 --> 00:43:07.710
I love your point about people don't change because they feel judged.

698
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.320
They're going to feel they're going to change when they're ready to change.

699
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:14.610
Absolutely.
And when I was the judgemental person,
you know,

700
00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.970
everyone just hated me.
In fact,
my friends like have a running joke.

701
00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:20.010
They were like,
yeah,
I remember that period where like,

702
00:43:20.011 --> 00:43:25.000
we all stopped talking to you.
I'm like,
those were great times.
I'm,

703
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:29.310
I was like,
but at least I had Kale.
Uh,
you know,
it's just because we don't,

704
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:34.130
you know,
we,
that's just not how we're,
you know,
we thrive now.
Some people may be,

705
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:37.430
but I doubt it's probably a very small percentage.
Yeah,
I would say so.

706
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:45.160
<v 5>Hi.
So I have a question for kind of all these fad diets,</v>

707
00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:50.161
which ones do you find kind of like the most misleading or dangerous is too

708
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:54.280
extreme of a word,
and which ones do you kind of see as,
you know,

709
00:43:54.281 --> 00:43:58.840
healthier options and ones that kind of you can incorporate along with your

710
00:43:58.841 --> 00:43:59.674
daily nutrition?

711
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.980
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a good question.
I think that,
um,</v>

712
00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.840
the ones that I hate the most personally are like the,
um,

713
00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.550
the clickbait things that are like the five fruits that are ruining your life.

714
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:16.480
You know?
And I'm like,
but it's fruit,
you know,
there's like,

715
00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.170
why you should never have a banana ever again.
And I'm like,
but it's a fruit,

716
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.023
like,
you know,

717
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.450
and I think that that's where it comes to listening to your body because then

718
00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.920
some people,
yeah,
Banana Bananas,
great.
Some people,
it may not sit well with you.

719
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:33.630
Um,
so those are the ones that I don't like.
If something,

720
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.110
if anything's too restrictive over time,

721
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.400
it's not feasible.
Um,
so like if something is too,

722
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:45.120
uh,
like I know a lot of people,
I don't,

723
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.250
some of these people are my friends that have these,

724
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:50.820
so I don't want to call them out,
but,
um,
there's,

725
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.740
there's certain trends or certain,
you know,

726
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:57.570
like diet programs that come around every,

727
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.780
every year.
And I think that I,

728
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:07.370
I think the problem with them is that they're are so restrictive that longterm

729
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.020
it's hard for that to become a lifestyle,
you know,

730
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:13.380
because then we carry the guilt and it we're like,
well,
I'm not doing,
you know,

731
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.530
oh,
I want,
you know,
grains now where I want,
you know,

732
00:45:16.531 --> 00:45:20.100
something now then and I can't have it.
Um,

733
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:25.200
so I think that,
I think the biggest thing is more plant based.

734
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:29.370
Um,
you know,
we can all afford to eat more plant based.
I think that's,

735
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:34.530
that's one thing that I can get behind just because we should all be eating more

736
00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:35.880
fruits or vegetables anyway.

737
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.450
So incorporating more plant based foods into your lifestyle I think is one that

738
00:45:40.451 --> 00:45:44.190
will never really go out of style because of that.
Um,

739
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.330
but it really just comes down to listening because you can do any of those types

740
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:52.770
of diets and see what feels best for you.

741
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:54.030
So if you're doing Paleo,

742
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:58.620
you know that may work really well and you may say yes and it can change.

743
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:03.650
Like I didn't eat poultry for like 10 years and this past September I'll,

744
00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:09.180
one day I was like,
I just need a whole chicken right now.
And I don't know.

745
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:12.520
And you know what,
it was my collagen cause I have,
um,

746
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:17.010
I needed more collagen in my joints and I was eating chicken and I was like,

747
00:46:17.011 --> 00:46:18.150
fine.
And like my,

748
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:22.980
my joints like felt so much better and so it can change,

749
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:26.510
you know,
and being open to that and taking what you learn from it.
Um,

750
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.670
<v 0>and going from there.
So I have a question.
Yes.</v>

751
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:35.010
I work with a lot of women who suffer or have suffered from eating disorders.

752
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.260
So listening to their bodies is really,
really hard.

753
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.150
What recommendations do you have for people who are just getting started on that

754
00:46:42.151 --> 00:46:44.580
journey and maybe don't even know what that means?

755
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.060
<v 2>I think I'm paying attention and I also think finding support,
you know,</v>

756
00:46:50.061 --> 00:46:52.070
like someone like yourself or um,

757
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.390
just being able to have someone that you can talk to about these things.

758
00:46:56.391 --> 00:47:00.290
Because I think sometimes talking through things it's,
you know,

759
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.990
can help you realize like,
oh yeah,
this is,
you know,

760
00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.220
this is why I did this or you know,
this is why I did that.

761
00:47:07.221 --> 00:47:10.310
And being able to have that kind of sounding board I think is really important.

762
00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.430
And then I think just starting for anyone,
just starting with,
you know,

763
00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:16.820
the basics,
like doing one thing a week for your,
for yourself and your health,

764
00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:20.900
you know,
so many times where like,
I'm going to the grocery store,
um,
you know,

765
00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:24.380
I'm getting all the fruits and vegetables.
I have male plants for days.

766
00:47:24.381 --> 00:47:26.810
I got breakfast,
lunch and dinner,
you know,
planned out.

767
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.610
And then by like Wednesday or like,
Ugh,

768
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.050
I just want burger from like the local joint down the street because it's,

769
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.560
you know,
or half your groceries just end up sitting there.

770
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.470
You don't eat them because it's not what your body is like really wanting.

771
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:42.610
And so instead of like going all in,
I just tell people,
hey,
do one thing a week,

772
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.620
drink more water.
It's simple.
We don't do it including myself.
I'm like,

773
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.200
I need to start hydrating this trip.
But um,

774
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:55.300
but just doing the simple things and over time it just becomes part of who you

775
00:47:55.301 --> 00:47:56.590
are.
And then the awareness,
you know,

776
00:47:56.591 --> 00:48:00.520
because some people are at a point where like you said,

777
00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:03.310
they're so conflicted with all these things.

778
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:07.450
I mean the other day I went in a grocery store and there was half the fat

779
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:11.080
Avocados.
I was like,
what?

780
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.880
Like that's how they were marketing them and I'm like half the fat abaco like

781
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:20.440
just eat the avocado and all it was,
was that an avocado cut in half?

782
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.170
Like that's all it was.
Like there was no,
there was,

783
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.220
it was just like package like that.
Like,
it's now half the fat.
I'm like,
yeah,

784
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:31.660
I can go get one off the bin over here for like $3 less.

785
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:36.610
And Yeah.
You know,
and so,
um,
but being bombarded with that stuff all the time,

786
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:38.770
especially with an eating disorder,
it can be very sensitive.

787
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:41.950
And so I think seeking support and then,
you know,
starting small and,

788
00:48:41.951 --> 00:48:45.730
and being okay with yourself or not okay with yourself,

789
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:50.530
but being okay with,
um,
with starting small.
Yeah.
Cause it's,

790
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:54.590
it's hard for a lot of people.
Yeah.
Thank you.
We have another live question.
Hi.

791
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.240
Hi.

792
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.870
Do you have any suggestions for a situations where you can't really control your

793
00:48:58.871 --> 00:49:03.390
food?
Like I'm also from Pennsylvania,
so when I go home it's like what part?
Uh,

794
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:08.170
northeast.
That's really like screen.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So my mom and be like,
Hey,

795
00:49:08.171 --> 00:49:10.000
I know you like Avocado Kale now,

796
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.630
but he or she stakes a pizza and a dozen cupcakes the two days you're here.

797
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:20.140
Um,
so a couple of my own personal tricks,
I don't know if this will work for you,

798
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:23.470
but I just tend to like bring snacks and like,

799
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.030
so if I was going home I'd be like,
Oh,
I'm going to stop and like get some,

800
00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:29.140
you know,
whatever.

801
00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:32.650
And then you'd get something healthy and like bring it to share.
You know,

802
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:36.910
I'm always big into like bringing things to share and selfishly because I want

803
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:40.750
to like kind of know what I'm walking into a little bit.
Uh,

804
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:44.470
and then I think,
and also if there's something that you want,

805
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:48.670
like when you're home or,
uh,
where it's hard,
I think it's just being,

806
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:52.480
just going back to like,
being mindful of not beating yourself up,
being like,

807
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:56.320
okay,
this is two days we're here.
You know,
I'm,
you know,
I brought,

808
00:49:56.321 --> 00:49:57.940
I brought these snacks and we're good,

809
00:49:57.941 --> 00:50:01.660
but I know my mom really wants to go to this pizza joint because it means a lot

810
00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:04.690
to her.
And you know,
this is her way of showing love.

811
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:06.850
So I'm going to just appreciate it for what it is,
you know,

812
00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:10.300
and being kind of a little bit easy on yourself and I think that'll help you

813
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:14.380
actually feel you'll probably feel less anxious going home cause you probably

814
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:17.950
already pre worried about that before you go home.
Yeah.
Yeah.

815
00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:21.700
So I think that'll help you kind of ease into it a little bit more and just kind

816
00:50:21.701 --> 00:50:26.410
of give yourself some grace and empathy as well because we tend to just beat

817
00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:29.960
ourselves up before.
But before anything,

818
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:34.370
like we pre worry about food more than I've ever and cat,
like even myself,

819
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:36.980
I'm like,
oh,
am I going to know what I eat when I get there?
You know,

820
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:40.340
it's like this,
this thing.
But I think being,
um,

821
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.290
controlling what you can but then giving yourself kind of grace moving forward.

822
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:49.760
Does that make sense?
Thanks.
Any other live questions?

823
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:53.720
Otherwise we have a few minutes in my,
I want to tackle one more dory question.

824
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.170
Um,
so I love the question about anxiety.

825
00:50:57.171 --> 00:51:00.890
So what other things did you do to help overcome during anxiety?

826
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.370
And if you still get anxious today,
how do you cope with it?
Yes.

827
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:08.080
So I definitely still get anxious.
I'm not perfect.
Um,

828
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:13.340
one of the things,
and when I was a kid,
um,
and I don't think I mentioned this,

829
00:51:13.341 --> 00:51:17.780
but I suffered from anxiety.
I was hospitalized and,
uh,

830
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.740
I was kind of intuitive as a kid and I think,

831
00:51:21.741 --> 00:51:24.950
which leads to kind of the approach that I take today cause I've tapped into,

832
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:29.610
into that.
But I,
I said,
uh,
I said to my parents,
I was like,
you know what,
I,

833
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.840
I don't want to continue this way.
Like,

834
00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:36.980
this is not being going to the hospital,
like all this,
like,
this isn't,

835
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.310
I don't want to do this.
So do you think,
you know,
I could try something,
like,

836
00:51:40.311 --> 00:51:43.010
could I get therapy?
So my parents were like,
yeah,
cool,
whatever.

837
00:51:43.011 --> 00:51:45.140
Like we'll take you to therapy.
I'm like,
crate,

838
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:48.170
they've never been to therapy in their life,
but their lecture or whatever,

839
00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:52.550
which I was grateful for.
Um,
so I started going to therapy and it,
it was okay,

840
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:54.380
but my therapist was like old school,
you know,

841
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:57.830
so it was like very like straight forward like,
okay.

842
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.560
And as you can tell I'm wearing a fruit and veggie suit.

843
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:05.420
I like to keep it a little bit real.
So it was like,
I was like,
you know,

844
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.310
um,
my sister's eight years older than me and she started going to this wellness

845
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:13.940
center and I said,
I saw a shift in her,
we suffered from similar things.

846
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.390
And I said,
hey,
can I try that instead?
So they were like,
sure.
Great.

847
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:22.000
So I started going to this wellness center,
um,
and we really focused on,
uh,

848
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:25.430
you know,
eating mindfulness.
Uh,
he,
uh,

849
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.600
he taught me Tai Chi actually is a,
as a 12 year old.
Um,
yeah,

850
00:52:29.601 --> 00:52:33.350
I know acupuncture.
I was doing all of it.
Um,

851
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:37.580
and those things really,
those things really helped me.

852
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:42.200
And by ninth grade I was actually teaching stress management workshops to,
um,

853
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.620
my student council conferences.
Uh,
because I've learned,

854
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:48.770
I learned all these different tools.
So I definitely think that,
you know,

855
00:52:48.771 --> 00:52:49.610
food's a part of it.

856
00:52:49.611 --> 00:52:53.750
I know what foods can trigger me and can trigger anxiety within me.
Um,

857
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.340
but then sometimes I get anxiety,
uh,
and I'm like,

858
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.840
I didn't eat anything.
I know,
like I don't even feel stressed in my mind,

859
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:07.550
but my body is anxious.
And so,
uh,
for me,
you know,
it really,

860
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:10.910
a lot of times it has to do with like taking less screen time,

861
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:15.020
which I know is like not something Googlers want to hear.
Um,

862
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.160
or,
or just allowing myself to,
to veg out,
you know,

863
00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:22.880
because so many times I'm one of those people that I like to feel accomplished

864
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:24.230
and to be doing something and,

865
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:28.920
and always have like a project to be working on to like go forward on something.

866
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.090
Uh,
but being allowing,
you know,
that downtime and,

867
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.410
and through that I feel like I have a toolbox and I can kind of be like,
okay,

868
00:53:37.411 --> 00:53:39.990
well let's try this thing.
This doesn't work.
Okay,
let's try this.

869
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:44.850
And so I have like some different resources like that,
like meditation or,
um,

870
00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:48.360
you know,
lessening the screen time and making room for fun.

871
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.890
I didn't do that for years where I just was like so busy,
you know,
just like,
oh,

872
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:53.940
got to grind,
got to do this.

873
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.940
And I wouldn't even allow myself to have fun in situations.

874
00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:59.580
That should be fun because I'd always be thinking about the things that I needed

875
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:01.080
to do.
So,
you know,

876
00:54:01.081 --> 00:54:05.520
making sure that you have and allow time to just play and have fun and be silly

877
00:54:05.521 --> 00:54:09.590
and,
you know,
act like a little kid.
Sometimes I do that,
I'm ready.

878
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:13.140
I'm ready to ride those bikes after this and like form like my little leg,

879
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.320
you know,
bike crew or whatever,
just like ride around Google,
get it,
you know,

880
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:21.270
just stuff like that.
Silly.
But it's fun and it gets you kind of out of the,
the,

881
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.350
the stress sometimes.
Awesome.
Well,
thank you Lindsey,

882
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:30.530
and we're so glad that you were able to join us and we'll now stick around for

883
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:35.640

Yeah.
Woo.
Yay.
Thank you.
