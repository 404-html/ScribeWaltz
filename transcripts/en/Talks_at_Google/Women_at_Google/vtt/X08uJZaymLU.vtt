1
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.370
Alex shiny.
Wow.

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.730
<v 1>[inaudible] you can here.</v>

3
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:14.520
Yeah.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.630
<v 0>Okay.
This isn't nerve wracking.
I've done this once before.</v>

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.930
Or you came five years ago for your first book.
Yeah,
it was super cranky.

6
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:22.770
I'm a Gemini.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.860
That half of me was like on the porch drinking beer and I came here and people

8
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.130
were like,
hmm.
Most and googled talk.

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.700
Um,
so what made you ready to decide to write another cookbook?
Um,

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.410
compulsive behavior.
No,
I'm kidding.
I'm naturally not.

11
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.280
Um,

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm an insomniac and I am the thank you mam.

13
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.050
Is that you?
Um,
I'm an insomniac.
Um,

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.700
I cook a lot.
Um,
I cook a lot at home because I have an 11 year old child.

15
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.240
Ava.
It was here today.
Yes.
Um,

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.710
she's forced to be there.
She looks so gracious and hospitable,

17
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.180
but really it's all a lie.
Um,
so I'm an insomniac.
I love to cook.

18
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:16.100
I Cook a lot at home and I think that books for chefs that are Chevy,

19
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:16.341
you know,

20
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:21.050
where your tweezing caviar on tiny little pieces of micro celery that are then

21
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.380
suspended in midair and they're from Switzerland.

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.540
That stuff is really daunting.

23
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.590
And I find that a lot more of the cooking that I actually do is at home.

24
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.810
Um,
and so my,
I just apply a chef sensibility to home cooking.

25
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.110
And so I found there was just a big body of recipes I had that really spoke to

26
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.840
me in that way.
And that's really how this book came about.
Yeah.

27
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:46.880
Cause it's been five years in between,
right,

28
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.040
because you came here five years ago.
Yes.

29
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.660
And a reminder of my unproductivity no,
I'm teasing.

30
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:58.370
The book is so full,
like,
yeah,
there's so much depth in it and there's so many,

31
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.300
so many recipes that are not daunting for someone who is not a culinary trained

32
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:06.950
person like myself.
Um,
to tackle,
I just think how much,

33
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.110
you know,
there's so many cookbooks in the universe.

34
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.230
I am the daughter of a cookbook editor.

35
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.220
My mother is basically the Quincy Jones of Cookie Academy and she,

36
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:20.630
um,
I just kind of said,
how many more cookbooks can we put out in the world?

37
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.490
And I have,
I went to Martha Stewart's last book party and I said,
wow,

38
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.270
a book about flowers.
Martha,
what book is this for you?
And she said,

39
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:33.500
it's my 99th book.
Wow.
And I just said,

40
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:36.530
I'm on like point 99.
Um,

41
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.880
so apparently there's a lot more to say.
How did you choose the recipes?

42
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.010
Um,
that's a good question.
You know,
uh,

43
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.790
just collections,
uh,
every kitchen I worked in,

44
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:53.720
I just took notes on a notepad and they're all like small,

45
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:55.090
they fit in the back pocket or,

46
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.560
or in the bra so you can write something down and just know chef I had to that

47
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.830
down.
Um,

48
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.240
and there were just greasy and butter stained and they have like,
you know,

49
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.460
the raspberry jam on them.

50
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.460
But I just collected all these recipes and I sort of find that the recipes pop

51
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:19.870
up in for,
you know,
in their,
in their proper order as I,

52
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.400
as the book unfolds.
So really I write the,

53
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.010
I wrote the book late at night and early in the morning everybody's sleeping and

54
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.360
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
I'm deep in a raspberry doughnut recipe.
And my daughter's like,

55
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.050
what's up?
And I'm like,
I can't talk.
The yeast is wrong.

56
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.410
I remember the talk I'm you did five years ago cause I was here for that.

57
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.750
You mentioned that your mom did the similar,

58
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.380
what's similar and the way she edited the cookbooks you would get up and she

59
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:49.060
would still be editing from the night before.
So twisted my,
I twisted.

60
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.020
Yeah.
My Mother did the 1997 revision of the joy of cooking.

61
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.910
So every 10 years or so the joy of cooking is revised.
Why,

62
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.220
why revise a book like this?
Well,

63
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.270
I mean when you've turtle soup and squirrel brain in a recipe in a,
in a book,

64
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.070
we don't kind of realize,
tastes evolve.
Um,

65
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.790
we now have an Instagram of,
we'll do double decker,
Turkey squirrels sandwich.

66
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.720
I mean,
I'm kidding,
but maybe not.
Um,

67
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.180
so my mother was revising this book and it took,

68
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.190
I mean it took almost four years of her life and I was working at a restaurant,

69
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:28.540
Danielle at the time,
and I started my shift at four o'clock in the morning,

70
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.800
the lunch shift.

71
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.390
I would start prepping lunch food at four 30 and sometimes not be set up by the

72
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.400
way,
just like someone would order something at noon.
And I'm like,
hmm,

73
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.610
to have that by the time they get back from the bathroom or their phone call.

74
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.610
So my,
my mom and I were on the same schedule.

75
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:50.611
I mean I would get up and she would be bent over a stack of papers at the dining

76
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:52.600
room table and I would say,
I'm going to work.

77
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.940
And she would just hold up a picture and say,

78
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.660
does this look like a mallet peck oyster?
And I'm like,
no,

79
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:01.120
you know a Mel peck is a little,
she's like,
shut up.
It's a Malpais.

80
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.110
So she was asking,
but she wasn't.
So I learned,
you know,

81
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.290
this does this look like a Belgian waffle.
I'm like,
it's a nice waffle.

82
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.300
She's like,
does it look Belgian?
So things got a little intense,
you know,

83
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:17.800
sleep deprivation and lack of food and oxygen and water while you're writing a

84
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:22.380
book about food and oxygen and water can get a little ironic.
What,
um,

85
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.260
how did you choose how to break up the chapters?
Like I saw that,

86
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.600
I was very curious to ask you this.

87
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.310
Root vegetables and the onion family got their own chapters.
You know,

88
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:38.311
I'm so sick of non-sexy vege hanging out underneath in the dark bins in the

89
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:41.680
nosebleeds of the supermarket,

90
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.950
like asparagus and fava beans and fresh peas and pineapple.

91
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.310
Right.
They're all the ones that have all this external sex appeal.
Right.

92
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.320
What about the unsung heroes?
What about the kind of,
bless your heart,

93
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:59.270
homely vegetables.
It really deliver.

94
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.970
So a lot of what the potato,
I went at the bins underneath Rutabaga,

95
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.580
celery root,
even mushrooms.
I mean,

96
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.010
I feel like they're always there and you're like,
oh,
whatever.

97
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:14.990
I'll buy mushrooms as a truffle truffle.
Right,
right.
Okay.

98
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:18.800
But you know,
they're not native to America and there are no truffles here.

99
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.430
So I tried also to stick with,
I love the supermarket.
I mean,

100
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.750
for me it's like a wonderland.
I can't,
I go to the supermarket,

101
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.560
I'm there for two hours,
just like,
well,
look at this.
It's really sick.

102
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.470
I need counseling.
Um,
I do,
I need to,

103
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:38.000
like if I go to a farm stand and a supermarket,
that's the day for me.
It's over.

104
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.010
Um,
so all those mushroom that,

105
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.550
the supermarket mushrooms that are always there,

106
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.490
like should talkies Kermes portobellos white.
But there's so much stuff.
So again,

107
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:52.280
there's a supermarket,
mushroom chapter.

108
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:57.080
I hate those recipes to the are like take three pounds of Porcini mushrooms

109
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:01.340
fresh from Oregon.
I'm like,
I don't have that.
How do you feel about some,

110
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:04.430
you know,
Shataka is from a parking lot in New Jersey?
Well that,

111
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.890
can I sub that in?
So if I'm thinking that aren't a lot of people,

112
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.570
we're not all Eric repairing.
No one actually is.
I put there,

113
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.290
I actually think he's an imposter himself.

114
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.060
This is just a perfect human being.
It's really upsetting.
Yeah,
he's married.

115
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.923
Let's move on.

116
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.460
So obviously you have cooked from your own cookbook.
I,

117
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.090
what's your Goto recipes for the week?
Um,
I'm really,
you know,

118
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:37.670
I give lots of recommendations,
but as a chef,
I,

119
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:42.020
I approach a cookbook cooking from a cookbook in a very disorganized fashion.

120
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.610
I think a lot of chefs do this.

121
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.560
I'll take a cookbook and I'll look at a pork chop and apple recipe and I will

122
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:50.180
turn it into,
it'll,

123
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.920
I'll make it multiple times and then the recipe will give me an idea for a Pi

124
00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.610
and the pork chop recipe then morphs into a great pie filling that started with

125
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.680
something else.
So for this,
um,

126
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.510
I really like the Pasta recipes and I like them cause you can make them and when

127
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:09.680
they sit overnight,

128
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.400
after you're done eating a bunch of it in the door of the fridge really late,

129
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.100
I know you're not here the whole time,
then you got stuff in your fridge.

130
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.340
Everybody does it.
The deal door of the fridge and your underwear type of eating.

131
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.390
That is so delicious.
Let's be honest.
Um,

132
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.710
so I like those types of recipes for the snack and then maybe the next day they

133
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.290
taste even better.
So anything tomato base for example,

134
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.450
tomatoes love to be cooked and then left to sit overnight or even two days I

135
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:42.650
find their better.
And He,
I have a lot of one pot meals.
Those are great too.

136
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:44.360
And people love that.
You know,

137
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.500
people aren't going to spend as much time as I do cooking.

138
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.360
And I assume not obsessive Lee seeing food everywhere.
They look in the universe.

139
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.871
I mean,

140
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:57.330
literally I went to a story yesterday and I was looking at surf boards and I'm

141
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:02.331
like an ice cream sandwich shaped like a surfboard with a flared edge.

142
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:07.050
I'm all in with,
I'm thinking flavor combos of cookies and ice cream.

143
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.380
And then I realized that I just look creepy.

144
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.030
Um,
and that some people go to the store and just see a surf board.

145
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.180
So probably a lot of those types of recipes that are make ahead or they can sit

146
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:21.630
in the fridge.
Also,

147
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:26.040
there's a whole chapter of sauces and vinaigrettes so you can make a bunch of

148
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:28.710
those,
throw him in the,
what I call the door of the fridge.

149
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.060
And then you buy something,
chicken,
steak,
whatever you're feeling,

150
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.980
Tofu,
vegetables,
and you throw one of those sauces on it and then you feel fancy.

151
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.120
And then you tell people you made the whole meal yourself or just buy something

152
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.390
to go and just dump one of your homemade vinaigrettes on it and be like,

153
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.253
I crushed it.

154
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.460
What chefs have inspired you over the years?
I love this question.
Um,

155
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.000
so many,
um,
chefs,
I envy chefs.

156
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:06.230
I want to be that.
I won't be chefs.
I'm so mad at being that aren't me.

157
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.550
There's a lot of envy and jealousy getting a theme.
Um,
and then chefs,

158
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:14.090
I just love to some,
I love to talk,
so I'm,
I love to watch cook.

159
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.800
Um,
I like Anne Sophie peak a lot.
She's French.

160
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:22.640
She's got a three star Michelin and she just stands there like this,

161
00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:25.370
calmly with like 700 people behind her all.
Like

162
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.360
I covered that kind of relationship.
I go to my own restaurant,
they're like,

163
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:32.360
what's up Ida?
He was like,

164
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:35.720
rap music blasting and they throw me like a pint container of ice water.

165
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:36.560
And I'm like,
hmm,

166
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:39.850
<v 1>okay.</v>

167
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.790
<v 0>Uh,
it's all a matter of how you frame the picture of people.
Um,
I like,
um,</v>

168
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.580
chefs I've worked for or with key Savoie who has a restaurant in Las Vegas and

169
00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:52.780
in Paris.
I worked for him for almost seven years and he,

170
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:54.070
I hear his voice in my head.

171
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.480
I think everyone has a mentor or a boss or a colleague and that's the voice or

172
00:10:58.481 --> 00:11:02.150
your mother.
If you've not worked it out on the couch,
that's where it's,
you know,

173
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.880
that's where it stays for a little while.

174
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.660
I hear his voice in my head when I'm cooking and he just,

175
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.960
the one thing he always taught me was do not ever throw flavor away.

176
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.060
If you're cooking something in a pan,

177
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.360
get the juices from where that fish or meat or whatever cooked and get that into

178
00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:22.510
the dish and not for the dishwasher.
And so every time I'm cooking,

179
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:26.050
I always think,
how can I keep all the flavor in the room?

180
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.740
And so that constant reminder,
because it,
that's true.

181
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.770
Every time you cook something,
whether it's a slice of toast,
you're like,

182
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:36.250
collect the crumbs,
collect the good bits,
everything has,
you know,

183
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:40.150
don't leave anything behind.
And so he's a big one for me.

184
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.820
So shifting a bit,
um,
how did you end up on the food network?

185
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.660
I know.
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't,
I can't believe it.
Right.
Crazy.

186
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.260
You're an iron chef.
Yeah,
I know.
Oh,

187
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.480
I saw,
no,
are you crazy town?
I get up every day.
I'm like,

188
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:00.910
my life is a complete sham,
but I am an iron chef.

189
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.420
What was I feeling?
Oh my God.
That,
and imagine it's on television.

190
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.400
I can watch one of the grid.

191
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.090
I mean giving birth to my child was definitely the best,

192
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:17.110
but I don't want to watch that video.
Not My sexiest,

193
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.670
but to watch getting that title was,

194
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.510
I can,

195
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.860
my daughter has it saved in the DVR and I'll come home every once in a while and

196
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:29.860
she's like,
check this out.
Oh,

197
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:34.861
this old thing I sold real of me be so great because you know a lot of chefs,

198
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.350
I don't know maybe a lot of people,

199
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:43.351
but a lot of chefs I think are a hybrid of acute arrogance and low self esteem

200
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.050
and no middle.
So we're like a really great donut with no feeling.

201
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.000
And so when you have a moment that's actual validation that you can witness,

202
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.370
um,
it's a,
it's a,
it mixes that salad up.
And for me it did.

203
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.140
And,
um,
so I won and I,
all I was thinking was,
oh,

204
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.650
don't cry.
Like,
just please don't cry,
you know,
inside,

205
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.800
like don't get all like you like me,
you really let you know,
like none of the,

206
00:13:09.801 --> 00:13:13.000
I just thought so I thought that.
So then I thought about,
you know,

207
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:17.890
like puppies in a meadow running in the field and flowers and cake of course.

208
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.650
And then Bobby flay came up to me and said,

209
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.060
the best thing about this is how much you deserve it.
And I just saw it.

210
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.290
I can die now.
I mean,
we're good.
And went home.

211
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.310
I did the show once and I didn't win.
Just so we're clear.
I'm talking about that.

212
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.120
No,
we will,
we will talk about the flawed journey.

213
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.800
Um,
and so they called me and they said,
you know,
we want to do a redemption,

214
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.570
um,
series,
will you do it?

215
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.320
And I said,
no,
I'm not going to do it again.
I just can't.

216
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.950
I can't have my heart broken twice.
Um,

217
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.350
many of you have dated people and broken up and been like,

218
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:58.510
I'm never talking to them again.
And then the next day you're like,

219
00:13:58.511 --> 00:13:59.380
what time is dinner?

220
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.090
I was really like on the breakup trail with this show.

221
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.900
And I called my mother and I said,
they want me to do the next iron chef again.

222
00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:10.870
And she said,
Oh,
don't do those competition shows.
You're so bad at them.

223
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.990
Snapshot Childhood damaged questions.

224
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.150
I'll take questions on that one.
So I did it and I,
well,

225
00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:26.360
I said to the food network,
can I do it?
But can you guarantee that I win?
That's,

226
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:31.180
I think that's fair guys.
It's like a fair playing field.
I win.

227
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.180
Um,
and they said no.
So that didn't work.

228
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.540
Um,
and I remember,
um,

229
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.920
just my cell phone ran out of juice and I was on the street and there was like a

230
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:49.240
payphone on the corner where I live.
So I'm like half a block from my apartment,

231
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:52.070
but on the payphone with my agent like a dude.
So

232
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.790
every time I look at that pay phone now I'm like,
you know,
like what a dope.

233
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.080
But I really just thought,
if I don't do this again,

234
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.300
if I don't take a chance on myself again,

235
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.660
I won't forgive myself.

236
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.070
Then that opened up a lot of doors to Ben be featured more on the food network

237
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:14.330
has every time I turn the food network on your,
on everything,

238
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.220
I have wine guy's grocery games,
you're on beat Bobby flay or on chopped.

239
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.980
I'm involved with the Mafia.
Uh,

240
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.020
I know it's so weird.
I turn it on.
I'm like,
hi you again.

241
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.280
It's really hard to watch yourself.
I liked the episodes of chopped.

242
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:35.240
I enjoy them more when I'm not on them watching them.
Um,
it's,

243
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.920
it's really interesting for me to,
I,

244
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.280
every year I have a different favorite judge.
You know,
like I'm like,

245
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:44.960
look at June this year,
but every year we go to the set of chopped and say,

246
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:48.140
what are we're here again?
We can't believe it.

247
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.440
And then I fall into a chop marathon on my own couch.

248
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.690
So I'll come home from shooting chopped,

249
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.770
and even I'll watch four episodes and shop net net.

250
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:02.060
I never want to see Ted Allen again.
He's like,

251
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:06.020
come over for dinner.
I'm like,
no,
I'm so sick of you.

252
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.570
When I watched the guy's grocery games,
you,

253
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.870
you won on the frozen feud where you took scallops and like frozen lemon sorbet

254
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:23.630
and made some fancy dinner.
I,
how did you do that?

255
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.250
It was from really neurotic.
I love a supermarket.
Suicides.

256
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.680
Sorbet would've never think to use that in a savory dish.
Well,

257
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:36.740
that's guy.
Okay.
That's the land of guy.

258
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.520
It was an unbelievable human being.
Yeah.
Um,

259
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.390
astoundingly smart.
He's there as much as you are.
Every time I turned it on,

260
00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:48.470
I'm either watching chopped or diners driving and dive.
Oh yeah.
Well he says,

261
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:51.740
you know,
I'm shooting triple d and then I'm going to triple g and I'm like,

262
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.980
oh my God,
you're making your way through the alphabet.
We do shows.

263
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.240
That show is so awesome.
I love running around a supermarket.

264
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.430
It's an incredible set.
It's a supermarket fully loaded and you know,

265
00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:06.740
I'll catch guy in the aisle,
snacking on stuff.
He's like,

266
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:08.060
this product's really good.

267
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.190
So the next challenge they set us free and I just take all this stuff guidelines

268
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.980
and I'm like,
oh,
why do you like this,
this,
um,

269
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:19.160
I get him to open cans and jars from me while he's standing there.

270
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.180
He is really fun to work with.
Um,

271
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.200
and I loved the show so I don't know.
Something about the supermarket.

272
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.650
I mean it's basically chopped is a great training ground for any other

273
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:35.600
competition show for me.
And I'm so unbelievably competitive.
I mean people like,

274
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:38.840
well,
you know,
I liked this sorbet.
And I'm like,
why do you like that one better?

275
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.650
You know,
it takes nothing for me to get rolling.
I mean,

276
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:47.330
I'll fight you right now for this cookbook.
I'm kidding.
Sorry.

277
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.320
But I really competitive and it's been such a privilege to be able to compete on

278
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:57.000
TV,
um,
and call that part of what I do.

279
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.330
I started out on food network challenge years and years ago.

280
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.770
I did a Thanksgiving challenge.

281
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.520
We had five hours to make a Thanksgiving dinner and it filmed in Denver,

282
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:07.320
Colorado,
and I,
I had never been,

283
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.770
and I really didn't know about the cooking and altitude thing.

284
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.750
I didn't think that was real.
I'm like,
oh,
come on.

285
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:16.320
Was this silly little mountain stuff?
It makes such a difference.

286
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:18.570
I've learned about this on top chef.
Yeah.
I mean,

287
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:21.660
I tried to make mashed potatoes and it never happened five hours.

288
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:24.000
I kept believing,
you know,
they're just like,

289
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:27.900
hold on until you know the cat kitten on the branch.
Like hang in there.

290
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.460
That kind of poster like that.

291
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:33.330
I was the poster child for hoping that the altitude was not a reality.

292
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.210
So I didn't win.
And I thought,
well if you don't win,

293
00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:39.810
you don't get asked to be on TV again.
But boy do they like a loser.

294
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.550
They were like going to Shelly,
how are ya?

295
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.100
I saw you last and most glorious fashion.
Are you busy?
Well,

296
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.371
you know,

297
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:51.030
I was at home fielding all my offers from having just lost the competition show.

298
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.860
So it snowballed.
I did some,
I judged some iron chef.

299
00:18:55.861 --> 00:19:00.620
I met Bobby Flay,
who I,
I famously really didn't like.
I used to turn on food,

300
00:19:00.621 --> 00:19:01.201
now are going to be like,

301
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:06.201
who's this guy thinks he's so cool with his grill and his spatula and his stupid

302
00:19:06.631 --> 00:19:11.510
hamburgers and I couldn't have been more wrong about that.
So,
um,

303
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.520
I did some daytime cooking stuff and then I just chopped came along and I just,

304
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.970
I,
oh,
I said no to the producer called me about chopped and I said,

305
00:19:20.971 --> 00:19:23.970
I don't want to be on that show.
It seems like it won't be a hit.

306
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.840
You think guys think my career as a TV exec is just no right?
Like no,
let it go.

307
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.840
Um,
and they just kept co really,

308
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:38.490
I mean I have to say there was one food network producer,
um,

309
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.680
exact who just stopped me and said,

310
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:45.450
just go once to the set and do one episode.
And if you don't like it,

311
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.320
you don't have to go back.

312
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.760
So I shot one episode of chopped and the floor producers said,

313
00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:54.060
what do we have to do to get you to do this show?
And I said,

314
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:55.530
I always have to sit in the middle.

315
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.820
So I'm the only judge who always sits in the middle.
Oh,
you're a,

316
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.030
you're not king center square.
I used to watch a Hollywood squares.

317
00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:06.690
I was like in the middle cares about the,
the,
the suburbs.

318
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.060
It seemed like a good move.
You know what I'm saying guys,
when you're judging,

319
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:16.740
is there anything you've been given that's been just awful tasting all the time?

320
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.220
Really?
Yeah.
Or wait,
let me rephrase that.
No,

321
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.133
nothing.

322
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.060
There's been a lot of awful stuff and there are a lot of ingredients that if you

323
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:28.140
didn't grow up eating them,

324
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.500
you don't have an understanding of them that's ingrained in you.

325
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:36.390
You cannot fake that.
Um,
I have ingredients I'm given where I'm like,
no,

326
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.640
I needed to start with this ingredient,
the age of 10,

327
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.600
either eating it or cooking it or both to really understand it.

328
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:46.440
And that's where culture is a card to play on chopped.

329
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.800
And if you happen to get an ingredient in the basket that that's part of your

330
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:53.830
cultural background or part of what you ate growing up,

331
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.080
that's a big advantage.
And that's like a luck thing in a way.
Um,

332
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.960
but yeah,
I've had some hideous stuff.
Oh my God.

333
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.200
And the worst is when the nicest person makes the worst dish and you're like,

334
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.710
I would love to have drinks with you,

335
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:10.780
but you're about to meet that hallway and get shot.

336
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.960
And that's hard.

337
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.960
Or when someone is an amazing chef with an incredible pedigree and doesn't have

338
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:24.310
the confidence in that context and blows it w I can't tell you how many times

339
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:26.620
we've had the,
the best cook out of the four of them,

340
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.430
blow it on the first round and leave two of the ingredients off and they're
like,

341
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:32.890
I know it was sitting there and you're like,
what do you like?

342
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:36.670
My whole day was based on what you are going to do.
What am I supposed to do now?

343
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.700
And I think that's why the judges on chopped are unique.
I think I,

344
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.150
I call us the cast of friends.
I think you pick like we all do with friends.

345
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:48.550
You don't know why?
Like some days you just feel chandlery.

346
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.090
Some days you feel Monica [inaudible] some days you're singing smelly cat.

347
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.210
I think people do the same thing with the chuck judges.

348
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.490
Sometimes we feel debonair,
a carrion.

349
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.050
Sometimes we feel like nebulous and strange.
Santos,
you know,

350
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:03.490
it depends on what you're vibing.

351
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.510
I always say Amanda Fried tag is sort of the upholder of cooking truth.

352
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.120
She's like,
everything you did was unbelievably creative,

353
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:14.190
but your chicken is overcooked.
And I'm like,
I,

354
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.130
I'm much more of like a Koombaya.
Like,
Oh,
you made a drawing a creative.

355
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:20.140
If I tilted this way,
I understand it.

356
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.730
Amanda goes right for the truth of the food,
you know?

357
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:26.950
So it's so interesting that mix.

358
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.980
How do they choose or do you know how they choose the ingredients?

359
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.640
It's a tub secret.
No,
it's food,
food network.

360
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.130
We have a whole staff of people that choose the baskets.

361
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:38.860
You can make suggestions.
Um,

362
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.140
you can beg and plead for things not to be in there.
Um,
but it's,

363
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.910
it's a,
it's a group of people,

364
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.280
a group of trained experts that just sit around googling things.

365
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.940
So step it up,
guys.
Um,

366
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.690
what is the best meal that you've ever had?

367
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.940
I know mine.
That's why I always ask people this,
God,

368
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:07.060
that takes real presence of mind to know something like that.

369
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.540
The best meal I've ever had.
You never had an experience where you just like,
wow,

370
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:14.710
this is,
this is like top 10.
Yeah,
I ate in a,

371
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.470
I lived in France for almost seven years,
almost all of my twenties.

372
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:22.471
I spent living in France and I went down to nice randomly for like a couple of

373
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.440
days in the Riviera and there was a little hole in the wall.

374
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.050
It's not really a hole in the wall,
but it's small and very homey.

375
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:33.640
Beasto they don't have phones and they have just communal tables with these very

376
00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:35.170
uncomfortable little stools.

377
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.360
And the wife is on the floor taking orders in seating guests and the husband is

378
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:44.170
cooking and that's it.
And so it was literally like,

379
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.530
I grew up an only child with my parents.
And that's my family.
I mean,

380
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:52.040
a lot of people have 8 million cousins and I'm Italian,
you know,

381
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.190
like you figure I got a million cousins and all that.
I'm just,

382
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:59.570
I'm very lean in the family department and it felt like my mother and my father.

383
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:02.570
So right away it was a setup that felt very homey to me.

384
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.200
And then the husband dropped fresh pasta,

385
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.390
boiling hot and water hot,

386
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:13.370
the Pasta water on Basil Pesto in a giant bowl next to where I was sitting and

387
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:16.220
just tossed it and the steam wafted over.

388
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:19.640
And I just cried and I was like really going to cry,
like,

389
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:21.980
like water for chocolate,
like eat,
pray,
love.

390
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:26.330
Like I had a personal revelation and now I'm amazing.
Not at all.

391
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.610
It just smelled really good.
And I wanted to eat the whole bowl.

392
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.420
And so I ate that pasta,
like a complete savage.
I mean,

393
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:37.400
I think utensils were just kind of on the periphery of my behavior.

394
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.900
Um,
and he made some rabid and some other stuff and I just kind of cried a lot.

395
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.820
I didn't talk,
I just cried.

396
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.100
And I can't say food generally makes me do that.
It,
I mean,
on chopped,

397
00:24:49.101 --> 00:24:53.930
I cry for different reasons.
So yeah,
that might be it.
And I liked that.

398
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:58.830
No phone,
no nothing.
You want to go,
you got to roll up.
It's not on the your GPA,

399
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.970
it's just God you got to really,
you know,

400
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:06.950
put some Goji berries in your pouch and climb a mountain on a loin cloth to find

401
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:11.090
this place.
Old School.
My,
um,
if any of my team through,

402
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:12.890
they know that whenever I plan off science,

403
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:17.210
I always add an activity of food tours because I am obsessed with them.

404
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.600
I love traveling and I feel like that's the best way to get to know a place.

405
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.730
Have you ever done one and a food tour?
No.

406
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.060
No.
Are you anti or just never done one?
You know,

407
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:31.250
I'm going to put it to you like this.
Honestly,

408
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:36.310
it's really hard for me to have food be any more a part of my life than it

409
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:41.210
already is.
In fact,
the fight for me is to have something not food related.

410
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.320
You know,
people say like,

411
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.870
what are your hobbies that round you out and give you balance.

412
00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:47.610
Like how do you find balance a,

413
00:25:47.611 --> 00:25:51.800
I think that's completely unrealistic as a goal.
First of all.
Second of all,

414
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:55.640
it's definitely not happening for me and I'm not going to lie about it anymore.

415
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.740
This is where I've come out with the truth.

416
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.780
I am not a balanced human and I don't have a balanced life.
I liked my child.

417
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.480
I like food,
I like flowers.
I like boating and needle pointing.
Um,

418
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:09.740
so I,
I,

419
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.390
my desire if I have any free time is to do something that doesn't have to do

420
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:17.360
with food.
And that's hard.
Yeah.
I'm like,
oh,

421
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:21.020
we're going to a pumpkin farm in an APP,
apple orchard that's not food related.

422
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.730
That's my idea of kind of getting out of the kitchen and not thinking about
food.

423
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.880
I went to the beach yesterday.
I'm like,
I wonder what,

424
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.580
what is that a bluefish no matter where I am,

425
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:36.500
I find something to eat creatures to cook.
Not you

426
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.860
yet.
I'm sure.
Um,
but you know what I mean?
So for me,
so,

427
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:47.220
but I admire people that do and I like you a lot.
I just,

428
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.080
it's my favorite thing I always find I learned the most and I learned about

429
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:54.240
these off the beaten path kind of places.

430
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:58.410
And I always used to go with the first day I'm somewhere,
so I had nowhere to go.

431
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.940
The rest of the time getting lost.
It's wherever I am.

432
00:27:01.941 --> 00:27:06.320
And finding those places.
I do that a lot.
I mean,
I was in Cleveland recently,

433
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.380
recently and I just found little Italy and just walked around and just wanted to

434
00:27:11.841 --> 00:27:13.070
feel Italian.

435
00:27:13.071 --> 00:27:17.450
Vaguely had like six can oles I figured that's what Italians are doing.
Um,

436
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.930
so yeah,
I understand that.
Yes.
But you mean organized tours?

437
00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:24.830
Like here's where the fresh potato was cooked.
Just no,
no.

438
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.560
What ev of everything that you've done so far,

439
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.700
what have you enjoyed the most of your career?
Like the TV shows,

440
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:36.090
the executive chef part,
the cookbooks.

441
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.140
Honestly,
I really like,
I really,

442
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.950
I'm privileged to say I enjoy him almost all of what I do.
Um,

443
00:27:43.951 --> 00:27:47.010
I don't like when the dishwashers are drunk and they don't show up at the

444
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:49.170
restaurant that I could do that.

445
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.160
I wish sometimes that I had become a plumber so that I didn't need to rely on

446
00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:57.540
other people to fix stuff.
That was the math I did when I graduated from college.

447
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.620
Do I want to be a plumber or a chef?
And I'm like Kinda like,

448
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.830
it's iffy guys.
Cause it's,
they're actually the same profession,

449
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:08.720
just one has onions and one has a toilet.
So,
um,

450
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.200
it's maybe slightly different.
Um,
but uh,

451
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.420
probably,
um,

452
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.830
cooking in a restaurant is the thing that speaks most to me.

453
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:23.100
And I think that's why when I've been on these TV shows,

454
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:27.270
it just feels like I'm at the restaurant cooking.
And so people say,

455
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:29.550
is a camera daunting to you or whatever else.

456
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:34.050
I get so lost in the sauce that I don't feel the camera.

457
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.050
A lot of times when I'm competing I'll say,

458
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:41.130
get out of the way to the camera people because there'll be filming and I'll

459
00:28:41.131 --> 00:28:46.131
have hot water and there's so close to me and I'm so in my planet I could,

460
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.520
I could hurts a camera person.
And so I say,
get out of the way.
And the,

461
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.540
they cut it in to make it sound like I'm saying everyone had of my way.

462
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.300
So I get all this mail,
like,
you know,

463
00:28:57.301 --> 00:29:02.190
we just think you could be a little bit nicer
and I'm like,
you try this.

464
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:08.070
Um,
so that's been kind of funny for me.
Um,
but I get lost,
I got to say,

465
00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:12.780
just pure cooking under pressure of any kind.
That's my whatever that is.

466
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.100
How often,
Jen,
do you still go into the restaurant?

467
00:29:16.101 --> 00:29:18.530
Because I feel like you have to be so busy with the cookbook,

468
00:29:18.531 --> 00:29:21.740
especially now that you're promoting it and with the TV shows you do,

469
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:23.280
where do you have time?
Fine.

470
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.190
I can go to the restaurant anywhere from zero to five times on any given week.

471
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.690
It depends.
So,
and I,
I mean generally it's the,
it varies wildly.

472
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:37.500
But I have one restaurant,
unlike a lot of other chefs,

473
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:42.040
I only have one and I've had it for 17 years.
So,
um,

474
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.660
it's like a family to me to go there and be in the kitchen and you know,

475
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.460
eaten Yogi Mac and cheese on the line and hide.
That's like one of my,
come on,

476
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:58.180
I'm at work.
I'm very busy,
so a lot.
Um,

477
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.170
and it's,
I can take a taxi to it from where I live.
Very important.

478
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.640
Um,
and I love the people.
They're better people than I am.

479
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.910
It's good to be around people that are better than you.
Well,

480
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:13.780
that's amazing to have had it for 17 years because so many restaurants come into

481
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:16.750
New York City and just fail.
I,

482
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.710
I read the review of butter before I worked there in the New York Times and I

483
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:22.990
said,
this sounds like a real happening hip joint.

484
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.810
I want to go there before it closes.
I read the review,

485
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:30.760
I thought that there's something.
So a friend of a friend kind of thing said,

486
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:32.020
go down there,
they're looking for a chef.

487
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.200
So I went there and there was like a disco ball on the ceiling and the waiter

488
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:40.010
was like,
Hey,
what do you want to eat?
And I thought in,

489
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:44.230
no,
no,
this has nothing to do with all the experience I had had up to that point.

490
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:49.390
Um,
but I went in the kitchen and I looked at the chefs,
the cooks,

491
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.220
and there was one guy that was like cooking some scallops and he turned around

492
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:59.221
and he was smiling and I thought he's cooking the scallops and the vibration of

493
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:04.441
the Pan is going up his arm and making him smile because he loves it so much.

494
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.830
This is what I thought I saw,
you know,
in the sunlight.
She looks stunning.

495
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:13.060
So I looked at him and I saw the smile and he turned around and that was it.

496
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:16.810
I was like,
all right,
you look,
this is what's up.
I miss that.

497
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.180
And if it's here,
I'm going to work here.
So I took the job.
Um,
we called butter.

498
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.020
We can't believe it's still open for,

499
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.760
I come in every day like we're so clever.
Um,

500
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.950
but maybe if you laugh at yourself all the time and work really hard and just

501
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:35.230
keep it humble and keep moving,
maybe that works.

502
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:40.150
That gentleman cooking the scallops still works with me 17 years later and he's

503
00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:43.990
like,
my child,
I'm like,
where are you going?
You've had two beers.

504
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:48.920
You're not going anywhere.
He's like,
I,
I'm old now.
Um,

505
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.700
but you never know.
I went on,
I really went with it.

506
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.600
I went someone's facial expression dictated my choice and um,

507
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.210
I've not been sorry since that's something that you just know,

508
00:31:58.211 --> 00:32:02.560
like you have a feeling about places,
especially with work work.
Yes.

509
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:06.970
Romantic endeavors might be a little clever maneuvering those.

510
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:11.530
That's another topic we'll have Google after dark.
Um,

511
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.120
I will open it up to some questions now.
Does anybody dare ask a question?

512
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.170
I wouldn't anybody.
Alrighty.

513
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.190
We're all staring at your shirt.

514
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.030
You Judge People's food.
Yes.

515
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.010
So is it hard to turn off that instinct when you're eating out or just getting a

516
00:32:36.011 --> 00:32:40.640
slice or,
that's a great question.
Um,
I grew up with parents.

517
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:42.710
My mother would cook from the cookbook.

518
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:46.310
She was editing and asked my father and me what we thought.

519
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.140
And she collected 30 years of for Maine magazine and she would say,

520
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:55.340
is this pumpkin pie better than the 1986 version from October?

521
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:58.700
Or what do you think?
Well the cross is a little bit,

522
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:03.080
so I'm going through this in my head that I did this every night of my childhood

523
00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:08.060
and realize that my mother trained a chop judge by accident.
So I came from that.

524
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:12.620
I'm cut from that cloth and the answer is yes,
I can completely shut off.

525
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.900
And in most instances when I'm eating out,

526
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.940
I do imagine I go to a restaurant now and I take a sip of water and everybody

527
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:24.080
stops.
How is it?
I'm like,
it's tap water.

528
00:33:24.081 --> 00:33:27.320
You guys crushed it.
So yeah,

529
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:29.420
I can shut off and really enjoy food.

530
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.810
The downside is no one invites me over for dinner and I have very few friends

531
00:33:35.391 --> 00:33:40.010
now.
Hi,
big fan.

532
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.260
Thank you eva on your Instagram.
Ah,
um,

533
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.390
so you're on a bunch of different shows,
a lot of,

534
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.090
a lot of things going on and we don't get to see behind the scenes.

535
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:53.570
Can you give us any like sneak behind the scenes secrets,

536
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.390
especially for chopped I guess since it seems like things happen so quickly,

537
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:59.480
but how can those people really come up with something?
Oh No.

538
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.520
The reason the show is so good is because it's all real.
And,
and I,

539
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.430
I go there every time and I say,
what more can happen.
Seriously.

540
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:11.480
I go there and I am the most skeptical of all.
And like I went there,

541
00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:16.400
the last episode we shot somehow someone was cooking something and it caught on

542
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:17.234
fire.

543
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.500
Somehow something in the Pan was flammable in an enduring way.

544
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.650
They threw it in the garbage can,
the garbage can caught on fire.

545
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.800
It was like burning.
And I'm like,

546
00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.880
the producer just kind of looked like,
it goes over to the judges table.
Like,

547
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.930
cause we kind of marvel at,
um,

548
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.080
the humanity that is chopped.

549
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.680
And I think now that it's been on for a few years,

550
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.080
people come and they expect that even if they don't win,

551
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:48.890
they're going to have some experience and learn about themselves and grill.

552
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:54.260
And guess what they do?
They do.
And you know,
I say to people stuff like,
you know,

553
00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:57.680
they're saying,
I don't know,
I can't do this.
And I said,
this is voluntary.

554
00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.420
You came here today,
you're going to win a lot of money.
You don't want it.

555
00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:06.830
That pisses us off,
you know?
And people just say,
wow,
you know,

556
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.310
that's cool.
You know,
you need that sit up straight kind of talk.

557
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:13.250
That's what chopped can be.
As far as behind the scenes,

558
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:16.970
I think I would just say to you that Scott Conant and I have a special

559
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:19.550
relationship with the craft services table,
which is,
you know,

560
00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:24.551
the table of food that they put out for the crew does not really for us the

561
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:25.724
judges,

562
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:31.670
but if there's a jar of peanut butter and like a plate of cookies,

563
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:36.970
Scott and I'll go over and to erase the banana peel fisheye sandwich.

564
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:41.190
Just say he will just start scooping the peanut butter like,
man,

565
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:43.320
what were they thinking?
He's healing

566
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.220
through half a jar of peanut butter.
And I'm like,

567
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:50.730
you shouldn't eat all that peanut butter.
And I'm meeting a stack,

568
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.370
a sleeve of cookies.
It was up to heal.

569
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:56.580
So I sat down with the nutritionist,

570
00:35:56.581 --> 00:35:59.490
wasn't one day to figure out like what's a day on top like for me?

571
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:04.080
And I figured out it's between five and 6,000 calories.
Yeah,

572
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.010
well I'm not going to be a swimsuit model for sure.

573
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.500
So,
um,
I think that's a really interesting thing.
People ask me,

574
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:17.880
how much do the judges you'd or what do you eat an often we do what I call like

575
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:20.430
healing eating.
Like I will go to something,

576
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:24.210
I have always known to be good and I will eat this and all will be healed in the

577
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:28.710
land and it works.
But you know,
then you get elastic weight,
waist pants,

578
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.440
you know,
so that's the trade off.
Um,

579
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.120
I would say to you behind the scenes on chopped the open the basket,

580
00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:40.410
Ted says your time starts now and they start cooking and there's no extra like,

581
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:43.560
wait,
stop,
go blah,
blah,
blah.
Nothing.

582
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:48.080
And I think that's how you get these visceral experiences.
Um,

583
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.360
they did have a light blow out once when they were about to start cooking.

584
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.180
So it took them about five or six minutes to change the bulb.

585
00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.660
They changed the basket because they had had five minutes.

586
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.900
And I think those types of truths on the show really make it what it is.

587
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.360
The other thing I want to say is that that Bobby flay man on B,

588
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:12.450
both lay people are like,
oh my God,
how's he went all the time.
It's so fake,

589
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.370
please.
I'm like,
how did you win again?
So annoying.

590
00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.600
I've said he really does it,
but I've seen him lose.
He loses.
Yeah.

591
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.930
I like when he loses something like Tacos.
I'm like,
aren't you sorry.

592
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.130
He's like,
shut up.
This is your last episode.

593
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.670
Those are my,
yeah,
sure.
It's the eating.
I guess that's the behind the scenes.

594
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:36.563
Are you laughing at

595
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.870
<v 2>to begin the Kava toppy out butter is one of my favorite things in the world.</v>

596
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.110
Thank you.
Thank you for introducing that into my life.
Um,

597
00:37:48.111 --> 00:37:53.090
so considering the culinary world is definitely a male dominated industry as a

598
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:54.500
prominent woman in the field,

599
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.450
what advice would you have for young professional women who are considering

600
00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:01.610
starting their careers?
Is that,
you know,
with my sister though,

601
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:07.230
<v 0>his sister
imaginary,
your friend,
just googling me.</v>

602
00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.340
I might go,
I mean,
you're an only child.

603
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.810
I get this question a lot.
I,
I'm going to write the,
the proper answer in a book,

604
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.910
but until I do that,
I'll say off the cuff,
which I'll regret later.

605
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.610
Um,
probably I just always ignored gender and,

606
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.660
and I think that in a gender fluid time where I think we're really questioning

607
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.220
gender roles,

608
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:38.080
I mean things like referring to yourself as they instead of he or she,

609
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:43.590
I think I was mentally referred to myself as a we and the we,

610
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.550
that was all the little characters in my personal play that gave me the

611
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.580
confidence to stand in the kitchen with 27 men and cook all those years and be

612
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:58.690
bad at it and be vulnerable and whatever else.
Um,
I just ignored it.

613
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:03.220
I just thought this is just part of the school yard.
You know,
I,

614
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.780
you know,
I find,
you know,

615
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:11.050
both genders can be cruel in their own way.
I'm sure you would agree.

616
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.690
Um,
but I really ignored that.

617
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.630
I just thought I want to be an expert and I want to be good at it and this is

618
00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:21.040
what I have to do.
And that,
that stuff was hard sometimes.

619
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:25.150
So is learning how to butcher a side of beef.
You know,

620
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.550
it wasn't just the people that was hard.

621
00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.600
It was all the work that I had to master or try to master.

622
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:36.880
Um,
so ignore it and be as polite as you possibly can.

623
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.170
Do you ever see the movie Roadhouse,
Patrick Swayze?
Probably not.

624
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.810
There's a whole talk in there,
you know,
he's a cooler,

625
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:45.910
like he's a bouncer and all these different places.

626
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:50.290
I want to hire him to just fix my life,
which is a little late for that.
But um,

627
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:53.820
he says be nice until it's time not to be nice,
you know,

628
00:39:53.821 --> 00:39:57.190
and he has this whole Chit Chat.
Some of you have seen the movie,
I'm sure.
I hope.

629
00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.140
Thank you.
Thank you dad.

630
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:08.290
You know,
something like that.
Um,
just keep it inside,
keep it moving,

631
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:09.670
stay polite and

632
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:11.330
<v 3>mm.</v>

633
00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:12.710
<v 0>Try to be the best in the room.</v>

634
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.040
And then that generally makes everything else not matter.

635
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.510
Even if you don't end up the best.

636
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.380
People respect you for effort and hard work.

637
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.730
I don't think anybody can ignore that,
if that makes sense.

638
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.750
And then sometimes all that just doesn't work and it just sucks also.
Um,

639
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.490
but ignore,
hit delete,
move on.
Yeah.

640
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.530
Hi.
Um,
I really like chopped.
And you as a judge,
thanks.

641
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.090
What you think is like the funniest or most memorable moment on the show.

642
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.390
No one's ever asked me that.
No one ever asks me what's funny.

643
00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:51.630
I've never been asked that.
What's funny?
Not much.

644
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:53.800
Um

645
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.753
<v 3>hmm.</v>

646
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.520
<v 0>I mean the funniest things to me are um,</v>

647
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.540
being on an episode with Jeffrey and Scott on either side of me.

648
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:09.000
That is the,
the,
the TRIFECTA.
The three of us.
Like we have some special bond.

649
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.230
I like watching Jeff and Scott Bicker over who's wearing a nicer suit

650
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.830
and they'll keep it going.
I mean,
we sit there for 10,
12 hours.
Oh Wow.
You know,

651
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:24.550
that's a la us a lot of thread count talk.
Um,

652
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.850
but the two of them,
they make me laugh the most really?

653
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.390
That that would have to be it.
Yeah.
They're just unbelievable.
And he's like,

654
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:35.660
do you see this?
And I'm like,
I just can't hold thing.
And your thing.

655
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:40.010
And Jeffrey is stratospheric mean,
you know now I've gotten,

656
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:44.750
Marcus Samuelsson is sort of like a competing fashion icon and I'm like,
Marcus,

657
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:47.470
I think you addressed this so well.
He really does.
I'm like,
mark,

658
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.990
I think you look a little nicer than Jeffrey today.
And Jeffery's like,
excuse me,

659
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.720
he's literally like a peacock,
like fanning has feathers.

660
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.750
So I enjoyed that with all that vanity is so much humility and intelligence that

661
00:42:02.501 --> 00:42:06.160
it's fun.
But then they cracked me up the most.
Definitely.

662
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.860
<v 4>So,
uh,
since you don't get invited out to eat ever,</v>

663
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.320
if you ever want to come over me and my wife will happily have you over just
one.

664
00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.630
Got It done.
You will be judged silently.

665
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.420
I feel pretty confident in my skills.
I'm an amateur.
I feel bad.

666
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:23.283
Take care of that.

667
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:28.480
<v 0>Buildings crumbling.</v>

668
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.140
<v 4>Out of all of the dishes that you've ever had,</v>

669
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.330
<v 0>therapist said,
I can ignore you</v>

670
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.790
<v 4>the best one that you've had so far on junk.
Yeah.</v>

671
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.680
<v 0>Best,
best one.
The one that made you go ahead.
There's a couple.</v>

672
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:53.000
Yeah,
there's a couple people usually ask me the worst.

673
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:57.530
You guys are so sunshiny the funniest small man.
What's your favorite dish?

674
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:00.920
People like what's discussing?
Tell us.
I asked you that.

675
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.120
Um,
yeah,
there was a dish.
I th I literally think it's season one.

676
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.740
It does a dessert.
And while I don't remember everything about it,
it was,
uh,

677
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:14.540
the person made a shortcake biscuit,

678
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:19.430
like a cream drop biscuit and they had to use pickled ginger and pickled grape

679
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:23.150
leaves.
The whole basket was like vinegar,
salt bomb.

680
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.680
And they made like a,

681
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.860
like a basically a shortcake with all these savory ingredients.

682
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:31.280
And it was just perfect.
And I remember,

683
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.680
I think I said to the producer,

684
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.000
is it okay if I say this is perfect and that I have no criticism?

685
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.240
And she said yes,
no.
Um,

686
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:47.090
but almost.
And that dish,
yeah,
that's my favorite one.

687
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.900
I had another one recently that was pretty good,
but I can't tell you about it.

688
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.960
I've also had,
um,
some really rough moments like period hot dogs,

689
00:43:56.961 --> 00:44:01.850
raw and French toast.
Yeah.
Sounds delicious.
Yeah,

690
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:06.560
I'll be serving it in the lounge after it.
So,
yeah.
Thank you.

691
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.680
Great question.
Hi.
Hi here.
Yes.

692
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:14.000
What is your favorite New York City grocery store to get lost in and spend a lot

693
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:17.000
of these questions.
You guys are so smart.

694
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:22.520
I wasn't ready for this,
really.

695
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:23.500
My favorite.

696
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.213
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

697
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.570
<v 0>I love so many.
I have to honest,
it's not a grocery store,</v>

698
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.460
but my favorite place to get lost hands down is the union square green market.

699
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:44.030
I start on Park Avenue and 17th Street and I just curve my way.

700
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:48.720
It's basically horseshoe shaped and I just curve my way all around.

701
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.330
That's my favorite grocery store.

702
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:55.230
I know it's not brick and mortar in the classical sense,
but you know,

703
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:59.880
I can eat five apple cider donuts and 14 muffins and,
and people are like,
oh,

704
00:44:59.881 --> 00:45:04.710
it's so healthy.
The green market like Zucchini.
Where's the fun in that?

705
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:05.680
Let me tell you again,

706
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.450
have a 10,000 calorie moment making that loop if you work hard.
Um,

707
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.393
and I like,

708
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:15.780
I really like keeping abreast of what farmers are making,

709
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:19.170
what in the tristate area.
I mean a lot of it is obviously New York,

710
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:21.000
some New Jersey.
Um,

711
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.840
I really like keeping up on what people are making and producing.

712
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:29.100
And I buy that and we serve so much of that at butter,
you know,

713
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:32.940
and I don't have like a wall of farmers with a picture of a cow and we don't

714
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:36.540
have any of that stuff.
We just buy the stuff and serve it.
Cause that's,

715
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:41.430
I feel as much as a restaurant is able to do that within their means.
To me,

716
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:46.320
that's what a restaurant should do.
So that's my favorite.
Um,
yeah,

717
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:51.230
sure.
I was,
I wish I had an even better answer.
Damage.
Yes.

718
00:45:51.231 --> 00:45:54.370
Last three questions.
Yeah.

719
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.730
So stressed out.

720
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.800
<v 5>Who would you most prefer to have a cook you a meal</v>

721
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.020
of all of the chefs and cooks that you've met?

722
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.700
<v 6>MMM,</v>

723
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:17.060
<v 0>God,
I'm like sweating.
I got a lot of friends and,</v>

724
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.980
but I got some enemies.
I gotta I gotta

725
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:27.150
probably,
you know,
I mean a wacky headspace.
Um,

726
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:33.230
I'd probably like Morimoto to cook me a giant Japanese feast or Rick Bayless

727
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.530
Cook.
We a huge Mexican feast.
That's kind of where my head is.

728
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.630
You asked me in two months and I'll pick someone French and someone you know

729
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:46.950
from South America,
but right now that'd probably be it.

730
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.810
I really also want and Sophie Pink.

731
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:52.020
I mentioned her earlier when we get to pick one though.
Stop it

732
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:59.070
worse.
Um,
yeah.

733
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:03.810
Morimoto I'm going to go with Rick Bayless for today.
I'm a I'm moody though.

734
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.170
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hi

735
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:11.360
<v 5>I,
oh I loved you on job.
Thank you.
Only on chopped you notice that?</v>

736
00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.460
That's the one I'm watching those.
So like I'm obsessed with the food network.

737
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.740
Like it plays in the background of my house all the time and like I love like

738
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:23.180
eating out and I love home cooking but like basically I hate cooking when I sell

739
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:25.340
because it stresses me out.

740
00:47:25.341 --> 00:47:28.130
Like there's like too many things that can go wrong and if I try and follow a

741
00:47:28.131 --> 00:47:31.750
recipe like really stresses me out because I'm worried that I'm going to

742
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:35.770
overcook something but I would like to be good at like I would like to cook

743
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.200
despite hating it right now.

744
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.260
<v 1>So do you want to have it?</v>

745
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.710
<v 5>Can I like,
do you have suggestions for like starting out,
like home cooking?</v>

746
00:47:46.711 --> 00:47:51.240
Like easy things to make or like recipe books?
I mean I guess you're selling it

747
00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.513
<v 1>right?</v>

748
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.890
<v 5>Things that are good to start out to make it less stressful.</v>

749
00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:00.030
<v 0>Oh honey.
Uh,</v>

750
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.040
is there someone in your family has a really good cook?

751
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:07.580
My Dad's a really good cut.
Did he do all the cooking while you were growing up?

752
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.340
Uh,
yeah.
So it was a kitchen was like his,

753
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.950
<v 5>yeah,
like my mom can't and my mom can't like boiling it.</v>

754
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.273
<v 1>Right.</v>

755
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:17.740
<v 0>I was just getting the vibe that someone was very territorial about the kitchen</v>

756
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:22.770
you grew up in and that you then as a result enjoyed all this great eating but

757
00:48:23.131 --> 00:48:26.110
maybe didn't exactly have the space to build some confidence,

758
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.750
<v 5>cook more.
But I just like,
I don't know,
it's,
it was seems stressful.</v>

759
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.880
Well this bar was too high.
I was like,

760
00:48:31.881 --> 00:48:33.880
if I cook it's not going to be as good as that.
So like

761
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:36.190
<v 0>we said the same thing.
You just said it in a different</v>

762
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.480
<v 1>[inaudible] very expensive mind you're talking to my therapist is living in a</v>

763
00:48:44.781 --> 00:48:49.100
yacht
and I am read tiling her third pool.

764
00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:51.740
Um,

765
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:55.460
<v 0>your dad's not coming over to your food unless you invite him.</v>

766
00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.430
So there's that to think about,
right?
I would say start with an egg.

767
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:08.570
You can boil an egg,
but you can also fry it.
Poach it.
Steam at bay,
get roasted,

768
00:49:08.571 --> 00:49:10.610
scramble.
You can do a lot of stuff with an egg.

769
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.480
And I think if you take the one ingredient and you just master all the things

770
00:49:14.481 --> 00:49:19.400
you can do with it,
um,
it really,
it's a great confidence builder.

771
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.790
I always say eggs and they're really easy to screw up.

772
00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.580
The real easy to cook and they're really easy to screw up.

773
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.270
And so if you can just fry an egg every day,
just heal honey.

774
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.080
<v 1>That's right.</v>

775
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:32.431
<v 0>He'll say,</v>

776
00:49:32.431 --> 00:49:37.431
I'm going to put these eggs into a cake and a souffle and a meatball and a

777
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:38.430
meatloaf.

778
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.820
And then all of a sudden you're cooking and then you invite your dad over for

779
00:49:41.821 --> 00:49:43.230
dinner and you're like,
excuse me,

780
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.553
<v 1>my house.</v>

781
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:52.600
<v 5>And then the last question I once dropped all the time and sometimes I wonder is</v>

782
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.040
as judges you play good cop,
bad cop.
Like it flows so much your,

783
00:49:57.041 --> 00:50:00.700
your comments where you know someone might slam someone but then someone else

784
00:50:00.701 --> 00:50:04.090
jumps in and says this is this like do you have to do you,

785
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.850
are you aware of that or do you feel bad ever if you're all three of you just

786
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.700
<v 0>no,
no to all of that.</v>

787
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:15.650
I know what you mean.
And some days I'm like,
you were so awful today.

788
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:17.780
And then some days I'm like,

789
00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:21.440
you're such a great buff but we don't do that on purpose.

790
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:24.200
And we don't ever say like,
okay dude you do this and I'll do that.

791
00:50:24.201 --> 00:50:28.360
Okay you take this and you,
I'll take that.
It just flows and know that's the,

792
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.740
the good fortune of fantastic accidental relationships between all the chop

793
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:36.770
judges.
And I find like,
you know,

794
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:40.430
I'll say I disagree in Jeffery's.
Like,
of course you disagree with me.

795
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:44.720
So he feels like I always disagree with him,
which I pretty much do.
Um,

796
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:49.610
but no,
that's all organic.
That stuff.
Yes.
I feel bad sometimes.

797
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:54.140
I wish,
I feel angry when someone doesn't do well.
That's great.

798
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.320
And that doesn't get portrayed right when it gets twisted through the lens of a

799
00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:01.570
TV.
Um,

800
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.000
or sometimes I'm very transparent with somebody and people write me like,

801
00:51:05.001 --> 00:51:06.710
y'all saw me and I hate jail.

802
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.780
So when I got my first hate mail,
I called my dad.
I was like,
nobody likes me.

803
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.320
Like clutching a can of paint thinner.
I'm like,
and my dad's like,

804
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:20.750
I think you're starting to really make it.
If someone doesn't like you,

805
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:25.160
that was very helpful.
Yeah.
The,
yeah.
And then I called my mom and she's like,

806
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:26.960
don't do those shows.
You're really bad at them.

807
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.570
So I've got alive a lots of workout.
Um,

808
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:36.600
but all that's just organic and I think that's why it's so great.

809
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:42.740
Yes.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for thanks for listening.

810
00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:47.970
[inaudible] finding books that ups the stairs there.
