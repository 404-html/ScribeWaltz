00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.400
Hi everybody.
Thanks for joining us on your midday break.
Um,

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.640
this is one of the very last events we're doing for the in the company of women

3
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.211
book tour.

4
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.930
And I have to say these conversations have been some of the most meaningful I've

5
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.510
had in the last 12 years of running my business.

6
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.870
And I run a blog called design sponge for the past 12 years,

7
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:28.830
which has slowly over the past decade kind of evolved from a site where we talk

8
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:32.520
about beautiful things to talking about the people behind those things and the

9
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.350
struggles they face and life and work.

10
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:36.870
And the new book in the company of women is,

11
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:40.380
is all about highlighting women's stories,
their struggles,

12
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.000
how they've pushed through difficult times.

13
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.980
All of these incredible women are a part of the book.

14
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.160
And today we're going to be talking about some of their stories and their

15
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.560
experiences.
So I'm going to let them introduce themselves.

16
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.960
Let's go down this way.
I'm Claire Manzur,

17
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:55.680
I'm one of the Co founders of a company called [inaudible] and we sell the

18
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.980
pieces and tell the stories of emerging makers in the United States.

19
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:02.050
And recently we've also expanded to include,
um,

20
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.130
just discoveries across lifestyle categories,

21
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:09.030
everything from our favorite restaurants to apps to,
um,
books.

22
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.860
And we do that in our podcasts and our newsletter and on the website.
Um,

23
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.430
I'm,
Eric has to reload the other cofounder of,
of a kind and cleared,

24
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:18.450
did such a great job.
I have nothing else.

25
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.140
<v 0>Sorry.
Erica,
would you like to introduce me?
I know
I'm,</v>

26
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.540
I'm Karen Karen Young.
I am the founder of a company called we shave.

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.580
It's a women's,
uh,
shave shave brand,
um,

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.840
and subscription club for,
um,
well obviously for women.

29
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.850
Okay.

30
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.820
<v 2>Um,
so we're going to start with one of my favorite questions from the book,</v>

31
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:46.970
which has to do with looking way,
way,
way back in time.

32
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.180
So I would love to know from each of you what you wanted to be when you were

33
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:53.450
little and how that connects to what you do now in any way.
Karen,

34
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:54.284
let's start with you.

35
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.090
<v 0>Um,
so when I was younger,
I,</v>

36
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.450
I had this fantasy of being a lawyer and I apologize now,
but,

37
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.930
um,
no,
I had this fantasy of being a lawyer.

38
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:10.910
I tend to be very analytical and I love to sort of process and really sort of

39
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.850
pick things apart.
Um,
so when I was young,

40
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:16.610
obviously it was the fantasy of like,
yeah,

41
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:19.790
I'm going to be in like this great high rise building and you know,

42
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:22.910
it's going to overlook the,
you know,
the Brooklyn Waterfront.

43
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.650
And eventually I was like,

44
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.090
actually I think somewhere hidden in there is designed because it was like

45
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.920
everything that I fantasize about was this concept of what a lawyer,
you know,

46
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.440
would look like and what my life would look like and so on.
Um,

47
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.050
and later on I just,
I kind of,

48
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:44.051
I actually went to school for psychology and I realized that I really just love

49
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.230
just,
you know,
pulling things apart and like really analyzing things and so on.

50
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.300
Um,
and I think the way that I turned it into what I do now,

51
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:57.350
I realized that I had a real love for product design.
Um,

52
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.150
and I also had a love for sort of understanding how people use things,

53
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:05.840
how to make people happy,
you know,
how like a daily experience,
um,

54
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.710
can sort of be changed into something that actually,
you know,

55
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.910
leaves a mark on someone.
Um,

56
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.000
so anytime I touch product or looked at product,

57
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.780
I always kind of thought about all of those little things.
Um,

58
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.320
and now what I do,
you know,
a good portion of what I do,

59
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.060
I hear from women a lot who are like,
you know,
email and say,

60
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:32.560
this product has really changed my life,
or,
you know,
the center.
So amazing.

61
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.830
Um,
and so somehow I think,
I,
I,

62
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.130
I like to say I took the scenic route to where I am now.
Um,

63
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.910
but somehow I think I managed to pull all those things together into a really

64
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.290
fantastic career.
[inaudible]

65
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.050
<v 3>Erica,
what about you too?
Um,
when I was growing up,</v>

66
00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:50.890
I don't think I knew what I wanted to be,
or at least,
um,

67
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.320
was unwilling to commit to an idea of what I wanted to be.

68
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.940
And when I was in college,

69
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.870
I did this amazing program called roadtrip nation that involved driving across

70
00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:03.660
the country in an RV with two friends and interviewing people who had taken an

71
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:04.760
interesting career paths.

72
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.600
And one of the people that we interviewed was a tune is a Rubenstein who was

73
00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:10.820
then the editor and chief of 17 magazine.

74
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.570
And I had booked that interview and it was someone I was really excited about

75
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.080
and we were asking the people,
we interviewed all sorts of career questions.

76
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:20.720
And I said that I didn't know what I wanted to be.
And she was like,

77
00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:22.340
you do though?
And it was like,
oh,

78
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.820
that's going to be one of these things like she,
whatever.
I'm just like,

79
00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:30.710
not going to get out of this what I want to get out of this.
And I was like,
well,

80
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:34.580
I love magazines,
but I just like,
don't know if that's the thing for me.
Um,

81
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.080
and she's like,
okay,
so tell me about this.

82
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:39.620
And we started talking about the magazines that I had right when I was growing

83
00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:41.840
up.
And I was like,
wow,
you know,
like all the teen magazines.

84
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:45.410
But also Disney Adventures and consumer reports for kids.
And she was like,

85
00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:49.370
that's not normal.
Not Normal.
If you read those magazines,

86
00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:53.650
that mean means you really like magazines,
you should do this.
Um,

87
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.930
and so I did,
um,

88
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:57.890
and I worked in magazines for five years before we started other kind.

89
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.070
And then I think it became clear to me that that world wasn't what I wanted it

90
00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:01.700
to be anymore.

91
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.570
But the idea of creating content and engaging people with storytelling invoice,

92
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.330
um,
and uh,

93
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.520
tying it all together with these products that we sell is what was meaningful to

94
00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:15.480
me.
Um,
you know,
I think I was also unwilling to commit to,

95
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.840
to my many interests.
And when you asked this question for the bucket,

96
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.220
I had this like moment of clarity where I remembered for really long time saying

97
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.470
when people would ask me what I wanted to be when it was like really young,

98
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:28.920
I would be like,
well,
I'm going to be an ice skater and a singer and a dancer.

99
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.800
And mostly because it was like,
well,
I want to be a pop star,

100
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:33.540
but I really like ice skating lessons too.

101
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.950
And I distinctly remember like my parents never once being like,

102
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.230
it's going to be hard to do all three,
like pick a lane.

103
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.910
And I look back and I'm like,

104
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:45.060
that definitely I remembered their reaction to that and being like,
well,

105
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.040
if they didn't say I couldn't,
I can definitely do this.

106
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.750
Like it's realistic because I kind of,
you know,

107
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:51.300
you expect someone to shoot you down when you say that.

108
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:54.570
And I actually think that that sort of like style of parenting and just being

109
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:58.840
like,
sure you can totally do that is kind of what led me to this place now where

110
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.190
we're know always coming up with this big ideas and being like,

111
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.340
why not let's do it.
Let's try this and let's start a business.

112
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:09.320
All of which seemed kind of unrealistic when you know,
when they're just an idea.

113
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.130
Um,
and so I,
I,
I will credit my parents with sort of being like,
sure,
yeah,

114
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.520
you can do that because what's the point of saying like you can't,

115
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.110
<v 2>yeah,
I'm so happy.
You mentioned wanting to be an ice dance.</v>

116
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.920
One of the most frequent answer is given for that question.

117
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:26.800
And this book was something that had to do with performance,

118
00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:29.770
whether it was a dancer or a singer or an actress.

119
00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:33.340
And I found it so interesting because not only did most people not end up doing

120
00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:34.150
those things,

121
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.680
but I found that people who run their own businesses of any type you have to

122
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:41.710
perform that is a huge part of what your daily job will be,

123
00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:43.240
is being the face of your business.

124
00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:46.900
And so I thought it was fascinating that all of these careers found a way back

125
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:50.220
into that aspect of performance.
Um,
but you,

126
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.440
you all brought up something that makes me think about the idea of mentorship

127
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:56.950
and visibility and visibility was a huge inspiration for this book.

128
00:06:56.951 --> 00:07:01.900
And I thought a lot about how women not having role models or very visible

129
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:05.830
examples of people in their field or in fields they maybe don't even know about

130
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:06.400
yet.

131
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.030
How that can affect their desire to be in that field or even their knowledge of

132
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:10.864
it at all.

133
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.300
Did any of you have mentors in your current field that you looked up to,
um,

134
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.610
or anybody maybe in a different field that inspired you to maybe dream a little

135
00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:20.350
bigger or try your own project?

136
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.890
<v 3>Um,
we were really inspired by 20 by 200,</v>

137
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:27.400
which is a company started by Jen Beckman that has a similar model to ours with

138
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.210
prints.
And I remember,
uh,
she would,

139
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.720
one of the things that she did is she had,
she had a tumbler for 20 by 200,

140
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:37.210
but she also had a tumbler that was like Jen at 20 by 200.

141
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:39.790
And she would talk a lot about the goings on behind the business.

142
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:43.420
And I read it obsessively and I remember when they raised venture capital and I

143
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.090
remember and like how she talked about that and thinking like,

144
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.820
what does this mean for that business?
And really following that closely.

145
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:53.200
And I think that that certainly gave me a sense that like this can be done and

146
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.710
this is kind of how it's done and one person can do this and take this,

147
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.240
make an idea into a reality.

148
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.970
<v 0>Cool.
Um,
so I think that for me,</v>

149
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.820
what I did is I kind of started,

150
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.630
I started by like reading magazines and books and blogs and so on.

151
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:16.660
And then I'm,
I'm a little bit on the Shyer side,

152
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:21.520
normally a very much an introvert.
Um,
so I started doing is,
you know,
I would,

153
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.700
I started forming a little bit of a community within the blogging world

154
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:25.534
especially,

155
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.920
and I would just kind of reach out and go to like events and so on.

156
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.140
And people that I admired,
you know,
people who,
uh,

157
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.720
many of them actually are in the book.
Um,

158
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.820
I ended up just kind of getting to know them on,

159
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.420
on less of a mentorship level at first and more of a,

160
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.410
I'm really curious about you and curious about what you do.
Um,

161
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.870
and from there,
you know,
they became mentors to me and some even friends.

162
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.980
Yeah.
I love that you brought up,
because

163
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.840
<v 2>that was probably the only thread connecting all of these women and the book was</v>

164
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.620
the importance of community and how the lack of it sometimes even stymied the

165
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:08.970
creation of a business because there wasn't that sort of strong base and support

166
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.730
system to keep encouraging you through those tough times.

167
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:16.020
And I'd love to talk a little bit about the way community affects each of your,

168
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.030
your business lives.
Because for me,

169
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:22.320
I know if I didn't have other women that talk to who ran businesses of any kind,

170
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.010
I don't know if I would've gotten done when I've gotten done so far because I

171
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:29.310
think those were the people who reminded me that everyone's going to face

172
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:31.560
hurdles.
Everyone's going to have tough times.

173
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:34.050
You're going to have moments where your business gets set back a little bit.

174
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:35.640
But you'll be able to push forward.

175
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.940
Who were those people for you and how did you find and build the community you

176
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:39.774
have?

177
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.740
<v 3>I think it took us a little while to find those people for sure.</v>

178
00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:46.670
And I think in the beginning we definitely felt like we didn't know that many

179
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:50.630
other women who were running their own businesses and building up a group of

180
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.790
designers.
It'd be,
we're working with,
definitely helped with that.

181
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.600
And I think the ones that we are,
the more that we have this,

182
00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:59.230
like the closest relationship with in this way are,
um,

183
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.720
Lizzy and Katheryn Fortunato the sisters behind the line.
Um,

184
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.210
Lizzy Fortunato and we'll have these like four hour long dinners that where

185
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:10.340
everybody is like sort of shouting over each other and we talk about everything

186
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:14.740
from hiring and firing to like managing resources to,
um,

187
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.970
design and aesthetic things like who makes your shoes?

188
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.720
<v 0>Karen,
what about you?
Well,
first I'm inviting myself.
I appreciate it.</v>

189
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:28.520
Thank you.
Um,
so it,
it kind of does,
you know,

190
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.750
um,
jumps off from my last answer,
which is where,
you know,

191
00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:35.540
I really did just start creating this,
um,

192
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.770
an honest community around me.
And,

193
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.450
and what you said just now was really important and just,
you know,

194
00:10:41.451 --> 00:10:45.440
people who were actually talking about the struggles of running a business.

195
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.640
I needed to have that truth because what I noticed with businesses that there's

196
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:55.960
a lot of gloss and glitter over it,
you know,
um,

197
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.790
my boyfriend somewhere hanging out over there somewhere.
Um,
oh,

198
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.140
he likes to call it.
Um,
Lisa can,
you know,

199
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:05.030
you really like to read a lot of design porn,

200
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.290
like a lot of business board and you know,
and I'm just like,
ugh.
You know,

201
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:13.040
I'm eating like those entrepreneur magazine articles and ink.com articles and

202
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:13.431
they're like,

203
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:17.280
this company made $500 million in the first two months of business and your
lung,

204
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:21.020
it's only the stats people want to share.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And they're like,

205
00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:23.960
but you forgot to mention the part where they were like crying in the closet,

206
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.650
you know?
But,
um,
yeah.
So it was really,
really,

207
00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:31.520
really important to me to be surrounded by those women who were very,

208
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:35.660
very honest about the struggles or even the good things about what it took to,

209
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.150
to run,
um,
and grow a business.

210
00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:41.390
And what I found was I approached those women even kind of thinking that they

211
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:43.910
were going to be like,
oh yeah,
you know,
this happened for me overnight.

212
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:46.460
And then they were like,
girl,
no,
sit down,
let's talk.

213
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.680
<v 3>And I mean we have been in the same position a lot where we have tried to be</v>

214
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:55.000
really honest and it's always surprising to me how surprised people are.

215
00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.070
And you know,
you don't brag about it publicly how shitty times are and we don't.

216
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.620
And it's just not good for your business,
right.
To be like,
oh,

217
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.780
it's actually awful right now we're about to fall through.

218
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:08.710
But I find that like in the moments where it's good and it's safe to sort of

219
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:11.650
like speak in retrospect to the times that had been really hard,

220
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:14.540
it's really therapeutic to talk about it yourself too and just be like,
right.

221
00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:18.100
Because this is going to happen again and like acknowledging that it changes and

222
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.750
it gets better.
It makes such a difference.

223
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.320
And for us a turning point was when we sold the business and you know,

224
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.260
you have a sense of security and I feel like that's when we really let loose to

225
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:28.690
everybody who came was like congratulations and we were like,

226
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.130
you want to hear what it was like before?

227
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.880
Like we were pretty sure that we were going to have to close the doors at many

228
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:36.560
points over the last five years.
Um,

229
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.270
I think it's really important to be honest about those things when you can be,

230
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.140
yeah,
more of that please.
Yeah,
and I think we've also,

231
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.500
there is the fact that we've been around for six years and have followed this

232
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:51.100
sort of business cycles and seeing the highs and lows and seen the company that

233
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:53.620
everybody's like so excited about,
you know,

234
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.450
raving about and can't wait to pour their money into then crash and burn a year

235
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.940
later or whatever.
Seeing enough of those things happen.
You,

236
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.530
you become a little bit like desensitized to those stories.
Usually.

237
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:07.720
If it seems too good to be true.
It is.
Yeah.

238
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.840
<v 2>Now that's been my general experience as well.</v>

239
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.770
I think too often people do make articles,
books,

240
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.390
anything TV segments about businesses feel like a highlight reel and it is this

241
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.380
moment of this much venture capital money,
you know this huge staff,
the success,

242
00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:23.760
boom,
everyone has a fancy house.

243
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:27.630
I'm like five nannies and everything's great and that's generally not the way

244
00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:28.560
things work out.

245
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:31.740
But people are intimidated and scared to talk about these things publicly.

246
00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:34.530
And that's one of the reasons I wanted to make this book was to create a safe

247
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:36.270
space to have these conversations.

248
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:39.120
And so one of the things I asked everybody in the book as you all know,

249
00:13:39.121 --> 00:13:41.610
is to share a moment when something didn't work out,

250
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.410
whether that was a mistake or a thing,

251
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.010
a time you had to like take a step back or slow down and what you learned from

252
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:47.250
that.

253
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.750
Because I think that mistakes and failures are all just very much opportunities

254
00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:55.470
that are disguise and chances to learn things and they are more painful than

255
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:58.650
when you learn things from great opportunities.
But they're important to,

256
00:13:58.651 --> 00:13:59.550
to pay attention to.

257
00:13:59.551 --> 00:14:03.660
So I'd love to know from each of you an example of a time when something did not

258
00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:06.330
go well,
but what you were able to pull out of that moment.

259
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.950
<v 3>I mean,
the one that comes to mind most immediately,
um,</v>

260
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.270
is a time when we pursued an expansion of the business that didn't feel like

261
00:14:16.461 --> 00:14:18.230
what Eric,
her I wanted to do,

262
00:14:18.231 --> 00:14:21.620
but it felt like the only way to grow the business aggressively and the only way

263
00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:23.600
to convince investors to give us money.

264
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.410
And we even said to each other at the time we turned each other,
we'd be like,

265
00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:30.740
you also think it sounds miserable to build this thing,
right?
And be like,

266
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.310
totally like hire people to run the part of business.
We won't have to touch it.

267
00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:36.560
Right?
Yeah.
Like we totally got checked more.
Like,

268
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:38.750
you also think this sounds miserable.
Totally.
Okay,

269
00:14:38.751 --> 00:14:40.970
let's go in this room and tell these people we're going to do it and it's gonna

270
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.770
make us like $1 billion.
And we got enough money to start expanding the business.

271
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.370
And that way it was like a marketplace model and it didn't work out and it

272
00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:52.460
almost killed the business and we really like,
you know we had,

273
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.730
you know these sort of like 11th hour things come through and save us from

274
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:56.600
having to close the doors.

275
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:59.090
But we really thought it was going to be the thing that was going to end of a

276
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:03.080
kind.
And I looked back and I was like let's never do anything again.

277
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:05.270
It's not the thing that we're really passionate or excited about.

278
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:08.630
Let's not do it just because it's the thing that seems like the trajectory we're

279
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:11.780
supposed to be on because we're a startup and because we should be able to

280
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:14.450
demonstrate hockey stick growth and how we're going to scale and no one will

281
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.980
give us money if we don't want this hockey stick growth.
So it's like you,

282
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.140
you start growing slowly and then you get investment and then it shoots right up

283
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:22.580
to the sky.
Yeah.

284
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.880
Because that's when all your graphs are supposed to look like cause that's all

285
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:29.720
your protection.
That is
certainly,

286
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:31.100
it wasn't hard to be that hockey,

287
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.100
but that's like what all the venture capitalists want to see.

288
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.480
When you put up projections,

289
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:39.620
they'll put $2 million in and then it'll look like that.
Yeah,
that's realistic.

290
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.380
Very realistic.
And we did it and you know,

291
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:44.360
we pursued this thing that didn't sound fun to us.

292
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.840
It just sounded like the thing that was what we should be doing in order to grow

293
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:49.400
a lot.
And it ultimately,

294
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.620
it was just as much of a nightmare as we thought and we weren't good at it.

295
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:54.710
And I think like Eric and I are no ourselves also well enough to know that.

296
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:57.860
Like if we're not excited about it,
if we're not invested in it,
it's,

297
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.370
we're not going to do a good job at it.
So Karen,
what about you?

298
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.820
<v 0>Uh,
so you guys are describing exactly where I am right now,</v>

299
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:07.080
which is so creepy,

300
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.590
<v 3>can stop you from doing that.
Don't build a market.</v>

301
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.570
<v 0>Um,
so we should have is actually my second business.</v>

302
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.910
My first business,
um,
was in the textile design space.
And,

303
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.953
um,

304
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.860
I really just went out there and this is the type of person that I am anyway,

305
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.230
like if you give me a piece of furniture from Ikea and you put the,
you know,
the,

306
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.960
the sort of instructions next to it,

307
00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:40.440
I'm going to chuck the introductions and be like,
ah,
like,
you know,

308
00:16:40.441 --> 00:16:43.230
and that were like an upside down table or something.
Um,

309
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.230
because I just love sort of figuring it out.

310
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.750
And that's what I did with my first business.
I figured it out.
Um,

311
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.910
but I had no idea how to ask for help.

312
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:58.500
I didn't know who to turn to to ask for help.
Um,
and I,

313
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.400
I basically was like,
okay,
I see this business,

314
00:17:02.401 --> 00:17:05.670
which is like 10 times bigger than me doing exactly these things.

315
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.420
So I'm going to model that.
I mean,

316
00:17:07.421 --> 00:17:11.490
while they're here and I'm here and I tried to model exactly what they were

317
00:17:11.491 --> 00:17:15.090
doing,
you know,
they had staff and money and everything,

318
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:19.590
like all the stuff that I didn't have.
Um,
and I basically tried to,

319
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.150
to build a business like that,

320
00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:26.100
like all by my onesie and completely floundered.
Um,

321
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.070
and so I actually had to take some time off.

322
00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:33.150
I took time off and I pause and I went back for a full time job.

323
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.270
Um,
and I learned and I ate,
what did they call it as a cro pie.
Yeah.

324
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.280
My a South American inflections are coming out.
Um,
yeah.
And,

325
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.880
and so that for me was a really,
really,
really humbling moment.

326
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.380
And so I'm,

327
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.270
I'm back now building my second business and um,
you know,

328
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:59.640
it's falling in line of the startups.

329
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:02.880
So now I've got a little bit of that gloss on me and you know,

330
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.120
some venture capital or like kind of knocking and I'm like,

331
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.230
okay,
you know,
like how,

332
00:18:09.231 --> 00:18:13.470
how do I do this now better than I did the first time around.

333
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:18.530
And the difference between now and then is that I know that I'm emailing you,

334
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:23.490
girls are one thing,
we're going to have dinner.
Um,

335
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.570
and I have help.
I finally accepted that I need help.

336
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.150
I need tools in the book.

337
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.950
Part of when I was talking a little bit about being in that position of sort of

338
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:36.720
floundering with the company.
You know,

339
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:41.721
I described it as if someone had sort of like built a glass mountain and they

340
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.520
had told everyone else how to climate and like giving them,
you know,

341
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:48.090
all the fancy shoes and clips and everything and here I was like trying to like

342
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:52.860
build this stuff and climbed the mountain at the same time.
Um,
so yeah,

343
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.520
the,
the difference now is,
is having people around me and,

344
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.480
and reaching out for help when they need it.

345
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.390
It makes a big difference to have help.
And it also,

346
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.990
it makes it a difference to have people who can help remind you to listen to

347
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:04.470
your gut.

348
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.920
I think almost every problem that I discussed interviewing people for this book

349
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.550
really involved,
somebody's ignoring their gut for a second and saying,

350
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.470
but this is what I think I should be doing.

351
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:15.600
And I think modeling yourself and another business.

352
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.200
I did the same thing with my blog and rented a,

353
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.820
and we got a three year lease for a studio years ago because I thought,
well,

354
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:27.930
every other blog has a fancy studio with like adorable girls lined up at pink

355
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:28.230
desk.

356
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.010
So I should have the exact same thing and signed myself up for like a ridiculous

357
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:35.490
amount of money to spend.
And that after three months my employees were like,
oh,

358
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:37.590
I don't want to work here anymore.
We all can.
We just work from home.

359
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:40.890
Like that was much easier.
It's cold outside.
I don't want to walk here and,

360
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.370
but I had signed myself up for three years of rent and that was an embarrassing

361
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:47.820
mistake to make 10 years into running a business where I thought shit.

362
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:51.840
And I know better than to make decisions based on what I think it's something

363
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:52.351
should be.

364
00:19:52.351 --> 00:19:55.830
But that's something that I think plagues women in particular a lot as the sort

365
00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:57.480
of comparison game.

366
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.110
How do you guys pull yourselves out of that when you feel those moments of like,

367
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.840
Ooh,
but this company does this?
So I should do that.

368
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.981
<v 3>I mean,</v>

369
00:20:05.981 --> 00:20:09.520
I think one thing that's helped me is seeing so many companies where I felt
like,

370
00:20:09.521 --> 00:20:10.210
oh my God,

371
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.860
if only like we had that level of success and seeing their dumb falter in some

372
00:20:14.861 --> 00:20:18.940
way or in some cases even fail.
And I just think it's years and years of that.

373
00:20:18.941 --> 00:20:20.950
I mean,
I still don't always know when,

374
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.050
I still don't always know to pull myself out of that,

375
00:20:23.051 --> 00:20:28.051
but I do think we're like almost seven years into this and there's just been so

376
00:20:28.331 --> 00:20:32.080
many,
every single company that I've ever sat in idolize and been like,

377
00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:35.770
why aren't we more like them?
I've now seen the cracks at one point or another.

378
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.870
<v 0>I think yeah,
that helps.
Yeah.
To read very quickly is like,</v>

379
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.220
no,
you know,
um,
I,

380
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.230
I think that it's just of built into this sense of success and failure,

381
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.610
you know,
that we have,
and this as humanity.
It's,
it's,

382
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:56.950
it's sort of part of,

383
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.130
it's kind of like looking in a mirror,
you know what I mean?

384
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:03.880
Except you're the person who determines what that mirror is every day.
Like,

385
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:06.690
what is it that I want to model?
What does it do?
I,
you know,

386
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.300
do I want to achieve and so on.
Um,
and so when you find your tribe,

387
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:14.830
I think it's very natural to kind of go,
hey,
you know,
she's just like me,

388
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.310
but yet she's got all this going on,
you know,
like,
what am I doing wrong?
Um,

389
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.350
so it's just become really important for me to just gut check,
you know,

390
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.940
like you said,
and remember,
well,
even if they're,
they're here now,

391
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.410
you know,
maybe they were in my position a few years back or,
or whatever it is.

392
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.990
Or even just call up my friends.
You know,
like I said in the book,
um,

393
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.810
one of my friends is like,
no,
Karen,

394
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:41.080
it takes 10 years to become an overnight success.
I'm like,
all right,

395
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:45.110
just seven to go.
Well,
let's talk about success.
Um,

396
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.830
this has been probably the most interesting topic I've discussed on the book

397
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:50.290
tour because I find it tends to be a very emotional one.

398
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:54.130
One that's tied into our ideas of who's come before us,
who comes after us,

399
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:58.300
our families.
Um,
what does success mean to each of you right now?

400
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.380
And is that something that has changed as you and your business have evolved?

401
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:03.483
Karen,
let's start with you.

402
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.970
So success to me right now is so much simpler than the girl who was like,

403
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:12.310
you know,
thought I was going to be a lawyer in like,
you know,

404
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.740
dolce Gabbana like head to toe with,
you know,

405
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.650
the penthouse overlooking the river.
Um,

406
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.840
I just left my full time job.

407
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.330
I was able to grow my business enough that I could take that leap.

408
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.330
Um,
there's some fantastic things coming down the line.

409
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.020
I got up every morning at about five o'clock in the morning.

410
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:39.190
I worked on my business before I went to work.
I worked a nine to five.

411
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:42.940
I came home and worked on it a little bit later.
Um,
you know,

412
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.030
until the evening is as much as I could stay up.
Um,

413
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.570
and after two years of doing that,

414
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:54.571
I was able to finally leave and take the leap and from me right now,

415
00:22:55.570 --> 00:23:00.490
success is,
I mean I get up and it's like I'm seeing things,
you know,
in a,

416
00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:01.720
in a whole different light,

417
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:06.130
like I'm actually able to watch the leaves change color and I'm able to go to

418
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:09.010
the gym at 12 o'clock in the afternoon if I feel like it.

419
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.830
And it's so simple,

420
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:16.390
but it's the sweetest feeling that I've ever felt in my life.
Um,

421
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:20.470
so success is,
you know,
having the time to travel,

422
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.460
to kind of be in charge of my day a little bit,
to be overwhelmed if that's,

423
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:28.180
if that's what it is,
you know?
Um,
yeah,
yeah,

424
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.810
to have dinner with friends.
It's really,
really simple right now and very sweet.

425
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.500
What about you Claire?
Naca?
Um,
I think,

426
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.330
you know what you're saying about sort of having,

427
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.950
having the autonomy over your day.
I think being able to,

428
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.040
you know,
control as much as anybody can control anything,
um,
their day to day

429
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.860
<v 3>and make decisions about how they want to live their lives.
Um,
that,</v>

430
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.420
that is success for me,
that that is so important to me.

431
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:56.170
And it wasn't something I realized until we sold our business.
And now,
you know,

432
00:23:56.171 --> 00:23:58.550
we have a parent company like tech know,

433
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.630
like boss and overload and the wonderful thing about it and the reason it's

434
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:06.260
worked as they've given us an incredible amount of independence and autonomy and

435
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.380
that all of a sudden brought into very sharp focus.

436
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.810
The one most important thing to me about my job,

437
00:24:11.811 --> 00:24:14.870
which is that like feeling like I'm deciding,
you know,

438
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:18.440
what my day looks like and you know what time it unified could go to the gym in

439
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:22.010
the morning so I can get in a little later and all.
Um,
and you know,

440
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.950
what projects I'm prioritizing and stuff like that.
It really,

441
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.480
I hadn't been aware of it,
of how important it was to me before then.
Um,
but now,

442
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.321
now it really is.

443
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:33.500
I think the other thing too that has changed for me in the last,

444
00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:35.300
and I don't think this is what defines success,

445
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.100
but making money has become a much bigger priority for me.
I think I've,

446
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.870
you know what,
I've just gotten older and you know,

447
00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:43.760
I like got married and you start to think about your future.

448
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:48.260
But I think I've also just noticed,
um,
over the last six,
seven years,

449
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.460
how much personal wealth gives you the privilege of,

450
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.920
um,
expanding personal wealth for others and putting in,
you know,

451
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:00.250
just expanding through your networks,
both,
um,

452
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.460
access and growth and privilege.

453
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:08.180
And I've really noticed the ways that it tends to be sequestered to male

454
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:12.260
networks.
And I think the more women amass personal wealth,

455
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.560
the more they amass power and influence.
And I think that's really important.

456
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:18.860
And I also just think,
you know,
obviously like money makes your life easier.

457
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.780
And I just never used to think about it that way.

458
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:24.200
And I think it tends not to be like a very,
um,
uh,

459
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.980
very phone and quality to think about like,
I really want to get rich,
but I,

460
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.160
I'm like really getting comfortable with that idea and just saying that like,

461
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:33.180
yeah,
I want to make a lot of money.
It's important to them.

462
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:38.230
There is very clearly a double standard even among women about profitability,

463
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:41.480
about wealth and about how we discussed those things because I have watched

464
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.020
bloggers and my community and other makers sort of go from being,
you know,

465
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.580
tiny indie companies to being huge brands and watching people like cheer them
on.

466
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:51.980
And then there's that tipping point where you can tell,

467
00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:55.430
or at least it seems like from the outside they are now financially successful

468
00:25:55.431 --> 00:25:58.370
and then people start to turn and be like,
Oh,
who does she think she has?

469
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.260
Like she has a nanny now and she has authentic anymore.
Like,
no,

470
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.990
she's authentic to who she like this is the path.
Exactly.
Career.
Yeah.

471
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.250
And I don't think it's to say that for financial and yeah.

472
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.110
And I don't think the financial success is the only measure of success,

473
00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:15.260
but I think it is one that often comes with a lot of guilt and a lot of
pressure,

474
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.490
um,
from within the community as a female makers and entrepreneurs.

475
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:21.980
And it's one that I think should be discussed a little bit more.
Well,

476
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:25.520
even just the thing you said about having a nanny,
I mean,
I want kids,

477
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:28.910
but I'm really intimidated by the idea because I really love working.
Right?

478
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:32.900
But if I work and I make enough money where I can have support in somebody's

479
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:34.610
helping me raise my kids,
I can do both.

480
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.640
And like that to me is one of the reasons to make sure that I'm amassing

481
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:41.810
personal well so that I can do that.
And then I can do both.
And yeah,
I just,
I,

482
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:44.070
you know,
I think that,
you know,
I led

483
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.030
<v 2>with that idea of like,</v>

484
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.700
I think it's important so that women can spread it to other networks because

485
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.740
there just aren't enough women investors and things like that.

486
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:50.670
And I do think that is important.

487
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:54.090
But I also don't think women should apologize for wanting to have money just for

488
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:58.920
the sake of making life easier.
No,
not at all.
I'd love to know from each of you,

489
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:02.760
what is one thing you wish you had known before becoming an entrepreneur?

490
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:08.070
I'll start with mine,
which is I wish,
I wish and I constantly think about this.

491
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:09.030
I wish I had known.

492
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.030
I wish someone had told me you will never stop making mistakes.

493
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.080
There's not a single person 40 50 years into their company that is not still

494
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:18.290
currently making mistakes.
Um,

495
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.870
but I think the silver lining of the fact that these mistakes and hurdles never

496
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:26.280
stopped is that they become infinitely more fulfilling to solve and learn from.

497
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.760
And I think when you're in your 20s and starting a business,
it's just,
Oh my God,

498
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:32.340
can I get through it?
Can I make payroll this week?
Like,

499
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.140
can we pay our taxes on time?

500
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.410
And now that I'm in my thirties and inching closer to 40,

501
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:41.940
I feel like I am looking for these lessons in a way that just makes the hurdles

502
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:44.970
a little bit less terrifying.
But I think I thought if I worked hard enough,

503
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:47.040
they would disappear altogether.

504
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.900
It's kind of like that thing where I think high schoolers,

505
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:51.790
like I'm guessing a lot of you in this room probably wear those high schoolers

506
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.780
where you felt like if you just like took all the AP classes and just got

507
00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:58.510
straight A's,
like life would be a piece of cake.
That doesn't happen stock,

508
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.170
it does not happen.
It just gets harder and more complicated.

509
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:03.360
So I wish someone had like drilled that in a little earlier.

510
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.440
It's just a good reminder because I think I still think that you're just going

511
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:07.770
to get so good one day,

512
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:11.140
then I'll just like be able to make all the right decisions and those will be a

513
00:28:11.141 --> 00:28:14.040
breeze.
I think the problem with that,
and I had the same realization,

514
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.290
is that that it seems everything else stays the same.

515
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.740
Like as if we're all working in operating in a vacuum and that like markets

516
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:20.380
don't change.

517
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.330
Internet doesn't change people's assumptions and desires for products and things

518
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:27.210
change and there's just so much that's out of our control and that you don't

519
00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:29.760
change.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.
Oh No,
I'm in,
for those of us,

520
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:32.610
I mean I was 23 when I started my business and I'm 35 now.

521
00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:35.010
And those are drastically different places in life.

522
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.550
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I wish that,
um,</v>

523
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.690
I kind of always was fixated on the end of the road.

524
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.890
I wish that someone had told me that I was going to spend a lot of time on the

525
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:46.724
damn road.

526
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.370
<v 2>It's like,
it's a long,
long,
long journey.</v>

527
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.730
<v 0>You know,
I think the end changes,
um,</v>

528
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:59.780
for each of us as we grow and,
and different things sort of take,
you know,

529
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.820
are become more important.
Um,
so yeah,
you know,
similar to what you're saying,

530
00:29:04.821 --> 00:29:08.210
like kind of as you go along and you,
you know,
you make mistakes.
It's like,

531
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.690
I feel like I'm,
you know,
on the road that I get to the sign post and it's like,

532
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.900
you got it.
You did it.
Yeah.
You know,
and then it's like,
all right,

533
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.950
you get to the next one.
And it's a whole other set of lessons to learn,
you know,

534
00:29:18.951 --> 00:29:20.150
especially for me,

535
00:29:20.151 --> 00:29:25.100
I think the greatest thing is in scaling a business and figuring out how in the

536
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:27.590
world to to do that.
Um,

537
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.890
every time I make it to one milestone and kind of like,
all right,

538
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:32.150
I've got everything in my pocket now,

539
00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:36.080
I'm just going to go and apply that to the next one.
No,
that's not gonna work.

540
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.243
Yeah.

541
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.130
<v 2>I think for me,
I'm hearing you're only</v>

542
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.500
<v 3>going to spend 20% of your time doing things that are your core competencies.
Um,</v>

543
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.310
I mean I came from working in magazines and I was an editor and I spent the bulk

544
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:55.270
of my time working in magazines as an editor editing.
Um,

545
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.830
and you know,
I worked on other little things here and there,
but the core,

546
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.560
my core job was editing and that's what I did every single day.

547
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:07.020
And even when I was producing all of the content for the site or editing all of

548
00:30:07.021 --> 00:30:08.080
the content for all the kind,

549
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.310
I still was only spending really 20% of my time on that because there's just so

550
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:13.630
many other things you have to do.

551
00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:16.930
And we've had to get good at managing lawyers and accountants,
um,

552
00:30:16.931 --> 00:30:20.560
and thinking about Facebook marketing strategies and creating newsletter

553
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:24.190
templates and all of these things.
Managing Web developers that,
you know,

554
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.380
of course we're part of the business,
but that we are still very,

555
00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:27.214
very involved in.

556
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.600
<v 2>Well,
before we opened it up to everybody for questions,</v>

557
00:30:30.601 --> 00:30:33.480
I want to ask you a quick lightening round of short,

558
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.460
not to be over-thought questions.

559
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.560
So let's start with one that you've all already answered before.

560
00:30:37.561 --> 00:30:38.400
That should be easy.

561
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:42.670
What is a tool object or a ritual that you could not live without in your work

562
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:46.130
day?
Let's start with you.
I run every morning and they can't,

563
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:50.760
I'm crazy without it.
Um,
I'm,
I'm a serious to do list maker.

564
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.830
Karen.
I drink like 12 cups of tea.
Um,

565
00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.240
if you weren't doing the job that you're doing right now,

566
00:31:00.241 --> 00:31:04.260
what other job would you like to try?
Karen,
let's try it with you.
Uh,

567
00:31:04.261 --> 00:31:09.261
so I have a degree in psychology and seeing how even that has has been affected

568
00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:11.190
by technology.

569
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:16.490
I would go back and figure out how I could make a mental wellness available to

570
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.500
more people for less money.
That's great.

571
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.510
I would do something around content for teenagers.
I don't know.

572
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:27.840
I think I would probably like create things like with my hands,

573
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:32.190
he'd be a maker and you could sell your own thing.
You're very good at it.

574
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:37.200
Um,
what's one piece of advice you would give to a young woman who was hoping to

575
00:31:37.201 --> 00:31:40.890
start her business right now?
Something really basic and simple.
Tell people

576
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:43.410
that you want to start a business.

577
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.460
<v 3>Yeah.
Dealt,
like,
tell people,
be like,
make yourself accountable to someone.</v>

578
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.400
Say I want to do this thing.
And I think the more people you tell,
they're like,

579
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.670
oh,
I have a friend who actually builds websites.
You should talk to him or

580
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.370
<v 2>whatever.
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh,
I'm speaking to,</v>

581
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.280
I'm going to be selfish and speak to my own inner 15 year old right now.

582
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.850
And that is,
um,
get help.

583
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.800
Reach out to anyone.
Doesn't matter how big you think they are or who,

584
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.300
you know,
might not respond to your email.

585
00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:13.160
Just try no that you're not going to be able to do everything and that's okay.

586
00:32:13.161 --> 00:32:16.100
And you will find people who can help you to do the things you don't know how to

587
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:18.880
do.
This is a two parter.
Um,

588
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.510
what is the hardest part of your job and what is also your favorite part of your

589
00:32:23.511 --> 00:32:27.590
job?
Sometimes they're the same thing.
Yeah,

590
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.321
<v 3>I mean,</v>

591
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:31.680
I would say managing other people is probably the hardest part of my job and

592
00:32:31.681 --> 00:32:33.900
it's definitely sometimes the most rewarding.
I mean,

593
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:38.070
ultimately the most rewarding thing for me is always like working on coming up

594
00:32:38.071 --> 00:32:42.640
with an idea and seeing thing become like a physical product product.
Um,

595
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.540
it's really rewarding.
Yeah.

596
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:49.520
Those are mine to managing people I think is something that we are still really

597
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:52.390
struggling with in our team has always been really small.
Um,

598
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.960
and it means that there's not a lot of time for us to be both,
you know,

599
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.080
producing things on a day to day basis and managing.
Um,

600
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.700
and I really want to get better at it.

601
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.910
I think it's also hard because Eric and I worked really closely.

602
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:06.560
We know each other,

603
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:11.150
so I'll have such high expectations of ourselves and others and just have very

604
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:14.300
similar instincts.
Like sometimes,
you know,
it's like a melting and I,

605
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.840
and so it's very easy to get frustrated when people don't have those same

606
00:33:17.841 --> 00:33:19.820
instincts,
which is totally unreasonable.

607
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.390
And that's what I don't know on a day to day basis.
And like,

608
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.640
you wouldn't screw up like that,
but like,
maybe that's just because like you,

609
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.880
like,
you know,
I just,
I don't know what the expectations of other people,

610
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.560
I don't know how upset together,
like,
yeah,
we're working on it.

611
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.820
<v 2>Um,
for me it's being the final answer.
I feel like jeopardy all the time.</v>

612
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.420
It's like,
you know,
the final answer is,
and I'm like,
shit,
that's me.
Okay,

613
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.200
I'll be right with you.
Um,
and then,
um,

614
00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.570
I love getting to know my customers.
Um,
yeah,
it's,

615
00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.730
it's really fun to talk to other women.
Yeah.
All right.
Last but not least,

616
00:33:54.731 --> 00:33:57.970
what is your favorite thing to come home to after a very long day at work?

617
00:33:59.240 --> 00:33:59.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

618
00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.030
<v 3>Like a Sitcom and my husband's Kale Salad.</v>

619
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:09.920
Maybe a glass of wine.
My bunny.
I have a bunny.
Yeah,

620
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.270
it's hard to get really upset when there's a bunny.

621
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.770
<v 2>I'm going to win at Christmas and birthdays and everything for this one.</v>

622
00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:22.560
But that guy right there.
Um,

623
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.780
before I open it up to questions for anybody who has them in the audience,

624
00:34:25.781 --> 00:34:27.540
I just want to thank postmen books for being here.

625
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.030
They have the book in the back if anybody wants a copy and thank you to Google

626
00:34:31.031 --> 00:34:33.610
for having us.
So,
and thank you to these amazing women.

627
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:34.603
<v 3>So</v>

628
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.430
anybody have any questions for the panel or for any of us?

629
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.480
<v 1>Oh yeah,
go for it.
Hi.</v>

630
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.040
<v 0>Thanks again for coming.
Um,</v>

631
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.000
I had a question about learning and just growing as you go.

632
00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.630
So one of the common threads in a lot of the questions was how you learned from

633
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.130
your own experiences or previous ones and from experiences of other people that

634
00:34:57.131 --> 00:34:57.964
you talked to.

635
00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.440
But what's your opinion on how to just grow either as a leader or get better at

636
00:35:02.441 --> 00:35:03.340
managing people?

637
00:35:03.341 --> 00:35:07.040
Would you suggest I meet your business school or books or you know,

638
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.020
what are your thoughts on that?

639
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.730
<v 1>I think</v>

640
00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.800
<v 2>everybody has different paths to that.</v>

641
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:16.000
I'm somebody who never went to business school,
probably should have,
but I read,

642
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.170
I read a lot of business books,

643
00:35:17.171 --> 00:35:19.900
but I think that being a leader is a muscle memory.

644
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.260
I think it's something that you have to do a lot of different times to kind of

645
00:35:23.261 --> 00:35:26.170
feel comfortable thinking of yourself that way.
Um,

646
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.390
I started my business as like a sole proprietor and now have to oversee people

647
00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:32.680
and that's still very uncomfortable for me.
But the more times I do it,

648
00:35:32.681 --> 00:35:33.730
the more it becomes a muscle.

649
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:36.370
I feel more comfortable flexing and getting used to.

650
00:35:36.371 --> 00:35:40.530
And I think one of the things I find most helpful is to maybe make a list of the

651
00:35:40.531 --> 00:35:42.570
ways in which you are already leading in your life.

652
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:45.720
Whether that's like leading a team meeting or you're in charge of like a

653
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:47.250
volunteer project outside of work,

654
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.310
reminding yourself of the moments where you're already a leader and doing a good

655
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.170
job of it helps you feel more confident.

656
00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.500
I think learning to ask for help but also,
or ask for feedback and help,

657
00:35:57.501 --> 00:36:02.250
but knowing,
vetting that yourself and knowing what fits for you.
Um,

658
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.770
I remember the first time we had to let an employee go,

659
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:10.130
we called two of our advisers ask them for help who had more experience and who

660
00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:13.460
had done this in the past.
And one of them was like,
well,
just what,

661
00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:18.440
just tell her that,
um,
you are getting rid of the role.

662
00:36:18.441 --> 00:36:19.730
And we're like,
well,
we're not basically,
yeah,

663
00:36:19.731 --> 00:36:22.480
just tell her that and then you'll hire someone later and it'll be fine and

664
00:36:22.481 --> 00:36:25.280
you'll just be a lot easier.
And that just didn't ring true to us.

665
00:36:25.281 --> 00:36:27.470
And then we called another advisor and she was like,

666
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.590
helped us write a whole script that was like,
I'm sure you have.

667
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.150
I'm sure you know that this is coming.

668
00:36:32.151 --> 00:36:35.090
We've had these conversations and just gave us sort of the strength to be like,

669
00:36:35.091 --> 00:36:38.930
you can do this.
Um,
and that felt right to us.
Um,
so I think,
yeah,

670
00:36:38.931 --> 00:36:40.280
just vetting advice too.

671
00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:43.453
<v 4>MMM.</v>

672
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.640
<v 0>So I don't manage that many people know.
But,
um,</v>

673
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:51.710
in my previous job I managed about like 25 people or so.
Um,

674
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:56.660
and the,
the one thing that I learned,
especially within the corporate setting,

675
00:36:56.661 --> 00:36:57.900
I learned that,
um,

676
00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.940
a lot of people were sort of pretending to be managers based on what they

677
00:37:01.941 --> 00:37:05.150
thought the role called for or what it meant to be a manager.

678
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.330
And I ended up having the best,
um,

679
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.100
the best conversations and the best relationships with the people that I managed

680
00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:17.690
when I Kinda just sat down and let them speak to me,
you know,

681
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:22.540
um,
and just kind of got to the heart of what was going on with them and allowed

682
00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:25.280
them to be human and have room to grow.

683
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.120
<v 4>Um,
yeah.
Thanks.</v>

684
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.630
<v 5>Oh,
hi.
So over here,
uh,</v>

685
00:37:32.631 --> 00:37:37.040
so two of the topics that you all talked about where growth of your business but

686
00:37:37.041 --> 00:37:39.920
also autonomy and control over your day.

687
00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:43.610
And I'm wondering how to bring those two things together.

688
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.700
Can you do both at once?
Is it a one after the other situation?

689
00:37:46.701 --> 00:37:48.140
I'm just wondering on your thoughts on that.

690
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.010
<v 3>I do think,
um,</v>

691
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:55.710
I remember when we were in I guess like year two or something of the business

692
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:57.480
and I just started dating my husband and I was like,

693
00:37:57.481 --> 00:38:00.570
I'm really sorry I can't be in a relationship cause I stay up until like one 30

694
00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:03.930
in the morning every night with my computer on my lap and being like,

695
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.850
there's no way it can do this.
And now it's,

696
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:09.540
that to me is like a marker because I look back on that and I'm like,

697
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.690
I go to bed at like 11 every night at the latest.

698
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:16.080
And I do think it gets easier over time.
And I think with most businesses,

699
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:19.350
you probably have to put a lot more in in the first like two to three years than

700
00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:23.490
you do in the years that follow.
Um,
but I also think maybe,

701
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.520
I don't know if I gave a false impression of what autonomy means,

702
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:28.830
I still don't really feel like I have control over my day.

703
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:31.770
Like I still work all of the time and I work harder than I think most of my

704
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:32.604
friends do.

705
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.130
But it's knowing that it's my choice to do that and like when to do it.
Exactly.

706
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.260
<v 2>That's really important.
Can say yes or no to the meeting.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,</v>

707
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.260
exactly.
That's an important,

708
00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:45.040
I think autonomy is something that sometimes gets conflated with like the idea

709
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:47.560
of like everyone is okay with the choices you made.

710
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.390
And I think that that's one of the hardest things,
and I might flick,

711
00:38:50.391 --> 00:38:52.240
I talk about this with my wife Julia all the time,

712
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:56.200
is that like we were both freelancers with essentially kind of can control

713
00:38:56.201 --> 00:38:57.430
everything we do in our life,

714
00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:00.090
but no one talks to you about what it feels like to control other people's were

715
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.100
not controlled,
but to absorb other people's reactions to those choices.

716
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.860
Because most of us have the autonomy to say like,
nope,

717
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.320
not going to be on that call.
We're not going to be at that meeting,

718
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.660
which is fine and the world will go on and your business will go on.

719
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.310
But someone might be mad and that's,

720
00:39:12.311 --> 00:39:15.790
I feel like women in particular have a difficult time with people being

721
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:20.290
disappointed or upset and that's where I think a support system or like just

722
00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.750
friends to go get coffee with comes in handy where you can be like,

723
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:24.700
I felt so bad that I didn't go to that,

724
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.910
but I also felt really good that I stayed home and didn't go to that thing.

725
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:29.680
So it's like managing those feelings.

726
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.090
I think that like having a partnership has made that so much easier.

727
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:36.340
If just somebody else being like,
no,
it's okay that you didn't,

728
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.010
or like we're not going to do this and it's going to be fine.
And like,

729
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.030
and that has been such a huge one of the many values of having a partner.
Yeah.

730
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.970
I think part of it is also managing your own expectations of yourself and

731
00:39:48.971 --> 00:39:52.840
whatever sort of guilt trips that you might put yourself through as well.
So,

732
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:54.820
you know,
there have been times when I'm like,
okay,

733
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:59.821
I really need to make this yoga yoga class at six o'clock for my own health,

734
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.960
like my own benefit.
Um,
so I'll get up really early tomorrow,
you know?

735
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.140
So you just,
it's,
it's about balancing your expectations of yourself too.
Yeah.

736
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.173
Thanks.

737
00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:14.830
<v 0>Hi.
So I have two questions,
one of which is for context purposes,
if you could,
oh.</v>

738
00:40:14.831 --> 00:40:17.740
Um,
let us know the size of your business currently.

739
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:22.780
And the second one is for someone who is sort of starting out with an idea for a

740
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:23.710
business.
Uh,

741
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.520
how would you recommend going about figuring out who to partner with or who to

742
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:29.770
bring on your team and how to find those people?

743
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.910
<v 2>I'll start with my side.
Um,
I have three full time employees,</v>

744
00:40:34.911 --> 00:40:36.550
me being one of them.
Um,

745
00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:40.460
and I have about a team of 10 to 12 writers who kind of kind of come in and out

746
00:40:40.461 --> 00:40:44.480
of my blog life.
And then this book was made by three people basically,

747
00:40:44.481 --> 00:40:46.280
so small.

748
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.990
We're six full time and then also have very interns.
Freelancers.
Yeah.

749
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.320
<v 0>Um,</v>

750
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.320
I am a team of one and I actually have some contract people who work with me.

751
00:40:59.231 --> 00:41:02.290
I have a Clo and a marketing person and yeah.

752
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:06.640
But I just kind of fill people in around me like that for now.
Um,

753
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.760
what was the second part of your question?
Will you remind me?

754
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.440
The second question is how do you determine at the beginning stages who to

755
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:17.590
partner with if you should bring someone on to partner with you and how you find

756
00:41:17.591 --> 00:41:18.424
those people?

757
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:23.120
<v 2>Hmm.
My gut response to that would be to be very,</v>

758
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.220
very cautious of taking on a partner.

759
00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:29.750
If you don't absolutely need one because companies can grow really quickly and

760
00:41:29.751 --> 00:41:32.990
then someone else has a lot of control over your company.
So like I,

761
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.030
I had cut my company like really,

762
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:38.510
really small and I got legal advice to like incorporate it and make it safer and

763
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.590
I'm the one hand that's good,

764
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:43.010
but it also means like a thing that feels like my baby is shared by other people

765
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:47.660
and that's a weird feeling.
So I would be really cautious and get a super,

766
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:52.310
super well vetted contract because I think sometimes the best friends can go

767
00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:54.110
into business and then you know,

768
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.680
expectations or ideas of where a brand should go change.

769
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.550
So I always feel like write the contract with the worst possible outcome in mind

770
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:03.020
so that if that does happen,

771
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:07.160
there is a rubric to follow because that happens a lot.
Yeah.
I mean I think,

772
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:09.380
I can't imagine doing this without a partner,

773
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:13.250
but I also think we have a really specific relationship and really specific

774
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:15.140
partnership.
And um,

775
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.470
we have had known each other for years beforehand.

776
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.920
We had worked in like very small capacities with each other.
Um,

777
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.650
but in a way that I think shed light on what are our w are working tactics were

778
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:32.560
um,
and helped us sort of vet,
could we do this together?
Um,
but then,

779
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:36.560
you know,
logistically when we started the company,
our equity,

780
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.460
neither of our equity vested,
it all,
I was on a four year vesting schedule.
We,

781
00:42:40.461 --> 00:42:42.470
you know,
we're in this place with a one year cliff,

782
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.190
meaning that neither of us had equity until after the first year.

783
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:49.880
So that it does give you that chance to say,
is this actually gonna work for us?

784
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.793
<v 4>Okay.</v>

785
00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:56.430
<v 0>Um,
I found the people that,
that I work with through community.</v>

786
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:00.240
Um,
and I think if you,
if you don't have someone in mind or you kind of,
you know,

787
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.220
having already started building that relationship,

788
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:06.750
that's also really good to be able to turn to other people who can vet them for

789
00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:07.584
you in a sense.

790
00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:10.250
<v 4>Awesome.</v>

791
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:14.060
<v 2>Thanks for coming.
Um,
my question is,
a lot of times I hear women say like,
Oh,</v>

792
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:16.700
I had no idea at that company was going to get this big or we are going to be

793
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:20.660
this successful.
Um,
do you feel it's important to go in with this like success,

794
00:43:20.661 --> 00:43:25.040
vision or kind of just see how much your hard work can,
can yield?

795
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.690
<v 4>Okay.</v>

796
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:30.860
<v 3>I mean for us I think what has worked best is thinking like a year ahead.</v>

797
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.610
We still struggle to think three years ahead and I think that's just the nature

798
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:39.380
of who we are as entrepreneurs and like what sort of work we find satisfying.

799
00:43:39.381 --> 00:43:42.560
And I think there are other people who it's really important to them to look and

800
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:46.940
say like in five years this is going to be a $3 million campaign in 10 years

801
00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:50.380
it's going to be a $2 billion company.
I think you just have to know who you are,

802
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.320
know what drives you.

803
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:54.920
It's really hard for me to think that long term and be motivated by that.

804
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.250
But I can be motivated by what I think is going to happen like nine months from

805
00:43:58.251 --> 00:43:59.084
now.

806
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.033
<v 4>Um</v>

807
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:06.150
<v 0>Hm.
I,
I,
for me where I am right now,</v>

808
00:44:06.151 --> 00:44:10.320
I think so much of,
of what I'm trying to figure out about,
you know,

809
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:14.820
my success and like how I should sort of even define that for my company,
um,

810
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.230
is there's a lot sort of coming at me based on the market,
you know,

811
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.060
a dollar shave club just sold for a billion and,
and so,
um,

812
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.340
right now and the law in all honesty,

813
00:44:26.341 --> 00:44:29.400
I'm kind of a little bit and in the place of the question that,
you know,

814
00:44:29.401 --> 00:44:32.280
you've asked and trying to figure out what's right for me,

815
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.460
<v 2>you know,
what can I do as a business and,
um,
you know,</v>

816
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.450
do I set a cap or not?
So,
you know,
I'm just going to be honest,

817
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:42.870
the question it always goes around.
Yeah.

818
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.040
<v 3>I also think that people who say that they didn't realize it was gonna be that</v>

819
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:48.210
big.
I also just,

820
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.870
I don't think you accidentally build like a billion dollar business.
Um,

821
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.020
so I don't know.

822
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.790
I think some people are just humble and they want to self present in a certain

823
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:57.990
way and maybe you know,

824
00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:00.960
the market changed and they didn't realize that the opening was as big as it
was.

825
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.960
But I just don't know if you can accidentally build something massive.

826
00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.690
<v 2>Yeah.
I think also consider or give yourself room and your company,</v>

827
00:45:07.691 --> 00:45:12.190
whether it's a tiny company or a company with huge aspirations is give your self

828
00:45:12.191 --> 00:45:14.020
room for those definitions to change.

829
00:45:14.021 --> 00:45:17.710
Like I started my business with absolutely nothing in mind other than hoping I

830
00:45:17.711 --> 00:45:19.840
could use that business to get a job at a magazine.

831
00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.330
And I'd thought of it as like a step up to something different.

832
00:45:22.331 --> 00:45:26.170
And then the market changed and magazines became unstable and web became more

833
00:45:26.171 --> 00:45:30.070
stable.
And so my definition of what the business should be to change.

834
00:45:30.071 --> 00:45:32.860
And then there are some years where I'm like,
my goal is to just stay afloat.

835
00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.970
And there's some years where I have like really big plans and but like things

836
00:45:36.971 --> 00:45:39.670
wax and wane and that's,
that's okay.
I think a lot of times businesses,

837
00:45:39.671 --> 00:45:42.490
it's like linear thing and it's just,
it's totally not,

838
00:45:42.491 --> 00:45:45.190
it's like full of all sorts of curves and turns.

839
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.760
<v 5>Awesome.
Um,</v>

840
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:51.010
I'm interested in the concept of the entrepreneurial spirit because I think

841
00:45:51.011 --> 00:45:55.190
there's like an idea or myth,
but there's like the born entrepreneur,
um,

842
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.960
and obviously here within Google we work in kind of a hybrid environment where

843
00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.110
we are within a huge multinational corporation,

844
00:46:02.111 --> 00:46:06.340
but we also have a lot of freedom to kind of pursue things that interest us in

845
00:46:06.341 --> 00:46:08.700
business opportunities that are available.
Um,

846
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:12.550
and so I'm interested in what kind of change for you where you said,
okay,

847
00:46:12.551 --> 00:46:16.600
I'm not going to work within the structure of an existing business and sort of

848
00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:19.360
change it from within.
I'm going to go out of my own.

849
00:46:19.361 --> 00:46:22.240
So like you kind of touched on the fact that it was maybe market forces that

850
00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:24.190
made you decide it wasn't a step up.

851
00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:27.310
It was actually that was where you wanted to,
to pursue your career.

852
00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.800
So I'd be interested in hearing your experiences.

853
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.880
<v 2>My,
my experience has been that I think at my core as a human being,</v>

854
00:46:33.881 --> 00:46:36.970
I've always done,
I couldn't work for somebody else and be a very good,

855
00:46:36.971 --> 00:46:39.190
I'm not a very good team player.
I'm just not.

856
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.210
I'm good at like creating teams and living like you go do stuff not good at

857
00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:46.840
participating and that and I'm an only child you could play in that.

858
00:46:46.841 --> 00:46:47.260
I don't know.

859
00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.560
I just feel like I've always known I couldn't do that and my first two jobs out

860
00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:52.900
of college were like very much team jobs and it,

861
00:46:52.901 --> 00:46:55.990
for me it was a moment of like the biggest thing I'm taking away from this is

862
00:46:55.991 --> 00:46:59.410
that I would never want to work for somebody else unless it was somebody that I

863
00:46:59.411 --> 00:47:02.560
just absolutely thought like was the best of whatever they did.

864
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:05.620
And I would never question anything they did,
which I don't think exists.

865
00:47:05.621 --> 00:47:08.230
So I'm just happier doing things on my own.

866
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.760
<v 3>I also,
I think for me,
I the,</v>

867
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.170
it's this idea of like realizing your own vision and like an idea that you've

868
00:47:17.171 --> 00:47:17.711
come up with.

869
00:47:17.711 --> 00:47:22.300
It's really just rewarding to me in a way that other projects aren't.

870
00:47:22.301 --> 00:47:24.520
There's like something really special.
I think about that of like,

871
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.430
I can just think of so many conversations that like Eric and I had had in the

872
00:47:27.431 --> 00:47:30.450
back of a cab or something that like six later real thing and the eight.

873
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.350
There's something so magical about that to me that that I think is harder to do

874
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.110
in a,
when you're working for someone else.
Um,

875
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.190
I would never say that I was a born entrepreneur and I don't think I had any

876
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:46.510
aspirations,
um,
until we came up with the idea for,
of a kind to start a business.

877
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.710
But I will say that I really loved that sense of ownership.
Um,

878
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.710
the Claire articulated and,
and always have.

879
00:47:53.711 --> 00:47:58.090
And that's something that's always been fulfilling for me.
Um,
and beyond that,

880
00:47:58.091 --> 00:48:02.650
I also trust that I am smart enough to learn things.
I don't know.

881
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:06.610
Um,
and I think that that's been the other half that has,
has been,

882
00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:09.580
been able to push me forward and get me excited about things.
Um,
it'd be like,

883
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:11.560
totally,
I'm just going to dive into this and figure it out.

884
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.280
<v 0>Um,
for me it's,</v>

885
00:48:14.281 --> 00:48:19.080
it's more about problem solving and I think that's where you actually find this

886
00:48:19.081 --> 00:48:23.790
entrepreneurial spirit,
you know,
that you speak of.
Um,
it's to kind of say,
hey,

887
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:27.090
this is missing or this is being done really badly.
Or you know,

888
00:48:27.091 --> 00:48:32.070
this is not really capitalizing on a great mark.
Like whatever those things are,

889
00:48:32.071 --> 00:48:35.340
it's about seeing what's missing and this sort of desire to,

890
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:40.540
to figure out how to fill that void,
the white space.
Um,
that for me is,

891
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:45.120
is,
is where that spirit is and I think you can do it anywhere.
When I was at my,

892
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:48.390
my fulltime job recently,
I kind of always said,
you know,

893
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:53.570
if I had the opportunity to think I'm more the way that I really am,

894
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:58.590
I'm in this position,
I would probably have stayed longer.

895
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.753
<v 4>Thank you.
Thanks.</v>

896
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.830
<v 0>Hi,
I'm,
my question is,
um,</v>

897
00:49:03.831 --> 00:49:07.070
kind of along those same lines I'm kind of interested in day one,

898
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.460
was your idea so clear and so right in your mind

899
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.310
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

900
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.870
<v 0>okay,
yes.
This is what I have to do,
like let's do it.</v>

901
00:49:18.871 --> 00:49:22.320
Or were there a couple of ideas and you picked the one that was most interesting

902
00:49:22.321 --> 00:49:24.500
or like how did you go from idea to start?

903
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:26.600
<v 4>Sorry.</v>

904
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.720
<v 3>Yeah,
we,
so Clara is applying for a job for us.</v>

905
00:49:29.721 --> 00:49:32.790
Claire was applying for a job at 20 by 200.
Um,

906
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.230
and she emailed me her cover letter and we were going back and forth.

907
00:49:36.231 --> 00:49:37.930
I was sort of helping her edit her cover letter.

908
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.080
She was like obsessed with 20 by 200 at this point.
Um,
she was like,

909
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:45.200
I'll do anything there.
Um,
and in going back and forth and editing it,

910
00:49:45.201 --> 00:49:47.540
we were talking about was so interesting about the business model and what was

911
00:49:47.541 --> 00:49:49.850
so compelling about it and why it was needed in the world.

912
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:51.650
And I got off the train that night.

913
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.990
I'm going home and there was an email in my inbox,

914
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:56.480
it had read this instead of my cover letter.
And it was like,

915
00:49:56.481 --> 00:50:00.460
what if we did this for fashion?
This doesn't exist,
but it seems like,
you know,

916
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:04.130
that's what our friends are consuming.
That's what we get really excited about.

917
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:07.070
And we fleshed this out over the course of like 20,

918
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:11.700
80 miles or something that I feel like I just got Chelsea about it again,

919
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:15.650
but not everybody's like that,
but like we did,
we,
it was like,
it was that idea.

920
00:50:15.651 --> 00:50:19.340
It was like lightning,
but that idea I think,
you know,

921
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.130
is very much the thing that sits at the core of,
of a kind kindness,

922
00:50:22.131 --> 00:50:25.700
this idea of limited edition pieces with a story.
Um,

923
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.170
but the thing that has spun out that,
um,

924
00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.310
and I think the world we've been able to build around it was definitely not in

925
00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:32.530
those emails.
Um,

926
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.110
and I think a lot of that has just come from what's been interesting to us.

927
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:39.260
The feedback we've gotten,
random things we've tried that have stock things,

928
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.380
we've tried that it failed and the business has been shaped by all of that.

929
00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:48.360
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
for me,
it honestly started with,
um,
uh,</v>

930
00:50:48.361 --> 00:50:52.980
need,
uh,
you know,
I,
I,
the story is,
so I,
I went,

931
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.620
I called my girlfriends up,
you know,
to get like a pedicure and so on.
And I,

932
00:50:56.621 --> 00:50:59.790
I grabbed my light pink razor and I scraped across my legs,

933
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:02.400
like I usually do and went out and I,
you know,

934
00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:05.640
put my feet up on the basin and I will my jeans up.

935
00:51:05.641 --> 00:51:10.290
And like the entire inside of my leg was covered with razor burn and you know,

936
00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:13.710
we just started like batting back and forth about how freaking annoying shaving

937
00:51:13.711 --> 00:51:14.700
was and so on.

938
00:51:14.701 --> 00:51:18.120
And so I think there were like a few things that just kind of were percolating.

939
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.080
Um,
I had seen,
you know,
Harry's and dollar Shave Club at that point,

940
00:51:22.081 --> 00:51:26.520
and I was like,
these mother still not doing anything for women.
I'm so annoyed.

941
00:51:26.521 --> 00:51:30.120
I don't want to use your Dr. Carver butter or whatever the hell it's called.
Um,

942
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:34.800
and then it was,
it was just sort of,
it,
it just stuck with me.

943
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:36.060
I knew it was really strong.

944
00:51:36.061 --> 00:51:40.620
It was different from anything that I had ever done before.
Um,
you know,

945
00:51:40.621 --> 00:51:45.300
I'd had a lot of experience at that point and I knew that it was scalable.

946
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.390
Um,
and that was one thing that I wanted to be able to do.

947
00:51:48.391 --> 00:51:52.080
I wanted to challenge myself to see what it would be like to build a scalable

948
00:51:52.081 --> 00:51:55.340
business and to challenge the,
you know,
the,

949
00:51:55.341 --> 00:51:59.250
the Gillettes and so on of the world.
And,
um,
yeah.

950
00:51:59.251 --> 00:52:04.020
Then I grabbed my balls in my hand,
but yeah,
I,
it took a lot of gumption.

951
00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:07.800
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah.
Congrats.
Thank.
Thank you.

952
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:10.320
Thank you everybody for coming and being a part of this.

953
00:52:10.321 --> 00:52:13.320
Thanks to Google for having us and thanks to postman for being here to sell

954
00:52:13.321 --> 00:52:16.020
books and I hope you have a great rest of your day.
Thanks guys.

955
00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:16.670
<v 1>Thank you.</v>
