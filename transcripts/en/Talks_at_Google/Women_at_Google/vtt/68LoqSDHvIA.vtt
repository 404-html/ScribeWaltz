WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.490
Thank you all for coming today.
Um,
we're here with,
um,
uh,

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.520
Morra Aarons merely the author of hiding in the bathroom an introvert's roadmap

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.620
to getting out there when you'd rather stay home.

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.320
If I may give a a little bit of a synopsis.

5
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:26.321
It's largely about being an introvert when you face things that are difficult

6
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:27.980
for an introvert.
Um,

7
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.110
it's been easier for many of us to stay in a,
in a,

8
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:34.640
in a corner on our own,
but,

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690
but more his work has forced her to go out and so she writes about how to deal

10
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:43.070
with this tension as opposed to give up and stay away from it all together.

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.260
Please.
A round of applause for Maura.

12
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.550
<v 0>Thanks David.
Nice to see you.</v>

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.800
<v 2>Well,</v>

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.580
how would you describe being an introvert and the challenge you face as a result

15
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:56.414
of it?

16
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.600
<v 0>I,
um,
I call myself an ambitious introvert.</v>

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.930
I don't know if that phrase resonates with any of you.

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.130
I also have a lot of anxieties.
Um,
I have,

19
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.310
I have social anxiety,
I have flying anxiety,
you know,

20
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:14.330
sometimes for me sort of leaving the house and going out in the world.

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.180
Can Be challenging,
especially in these times.

22
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.270
And yet I,
I run a business and I,

23
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.570
I chose to write this book,

24
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:28.571
which has taken me out of my comfort zone and every way possible because I

25
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:29.894
wanted,

26
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.580
it's the manual that I wished I had had when I was trying to build my career.

27
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.960
Um,
I didn't know that I was an introvert.
I didn't know that I had anxiety.

28
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.420
I just knew that I cried a lot in the bathroom and quit lots of jobs.

29
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.440
I felt like walking into the office some days was an assault on my senses.

30
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.120
And you know,
as I got promoted in my career,

31
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.650
I worked in political consulting and digital marketing.
And so,
you know,

32
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.210
as the sort of demands increased to run teams,

33
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.520
run meetings,
collaborate,

34
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.360
negotiate cell network,

35
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.440
all the stuff that you really have to do,
um,

36
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.350
I literally just,
I felt like it was an assault.

37
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.240
I didn't know how to do it and I didn't have a manual.

38
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.230
And so instead I hit a lot in the bathroom.
I still hide in the bathroom a lot.

39
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.800
I don't know if you do too.
I haven't been to the bathroom here.
Um,

40
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.410
so I wanted to,
um,

41
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.850
really provide a really practical,
if you see the book,
it's super practical.

42
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:36.170
There's worksheets,
there's tear sheets,
and we take on business development,

43
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:41.090
networking,
how to survive a professional networking event.
That's a huge one.
Um,

44
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.150
social media,
right?
How do you get out there?

45
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.630
Everyone says you should get out there,
you should have a personal brand.

46
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.560
Certainly as you grow in your career,
if you take on a more public facing role,

47
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.360
and this is tough for some of us.

48
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.970
<v 2>Um,
most of the crowd that I see here is engineers,</v>

49
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.310
but as we,
every time we look for a job that that's,
that's an issue.

50
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.180
But also,
um,

51
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.480
people that were not software engineers don't appreciate how much collaboration

52
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.770
as part of the work we do,

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.100
we may be able to get by with relatively little if we only go to the things that

54
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:22.150
we are called to.
But if we have an idea,
we want to promote as,

55
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.880
as you're familiar,
you,
when you need to get someone's attention,

56
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:29.881
you need to push an idea that maybe somebody doesn't want to put his attention

57
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.980
on.
Um,
and so,
um,
some of some of these things are,
are,

58
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.860
are certainly more relevant to us in ways other than,
than,

59
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.620
than your personal experience directly.
One of the,
the,

60
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.840
the things you've described yourself as,
as,
as ambitious overachievers.

61
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.720
<v 0>Yes.
So you want to hear is an ambitious over achiever,
I'm sure.
Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.070
<v 2>Well,
it's easy to be an overachiever in ways that are solitary with our field.</v>

63
00:03:55.071 --> 00:03:57.680
Until you get into industry.
When you were an industry,

64
00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:02.030
you aren't just writing a program anymore and then letting the world see it.

65
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.350
You have to interact with everybody else who your software is.
Is,
is,
um,

66
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.850
affecting in any way.
Um,
and uh,

67
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.520
how do you reconcile having that,

68
00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:17.840
that urge to achieve and facing the fearsome,
um,

69
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.320
a dog ahead of you that you're,
you don't want to interact with?
Yeah,

70
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.810
<v 0>that's right.
And,
and I think for something like,
like,
right,</v>

71
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.610
I would imagine if you have,
if you've written something,

72
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.090
I have felt this way about my passion projects and this is where introverts can

73
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.670
really shine if we are creative people,

74
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:36.700
which I believe software engineering is very creative as well.

75
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We have the ability to have faith in our project and our work and to carry it to

76
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.360
a certain place.
So how do you translate that?

77
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.340
Not only in being able to stand up in front of a group and sell in that vision,

78
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.350
which is a,
which is an essential skill,

79
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.450
but be able to negotiate with other people to make your thing come to life.

80
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.590
And this can be hard for introverts sometimes because we've gotten feedback

81
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.170
right in our career,

82
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.710
even in school that we aren't heard,
right?

83
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.580
Because we may be talked over a lot.
I don't know how many of you have felt that.

84
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.320
Um,
and of course there are gender and race and age implications and all of that,

85
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.910
right?
Depending on where you're at in your career,

86
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:22.000
you might get talked over more or less.
Um,

87
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.390
and so I think one of the skills that I had to learn the hard way and that I

88
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:31.270
encourage companies now to teach is how to help,

89
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.160
how to help that ambitious introvert with an idea and negotiate it,

90
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.340
sell it,
right?
You're not born learning how to code.

91
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.940
You're not born learning to how to know excel or PowerPoint or keynote or any of

92
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:43.900
these things you're taught.

93
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.370
And so one of the things that I think we have to seek and given companies is how

94
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:52.120
to birth your idea socially in the office culture.

95
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.970
<v 2>Google,
many of us perhaps not a predominant direction,</v>

96
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.800
but many of us have not had a very social experience before coming here.

97
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.420
And so many of us are shorter on those social skills and it would benefit from

98
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:05.590
them.

99
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.650
But it sounds like this is general useful advice for companies to help their

100
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:10.490
employees thrive

101
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.680
<v 0>well.
And,
and you have a rich peer culture here,</v>

102
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:14.630
which I think can be really valuable.
You know,

103
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.180
I always say that it's great to adopt an extrovert.
You know,

104
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.810
if there is someone who you see has that skillset,
right?

105
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:23.780
Whether it's being able to have someone see their vision,

106
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.990
being able to negotiate and listen.
I mean,

107
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:30.590
one of the things that introverts are really good at and if you can think of

108
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.590
selling in your software project as a sort of negotiation,

109
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.980
is it may be tempting for us to sort of learn to go in and tell everyone about

110
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:40.010
our project.

111
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.330
But one of I think the natural skills of introverts is that we do absorb and we

112
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:47.300
tune in.
And so before you sell,

113
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.760
and I have this in the book and the chapter on selling and negotiate,

114
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.830
read the room,
right?
Tune in to the other conditions,
do your research.

115
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.800
We're very good at preparing and the layer of,

116
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:00.890
sometimes those of us with anxiety makes us prepare even more.

117
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.010
And so you can learn how to use your introvert like super powers to actually

118
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.180
take a step back and sell in a project.

119
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.010
<v 2>You described yourself as somewhat of a hermit.
Um,
uh,
an introvert.</v>

120
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.780
I'm socially anxious.
I know these aren't,
um,

121
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.940
synonyms.
They aren't distinct.

122
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.360
Could you talk about where they overlap and what the difference?

123
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.750
Introvert is one that I didn't even understand until a few years ago when I

124
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:27.584
learned from a friend.

125
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.540
<v 0>There's a lot of myths about what an introvert is.</v>

126
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:32.420
There's a lot of great books and literature out there and I think it's becoming

127
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:34.730
much more socialized and acceptable.

128
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.620
We understand that we are born probably more introverted,
more extroverted.

129
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.130
It's not something that we learn,
although most introverts,
right?

130
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:44.960
We learn how to fake it at some point.

131
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:48.320
Certainly if we're going to go out and sell or be public in any way.

132
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.590
I was on Boston public radio last week and Jim Brown,
he said to me,
well,

133
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:53.840
you don't seem like you suffer from introversion.
I mean,

134
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.900
you can make eye contact with me and you're laughing,
and I was like,

135
00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:01.040
what are you talking?
You know it.
It is not.
It is.

136
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.050
Introversion doesn't necessarily mean that you're quiet.

137
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.870
It doesn't mean even that you're shy.
Actually,
if you're shy,

138
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:08.990
it may mean that you have social anxiety or if you're just a little shy.

139
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.440
I'm an introvert is someone who needs a time and space and does great work

140
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.140
alone.
Who gets that creative energy alone and when you go into overwhelming

141
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:21.831
situations,

142
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.980
whether it's walking into a whole hotel lobby with lots of fluorescent lights

143
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.470
and noise or an open plan office.
Frankly,

144
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.620
I mean I'm obsessed with open plan offices and I have all chapter in the book

145
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.490
about how to survive an open plan office or pod situation.

146
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:39.491
If you feel like I do like the you're superman and the Kryptonite is draining

147
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:42.620
your energy,
you're probably an introvert,
right?

148
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.500
But it doesn't mean you're quiet or that you don't talk.

149
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.460
It just means that you recharge and you need more quiet environment to do your

150
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:53.210
best work and you like to be alone with yourself,
which I think is amazing.

151
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.750
Social is another layer that I talk about in the book and that I separate out

152
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.120
because many of us,

153
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.230
whether we're awkward as kids or you know,

154
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.380
no one will sit with us at lunch and we have whatever kind of trauma.

155
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.020
We have intense performance,
anxiety and fear of social situations.

156
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:17.970
Even picking up the phone to call a colleague or a client walking into a
meeting.

157
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.830
We assume people won't like us,
and again,
this is,

158
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.120
this is a real challenge as you grow in your career and you have to sell.

159
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.210
Being a hermit is that it's,
I use a tongue in cheek.

160
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:28.530
I actually trademarked the term.

161
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:32.340
I'm a hermit entrepreneur and this is my choice.

162
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.640
I left Corporate America about 10 years ago and decided that I was going to work

163
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:42.510
for myself.
I started a small business,
successful business,
small business.

164
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.350
I decided I didn't want to become a corporate executive.

165
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:49.290
I didn't want to have a big career in the typical sense,

166
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.790
I was willing to make less money and have less power systemically because it is

167
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:56.850
that important to me to work from home.
I mean that sounds ridiculous,

168
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.600
but it really is.
I love to work from home.
I like to be my myself.

169
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:04.560
I love my favorite day and this may not apply to you as a day without meetings.

170
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.540
And when we were talking about email,

171
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:09.300
email is also a big sensory overload for a lot of us,

172
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:11.940
but a day without meetings and time to think.

173
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:16.470
And so I created a business that allows me to build in days alone,

174
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.480
time to think and then I hit the road.

175
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.060
<v 2>How do you reconcile being a mother of three with having time alone at home?</v>

176
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.180
<v 0>It's tough.
It's hard,
you know,
but I actually,
I mean this is,
Oh God,</v>

177
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.930
this feels horrible to admit,
but I have,
I,

178
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.150
I build in my alone time during my workday because,

179
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.010
because when your kids don't care,
right?

180
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:40.850
Your kids don't care if you need a break.
So,
um,

181
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.000
what I try to do is I try to protect my time during the work week,

182
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:48.630
actually to get a lot of time to think.

183
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.830
And I justify it by actually saying it helps me run my business.

184
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:54.120
It's where I have my best ideas.

185
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:57.750
It's where I come up with solutions and figure out how to pay for things and

186
00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:59.410
hire new people.
But yes,

187
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.200
<v 2>one of the complications of working at home.
Yes.
All right.
Okay.</v>

188
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.100
<v 0>Oh,
not everyone's made to work from home.
It's a discipline.</v>

189
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.590
I don't know if you have a work from home policy here.

190
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:12.380
I think that some people really seek it and some people it drives them crazy.

191
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.440
<v 2>We were talking earlier about how um,</v>

192
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.510
social anxiety and introversion can be different for women than men broadly.

193
00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:22.490
Of course it's not going to be the same in every case.

194
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.570
Could you talk some about how it differs for women in ways that might not be

195
00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:28.640
obvious to us?
We're not.

196
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.120
<v 0>I mean I think one of the things that has been really remarkable to me,</v>

197
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.970
and I love seeing so many men here today is,
you know,
my publisher,

198
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:39.210
I wrote the but sort of geared towards women because that's my bias.

199
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:43.230
I run a business called women online and I create political and social marketing

200
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:44.640
campaigns that mobilize women.

201
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.090
But I think what's interesting is that men feel work life conflict,

202
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.050
right?
The tug between home,
the pressure certainly,

203
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.090
I mean this is one thing I talk a lot about in the book.

204
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:00.930
When you think of sales and negotiating,
and again it's,

205
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.190
it's a bit different maybe in an environment like this,

206
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:07.540
but you will come up against it.
I think to be that sort of Alpha male salesmen,

207
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.200
that's something that women don't really face.
We face a lot of other biases,

208
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.400
but I've heard from many introverted men at work who feel really frustrated.

209
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.160
One Guy said to me,
I gave a talk last week and Cambridge and he said,

210
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.380
how did the extroverts,
when everything,

211
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.800
he felt in his work experience that because he was more quiet,

212
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.840
he was not your typical sort of get out there.

213
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:32.440
Kind of glad handler that that he felt he didn't fit in at his office,

214
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:34.060
which I felt was really sad for him.

215
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.680
So I think for men there are barriers to feeling.

216
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.250
Certainly if you do like me,
you're a hermit.
You love to work from home.

217
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:43.810
You like alone time.

218
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:47.770
You don't maybe want to go out and take clients out for drinks or dinner or sal

219
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:50.590
and all those ways.
That's a barrier for women.

220
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.520
If we are more introverted data show,

221
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.390
we are less likely to get promoted.
We earn less money.

222
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:01.420
And of course women earn less money anyway.
And we fought to get,

223
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.130
we fight to get heard anyway.
So there's really a double edged,

224
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.140
a double barreled assault on women.
I think who again,

225
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.850
may not present in a typical leadership fashion.

226
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.210
You know,
you only have to look at our politics to see right now.

227
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:21.880
And I promised I wouldn't get political,
but I can't help it.

228
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.890
That too often the salesperson and chief wins in our culture.

229
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.980
Certainly when it comes to what we see as leadership,

230
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.110
I could not help feeling all during the election that Hillary Clinton is really

231
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:37.150
an introvert.
And if she could just,
you know,

232
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.200
sell her policies and small groups and connect in an authentic way,

233
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.970
things would be so much different.

234
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.630
And yet we got the sort of man in front of the room talking and selling.

235
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.800
And I think that that's powerful and that extends to every corporate environment

236
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.740
and every leadership environment.
We need to think about that.

237
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:54.910
And gender as a piece

238
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.810
<v 3>you,
um,
uh,
wrote that,
uh,
uh,</v>

239
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.420
<v 0>you would be more successful.
Uh,</v>

240
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.250
if you went to cocktail parties more or 37% more successful if I went to

241
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:09.700
cocktail parties.
Could you explain that?
Absolutely.
I mean,

242
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.930
I think it's amazing now,
um,

243
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.920
that we have so many online tools to network and I talk about that a lot in the

244
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:20.470
book.
Um,
in many,

245
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.800
many business environments,

246
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.920
we are obsessed with networking.
It is,

247
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.440
I call it enlightened bro.

248
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:33.730
There are guys like Gary Vaynerchuk and Tim Ferriss out there,
you know,

249
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:36.400
and they're full of tips to solve your like life.

250
00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:39.100
But if you watch any leadership video on youtube,

251
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.000
chances are there is going to be something about getting out there,

252
00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:47.020
about networking,
right?
Still the old chestnuts of never eating lunch alone,

253
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.850
again,
prevalent in our culture.

254
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.230
And if you're like me and you're sort of allergic to this and um,

255
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.780
you go to a professional conference and you know,
think,
oh gosh,

256
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.550
how am I going to survive the cocktail hour?

257
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.150
I just want to go back to my hotel room and hide or whatever meetup group or

258
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:04.940
whatever you're part of to sort of advance your career and you know,

259
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:08.660
it's important.
Again,
you can always feel like you're at odds.

260
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.840
So I probably would be more successful if I like networking more,

261
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:15.050
but I've also made my peace with it.
And that's why for me,

262
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.650
blogging and participating in online community has been a savior.

263
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.470
Because I can find connections online,

264
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:24.410
I can blog and connect with people who care about what I do.

265
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.000
And it doesn't matter if we're going for drinks at the local Hilton on a Tuesday

266
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.900
night.
You communicate.
I communicate on my terms from bed

267
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.660
<v 2>terms.
Um,
uh,
you,</v>

268
00:15:37.661 --> 00:15:42.040
you hinted at having a device for people for the most important thing that they

269
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.440
could do when,
when that parties,
could you,
uh,

270
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.380
explain that I was curious what it was?

271
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.360
<v 0>Yes.
Well,
the last chapter of the book,</v>

272
00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:51.880
and actually if you go on hiding in the bathroom.com,

273
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.140
I have a 16 point guide to getting out there when you have to.

274
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.300
And,
um,
you know,

275
00:15:58.301 --> 00:16:02.740
one of the things that I talk about is,
and again,

276
00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:07.540
this is simple advice,
but it's really,
really powerful,
is um,

277
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.920
that feeling of anticipatory anxiety when you have to walk into a networking

278
00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:16.630
event or you have to go to a presentation or meet a new team or whatever you

279
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:17.464
feel.

280
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.950
I think it's really important to sort of physically get a sense of yourself.

281
00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:25.090
You know,
actors do this before they get on stage.
They check in with themselves,

282
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.850
they check in with their motivation.
Why am I here?

283
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.390
I feel that all the time I want to be at home.
Why am I here?

284
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.580
I don't want to go on this business trip.
I'm scared.

285
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.010
I don't want to walk in this room.
Why am I here?

286
00:16:36.011 --> 00:16:39.700
Sometimes it's as simple as I have to pay the bills.
That's legit.
Sometimes it's,

287
00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:43.490
I care about my work.
I want to share what I've written.
I want to bring this.

288
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:48.100
So checking into the meaning and checking into your body.
For me also,

289
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:51.910
and I don't know,
this is different for everyone.
I have clothes that I wear.

290
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:53.680
I have literally I'll put my lipstick on,

291
00:16:53.681 --> 00:16:57.400
I will put on my armor and become the person who would play me in the movie

292
00:16:57.401 --> 00:17:00.370
because I can then get that person out there.

293
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.230
And then I follow what my friend Doctor Ellen Hendriksen calls the ten second

294
00:17:05.231 --> 00:17:08.410
rule.
And this,
she's a social psychologist.
You can do anything for 10 seconds.

295
00:17:08.411 --> 00:17:10.870
You can even put your feet over fire for 10 seconds.

296
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.970
So just give yourself that push,

297
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.990
walk into the room or walk up to someone and say hi.
Right.

298
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.040
And then muscle memory takes over.
The other tip that I have,

299
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.380
and this is one that I actually talked to a lot of people about,
and you'll,

300
00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:26.560
you'll hear this a lot,
I call it channeling your inner Oprah,

301
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:30.010
but some people play journalist,
you know,
especially if you're an introvert,

302
00:17:30.011 --> 00:17:34.960
you don't like the spotlight.
Ask people questions.
Again,
tune in to other people.

303
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:40.240
You don't have to be the best conversationalist to be remembered as a great

304
00:17:40.241 --> 00:17:43.840
conversation list because if you're present with someone and you can ask them

305
00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:48.820
questions,
they'll think that you are.
Um,
anyway,
I have lots of other good,

306
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.770
but one thing I also wanted to say is,
um,

307
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.570
to give yourself a reward,

308
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.140
this is something that you can think of if you're at a professional conference.

309
00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.610
Did you know that there are,

310
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:03.570
I think it's 137 professional conferences in the u s a day.

311
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.190
It is,
it is the most booming industry.
And so,
so again,

312
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:10.650
the way that we're taught now to network more than ever,

313
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.650
we're also expected to go to conferences more than ever,
which is weird.
I mean,

314
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:18.480
certainly in tech conferences or like out of control,
right?
So,
um,
for me,

315
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:21.700
I'll say,
I'll do my research about what I,
who I want to meet.

316
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.960
I'll say I got to meet three people and then I let myself leave.

317
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.640
I sometimes they'll go hide in the bathroom,

318
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:31.590
I'll go hide in my hotel room and it's okay.
Set a quota,
set a quota or the goal.

319
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.370
<v 2>Um,
there's a term that you used,
um,
uh,</v>

320
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.650
I didn't get to the part of the book where you explained this term,

321
00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:41.230
but I'm curious what it means.
You,
you mentioned achievement,

322
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.420
porn achievement during,
it's very much

323
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.130
<v 0>a while back,
I wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review about the rise of</v>

324
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:52.080
entrepreneurship porn.
Um,
and uh,
I'm glad you think it's funny.

325
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:53.760
I,

326
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.590
I've been a sort of player on the edges of the Boston tea tech and VC scene and

327
00:18:58.591 --> 00:19:02.970
those sort of women in tech scene for many years now and then in La.

328
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.480
And it's very sexy to be an entrepreneur.

329
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.920
It's very sexy to work at a startup.
It's probably still sexy to work at Google,

330
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.930
you know,
so you guys,
you guys have that.
But as you know from your friends,

331
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:18.810
whenever you work at a startup or if you found a startup,
it's very sexy.

332
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:21.090
People want to talk to you.
You're an entrepreneur,
right?

333
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.470
And so the media and networking culture and leadership talks in this whole

334
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:29.760
conference industry has really glamorized entrepreneurship,

335
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:32.190
especially tech entrepreneurship,
right?

336
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.230
It's made it seem like that's what we should aspire to and scaling and never

337
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:42.231
sleeping and tirelessly fighting until we get funded or we grow.

338
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.290
And I call it porn because you know it when you see it right.

339
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:50.250
You read all these profiles of these young entrepreneurs who would stop at

340
00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:53.460
nothing and made a gazillion dollars.
Very few of us can do that.

341
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.450
Even if we're smart enough for me personally and the people that I interview in

342
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:00.930
my book and my podcast,
they didn't want to do that.
You know,

343
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.390
some of us wanted to have really great lifestyle businesses.

344
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:07.440
We needed to step back from the entrepreneurship porn and the achievement porn

345
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:08.161
too.
You know,
it's,

346
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:12.630
it's this sense that if you don't give 110% every single day,

347
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.590
you're letting the side down.
So it's the false image.
It's the false image.

348
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:18.810
It's the glossy image.

349
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.000
Even failure is sort of glamorized because we read a lot of stories about this

350
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.780
sort of epic failures certainly in Silicon Valley,
in New York,

351
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:30.960
but they never really feel like failures to me.
I,
I don't know about you,

352
00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:34.950
but they for to feel like just a blip in the road till the next big one and life

353
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:35.784
isn't like that.

354
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.650
<v 2>You mentioned the,
the Tech Industries,
um,
passion for,</v>

355
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.760
for an entrepreneur who drives a,
an idea and starts a company.

356
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.860
But I feel like we're changing more broadly than that.

357
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.180
More and more people are expected to make their,

358
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.460
their job as you've done,
even without building a company,
just as,

359
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.830
as a sole contributor who is,

360
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:03.670
who is also the CEO of the company might say.
Um,

361
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.890
and that requires a lot of,
of social networking of sorts as well.
A lot of,

362
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.730
a lot of,
um,
often cold calling to,

363
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.100
to start a business that doesn't exist because no one else has done it for you.

364
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.880
Um,
given that many of us,

365
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.430
well maybe not in this room this year,
but,
but,

366
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:24.550
but many of the people watching this may find themselves in that state while

367
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:28.870
looking for their next job,
finding that they need to make it themselves.
If they,

368
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.450
um,
if they prepare themselves to walk into that room,
then they're there.

369
00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:37.570
They're talking to the people and their nerve fills them.

370
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.390
Do you have any advice for how to,
how to pull yourself back together when,

371
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.820
when you,
you feel you're not up to the task?

372
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.560
<v 0>I mean,
I think it's,
again,</v>

373
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:50.050
it's about tapping into the meaning and the motivation.

374
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.720
I like to use the metaphor of being a crafts person.
You know,

375
00:21:52.721 --> 00:21:56.440
if you had built a house that this really lovely family we're going to move into

376
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:59.100
and you had lovingly taken care of every element,

377
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.640
you would be proud to talk about it.

378
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.940
I'm a big fan of of freelancing and consulting,

379
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.180
although there are many things that are bad about it and you probably will make

380
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.150
less money.
You will have maybe less of a systemic impact.

381
00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:11.380
You got to think about healthcare,

382
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.000
but for many of those people are you in five years from now,

383
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.300
if you leave this place and go walk into a room to make it on your own,

384
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.950
even if it is as a consultant,
don't feel like you need to start a fresh.

385
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.640
Often your best clients will be your old company,

386
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:30.100
the people that you used to work for.
You know,

387
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:35.430
an introvert's gift is actually managing a network in a way that is good for us

388
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.420
and so I find that we're actually good at sustaining those long relationships.

389
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:43.210
I have a role called the 10 touches,
which is in the book.

390
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:47.290
I learned it from my husband,
my favorite adopted extrovert.
But for me,

391
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.190
I can handle 10 business development touches a week.

392
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.760
It might be just dropping you an email,
which I know now you won't see,

393
00:22:54.761 --> 00:22:58.300
but that's okay.
It could be calling someone,

394
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:00.880
it could be recommending someone on Linkedin,
right?

395
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.500
Making some sort of outward gesture.
I can do all of this from my Home Office,

396
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.670
but if I have the discipline of reaching out to 10 people a week and you can do

397
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:13.810
this actually while you're working for someone else to help build that network

398
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:18.790
and help build that future network of potential employers,
funders,
colleagues,

399
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:21.580
staff,
whatever,
you know,
you can,

400
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.490
I'm a big believer in breaking things down into bite sized chunks,

401
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:27.220
bearable chunks.
So I do the 10 touches every week.

402
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.650
I keep my network going and so then I'm never so scared to walk into a room

403
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:34.540
because I know why I'm there.

404
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.280
I try to have a sense that I am not alone in this work,
if that makes sense.

405
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.570
<v 2>Thank you very much.
Um,
is this a good time for questions?
Yeah,</v>

406
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.620
<v 0>I think anyone has a question.</v>

407
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.130
<v 4>So,
uh,
I don't know whether,
you know,</v>

408
00:23:48.131 --> 00:23:52.900
the leadership of Google would consider themselves introverts like very page and

409
00:23:52.901 --> 00:23:57.190
Sundar.
Um,
but they don't strike me as the like,
you know,

410
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:01.720
usual sort of CEO,
right.
When you see them speaking publicly,

411
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.030
they're not as comfortable or polished.
Um,

412
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.980
I don't know that I have a particular question but like any thoughts about that

413
00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:10.210
and kind of,
you know,

414
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.430
tech leadership in general I guess and kind of where people fall on the

415
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.500
introvert extrovert sort of scale.

416
00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:18.960
<v 0>I think that's really interesting.</v>

417
00:24:18.961 --> 00:24:21.450
And I was thinking about that actually as I was coming in,

418
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.530
again coming back to the fact that these are skills that you learn.

419
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.540
I think that if you are,
you are gifted and you create an amazing tech company.

420
00:24:30.541 --> 00:24:32.700
And I think of Bill Gates and I think of,
you know,

421
00:24:32.701 --> 00:24:34.590
all the leaders of these big tech companies,

422
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.430
they are not necessarily the most comfortable public speakers,

423
00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:42.720
but they give public speeches every day when they reach a certain point in

424
00:24:42.721 --> 00:24:45.870
leadership.
And I do think they are changing the model.

425
00:24:45.871 --> 00:24:47.190
I think that's really cool.

426
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.840
But what's interesting to me is at the same time we have these leaders who are

427
00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:55.290
changing the model and do seem like they're more introverted and probably would

428
00:24:55.291 --> 00:24:59.610
be much more comfortable in a smaller group or one on one or even behind the

429
00:24:59.611 --> 00:25:00.900
screen.
Um,

430
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:06.290
we have sort of this flourishing how to culture of conferences and gurus telling

431
00:25:10.231 --> 00:25:14.400
us to get out there.
And so to me it's like actually a little confusing.
You know,

432
00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:17.080
what kind of,
should I be a great networker?
I should,

433
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:18.960
I just pursue my own passion.

434
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.890
I think the answer is pursue your own passion and you'll figure it out later.

435
00:25:22.891 --> 00:25:24.540
If you're good enough at what you do,

436
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.390
no one's going to care if you don't give a great speech.

437
00:25:27.391 --> 00:25:29.970
And you will notice that when they're talking about things they really care

438
00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:33.630
about and they're really comfortable with,
they come alive,
right?

439
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.860
They don't feel awkward anymore.

440
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.730
I saw that with the professor when I was an undergraduate.
Yes.

441
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.110
Freshmen to sophomore classes.
He was like a robot.
Junior year classes.

442
00:25:43.111 --> 00:25:47.490
He was a fire.
I bet someone taught him or he just liked that class better.

443
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.730
It was the material difference change.

444
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.520
<v 4>Oh.
Um,
I had a question about,
uh,</v>

445
00:25:54.521 --> 00:25:58.090
so you talked about creating a sort of like space and alone time in the business

446
00:25:58.091 --> 00:25:58.691
that you created.

447
00:25:58.691 --> 00:26:02.350
You have recommendations for how to do that within a corporate environment.

448
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.370
Given that we are in an open layout and there's always a lot of noise around us.

449
00:26:06.371 --> 00:26:10.210
People are always walking around or are you just hear like conversations right

450
00:26:10.211 --> 00:26:13.560
from people that are sitting right next to you?
Um,
yeah.
Do you have a,

451
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.520
I guess recommendations for how to sort of carve out that time for yourself even

452
00:26:17.521 --> 00:26:18.760
in that environment?

453
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:23.560
<v 0>Yeah,
that's chapter 10 in the book.
Um,
and,
and,
and to be honest,
you know,</v>

454
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.010
I think that it's a very individual thing.
I hear you,

455
00:26:27.011 --> 00:26:31.420
I hear you on the open plan.
I think that um,
more companies and,

456
00:26:31.421 --> 00:26:33.040
and I don't know about Google and it,
you know,

457
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.090
I'd actually be very curious to know are building in more private space,

458
00:26:37.091 --> 00:26:40.090
especially with the rise of a pod based,
you know,

459
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.120
pod based setups and and sort of agile everything where there is so much

460
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:48.400
collaborating happening.
Right.
Um,

461
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.310
I think people also understand that individual teams might want a quiet space to

462
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.590
collaborate but that people need a break.

463
00:26:55.650 --> 00:27:00.330
We're all over meetinged I also think the rise of slack and I guess here you use

464
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:01.500
g chat but you know,

465
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.880
the constant communicating not just face to face but online while we're sitting

466
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:07.890
publicly is very draining.

467
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.280
I think if you can and you are able to do your best work talking to your manager

468
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.570
and you know,
if,
if working from home is your thing,

469
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.130
if there's a quieter place,

470
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.870
I think many of us are socialized and I totally understand it.

471
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.050
To be afraid to ask for what we need to get our best job done.

472
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:30.480
But I have some amazing statistics in the book.

473
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.530
Your boss will accommodate you because she doesn't want you to leave.

474
00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:37.020
It's very expensive and it's a major pain in the butt.

475
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.190
And so being prepared,
having a plan and saying,
you know,

476
00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:44.580
I have to get this project done,
I need quiet,

477
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.470
I will do my best work in the quiet.
I'm going to take three hours on Friday.

478
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.890
You have my cell phone,
I'm Gunna be on g chat.

479
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.590
And just trying a little bit of a pilot,
an easing in might be really effective.

480
00:27:58.591 --> 00:28:03.030
But I think not being afraid to say we all feel that way,
right?

481
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.560
It is a very draining environment and so don't be ashamed.

482
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.280
<v 4>Thanks for coming again.
And um,</v>

483
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.340
I guess first thing I'll say is that Google has some very nice bathrooms,

484
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.540
so it's going to take advantage.
Um,
the question is,
uh,

485
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.380
I guess I find myself in a little bit of a flip of the situation that you

486
00:28:21.381 --> 00:28:23.900
described in the sense that like day to day,

487
00:28:23.901 --> 00:28:26.120
I'm attracting with a lot of people around here.

488
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.220
And outside of that I find like I have zero energy for social networking,
right?

489
00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:33.530
Like for online networking.
Right?

490
00:28:33.531 --> 00:28:37.220
I have zero energy to put stuff even on Google plus internally much less,

491
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.070
you know,
Facebook or Linkedin or whatever.
Right?

492
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.750
And it feels like there are these very big channels of being connected and

493
00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:47.990
tracking with people,
having influenced blah,
blah,
blah.
The,

494
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:52.160
I'm not participating in because I just don't feel I have this sort of introvert

495
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.420
energy to participate in those.
Do you have any thoughts or suggestions?

496
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.320
<v 0>I just want to say I hear you.
I feel I feel the same.
I feel,</v>

497
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.330
I feel sometimes that participating online is almost more of a challenge.

498
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.453
Um,

499
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.553
<v 1>and,</v>

500
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:11.910
<v 0>and that you do have to force yourself.</v>

501
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.740
But I would ask yourself why.

502
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.390
I think a lot of us feel this sense of Fomo,
right?
I know I should be doing this.

503
00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:23.900
I should be gaining influence.
I should be building my personal brand.

504
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:28.460
My question is why fear of missing out,
fear of missing out.

505
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.910
So that's my question to you.
Why?

506
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.520
What's your motivation for building the influence?
And then,

507
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.390
okay,
I want to write,
do you want to,

508
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.360
do you want to make a creative contribution?

509
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.700
Do you want to grow your network for potential future career opportunities?

510
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.550
Do you just want to build your online landscape,

511
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:50.860
your online footprint in your online profile?

512
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.930
Maybe pick one simple way.
For me it's always been writing.

513
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.120
I'm comfortable writing,
I like to write.

514
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.420
So blogging was so natural for me and I didn't push myself for the other parts

515
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:05.620
of social media that made me feel naked.

516
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:10.840
I think that there are ways to build your online footprint that are less social

517
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.640
but equally legit photography,
video,
recipes,

518
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:17.590
writing.
So maybe start there,

519
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:20.860
but I think it's also okay to say why,

520
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.060
who says I have to do this right now?
And like baby steps.

521
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.640
<v 5>Okay.</v>

522
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.270
<v 4>Hey,
thanks for coming.
Um,</v>

523
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.920
so I have a question sort of on behalf of my partner who's currently trying to

524
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:37.270
get a leg into a career or doing like animation and she's spitting,

525
00:30:37.271 --> 00:30:40.570
it's at a time building up a portfolio.
She's gonna start applying to jobs soon.

526
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.580
And I think she has a challenge now where she's an outsider looking to break

527
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:49.780
into an industry where she's doesn't have a lot of connections.

528
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.440
What would you say to someone like that WHO's trying to get into um,

529
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.890
a place where they're networking and meeting people and finding opportunities

530
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.390
when they're starting from zero?

531
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.970
<v 0>That's tough,
right?</v>

532
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:07.710
This is where conferences actually can be very helpful and because she does want

533
00:31:07.711 --> 00:31:10.080
to get into a very specific industry,
I mean I would,

534
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.020
I would encourage it to even go a little bit deeper than an animation.
You know,

535
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:13.950
is there a certain area,

536
00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:16.110
does she want to do entertainment and she wanted to do scientific that she

537
00:31:16.111 --> 00:31:19.620
wanted to technical,
I don't know.
But what I would do,
honestly,

538
00:31:19.621 --> 00:31:23.820
this sounds so basic is I would start on Twitter and use some search term

539
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.720
seeking and find out who's writing.
This is what I've been telling my clients to,

540
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.900
who's writing about it?
Are there animators tweeting who are,

541
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.180
who are people on Youtube who have big followings?

542
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.340
I would start following them and I would figure out what are the publications

543
00:31:38.341 --> 00:31:41.190
they cite or contribute to message boards,

544
00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:44.910
websites and is there a conference they go to?
Honestly,

545
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.090
and then she needs to sort of have a battle plan.

546
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.950
I would challenge her if there's a,
if there's a conference in La for example,

547
00:31:52.951 --> 00:31:55.520
where she says,
you know,
potential employers are going to be there.

548
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.250
This person that I really want to work for,
his speaking,
that's the opera.

549
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:02.340
That's that.
That's the place where she's got to have her plan and she's got to,

550
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.940
you know,
figure out her online strategy ahead of time.
She's got a good website,

551
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.720
she's got a good portfolio.
Is she following the right people on Twitter,

552
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.300
go to the conference,
have a strategy,
try to meet you know,
five people.

553
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.100
Maybe she can bring an extrovert with her and do it because when you are going

554
00:32:20.101 --> 00:32:24.210
to break in you sometimes have to get out there and sometimes the facetime of a

555
00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:27.000
conference is actually really great.
It just is

556
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.570
<v 5>awesome.
Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

557
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.920
<v 2>Typical sorts of things to,
to,</v>

558
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.620
to bring up in a talk like this that don't apply so much to Google.

559
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:40.070
Are Hauer the workplaces locking in ways that that

560
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.980
<v 0>makes these challenges greater and how can the companies change?</v>

561
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.340
I would say just in general,
and I don't know if this is an issue in Google,

562
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:48.200
I've never worked here.
I've read a lot about it.

563
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:53.350
My personal passion is helping really successful ambitious people claim the

564
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:57.110
space and the quiet they need to get their job done.

565
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.160
For a lot of people it's working from home,
it's getting out of the open plan.

566
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.520
There was a great reported story on a blog that,
you know,

567
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:09.020
the apple $5 billion headquarters,
it's all pod.
It's all open plan.

568
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:12.920
So one of the senior engineers actually had a bit of a palace coup and insisted

569
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:15.260
he have his own building with private spaces built.

570
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.510
I don't know if that's true or not,
but I was like,
yes.

571
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.080
So if I had one dream for workplaces to change,

572
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:26.110
it would be that managers stop looking at the person who's always in the office

573
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.390
as their most ambitious person and look at the person who does the best work.

574
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.310
Right.
I,
I feel that,
um,
we,
again,

575
00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:41.840
we equate facetime,
seeming enthusiasm,

576
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:46.700
team spirit,
all this stuff with ambition and skill.

577
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.530
And that's actually not the case at all.
Um,
if I could have,
you know,

578
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.800
growing through the corporate ladder and worked from home two mornings a week,

579
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.570
I would have been really happy.

580
00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.720
So I would like people to stop to decouple ambition from facetime and certainly

581
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:02.690
from extroversion.

582
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.271
<v 4>What is it going to say?</v>

583
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:08.330
I don't know if this is a question or response to something and somebody else,

584
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:09.141
uh,
asked,

585
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:14.141
but are you familiar with rest by Alex Pang?

586
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.190
Yes.
I quote it in the book.
Yeah.
Cause he talks a bit about,
you know,

587
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.450
many intellectuals or quiet people or whatever who,
you know,

588
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:28.400
would do an hour or two of work and then go out on a walk for,
you know,

589
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:31.790
an hour,
hour and a half,
something like that.
And to me,
you know,

590
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.450
I have certainly done that here at Google when I need quiet time by myself to

591
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:36.590
think about something.
Right?

592
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:40.340
The problem is you can't bring like a laptop with you and type,
but you know,

593
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.760
around here sometimes that's the only time you can get quiet for 30 minutes.

594
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.420
<v 0>I just want to acknowledge that and to say,
again,
these,
it sounds so basic,</v>

595
00:34:51.421 --> 00:34:56.310
but the ability to claim your time to think is really powerful.

596
00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.580
And I know the Google's always been a leader in that you've had your,

597
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.220
is it 20% rule or whatever,
but you know,

598
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:07.250
so few places in our life give us a moment to be with our thoughts and get

599
00:35:08.641 --> 00:35:12.990
creative and that's a discipline at work that we need to honor.

600
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

601
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.260
<v 6>Oh,
hey,
another question.
You brought up a Hillary's campaign.
I was curious.
Um,</v>

602
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:23.050
yeah,
I guess if you to go in to do that,
right,
I'm having those flexible.

603
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.320
How would you have gone about,
uh,

604
00:35:25.321 --> 00:35:29.340
I guess like changing the way that she sort of went across America and how these

605
00:35:29.341 --> 00:35:34.200
conversations.
Oh,
so politics,
I'm just curious.
Yeah.
It's not really like a,

606
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.380
<v 0>you know,
I had been thinking about this because as,</v>

607
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.020
as a sort of digital political consultant,
I've been thinking and,
um,

608
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.040
there's actually a candidate running,
you should check her out.

609
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:47.790
Laura Moser in Texas who started something called the daily action,

610
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:50.790
which is online action.
She's a bit of an introvert,

611
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:54.360
so I'm going to see how she's running.
Again,

612
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:59.390
I think that we don't always get the best candidates because so much of being a

613
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:04.440
politician is that glad handling small talk.
I mean,

614
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:06.990
if we think walking into a tech networking event is bad,

615
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:11.340
imagine walking into like a firehouse dinner in a different state and fire has

616
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:14.910
breakfast every,
you know,
I mean,
oh my gosh,
that's hell for an introvert.

617
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:20.190
So I would love to see candidates win.
Who could,
you know,

618
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.770
either use online conversations.
You know,

619
00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:26.100
wouldn't it be amazing if you could have Skype conversations,

620
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:30.240
if you could use all these tools to connect with people in a meaningful way.

621
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.920
Convene smaller groups,

622
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.090
usually small groups or just only high donors get small groups now,

623
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.140
high dollar donors,

624
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:42.540
and yet politicians are expected to be so extroverted at the detriment to the

625
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:45.630
skill of policy.
I think this is something we're all going to deal with.

626
00:36:45.631 --> 00:36:49.110
We're dealing with diversity at work,
work styles,

627
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.680
we're dealing with failed styles of leadership.

628
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.870
I think we need to rethink all of our different temperaments and how leaders can

629
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:00.000
be different kinds of people.
To your point,

630
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.430
and that that will happen in the next five or 10 years,

631
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:08.030
<v 2>here's to seeing how the future accommodates and how introverts,
yes.</v>

632
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:12.650
Thank you very much for coming.
Thanks David.
Thank you.
Thank you everyone.
