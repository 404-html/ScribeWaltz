1
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.400
Rebecca comes to us live from standby.
Quick show of hands.

2
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:14.420
Who in this room has actually been to the standby yet?
It's so up.

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.590
Oh my gosh,
me too.
To love it.
It's super good.

4
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:19.670
It's unbelievable.

5
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:23.510
Thank you so much for being a part of sort of the revitalization that's

6
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:27.450
happening with all of Detroit and the eateries as well.
Um,

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.570
big as you can tell.
Crowd favorite.

8
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.350
I didn't even realize that many people had been there already,
but um,

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.490
a couple more cool and interesting facts about Rebecca and then I promise I'll

10
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:41.450
stop talking and let you to do more talking.
So she's California native.

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.170
I think probably the most notable thing we'll talk a lot about today is that you

12
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:49.430
were a contestant on the 12th season of top chef.
Amazing.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.840
So exciting.

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.970
She has moved here to recently this summer sometime.

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.540
Yeah,
I moved in June.
In June from Chicago,
right?
Yes.

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.330
So you were in Chicago,
you were head chef at uh,

17
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.990
the Virgin Hotel.
Yes.
And um,

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.280
you came here with your husband who is also working in Detroit as a chef at the

19
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:18.860
apparatus room.
Yes.
Station hotel.
For the foundation or Tom?
Tom is his name.
Yup.

20
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.630
Yup.
And um,
you have a couple for babies.
I just collected.
I don't understand.

21
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.560
Oh,
you have another one?
Last I heard you had three fur babies,

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.250
now you're at fault.

23
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.650
<v 0>Four,
four.
And I have a very small apartment right now,</v>

24
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:33.530
especially when you have four creatures.

25
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.250
But that happens.
That was used to it now.

26
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:40.370
He used to get so mad at me for bringing stuff home.
That's the way it was.

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.680
It was two dogs and a cat before.
What is it now?
Now I have three dogs.
Cat.

28
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.930
Wow.
That's it.
And then it's a good story.
That was funny.
Well,
can we hear it?

29
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.670
Sure.
So we have another restaurant or bar called the skip and about,

30
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.400
and we only serve the Mexican style coke,

31
00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:59.960
the small ones and the in the glass jars.

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.510
And we got completely slammed one weekend we had like a big Dj set and Adidas

33
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:08.840
had like taken over the whole beltway.
And so they're like,
chef,

34
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.930
you're one the only ones where the car can you please go to honeybee and get

35
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.640
some more soda?
And I was like,
sure.

36
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.180
So I go to honeybee at like eight o'clock at night and a big giant puppy dog is

37
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.060
running around the roads,
like freaked out.
And I was like,
oh,

38
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:27.320
he got out of somebodies yard.

39
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.900
So I pull over and these other people tried to get him.

40
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:34.250
He ran away from them and I was like,
come here puppy.
He was huge.
Um,

41
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.830
jumped in my car.
He was beat up pretty good.
Um,

42
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.680
but it was a Saturday night and none of the rescues could take him.

43
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.660
So I was like,
okay,

44
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.320
you're either going to like fit in this weekend with the dogs or you're going to

45
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.740
try to kill my docksin.
Um,
cause I didn't know he was a fight.
Darger anything.

46
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.630
It was just like,
all right.
Um,

47
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.680
so we gave him a bath and fed him and kind of hung out with him for a little bit

48
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.160
and he never went away.
He adapted.
He did.

49
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:02.410
So now I have a a 90 pound baby.
And what kind of dog is he?

50
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.300
He is a lab mastiff pit.
Bull Mix.
Oh Wow.
That's,

51
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.860
but he is just,

52
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.450
and we should've named him Stimpy cause he's totally sweet but kind of stupid

53
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.640
and like just happy.
He just wants to play all the time.

54
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:19.480
It just has no idea how big he is.
What did you name him?
Um,
his name is Busby,

55
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.920
which is like totally not a normal name,

56
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.100
but my husband has been amassing the Manchester United greatest tips players of

57
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.980
all time history with all of my pets.

58
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.600
So my cat's name is gigs after Ryan Giggs.

59
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.820
My um,

60
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.540
American bulldogs name is Rooney from Wayne Rooney.

61
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.250
And then now I have sir Busby who was like there,

62
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.550
I don't know if he's like hall of famer manager something or other and I was

63
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:53.590
like,
okay,
perfect.

64
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.590
<v 2>That's one of our clients actually.
Chevrolet sponsors Manchester.
Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.590
<v 0>With them.
There is an interesting,
their hugest fan lives downtown.</v>

66
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.130
<v 2>Can we tell them that?
Totally freak out.</v>

67
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.160
It's my world.
It's my world into trade.
I think you're probably realizing that,

68
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:16.330
that you can't walk down the street and not know someone or someone knows

69
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.260
someone from high school or college.
Right.

70
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.480
<v 0>She's the other day.
And I was like,
okay,
everybody is like everybody,</v>

71
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:23.060
I had all the five people I know we're here.

72
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.300
<v 2>Well let's start there.
So we're,</v>

73
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.520
we are going to talk a lot more about top chef and end of year for babies.

74
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.080
But let's start there.
Let's very,
very interesting to us and,
and,

75
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:36.290
and there's some timely news happening right now cause I don't know if you saw

76
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:38.060
but Google just announced a couple of weeks ago.

77
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.330
We're making the move officially down to Detroit next year.
Yeah,

78
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.370
we're excited too.
So tell us,
um,

79
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.310
having not been being a California native and not necessarily a Michigander to

80
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:49.144
train name it,

81
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.610
tell us what being a part of the Detroit rebirth has been like for you.

82
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.900
<v 0>Um,
I love it.
I have been coming to Detroit for the past four years.</v>

83
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.240
Um,
actually what's pretty funny,

84
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:05.241
four years ago we stayed at the Cadillac cause my bridal shower was here cause

85
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:06.241
we have,
hi,

86
00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:10.080
my husband has relatives in Michigan and so I had never gotten to meet a bunch

87
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:11.670
of them.
So that was how I met all of them.

88
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:14.220
And that was the first time I'd ever really been downtown Detroit.

89
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.350
And at that point it was a little bit scary.
Yeah.
And it wasn't bad.

90
00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:22.830
Like I think the guy,
we've,
we went and had dinner at roast and we were like,

91
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.380
where can we go for cocktails?
And like,
I was like,
you shouldn't leave the hotel.

92
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:30.180
And I was like,
well,
okay,
fine.
He's like,
no one's really bad idea.

93
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.530
That's just four years ago.

94
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.600
And now I recognize the church that I drove by and it's completely like,

95
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:41.601
it's right across the street from Little Caesar's pizza arena and nothing was

96
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:44.490
there.

97
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.240
And now it's like Woodward has grown up and all of these beautiful buildings,

98
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:50.670
it gets completely unrecognizable from what it was four years ago.

99
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.860
And right after the show I started doing dinners at revolver and steadily every

100
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:57.890
six months I have done dinner at revolver.

101
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:02.090
So I've been coming ahead and watching it grow up and I tried to get him to move

102
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.650
here like two years ago.
Um,
and you guys probably didn't know this but um,

103
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.020
Michigan is huge horse country and I grew up showing horses so I know a lot,

104
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.280
a lot of breeders and trainers are here and I was like,
cool,

105
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.700
I can like I can still show horses if we move

106
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.440
<v 2>to Detroit.</v>

107
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.950
That's funny you did an interview with someone recently where you said that a

108
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:26.490
big part of moving to downtown Detroit meant that you could staple your horses

109
00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:30.570
or you could have your horses,
which I didn't think that that would be,

110
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.600
it doesn't seem realistic.
And I live here,
I'm from here.

111
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.510
So where do you stable them?
Tell us a little bit about that.

112
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.560
<v 0>Quite Metamora but like,
uh,
okay.
Um,</v>

113
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.470
right before I always forget where his family's from.

114
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:47.471
Port here on there is to like have the top Arabian horse trainers in the u s up

115
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:49.311
there.

116
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:54.120
So it's literally a 45 minute drive from downtown if it's not traffic time.

117
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.170
Did you have your horses in Chicago?
No,

118
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.230
most of my horses are in Arizona and in California.
Right.

119
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.430
So I have western pleasure horses and renters and they aren't with my best,

120
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:06.020
one of my best friends down in Scottsdale.
And Are you,

121
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.570
do you do shows with them as well?
That's so interesting.
Yeah.
So,

122
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.590
but up here there's a lot of English horses and I love English and writing hunt,

123
00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:19.340
so I'm gonna get myself a half Arabian and very cool.

124
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.400
Yeah.
Very cool.
Well let's,
let's

125
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.401
<v 2>really interesting,</v>

126
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:27.780
you do hear that a lot when we get people transplants as we call him from other

127
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:32.781
cities who have given up a swanky life in New York or given up a lot of property

128
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:35.040
out west to come to Detroit,

129
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.600
that there are some sort of creature comforts that did.

130
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.860
This city does an offer side of your stature.

131
00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:44.130
And so I think that that's really interesting that horses is,

132
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:47.580
your passion into trade seems to be still a good fit for you.
So yes,

133
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.950
<v 0>great.
You kind of,
you get the best of both worlds.</v>

134
00:07:49.951 --> 00:07:53.250
Like we can't really live too far away from a major metropolitan area.

135
00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:57.330
That's just our jobs don't translate well to the other kind of food they're both

136
00:07:57.331 --> 00:07:57.841
of us do.

137
00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:02.841
So it works out really well that we can have a property and have animals and I

138
00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:07.020
have always had cows and pigs and horses and all that stuff and now I can

139
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:11.010
actually do that and afford to buy a house.
It isn't the size of a postage stamp.

140
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.670
<v 2>Yeah,
it's a little expensive down there right now.
Well,
okay.</v>

141
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:20.720
So in that same theme of Detroit,
um,

142
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.220
well let's talk about standby.
Standby James Beard award nominee right now,

143
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:26.054
um,

144
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.480
typically known as a bar that leads to a restaurant slash bar that leads with

145
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.870
really well known,
strong alcoholic drinks,
bar drinks.

146
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.410
That's kind of how you guys have your reputation building right now.

147
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.480
Tell us as a chef coming into a restaurant with a bar with that type of

148
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:45.314
reputation,

149
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.890
how it's been challenging for you or how you've been able to either a compliment

150
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:52.760
that or you know,
what,
what you see from a negative and a positive standpoint.

151
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.530
<v 0>Um,</v>

152
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.420
I thought it was a great project and I came from having five restaurants under

153
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:01.800
my hat to having one that was really focused was really nice.

154
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:02.790
Um,

155
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:07.790
and I could bring the food to the same level as the cocktails and my job was to

156
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.290
get it there,

157
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.190
get us more organized so we can continue to work on other projects and expand

158
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:18.650
the company.
Yeah.
What,
what are you most proud of that you've done it?
Um,

159
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.670
just that like consistency,

160
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:25.671
I think consistency and that like we don't have a disparity between the food and

161
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.040
the cocktails.
Like before we had,
we have a $20 drink on the menu,
but

162
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.240
it's like everything is,
is a lot snacky are,
and that's just,

163
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.290
they just hadn't found the right fit of person to kind of do that.

164
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.050
And to me,
I'm like,
standby is a cocktail bar that has great food.

165
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.030
It's not a restaurant that has great cocktails.

166
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:52.110
So that's something that I try to keep it everybody's mind that I'm there to

167
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.770
compliment the food and to help us do other things.

168
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.480
<v 2>Yeah,
you have quite an extensive background as a chef.</v>

169
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.250
Let's talk a little bit about the APP chefs.
So,
um,
top chef,

170
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.160
I think it's what all of us know,
that's how you got your chops,

171
00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:09.370
but is there some other way that,

172
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.260
do you think top chef kind of has out shadowed something else in your life

173
00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:14.900
you're really proud of that got you to where you are now?

174
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:16.790
Or would you credit top chef for that?

175
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.290
<v 0>I think I did top shelf cause it was just an easy point in my life to be able to</v>

176
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:22.970
do that.
We were really fortunate to where my,

177
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.830
the company that I was working with Trencherman and the Heisler group where it

178
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.830
was like,
yes,
do it please.
And I was like,
I don't know.
I'm not like,

179
00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:33.320
that's not my deal.
I didn't really need to do that stuff.
Um,

180
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.240
but I think what I had kind of done to get there before was a good lead up to

181
00:10:38.241 --> 00:10:41.270
it.
Um,
it certainly wasn't my favorite thing that I've ever done,
but it,

182
00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:43.970
I don't regret it.
I never wanted to regret doing it.

183
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:47.150
And they asked me like they begged and begged,
begged me to do it.
And I was like,

184
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.480
alright,
I'll do it.
Just not a very good social person.

185
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.490
We could afford that.
Man.
I kept my mouth quiet a lot,

186
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.520
which was one of the reasons why they were like,
you're,
you're very quiet.

187
00:10:58.521 --> 00:10:58.941
I'm like,
well,

188
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:01.040
because some of the things that come out of my mouth are very nice.

189
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.690
Like I just like,
well,
you're just like,

190
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.760
you're stuck in a weird situation.

191
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.280
And I think the most frustrating thing for me was I was like,

192
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.010
and the same thing with James.
Have we both agreed on this one?
We were like,

193
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.150
good food takes time.
And that's what they take away from you.

194
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.450
They take away the two most important things about being a really good chef that

195
00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:24.440
really cares about your food is time and the ability to pick your ingredients.

196
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:27.620
One of the biggest things about our job is sourcing the best ingredients and

197
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:28.790
local ingredients that we can.

198
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:34.100
So it's a little bit like you never feel like you're putting your best foot

199
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:36.800
forward for somebody that you completely admire.

200
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.630
Like you're cooking for Java pen and you're like,
wow,

201
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.720
I just ran through whole foods that we ravage like three days ago.

202
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:42.471
It's a three day weekend.

203
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:45.500
We know they didn't get any fresh orders because we know how everything flows in

204
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:50.650
and out of these places and I'm going to put this in front of 7 million people

205
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:55.721
and I'm cooking on a stove in an apartment near you and this is awesome.

206
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.570
Here you go.
Thank you.
He's just like,
oh.

207
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.040
But for the most part you were given some really positive feedback on that show.

208
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.560
Oh yeah.
I had a good time.
I mean I met some amazing people.
Um,

209
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.020
it's definitely like nobody knows what you go through except for like the 15 of

210
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:17.890
you that are there.
So we're all pretty,
pretty close,
pretty tight.
Which was fun.

211
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.480
Well,
you met some amazing people.

212
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:23.320
There's a lot of celebrity chefs and a lot of celebrities really in general that

213
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.920
you came across with on that season.
Who is your favorite?

214
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:31.790
Who stands out to you as someone you were most glad to meet?
Or newer?

215
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.750
But I think it was pretty over it by the time we had to meet people.

216
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.110
Would you say one of the other contestants?

217
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.580
It was really fun to like be in the chairs set and do an meet norm and do all

218
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:43.031
that stuff.

219
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:46.330
And then he came to my restaurant like four months later and we weren't allowed

220
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:49.660
to talk about it because we had the,
it had an air yet and he was like,

221
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.940
I love your jacket.
I was like,
thanks.
I thought that was super funny.

222
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.500
Oh my gosh.
That's awesome.
That's very cool.
He had,
that was,
that was a great one,

223
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.450
but it was one that much.
So post life top chef.
Um,

224
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.910
was there one of the other contestants that you stayed in touch with?

225
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.790
I think we know the answer to this.
You already mentioned a couple of names,

226
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:13.630
but someone you stayed in touch with that you've really felt you built a network

227
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:16.960
around.
Um,
but,
well James and I are really close.
James.
Yeah.
Um,

228
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.700
May and I talk pretty much all the time.

229
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.170
Carrie Ann and I are still really good friends.
We were roommates.
Um,

230
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.840
George and I were really close.

231
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.910
We hung out together a lot after we got eliminated.

232
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:31.810
It was really fun to get eliminated because you're stuck in this house and

233
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.420
you're like,
wow,
I don't have to do anything besides like entertain myself.

234
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.560
What would you do once you got eliminated?
I'm always,

235
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.880
we know this when you get eliminated a ton of trouble for telling you this,

236
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:41.500
but I don't really care.
Like I'm like,
what are you gonna do to me?

237
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:46.360
I've got nothing but basically rented out like a residence inn and we all got

238
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:48.940
our own apartment and you get like,

239
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.010
you get so much money a week for food and stuff.

240
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.750
So we took over the pool and we barbecued every day.

241
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.220
Yeah.
And then we would perfect.
Yeah,
it was awesome.

242
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.660
We had a great time and it was summer.

243
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:04.390
It was like none of us have ever been able to be off,

244
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:08.650
have this much time off in our life and to not have to like run a check on the

245
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:12.310
restaurant or do something else.
Or like every year as a chef,

246
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:16.300
you're always just on.
So it was really awesome to be like,
wow,

247
00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:18.190
this is like what actual vacation feels like.

248
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.960
It's like celebrity spring break.
Totally accepted.
We were like,

249
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.340
you guys should have had the camera's here.

250
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.840
Like we snuck out and went to Karaoke and James is a huge karaoke,

251
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.560
a holic.
That was hysterical.
I had a great time.
How Fun.
Yeah,

252
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:39.040
we had a great time.
Well okay so,
so top chef,

253
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:43.410
the rebirth of Detroit,
you're,
you have so many interesting layers to,
I could,

254
00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:44.500
I don't even know where to start,

255
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:49.060
but one of the other things I do want to talk about because you're at Google and

256
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.150
there's a number of things that we prioritize here.
Worklife

257
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.420
<v 2>balance is one of them.</v>

258
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.320
Hearing that you have your horses here with you at which affords you a better

259
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.770
life is awesome cause we can all relate to that.
But um,

260
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.480
talk to us a little bit about something else that's very important here at

261
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.250
Google.
And we have a group called women at and a part of our,

262
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.360
our initiative behind that is just to kind of like uncover truths and,

263
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.420
and do a lot of sort of sharing of our lives and things that make being a woman

264
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:24.560
in a technology field at a very large corporation with a big reputation.

265
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.820
It's not always easy.

266
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.510
I cannot imagine almost a tougher industry then being a chef,

267
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:36.770
a professional chef and the industry that you're in and being female and leading

268
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:37.041
that.

269
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:41.240
So talk to us a little bit about some of the challenges or if there's one big

270
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:45.890
one that stands out for you in your journey as a female chef amongst what I

271
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.110
think is probably a pretty big boys' club.

272
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.360
<v 0>It is a huge boys' club.</v>

273
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.100
I just never put up with it and I didn't ever kind of realize that it wasn't

274
00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:59.830
going to put up with it until I was at Michael Mina.
And,
um,

275
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.340
I always just kind of focused on doing a really good job.
And if I knew,

276
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:05.770
I knew I needed to get better and I was looking over at what other people are

277
00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:08.890
doing and I just made sure,
I just made sure I worked harder than everybody else.

278
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.533
Um,

279
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.440
but there was a couple of people that like you always run across some guys that

280
00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:18.400
don't want you there.
Right.
Um,
especially,
um,
this is gonna sound really terrible,

281
00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:21.700
but like there's a lot of foreign chefs that we work with,
but that is not,

282
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:27.700
it's not a big women crossover yeah.
Into their workforce.
So they were like,

283
00:16:27.701 --> 00:16:31.900
get out and you're not conforming to whatever our cultural program is.

284
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.670
And I was like,
dude,
if you want to go toe to toe back here,
fine.

285
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.340
Bring it on chef style.
I don't care.

286
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.560
Yeah.
You're not going to get in the way of me not doing my job,

287
00:16:44.561 --> 00:16:48.370
but I'm also not going to let you treat me like garbage or throw my stuff away

288
00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:51.760
or oh,
would they do that?
Oh yeah.
Like kitchen sabotage is,

289
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.310
oh yeah,
I need that pot.
Like,
oh yeah,

290
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.780
like completely,
oh,
that's horrific.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Oh,

291
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.310
I did not a big deal.

292
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.090
<v 2>I love that you say that.
You just,
you just won't stand for,
and it's,</v>

293
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.960
<v 0>I know,
dude,
like if you touch my shit again,
I'm going to burn you out.</v>

294
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.340
It's like prison rules,
man.
Like you get there early,
get all of your stuff,

295
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.800
and if you continue to try to take my stuff,

296
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.770
I'm going to put a spoon on the flat top and I'm going to hold it to your hand.

297
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.320
Don't yet.
But as soon as you like,

298
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.380
they figure out that like you're not going to put up with it.

299
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.880
Like the stuff stops.

300
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.850
<v 2>Yeah.
Wow.
So it's,
that's,
that's amazing.</v>

301
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:36.830
And actually even more a terrifying then the way I thought you would describe
it.

302
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:40.690
So good for you.
I love,
I love again,
I just love that you have,
you know,

303
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.660
the balls to just say,

304
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:46.040
I'm not going to stand for this and I will sabotage you right back so you don't

305
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:50.400
belong here.
You belong here.
Don't you're good for the city.

306
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.230
Like,
am I going to put up with that?
So then,
uh,

307
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.920
the next obvious question is two chefs in one family,

308
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.610
incredibly difficult back to the work life balance thing.

309
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:06.390
But how do you and Tom Make it work?
Cause it's nights,
it's weekends,

310
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:08.720
it's early mornings.
Do you,

311
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.660
you find that that presents itself a challenge or is it easier?

312
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.180
It was probably a little harder when we were first

313
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.660
<v 0>together cause we didn't really have super control of our schedules.
But no,</v>

314
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:21.750
we both kind of make the schedule and we both really understand that.

315
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:24.810
Like if something happens,
if you have something going on in a Sunday,

316
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:28.350
of course you have to work on Sunday,
that's,
that's okay.
Um,

317
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.250
but we try to make sure that we have like Sunday or Monday or both days off a

318
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.420
week so we can actually see each other.

319
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.800
I feel like it makes us appreciate each other more because we are not on top of

320
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:41.370
each other at all.
Like we leave by nine 30 10 in the morning,

321
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.550
one of us will come home and walk the dogs and hang out with the dogs during the

322
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:49.470
day and then we don't get home until 12 o'clock.
Wow.
So,

323
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.040
and then repeat rinse,
wash,
repeat.
Absolutely.
Uh,

324
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.480
who's the better chef de totally depends.

325
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.360
We do totally different styles of food you'd tell us about that.

326
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.150
So he is like ultra fine dining all the time.

327
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.050
And I did that for a long time and I was just like,
I don't need this in my life.

328
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.770
Um,
I remember like a pinnacle moment,

329
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:14.570
we were actually here two years ago doing Saber Detroit and Tom was,
um,

330
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.210
paired up with Luciano from Bucko and I was like,

331
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:21.420
just because your restaurant's name is 16 does not mean you need 16 garnishes.

332
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.130
Whoa.
I think I'm one of the only people that can get away with saying that.

333
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.600
And there was like sometimes like,
you know,

334
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:29.910
like Chenelle says more when you look in the mirror before you go out the door,

335
00:19:29.911 --> 00:19:33.420
it takes something off.
Yeah.
Trail applies here,

336
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.660
<v 2>but that's,
that's his style.</v>

337
00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:38.210
So you were telling how then as a little bit more simplistic.

338
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:43.130
<v 0>Yeah,
I just like,
and that's kind of how I take standby is,
um,
I'm like,
well,</v>

339
00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:44.730
what tastes good?
What's going to,

340
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.800
to me it doesn't have to like I don't want to it to be more complicated than it

341
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:56.450
has to be.
To me kind of less is more.
And let the,
let the stuff speak for itself.

342
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.343
Right.

343
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.900
<v 2>So you didn't answer us though.
Who Do you think is the better?
The better?</v>

344
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.410
I don't know.
I mean,
so he's 10 years older than me,

345
00:20:05.411 --> 00:20:08.770
so technically he would be that way.
If you ask who makes dinner every day?

346
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.580
Is it you?
Actually I was on my list of questions.
So what,

347
00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.990
what's your go to recipe at home?
Not home really ever at the same time,

348
00:20:16.991 --> 00:20:19.660
but it never had to cook something or you had friends coming over.

349
00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:22.810
What's your go to if we friends coming over?

350
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.580
<v 0>That's a tough one.
It's usually a holiday,</v>

351
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:28.390
so whatever holiday food I like totally nerd out over the holidays so I'll go

352
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.360
like go crazy that way.

353
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.940
And we both loved Thanksgiving so thanksgiving becomes like a giant raucous of

354
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.830
stuff.
I'm like,
who are we going to feed?
And we have like five.

355
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:42.420
<v 2>I was going to say
working,
but</v>

356
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.270
<v 0>we cook really simply at home.
Like Tom Loves me,
real meatloaf and Paul Rose.</v>

357
00:20:46.271 --> 00:20:47.770
So that's like basically I make at home.

358
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.960
It's like completely not what people think.

359
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.120
<v 2>He's a,
he's more of like a,
a fluffy,</v>

360
00:20:53.121 --> 00:20:58.121
luxurious 16 course meal or 16 sort of big,

361
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.390
but he likes you.
He likes just like good home cook.

362
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.520
<v 0>Totally.</v>

363
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.700
Like he cooks breakfast every Sunday morning and that's like the most cooking

364
00:21:05.701 --> 00:21:09.540
that he does at home.
And then I usually do,
do dinner and stuff like that.

365
00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:12.180
But yeah,
we're totally symbol at home.
We cook like everybody else.

366
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:17.270
<v 2>Do you use any social media channels or youtube maybe for any kind of recipe</v>

367
00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:21.240
guidance or cooking or

368
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.650
<v 0>no.
Um,
my Instagram is full of darn pictures,
which is totally,</v>

369
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.990
totally disappointing for some people.
But yeah,

370
00:21:27.991 --> 00:21:29.320
I have a docksin and I think he's won.

371
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:34.710
So he posts pictures about him all the time.
Um,
but no,

372
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.940
generally youtube by watching makeup tutorials and get out of like chef world.

373
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.720
<v 2>Okay.
So you,
you actually,</v>

374
00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:44.470
you're not using youtube to sort of perfect your culinary craft.

375
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.220
You're using that more

376
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.450
<v 0>for your personal yeah,
well better.</v>

377
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.500
I do point my sous chefs and stuff to a channel called chef steps and they are

378
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.650
awesome.
So if you're like,
okay,
I suck at boiling eggs,

379
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.950
they will show you like four ways to like hard boil and peel and egg.

380
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.420
And they also do a lot of like molecular gastronomy and like they do some really

381
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:08.920
high end things,
but um,
they have some really fun stuff.
Like if you're like,
okay,

382
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:12.550
I want to figure out how to make hollandaise sauce and put it in an Isi gun and

383
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:15.820
blow it up.
Like,
all right,
cool.
There's a video,
the whole team.

384
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.000
<v 2>Well then who is your,
you said you use makeup tutorials.</v>

385
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:21.340
Who's your favorite youtube create her for that.

386
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.970
<v 0>Oh my God.
I have like a million of those.</v>

387
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.450
I like to watch them all and no one stands out.

388
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.890
I Watch Bailey Syrian a lot and um,
Michelle phone,

389
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.280
I don't watch Michelle fonder.
I used to,
but,
um,

390
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.390
Jaclyn Hill does a good job and um,
a couple of girls over in the UK.

391
00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:41.360
I really like,
it's a little bit more of a natural look.
Yeah.
Yeah.

392
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.980
There's a lot of makeup going on these days and I'm like,

393
00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:48.500
I don't have time for that.
I also don't want it to like,

394
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.980
we sweat a lot in the kitchen and like nobody feels good,

395
00:22:51.981 --> 00:22:55.160
but like did our 10 and you look like you've jumped out of a swimming pool.

396
00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.350
You're like,
wow,

397
00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.140
I just went upstairs to the dining room and I look like I have either been

398
00:23:00.141 --> 00:23:02.840
crying or at a Marilyn Manson concert.

399
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.740
Not a good look for anybody.
Well,
you listen to,
to fall

400
00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:12.030
<v 2>everything I've ever seen it on TV.
So it's one of my best friends is to makeup.</v>

401
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.860
<v 0>She always does make fixes me before I have to go on.
Was she in town?</v>

402
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.540
She travels all the time.
She's the lead,
make a traveling artist for the UFC,

403
00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:25.280
so she covers it.
Bruises mostly makes the girls beautiful.
But um,
yeah,

404
00:23:25.281 --> 00:23:26.990
she's the one who's always like,
okay,
hold on.

405
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.340
<v 2>You mentioned you and Tom when you are together,</v>

406
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:33.250
maybe Mondays or Tuesdays you have date nights.

407
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:38.170
Is there outside of the foundation hotel or standbys or a favorite hotspot you

408
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:42.490
guys like to go to in Detroit?
We always try to go someplace different.

409
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.040
Yeah cause there's like everybody,
so

410
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.460
<v 0>many friends who have restaurants and so many places to go,</v>

411
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:50.450
which is really awesome.

412
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.350
It's kind of nicer to go out here then it wasn't in Chicago cause this was just

413
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:58.310
like everybody here has a purpose and instead of like,

414
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.370
oh I decided I'm gonna open a Chinese restaurant.
That's cool.
All right.

415
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:05.330
That's not what you do.
Yeah.
So we basically try to hit

416
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.550
all of our friends places and then anything that's been around for more than 50

417
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:10.971
years.

418
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:15.110
Like we totally love restaurants that have been around for a million years.

419
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:19.070
Even if they're like,
because it's funny and like totally old and nostalgic.

420
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:23.360
And the more,
the funnier the better like class and stay camp.
Totally.

421
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:26.170
Like can't wait to go there.
Like it's totally on our list.
No,

422
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.360
because they closed on the one of the days that were always off.
So yeah,

423
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.370
like the best place that we love,
places like that.
Anything that's kind of funny.

424
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.550
One of our first dates was at book in a Pepo cause it was funny and I'm like

425
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.130
this is like the weirdest goal.
But we were like,

426
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:47.870
we want to go someplace and order the nicest Keon d on the menu and have it be

427
00:24:47.871 --> 00:24:51.500
one of those stupid basket one
to do it.

428
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.410
And so this is like,
because all the cafe,

429
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.530
yeah that wasn't well and where were we?

430
00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.990
We were in Vegas so there wasn't a Roma cafe there and we didn't realize they

431
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:02.540
put us downstairs in the basement because we must have looked like trouble.

432
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:05.150
But there was these private party of deaf people.
It's where like,

433
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:08.120
it's really quite what is going on.

434
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.850
And then we like dawned on us like half way through,
I remember like,

435
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.940
oh they're at a private party and they stuck us in their room and they're all

436
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:16.040
signing like no wonder there's folk music or anything.

437
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.760
Like we were with this kind of sitting there like things going on.

438
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.840
This is your first date.
Yeah.
I was wondering if first days

439
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.850
that'd be tough.
Temped to connect.
It was quiet hysterical.

440
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.400
We had been had like plenty to drink before then.
So yeah it was,

441
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.700
it was super funny.
What about in Detroit?
I said class in steak house,

442
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:37.520
but what's your favorite old place?
50 plus years old.

443
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.310
Anywhere that you could name off.

444
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:44.090
We loved the going to the London chophouse that has been reopened and redone.

445
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.410
That was really,
really good and it's fun and going up to the cigar bars.

446
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:52.370
Really cool.
And um,
so so far that's been kind of the number one.

447
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.790
Like we love to go to Jacoby's cause it's funny.
Sweet water tavern.

448
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:57.750
We live across the street front.

449
00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.490
So I've had enough of them every day I walk my dogs and I have to like fight

450
00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:03.440
them for chicken wing bones.
Yeah,

451
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.860
that's kind of a nasty court or down there sometimes when there's like after

452
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.320
Lionsgate or Saint Andrews Hall concert or something.
So it's like,

453
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:16.680
if you can imagine like my docs and is feisty.
So I'm trying to like,
yeah.

454
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.340
And he's growling at me.
I'm on a chicken bone.
You got to let it go.

455
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.360
We spend a lot of time down there with some of us have clients and such around

456
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:28.280
General Motors and around the AD agency.

457
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:30.650
So we're always looking for good recommendations.

458
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:35.440
What do you think is the best lunch place around that area?
Tough man lunches.

459
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.080
So tough besides the stand by,
but you can see my doesn't open until four.

460
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:42.530
We don't have until five.
Five.
So yeah,
we're late.
We do late night,

461
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.160
so desserts til 2:00 AM.
Yeah.
And we do like,

462
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:50.880
we do chicken and dumplings from 12 to two.
Oh,
I didn't know.

463
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.050
So like there's like nice hot something to get until 2:00 AM because there's

464
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:59.320
really not a lot.
Yeah.
Um,
but lunch go cy.

465
00:26:59.321 --> 00:27:03.420
Ty is really good.
Um,
I don't like,

466
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:07.970
I like the salads that they have at grand trunk.
We did two long trunk.

467
00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.260
We'd spend a lot of time.
Yeah.
It's one of the few places.

468
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:14.030
It's often the apparatus room.
If you can get in his great lunch.
Okay.

469
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.630
I sit at the bar.
Yeah.
Semester.
Um,
but yeah,

470
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:20.820
there's just not a whole lot of places to have lunch downtown yet.

471
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.360
Like we're working on it.
Yeah.
We think that's a big opportunity.
Yeah.

472
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.220
Especially with companies like Microsoft and hopefully Amazon and obviously

473
00:27:29.221 --> 00:27:33.050
Google moving down there.
Definitely.
Yeah.
It would prove it for,

474
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.970
it's all in the works,
man.
All that stuff.
It was like coming.
You're going,

475
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I is there anything you want to reveal today here at Google and that plans that

476
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.530
like we want to do that.
Like that's in the,
cause there's,
they're literally like,

477
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.570
we all go to the desert.
Desert Oasis.
Desert Oasis.
Coffee,

478
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.780
coffee.
Yeah.
To have to like have meetings and we're like,

479
00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:57.000
this would be great if there was food.
Yeah.

480
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.850
And like there's only so many times you can eat it.

481
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.020
The little Mexican street on the corner.
It is good though.
It is good.
Yeah.

482
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.400
But when you've had,
I'm like,
okay,

483
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:09.240
we've all had their menu and we all are totally lazy and we get delivery at

484
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:13.110
stand by all of the time.
Like,
oh my God,
you guys,
we have to stop.

485
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:15.030
Like there's nothing healthy about anything that we're doing.

486
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.170
Do you think when Google moves down to Detroit,

487
00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:21.180
you might come over and celebrity guests,

488
00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:25.380
chef for us one day I said are a way we could get you to do that.
Yeah.

489
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:27.990
How many people do you have to serve?
Yeah.
Awesome.
Okay.
Well be about what,

490
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:32.910
120 at some point,
but 80 maybe at first.
We'll figure that out afterwards.
Yeah,

491
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:36.990
I can totally do that.
That's easy.
Okay,
awesome.
That's totally,

492
00:28:36.991 --> 00:28:40.530
I think that concludes the interview.
It.
No,
just kidding.
Okay.

493
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.720
So why don't I stop talking.
There's a microphone over here.

494
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.390
Is there anyone with any questions for Rebecca?

495
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.270
<v 3>So you talked about,
um,
maybe expanding a little bit outside of the standby.
Um,</v>

496
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.030
are you looking to just kind of stay in that sort of midtown,
downtown area?

497
00:28:57.031 --> 00:29:00.240
Are you looking at it,
uh,
any of the other neighborhoods?
For example,

498
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:03.960
like West village has some good development going on there.
Uh,
so just curious,

499
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:05.370
like what areas are you looking at?

500
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:10.570
<v 0>We just bought a house over in that area,
a village.</v>

501
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:15.030
We're super excited about it and there is no room right now in West village.

502
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.470
Everything is rented.
Yeah.

503
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.740
So West village is going to blow up here really soon with,

504
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:23.280
I know there's at least three or four restaurants opening.
Um,

505
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.900
my buddy Anthony Lombardo is opening his restaurant.

506
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.180
I can't remember the name of it right now.
Um,

507
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.260
but he actually moved over to midtown because he couldn't get in in West

508
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.480
village,
which is,
it's like,
um,
yeah,
we have,

509
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:46.930
there's still plenty of space downtown and I don't mind staying downtown.

510
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:50.350
I like it down there.
Um,
and I think downtown needs it.

511
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.660
I'm not a super huge suburb person.
I like to come out here to go shopping,

512
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:57.550
but I feel like there's,

513
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.090
there's lots of amazing stuff out here and there's a lot of call for some,

514
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:02.860
for new things.
So we're focusing,

515
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.210
both of us are focusing all of our energies kind of downtown.

516
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.330
<v 2>Thank you.
That's good.
We need that.
That you're absolutely right.</v>

517
00:30:11.331 --> 00:30:15.410
If we could just figure out a way to get some of that shopping downtown and keep

518
00:30:15.411 --> 00:30:18.530
him full of say down there Nordstrom's to move down to the

519
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.480
okay on it.
We had another question here.

520
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:28.690
So you mentioned that you're out the door at around nine 30 until 12.

521
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.530
Can you talk a little bit about what you do in your typical day from when you

522
00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:34.520
start to finish?

523
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.300
<v 0>So my day starts with um,
making sure that my soup,</v>

524
00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:42.060
my morning sous chef has like all the orders have come in.

525
00:30:42.061 --> 00:30:44.610
It was all the stuff I actually ordered.
Um,

526
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.500
everybody is on the same page in that we have on prep projects with,

527
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.200
okay,
Burger me is here.

528
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.500
We petty those fresh everyday and making sure that that's done fries or blanched

529
00:30:55.501 --> 00:30:57.830
by a certain time.
So by the time the cooks come in,

530
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.810
they're kind of out of their way.
And then by that time,

531
00:31:00.811 --> 00:31:02.430
my other two sous chefs have made it in.

532
00:31:02.431 --> 00:31:07.431
And normally at that point I have meetings and then I have meetings in and out

533
00:31:07.921 --> 00:31:10.710
of the city.
So I'm kind of out and around all the time.

534
00:31:10.711 --> 00:31:12.290
And the past couple of weeks,

535
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:17.310
months we have opened a cart out in the alley that we brought you guys some

536
00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:21.630
snacks from,
but we're just some simple little like fun sayings.
Yeah.

537
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.150
Um,
so we,
it was,
I was focusing a lot on like,

538
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.670
okay we need equipment for that.
We need to get bids for equipment,

539
00:31:29.671 --> 00:31:34.010
we need to figure out what we're going to serve it in.
Like how many people does,

540
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.330
does Jesse need to run that?
Um,

541
00:31:36.331 --> 00:31:39.780
so I spent a lot of time doing that and we are also in the works of opening

542
00:31:39.781 --> 00:31:44.490
another bar down the way down at the end on library street.

543
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.020
So that's been another focus cause I'm going to do soft serve ice cream in there

544
00:31:49.021 --> 00:31:49.854
so

545
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.670
<v 2>that will be safe.
Have you announced the name of that are still in the works?</v>

546
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.700
I think it's called the Lux Lux or deluxe locks or something like that.

547
00:31:58.701 --> 00:32:01.160
Looks less but that will be open sometime in March.

548
00:32:01.161 --> 00:32:06.050
That's going to be really fun.
You um,
mentioned meetings outside of the city.

549
00:32:06.051 --> 00:32:06.650
Is it,

550
00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:10.490
I know you do a lot of sourcing from local farms and so is it usually related to

551
00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:10.880
that?

552
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.200
<v 0>So I do that.
I help,
um,
I consult for a couple of people.
The,</v>

553
00:32:15.201 --> 00:32:18.010
I'm just helping them get the restaurants open around and um,

554
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.140
menus and things like that.
I have,
um,

555
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:25.100
a couple of meetings with people that have that want to do private dinners and

556
00:32:25.101 --> 00:32:27.950
then like every doctor's appointment and the world is over out here.

557
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.690
And then if anybody,
if you like,

558
00:32:29.691 --> 00:32:33.290
the one thing that needs to come downtown desperately is a grocery store,

559
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.090
<v 2>Nordstrom's and a grocery store and a non whole foods.</v>

560
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.010
Whole foods is tiny and it gets

561
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.730
<v 0>picked over and mentally quickly.
So if you need like Ziploc bags,</v>

562
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:45.950
your host and wow,

563
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.550
CBS closest really quickly and that gets picked over really quickly.

564
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:52.790
So if you're like,
okay,
I need to like get actual staples of life,

565
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.610
you have to drive out to eight mile.

566
00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:00.380
You mean sitting market doesn't have everything that you think?
Well,

567
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.640
it's also picked over quite quickly.
People know us very well.
Yeah,

568
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.830
they love my dogs.
Oh,
that's great.

569
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.750
Well.
Um,
I don't know if there's any other questions I would,

570
00:33:12.751 --> 00:33:16.250
I'd love to have Rebecca do is talk a little bit about what she brought for us

571
00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:21.080
today,
what you guys are going to enjoy.
And so we just changed the menu,

572
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.040
the dessert menu.
We,
Julian,
I love desserts.
So that's truly,

573
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:29.440
it's my sous chef in the back.
Um,
so we brought you what,
um,

574
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.960
our latest dessert that we put on the menu.
It is a sour cream,

575
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:35.060
old fashioned donut with dried cranberries,

576
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.290
pumpkin cheesecake and apple butter.
Wow.

577
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.710
And we brought some of the snacks that go out on the skip cart,

578
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:47.550
which is some spiced pecans with milk and dark chocolate world bend around it.

579
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:53.080
Are there any local companies or farms in this that go into this rest or recipes

580
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:56.040
that you brought today that you can hype up or tell us about?

581
00:33:56.041 --> 00:33:58.640
So seedling farm has been,
um,

582
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.550
a form that I use in Chicago quite a bit.

583
00:34:01.551 --> 00:34:05.840
And Pete was a tech guy that bought this farm from,

584
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.300
that has been around for over a hundred years.
But the,

585
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:11.660
I think the gentleman that owned it,
his family didn't want to keep it in the,

586
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.140
in like,
oh no,
I think he had anybody to um,
leave it to.

587
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:19.880
So Pete bought it and they live in Chicago and they drive all the way up to

588
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:24.650
grand haven every weekend to make sure that this farm continues to run.
And um,

589
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.960
wow.
It has heirloom pairs and like six different birds,
like no,

590
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.630
like 15 different varieties of apples.
Um,
ground cherries,
cherries,

591
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.570
figs,
he has all sorts of fun stuff.

592
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:38.200
So we get all of our apples from those guys and they ship them,

593
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.450
they truck them in from across the state.
That's cool.
Um,

594
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.300
we also buy from,
um,

595
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:51.130
I think it's cocoa Detroit and it is a company that goes around and helps little

596
00:34:52.971 --> 00:34:55.430
farmers get their product to restaurants.

597
00:34:55.730 --> 00:35:00.730
So we have one place to order from and they make sure that we get to use some

598
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:04.580
really awesome things.
And like some of these guys only grow one or two things,

599
00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:08.950
but they go like,
this guy grows amazing beats or he has,
um,

600
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.790
really awesome Zucchini.

601
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:14.300
So we'll buy the flowers and all that stuff and it will come from,

602
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:18.280
from one person.
The guy's name is [inaudible].
It's really fun.
Yeah.

603
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.150
It's interesting because Chicago's not too far away so you can kind of share and

604
00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:25.050
stay with the same farm seedling.

605
00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:27.620
Sounds like maybe one of the ones that you did that with.

606
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.000
And what was annoying when we moved here as a lot of those farmers on the west

607
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.100
end of Michigan,

608
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.520
it's so much easier to go to Chicago that yeah,

609
00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.160
there are lines that we'd have to drive to Detroit.
I'm like,
well Kenya,

610
00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:45.570
you're in Michigan,
right?
Which is working out really awesome like they are,

611
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.060
which is great.
And has there been any,

612
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:53.150
any like a Michigan staple or products that's changed the way that you cook

613
00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:57.270
because you were so surprised by the had all the cherries are the apples or

614
00:35:57.271 --> 00:36:00.930
something.
I didn't realize that Michigan had nuts.
Oh,

615
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.770
so in southern Michigan there's like quite a few pecans and stuff,

616
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:08.980
which my dad did not farmer,
so that was like awesome.
Right.
Um,

617
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:13.650
but not really.
I mean growing up,
having a ton of stuff at my disposal,

618
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:16.050
I was super,
I'm always like super excited about cheese,

619
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:20.700
so I'm always finding local,
small artisanal cheese people.

620
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.490
There's a million good ones,
you know,
and I love it.

621
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.520
One of the local farm people like goes around and picks up cheese from all those

622
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:32.250
places.
So I'm like,
I'll,
I'll be on a two week waiting list.
I don't care.

623
00:36:32.251 --> 00:36:36.690
I just want like one or two of those things that are available.

624
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.570
It's share with us who is the best artisanal cheese?

625
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.460
I can't remember the name of this farm.

626
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.500
They're right outside of Ann Arbor and they literally have like 20 goats.
Wow.

627
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.240
Less to figure that one.
Yeah,
we'll find out.
I'll figure it out.
Yeah.

628
00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.560
But I was super excited to get their stuff,
but yeah.

629
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.140
Or I ordered it in there like it's a two week preorder and I was like,
dammit.

630
00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.300
Yeah.
Good cheeses worth the wait for sure.
Absolutely.

631
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.790
Well thank you so much,
Rebecca.
Can we get a big round of applause.
