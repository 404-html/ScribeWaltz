00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.350
Good morning.
Today we have with us,
Martha Stewart

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.620
and Martha's doubts are really impressive and we think a lot about stats and

3
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:16.770
data here at Google,
but these are pretty amazing.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.880
37 million readers,
users,
viewers and listeners.

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.540
Each month she inspires them to celebrate art and their everyday living through

6
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:28.890
cooking,
entertaining,
gardening,
decorating,
crafting,
organizing,

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.280
their holidays,
weddings,
pets,
their entire lifestyle.

8
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.340
And today we're here to look at her most personal book,

9
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.930
yet she literally invites readers into her home for a year's worth of

10
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:43.110
celebrations across all times of day and all seasons.

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
This book is a return to her first book,
entertaining,

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.260
which actually established worth as a household name or than 30 years ago.

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.890
And this is her 75th buck.

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.270
And I thought I heard that I'm Jay Leno and I thought it was a joke,

15
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.580
but it's actually her 75th buck,

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.010
1800 recipes each year in her magazines,
properties and Martha Stewart show.

17
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.310
And she's also won 18 Emmy's and approximate to our industry.

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.030
She's also won the Webby for the best lifestyle website.

19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.070
Please welcome Martha Stewart.

20
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.093
<v 1>Hi everybody.</v>

21
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.600
<v 0>Oh,
we are so delighted to have you</v>

22
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.830
<v 2>here.
I just tweeted,</v>

23
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.070
<v 0>we're so excited to have you heard that you can see the Googlers are all just so</v>

24
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:50.330
excited that you've made the shrimp.
Very happy to see us here in mountain view.

25
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.520
And I'm going to ask you a few questions.
We have questions from the Stroller,

26
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.190
but we'll have questions from the audience later.

27
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.500
We've also been collecting questions ahead of time.

28
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:01.760
And actually the first one was a bit of a joke from Ted [inaudible].

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.430
He asked,
do you have any suggestions for decorating Charlie's cafe,

30
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.283
which is the room.

31
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.920
<v 2>The flowers are very fancy for Charlie's cafe.</v>

32
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.340
Well thank they are succulents and orchids and roses.

33
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.740
Very beautiful.
Um,
no,
you can't decorate a place like this.

34
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.380
Yeah,
it's all,
it's already,

35
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.440
it's already the place and it's so exciting to be here.
I'm really happy to

36
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.110
<v 0>functional space.
I'm not a very decorated space.
Um,</v>

37
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.590
but all I wanted was to go ahead and start off with is where you started because

38
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.620
I think that what a lot of people don't know.
Uh,
and I was surprised.

39
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.940
I got to visit your office and your studio last year is that you actually

40
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:49.970
started off as a model.
I do.
World renowned model.

41
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.320
We actually had this beautiful photo of Martha when she was,

42
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.390
and of course we also have the Google image search and you type in Martha
Stewart

43
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.233
<v 3>model.</v>

44
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.130
And where does that waste go?
John Dunning.
Just,

45
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.680
just,
just stunningly,
stunningly beautiful.

46
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:16.000
And I guess I would love to hear the story of how you went from a model to

47
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.650
becoming a do it yourself icon and you,
well,

48
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.860
before I was a model I was actually a student,
uh,

49
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.100
and um,
during high school in order one of six kids,

50
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.360
my father was a pharmaceutical salesman and my mother was a teacher,

51
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.500
a sixth grade teacher,

52
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.760
and there was no extra money to go to college.

53
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.750
There was no extra money to buy beautiful clothes.
And I love beautiful clothes.

54
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.410
My mother,
who was a,
who was quite well dressed,
but she made everything.

55
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.580
So we learned how to sew.
Either had to do all those homely things at home.
But,

56
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:49.000
um,

57
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
so I started modeling when I was 13 and a to pay for extras like college and,

58
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.710
uh,
and it was,
uh,
it was very successful because,
uh,
in those days,

59
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:04.660
college was only $3,500 a year,
including room and board.

60
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.670
And that's very cheap compared to what it is now.
55,000,
75,000,
whatever.
Um,

61
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.090
and so I,
um,
so I did commercials,
television commercials,

62
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:18.091
and I did a print print ads and print editorial and it was a lot of fun and it

63
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:23.770
paid $50 an hour at that time,
which was a lot of money.
And,
uh,

64
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.401
and I,

65
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.401
and my commercials appeared on things like Gunsmoke and a Wyatt Earp and uh,

66
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:34.210
and different.
So it was,
it was a very,
very good way to earn money.

67
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:36.070
So it wasn't really an older,

68
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:39.960
in college I went to Barnard College at Columbia University and that time too,

69
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:40.794
I was modeling.

70
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.230
And then how did you make the transition from model to,
you know,

71
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.050
to whatever your own Tammy or,
well,
really I do it yourself.

72
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.550
Well after college and during college I was a,
my,
my,

73
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.780
my father in law happened to be a stockbroker.

74
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.950
He added a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and I got interested in
investing.

75
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.210
Um,
it was,
uh,
it's interesting then really as it is now,

76
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:07.030
although the money wasn't as great.
Um,

77
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.340
but you could if you invested in Mcdonald's for example,
in the early days,
um,

78
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.070
it was,
uh,

79
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.390
that was one of the most successful investments or in a thing like it was called

80
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:20.740
Leasco data processing.
Very good investment if you bought warrants,
um,

81
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.960
on warrants.
Um,

82
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.560
and you invested kind of crazily like my little firm that I belonged to.

83
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.240
I became a stockbroker,
um,

84
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.170
right after college because I thought that that would be an interesting way to

85
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:33.310
learn about business.

86
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.230
And it was because I learned about how a good company or even a bad company,

87
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.620
a function.
But this is before big time to ecology.
And,
uh,

88
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.350
I gave up the stock market after about an eight year career,
which was,
uh,

89
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.920
which I loved very much and I started a catering business.

90
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.850
The catering is what led me into the lifestyle business.
And the writing,

91
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.530
my first book in 1982

92
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.190
<v 0>as well,
Martha Stewart Living,
I'm the media,
I get started.</v>

93
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.900
<v 3>Oh well I wanted to a,
I had so many ideas for lifestyle.
Uh,</v>

94
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.910
and I realized that there were voids in the media world.

95
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.030
There was no one book,
for example,

96
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.060
like entertaining that would teach you a really the basic basic tenants of good

97
00:06:22.411 --> 00:06:26.280
home entertaining.
Uh,
there was no great garden book.

98
00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:30.630
There was no great.
Uh,
and these are illustrated books.
I loved photography.

99
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:35.210
I loved a colored photography especially.
And,
uh,
so I,

100
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.600
I went to my publisher and I said,

101
00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:40.020
I'd like to do a whole series of beautiful how to books,
uh,

102
00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:44.770
so people could really learn how to do everything.
Uh,
and they said,
Nah,

103
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.000
it's all right,
but you know,
you just keep writing your book a year.

104
00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:52.580
And I was writing a book a year.
And so then I went to sign new house,
uh,

105
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.860
who is the head of Conde Nast publishing.

106
00:06:55.861 --> 00:07:00.540
And I told him my idea and he said,
well,
that sounds like a magazine.
And a,

107
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.320
so I gave him a proposal for a magazine and um,
and then it went,

108
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:08.740
it went on from there.
So I started Martha Stewart Living,
uh,
the magazine,
uh,

109
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.680
with,
not with Connie Nas,
but with Time Warner in 1990.

110
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.060
And from there,
everything else has,
uh,
has grown,
uh,

111
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.950
especially the idea of synergy between media,
television,
um,

112
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.880
bringing all the,
all kinds of media together.
Uh,

113
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.370
and then of course intranet and then a merchandising.

114
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.970
<v 0>You can stay the whole array of different magazine.
Yeah.</v>

115
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:34.250
Those are probably isn't even all of them.
Yeah,
that's,
yeah.

116
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:37.070
You're missing every day.
Food magazine format.

117
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.260
So what were the early days at Martha Stewart Living Life?

118
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.370
<v 3>Well,
it was so much fun.
We were,</v>

119
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.080
we considered ourselves a microcosm of a big media company,

120
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:52.650
Time Warner,
uh,
and we were very proud of being that microcosm.

121
00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:57.450
We were put on the most unfriendly floor in the time that in the Time Warner

122
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.770
Tower on sixth avenue below us.
Oh,

123
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.120
below us was all the mechanics of the building.
So my feet,

124
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.390
my feet were warm because it was a hot floor and probably an unhealthy floor.

125
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:12.650
I hated it.
The windows didn't open.
I will,

126
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.410
we run them like 50 something Florida and you wouldn't want your windows to open

127
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:20.910
up there.
Um,
so it was an unhealthy in that respect,

128
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.820
a no fresh air,
um,
hermetically sealed.

129
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.120
And ever since that little time I stayed in that office for about a year and a

130
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.950
half and I begged to move and we found a space that with windows that opened

131
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:37.740
with fresh air,
with natural gas for the stoves,
for our kitchens.

132
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.460
All that meant a lot with me.
Sunlight,
daylight.
It was important.

133
00:08:41.461 --> 00:08:44.430
It was very important.
And,
uh,
and ever since then we've,

134
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.320
and you've been to our office and uh,

135
00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:49.380
you know that we have sunlight and daylight much like you have out here,

136
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:50.310
only much smaller.

137
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.980
<v 0>Well,
you're here in Silicon Valley and it's the heart of innovation.
Uh,</v>

138
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.290
and you're one of the few people in the world who's actually defined in
industry.

139
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.520
So what words of advice do you have for young entrepreneurs?

140
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.800
So as to how they might try and do the,

141
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.160
do the same and a lot of people here who are entrepreneurs within Google and

142
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.760
trying to build new businesses and new categories themselves.
Well,
again,

143
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:12.470
it's finding okay

144
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.820
<v 3>void I think in,</v>

145
00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:17.540
in your area of interest and expertise,

146
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.720
finding that void that other people really also consider a void and building in

147
00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:25.670
that void,

148
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.670
something that is so original and so enticing and so a desirable that many other

149
00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:36.830
people will have to come there.
Uh,
I mean,
that's what Google is.

150
00:09:36.831 --> 00:09:40.550
I mean,
you had to come to Google.
I mean is there was no choice.

151
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.970
There was no other way.
Uh,
there were other companies,

152
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:47.880
but it was by far the most interesting place to go.
Uh,

153
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.890
I was an early adapter or adopter of technology and I bought my first computer.

154
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.310
It doesn't sound like very long ago,

155
00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:59.720
but 1982 I bought my first IBM computer a PC.

156
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.110
I still have it.
And uh,
does it,

157
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.290
<v 0>I haven't,
I haven't plugged it in.
I haven't even tried.
I haven't even tried,</v>

158
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:08.240
but I still have it.
That's silly looking.
Yeah,

159
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.700
<v 3>little thing.
Um,</v>

160
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.200
but it was so interesting what was going on and um,

161
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.800
and I've tried to keep up,
uh,
I know there's lots,
I don't know,

162
00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:22.400
but as much as as I can,
I keep up with the,
with the newest,
uh,

163
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.740
and um,

164
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.330
I watched with interest the new IPOs that are happening like the Groupon this

165
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.070
morning,
um,
and uh,

166
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.960
and testing the waters her for what else we are going to be distracted with and

167
00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:38.970
our quest for our own particular interests.
Right.
Yeah.

168
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.730
There's a lot of distracting stuff out there or is it really

169
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.980
<v 0>it's not,
it's interesting.
We're one a half a mile.</v>

170
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.560
I'm down the road from the Computer History Museum,

171
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.830
which always to me it seems like an oxymoron,
a short history,

172
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.920
but it's really amazing.
It's like it was more like a fragment.

173
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.640
So what are the three,

174
00:10:57.641 --> 00:11:01.420
if you had to name three really important lessons that you've learned throughout

175
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:04.320
evolving your business,
you've been so successful,
what are are,

176
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.040
are three of the most important lessons you will find it,
right?

177
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.540
<v 3>That finding that niche that interests you and will interest others.</v>

178
00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:16.400
That's one very,
very,
and a niche.
I,
a niche can be as big as the Grand Canyon,

179
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.030
you know,
it says not has to be,
it doesn't have to be a tiny,
tiny little space.

180
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:22.140
It can be a giant space.
Uh,

181
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:27.190
and then creating content or something to fill that cavern a or canyon with

182
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.280
something really valuable and will made,
uh,

183
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:37.970
and it can be pretty too,
like you're beautiful Google maps,
uh,

184
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.150
like your like and like so many things that,

185
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.160
that you find on the Internet that are,

186
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.180
that are appealing to the eye but understandable at the same time.

187
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.370
And then third,
just continue with it.
Uh,
and,
and don't forget to look elsewhere.

188
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.680
Don't forget,
look at what's coming up behind you,
what's coming in front of you.

189
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.620
Uh,
always keeping is as current as possible.

190
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.640
<v 0>Okay.
And you have so much variety in your business.
You know,</v>

191
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.480
there's cooking cause,
crafting,
there was organizing,
there's a Bunnings,
there's,

192
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.290
there's blogging,
there's tweeting,
there's the TV show,
there's the radio show.

193
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.050
How do you decide to go into a new area?

194
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:15.970
How do you decide to explore a new venture?

195
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.390
<v 3>We were,
we were very avid,
um,
um,</v>

196
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.630
explorers and all kinds of media in the first place.
Um,

197
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.070
we were also very avid in exploring a retail business,

198
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.390
merchandising businesses.
Um,
and we continue to be,
so,

199
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.630
although we now know that you cannot even as a,

200
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.130
as a corporation do every single thing that you want to do and,
uh,

201
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.220
and you must concentrate on those areas that are really the most profitable,

202
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:47.050
the most interesting,

203
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:50.290
the most had the most future have the most growth potential.

204
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.550
So that's what we're doing now is,
is figuring out with our company,

205
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:56.110
our small company,
uh,

206
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:59.590
what really we should be focusing on.

207
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.760
<v 0>Okay.
Well we have a little video I would like to add to show because one of the</v>

208
00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:08.000
things we've seen is that users are constantly googling you.

209
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.230
They're constantly googling you,
your crafts,
your ideas,
your recipes,

210
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.520
the products.

211
00:13:13.521 --> 00:13:18.521
And so you can just see there's a so much inspiration and you've given you,

212
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:24.010
you've gone to great lengths to make all of your content really accessible.

213
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.730
Um,
and,
uh,
I guess I'd like to start,

214
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.570
<v 2>did you,
have you made a Croak and Bush?
I have not,
unfortunately.</v>

215
00:13:32.571 --> 00:13:35.760
I can't really cook,
but my husband is a fabulous guy.

216
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.950
<v 0>So,
um,
do you embroider a I do embroider.
I do.</v>

217
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.120
I do like especially I'm going to say constant.

218
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.120
I do like I do like to sound and I like,
I like to do crafts with LEDs,
but,

219
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:54.050
um,
so I like to do like light displays and things,
but you know,

220
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.900
people are just obviously been so inspired by what you've done.

221
00:13:56.901 --> 00:14:00.620
And part of it is that you've made so much of what you do really accessible to

222
00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:03.170
them through the internet.
And so I thought I would talk,
I would,

223
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.760
I like you to talk a little bit about how the Internet has changed your

224
00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:10.100
business.
How has made you more accessible to use her?

225
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.210
<v 3>Well,
it's changed it tremendously.
And,
um,</v>

226
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.480
and we want to be where our customers need and want us.

227
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.370
And more and more of our customers really do want us on the intranet.

228
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.860
As the population of a tablet owners grows.
Uh,

229
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.660
we were,
um,
very aware of that and we wanted to be there with,
uh,

230
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.490
the best apps possible.

231
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.670
I wish we had a picture of the APP that Martha Stewart living a half that we

232
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:37.504
should have put up.

233
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.450
<v 2>Sorry.
Um,
but,
uh,
but if you,</v>

234
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:46.390
if you have a chance to look at it,
I,
I suggest you look at it.
Oh,

235
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:50.380
the first issue of Martha Stewart living that went up was a specially prepared

236
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:52.490
issue,
uh,
for the IPAD

237
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.480
<v 3>and uh,
but it is so amazing,
uh,</v>

238
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.690
how you can transform a print magazine into something alive and vibrant,

239
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.330
more vibrant than the real,
then the real printed magazine.
Uh,
and uh,

240
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.850
and now every month we prepare,

241
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.600
we prepare a tablet versions of our magazines,

242
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:18.400
a two of them everyday food and Martha Stewart living.
Um,
and the,
uh,

243
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.680
the people who work,
the editors who work on these,
um,

244
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.590
these apps are very happy working on them.

245
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.230
They love creating the imagery,

246
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.350
which is a little different from print photographs,

247
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.260
but the photographers love it.
The editors love it.

248
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:38.090
The writers love it and the users love it.
They love looking at it.
So,
um,

249
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.950
so we're,
we're doing that.
We have a couple of fantastic apps,
a cookie app,

250
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.870
a cupcake App,
uh,
which,
uh,
a drinks app,
that's a really good one.
If you're,

251
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.720
when you get home from work on the,
on a Friday night,

252
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.910
that's a good one to go to for some inspiration.

253
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:59.270
And so,
so we're doing that.
We're working very hard to get across.

254
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:01.790
I do a daily blog which reaches,
oh,

255
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.170
on an average maybe a five or 600,000 page views a day,
which,

256
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:11.030
which for a blog and one of 12 blogs in our company's pretty good.
Um,

257
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.730
and,
but people get to know you,

258
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:18.140
they get to understand the value of what you're trying to set forth.
Uh,

259
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.690
um,
and,
uh,
and I like that.
It's a personal,

260
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.440
my and my blog is a pretty personal blog.
Uh,

261
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.150
lots of views of snow storms and tragedies and Oh,
they,
the tragedies,
the,
the,
um,

262
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.090
broken trees that those,
those get the most page views,
the death of a dog.

263
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.510
Oh my gosh.
Um,
you know,
it's,
it's sad,
but that's what happens.

264
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:40.280
They people like that they want to commiserate.
Um,
but the,
but that's um,

265
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:44.960
so,
and,
and we are a really using as much and the,
the,

266
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.290
even this little device,

267
00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:50.980
the nook a where you just send a pdf of a magazine,
uh,

268
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.950
to the nook.
Uh,
the economics are very favorable.
Um,

269
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.960
and I wonder how would it do,

270
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.390
well actually the books are selling well and the subscriptions,
uh,

271
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.730
via the nooks selling well and so we have to figure it out.
Um,

272
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.050
advertisers haven't figured it out yet.
A publishers haven't figured it out yet.

273
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.970
Maybe Google has answers for me today about what's going to happen here,

274
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.110
but it is,

275
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.820
we're in a very important stage of transition right now with,
uh,

276
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.230
with media especially,

277
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.280
where are you going to access your information regularly?

278
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.390
Is it going to be in that beautiful magazine that you can open and page through

279
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.990
or is it going to be on your tablet?
We don't know for sure yet,

280
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.450
but I can see sort of where it's going

281
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.530
<v 0>all.
We have some very exciting demos to show you later today.
But yes,</v>

282
00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:41.800
I think we're all really excited about tablets,
particularly android tablets.

283
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.890
And I said yes,
I don't say that point again.

284
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.010
Well we'll make sure we change that today.

285
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.390
We can hook you up with an android tablet.

286
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:57.120
<v 3>I had,
I had one in Italian,
doesn't do so well.
Um,
but um,</v>

287
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.371
no,

288
00:17:57.371 --> 00:18:02.170
but yesterday I was talking to one of my publishers who's traveling with me on

289
00:18:02.171 --> 00:18:05.080
this book tour and she and I saying,
you know,

290
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.160
I have all my books in one place now I don't have to have a suitcase just to

291
00:18:11.201 --> 00:18:12.600
carry the books that I'm reading it.

292
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.540
And I used to read a one book from cover to cover and I wouldn't pick up another

293
00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:21.160
book Nerissa I until I finished that book and I knew I was finished with it.

294
00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:24.910
But now with the tablet,
uh,
you can just,

295
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.080
you can put in any number of hundreds and hundreds of books and just pick up

296
00:18:29.081 --> 00:18:33.430
where you left off on any number of books.
And it's a very,
it's confusing.

297
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.110
<v 0>It is confusing and it's convenient.
It's very convenient,</v>

298
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.130
but it is confusing and it is nice to actually be able to jump around between

299
00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:45.280
the box.
So,
so I'll be on the blog.

300
00:18:45.281 --> 00:18:48.070
One of the interesting things you've done is you've created Martha's circle,

301
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:52.180
which is actually a community of bloggers and interact with you.

302
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.640
Can you tell us a little bit more about that?
What inspired you?

303
00:18:54.641 --> 00:18:57.370
What are some of the interesting things and then happened in Martha Circle?
Well,

304
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.313
we liked,
yeah,

305
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.101
<v 3>other bloggers.</v>

306
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:03.570
We've done programs on our television show of just an audience full of bloggers

307
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.100
and uh,
and they,
we let them blog all during the show.
Uh,

308
00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:11.600
and it's a lot of fun but,
but blogging is kind of a,
um,

309
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.650
wonderful way to communicate with a vast audience and,

310
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.730
uh,
and to get a vast,
a number of opinions about something.

311
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.950
And it's so much fun to see who's doing really well in the blogosphere who isn't

312
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.830
a,
we tried to put in our circle,
um,

313
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.600
bloggers who are actually sort of in tune with what we're doing.

314
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.900
Uh,
maybe even more avant garde or less,
um,
you know,
just,

315
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.680
just to bring a community together,
a bigger community.

316
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.810
<v 0>That's great.
Well,
let's talk a little bit about the television show.
Uh,</v>

317
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.650
over the years I think you've had,
everybody has it.

318
00:19:47.651 --> 00:19:51.370
You get these amazing celebrities and you're getting them all to do to do crafts

319
00:19:51.371 --> 00:19:55.270
and teach them cooking and everything else.
Who had been the most entertaining?

320
00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:57.820
Do you have some favorite class?
The last week I had,
yeah,

321
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:03.070
<v 3>I had Hugh Jackman on and I had just seen his new movie,
real steel.
Which uh,</v>

322
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.660
well it depends if you like,
robots are not

323
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.680
live robots go see it because it's quite extraordinary these boxing robots who

324
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.210
smash each other to death.
Um,
but,

325
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.890
but luckily I had seen it and he is charming,

326
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.750
absolutely charming and,

327
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.140
and very self effacing and a very talented man.

328
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:29.410
He happens to live across the street and his windows are in direct view of my

329
00:20:29.601 --> 00:20:33.770
daughter's apartment,
so we can sort of watch him and say we wave to each other,

330
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.910
uh,
when he's in there.
So I knew everything he was doing in his apartment.

331
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.950
And he knows everything.
That dinner party,
that was fun,
but he's,

332
00:20:41.951 --> 00:20:46.110
he's a great guy.
Um,
and that is the guests like that who are very,
um,

333
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:51.190
sort of and get into the,
get into the segment that we're trying to do.

334
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.960
Some actors really are actors and they don't,
unless they have a script and a,

335
00:20:55.961 --> 00:21:00.170
and a and a director,
they really can't do anything.
Right.
Wow.

336
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.140
They even admit,
one actor said to me,
I said,
I said,
gosh,

337
00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:08.280
that scene and if the cherry orchard,
it's a checkoff fight.
I said,
Gosh,

338
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.020
you talk about cherry trees.
Like so knowledgeable.
He's,
I don't know,

339
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.800
fuck about it.
Cherry tree
checkoff wrote the words,

340
00:21:16.801 --> 00:21:19.990
I just act,
um,
you know,
and it's fun.

341
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.690
<v 0>Is there a biggest or funniest mishap this happened on the TV show?</v>

342
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.470
<v 3>Um,
oh,
mishaps happen all the time.</v>

343
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:33.520
And the more and more ms that and with comedians especially because they make

344
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:38.440
mishaps happen and we had one guy,
uh Oh,

345
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.020
we had,
um,
wonder,
we have,
um,
um,
now I'm going to forget all my comedians,

346
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:47.550
nasal ones I love the most,
but Seth Meyers for example,
uh,

347
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.530
Seth always makes something right.
Bad Habit.

348
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.340
And Conan is very funny.
And Jimmy Fallon,
Jimmy Fallon,
I made him on a,

349
00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:00.180
on a Halloween special.
I made him put his hand in,
you know,
in a secret box,

350
00:22:00.181 --> 00:22:03.210
you'll have to stick your hands through a membrane.
And,
and uh,
I said,

351
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:07.590
what does it,
what do you feel?
He says,
Eh,
it feels awful.
And then I uncovered it.

352
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.120
It was full of mealy worms.

353
00:22:09.121 --> 00:22:13.470
Live mealy worms never forgiven me.
He's trying,

354
00:22:13.471 --> 00:22:14.500
he's trying to get that.

355
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:21.390
<v 0>So let's talk a little bit about the book.
So the first book I have here is,</v>

356
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.850
and this was entertaining.
Yeah.
What was your first book?
Very first,

357
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:29.380
huge best seller inspired,
I guess all in the books that came after it.

358
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.190
And now your new book is a revisiting it.
Yes.
One.

359
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:37.920
<v 3>This one weighs a lot more.
This is like six and a half pounds.
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

360
00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:41.180
It's not a sequel.
It's not because it's quite different print actually.

361
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.340
And the first one was,
um,

362
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.490
was a textbook on how to entertain a picture book with beautiful visuals and a

363
00:22:49.491 --> 00:22:53.120
recipe book.
And this book is really more,
I think,
more cohesive.

364
00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:57.500
And the first book had a lot of parties that I was catering at the time.
Uh,

365
00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:02.210
and this one is really all personal parties.
And I also had,

366
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.560
um,
Betsy Hawes.

367
00:23:03.561 --> 00:23:07.730
Elizabeth has helped me write that first book and I didn't know how to write a

368
00:23:07.731 --> 00:23:08.001
book.

369
00:23:08.001 --> 00:23:12.170
I had never written a book when I wrote that in 1982 and she was such a good

370
00:23:12.171 --> 00:23:13.060
teacher.
Uh,

371
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.610
and that's another thing that anybody contemplating writing or creating

372
00:23:16.611 --> 00:23:19.400
something like that is if you don't know how to do it,

373
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.760
find somebody who does know how to do it and can kind of teach you the method.

374
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.360
Uh,
that's why we go to school.
I mean,
and I,
but I hadn't taken a writing course,

375
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.160
so I found my voice doing that book.
And I was so happy that I did.
And this one,

376
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.420
I wrote every single word and a I write final text if I can,

377
00:23:38.421 --> 00:23:43.190
I think about it a lot.
And we took the pictures for four years.
So,
um,

378
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.220
during that time I sort of what I was gonna say and then I sat down last

379
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.700
Christmas and took until I finished and on my third floor craft room and wrote

380
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:57.290
away.
So there it is.
And so how did you decide what to include in the book?

381
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.320
Well,
we took pictures.
Well,
we,
we um,

382
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.210
created a whole bunch of fabulous parties,
invited real people,
uh,

383
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:10.211
friends and family and guests and colleagues and photograph them and then a

384
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.620
design the book and then a row the recipes,
and then wrote the book.

385
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.490
It was,
there was a lot left on the,
on the kitchen floor.

386
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.540
Those are those stories I hope will maybe make the next book.

387
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.500
<v 0>Is there one celebration in there that just stands out in your mind,</v>

388
00:24:26.501 --> 00:24:27.340
is your absolute favorite?

389
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.920
<v 3>Uh,
well,
I'd like Easter a lot with Easter bunnies.
There's,</v>

390
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.340
there's a really great picture in here of,
um,

391
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.300
my veterinarians daughters who came for Easter.
Did you see the one with the,

392
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.470
with the little girl looking at the giant chocolate rabbit?
Yeah.

393
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.390
<v 0>Wow.
That is a really big,
bad is a great,</v>

394
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.600
<v 3>she's uh,
she's smaller than the chocolate rabbit,
but that,
those are fun.</v>

395
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.190
Those are fun and memorable events.

396
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.200
<v 0>Well one of the things is,
you know,
you do a lot with the holidays.</v>

397
00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:00.180
How do you make the holidays fresh year after year?
How do you reinvent them and,

398
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.950
and it can keep them excited.

399
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.490
<v 3>Doing my proposal for the magazine was Time Warner.
I remember meeting with,</v>

400
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.530
you know,
the,
the big honchos and I told him,

401
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.720
I showed them the prototype for a July issue in July of course,

402
00:25:12.721 --> 00:25:15.960
includes July 4th.
And they said,
well this is all great,

403
00:25:15.961 --> 00:25:18.240
but what the heck are you going to June next year?

404
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.550
Cause they thought it was finished.
And I said,

405
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:25.140
I think we could probably not repeat ourselves for 20 or 30 years with all the

406
00:25:25.141 --> 00:25:28.320
ideas.
It's about having creative teams,

407
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.970
about making a new,
uh,
making up new ideas.

408
00:25:32.971 --> 00:25:35.970
Making up new ways to celebrate traditional things.

409
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.590
And that's what we do all the time.

410
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.090
<v 0>That's cool.
So Thanksgiving's right around the corner.</v>

411
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.530
What are your plans this year?

412
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.960
<v 3>Oh,
family thanksgiving.</v>

413
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:48.130
I think we're going to have it in New York City and with some friends and uh,

414
00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:52.990
there's a new grandchild,
Jude,
and we're going to have her sitting at the table,

415
00:25:52.991 --> 00:25:57.991
hopefully ab eating her first piece of Turkey if her vegan mother allows it.

416
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.720
<v 0>I just want to ask you what your funniest Thanksgiving experience might be,</v>

417
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.180
but that might be the worst.
Worst one

418
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.530
<v 3>was the first I ever had and I was 19 years old.
Oh,</v>

419
00:26:11.531 --> 00:26:15.180
right after I got married.
Now I must be 20 cause I got married when I was 19.

420
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.790
Then with my first Thanksgiving I was 20,
so I was 20 years old.
I,

421
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.230
I fought large even then.
And I was living in new haven.

422
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.500
My husband was at Yale law school and I was commuting backwards to New York to

423
00:26:28.631 --> 00:26:29.530
go to college.

424
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.330
And I invited his whole family and my whole family up to our little cottage in

425
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:38.080
the woods in Guilford,
Connecticut,
where we lived on the other side of new haven.

426
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:42.970
It's stupid,
stupid,
stupid life.
Um,
and uh,
and I,
uh,

427
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.830
down the end of the road is a Turkey farm.
God sees Turkey farm.

428
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.460
And I went there on set on Wednesday to buy my Turkey.

429
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.110
They were all packing up and he said,
well,

430
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.350
it's lucky it came in today because we're taking off her Florida tomorrow.

431
00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.150
The farmers and I bought up like 35 pound Turkey and uh,

432
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.880
made the stuffing,
got an already the night before,

433
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.180
set the alarm for 3:00 AM so that the Turkey,
it was 35 pounds,
you know,

434
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.550
I'm turning to minutes a pound.
It takes a long time.
Uh,

435
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.240
would be ready when the guests got there.
And,
uh,

436
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:15.020
which was about two and a half hours from New York.
Um,

437
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.670
and I fell back to sleep in a dead sleep.

438
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:22.671
I was exhausted and I had asked my husband to preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

439
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.890
He had just put it on broil.

440
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.150
So we woke up to a house full of black smoke.

441
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.630
The Turkey was totally charred on the outside and this was at 7:00 AM and I

442
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:39.760
started to cry and I got in the car,
jumped in the car.

443
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.980
My husband thought I was leaving him.

444
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.570
<v 2>I should have been,
it would have been better.
Better.
No,</v>

445
00:27:47.571 --> 00:27:52.070
I'm just kidding.
Um,
but I drove down to the Turkey farm at the end of the,

446
00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:55.790
it was really virtually at the end of the road and they had one Turkey semi

447
00:27:55.791 --> 00:27:56.624
frozen.

448
00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.950
<v 3>It's still there that they hadn't sold.
I grabbed it,</v>

449
00:27:59.951 --> 00:28:04.150
took it back home to the stuffing out of the older Turkey and put it in and put

450
00:28:04.151 --> 00:28:09.040
it back in the m and Thanksgiving dinner was about five hours late.
But they,
the,

451
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:13.440
the,
the relatives,
they,
they went along with it and that black and Turkey.

452
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.820
Now there are recipes for black and Turkey.

453
00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.080
<v 2>Well,
story,
sorry.</v>

454
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.670
<v 0>Well,
we've been collecting questions from Googlers and bomb fall or one of our</v>

455
00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:29.150
Googlers wants to ask,
when entertaining,
what is more important?

456
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.950
Food or presentation?
Food.
And what is your favorite holiday food?

457
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:39.160
<v 3>My favorite holiday food,
um,
for Christmas eggnog.</v>

458
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.343
Okay.

459
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.510
<v 0>And did you have a least favorite dish to cook?</v>

460
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.400
Is there something that you really don't like to cook?

461
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.190
<v 3>Well,
if I don't like to cook it,
I don't cook it.
So I mean that you,</v>

462
00:28:51.191 --> 00:28:52.050
you have your choice.

463
00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.200
[inaudible] nobody's forcing you in your own kitchen to cook something.

464
00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.270
<v 0>Uh,
we recently acquired as a Gat,
uh,
and it was,
it God is all about restaurants.</v>

465
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.570
Do you have favorite restaurants in the world of favorite restaurant in New
York?

466
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.450
Oh,
favorite restaurant.
And we'll just go

467
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.161
<v 3>in New York.</v>

468
00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:12.960
One of my favorite restaurants just because of the ambiance is wonderful.
The,
um,

469
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.730
the look of the restaurant is x is so exquisite and the food is really,

470
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:22.060
really good.
It's a Japanese restaurant called n,
e.
N.
Brasserie.
Uh,

471
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:26.880
the young couple who owns it is a cheese from Tokyo and it's superb food.

472
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.690
So I go there a lot.
Uh,
it's congenial and very,

473
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:35.190
very nice and it stays open late.
And um,
I liked that one a lot.

474
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:36.840
But then I like all the great chefs too.

475
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.920
<v 0>Sure.
Let's change gears to technology.
When did you,</v>

476
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.430
the web was going to be this incredible catalyst for your media empire?
Well,

477
00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.220
is there a moment you can pin point where you're like,
wow,

478
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:49.380
this is the thing is really,

479
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.700
<v 3>um,
well pretty,
really see I've,</v>

480
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.340
about when we started with our,
with our business on the intranet,

481
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.120
it was immediately a very attractive,

482
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.790
very enticing and very important.

483
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.400
So I would say maybe 10 years ago.

484
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.700
<v 0>Okay.
Another question from a Gugler Eugenia Vas goes,
asks,</v>

485
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.490
you're quite active on Twitter,
which here's on your right out here.

486
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.250
I just started to follow your boards on Pinterest,

487
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.140
which is a new startup out here that's getting a lot of buzz right now.
Uh,

488
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.590
I'm very impressed that you're actually already on Pinterest.
Oh,

489
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.470
it's getting like they won.
Um,

490
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.260
I find it repetitive.
Oh really?
Yeah.
I don't know why,
but I do.
Okay.

491
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:36.420
So how well it will hopefully the guys on Pinterest and we'll try and make it

492
00:30:36.421 --> 00:30:38.050
less than that.
Less repetitive.
I love you.

493
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.700
How best you,

494
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.880
is there a particular way that you really like to engage with your fans online?

495
00:30:44.881 --> 00:30:48.430
Cause the penetrance bores Twitter.
Well,
Pinterest parties,

496
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.450
<v 3>visual.
I'm on Twitter.
I do both,
uh,
both,
uh,</v>

497
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:58.090
twit pigs as well as,
uh,
just tweets and that works very well.
I've two,

498
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.420
almost two and a half million followers who are pretty active.

499
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.370
I love to do instant surveys.
Uh,

500
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.580
so if I'm meeting with a new potential business partner,
uh,

501
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.820
and we did this not long ago with a retailer that I wanted to carry our cleaning

502
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:17.710
products,
I said,
I just tweeted while I was sitting with the CEO,
I,
I treated,

503
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:22.330
would you buy my cleaning products at such and such and such a retail outlet?

504
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:23.620
I got back,
oh,

505
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:28.621
several hundred tweets within three minutes saying exactly why there's that

506
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:33.010
story.
Doesn't,
uh,
isn't it near me?
I can't buy it there because I,

507
00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:34.630
it's too far away from my home or,

508
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.760
but instantaneous results.
I love it for that.

509
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.290
And I also love it for instant news because it really does keep you informed on

510
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:48.590
Facebook is a fantastic way for us to,
um,
to,
uh,

511
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.930
communicate and I just can't wait to really get into our Google.
Yeah.

512
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.070
<v 0>Plus it's Martha's on</v>

513
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.320
Martha [inaudible],
Virginia actually had a question when she said,

514
00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:05.510
we would really love to see you do a Google plus hangout.

515
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.560
You can actually do an hangout where you broadcast.
Yep.

516
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.410
All your fans let us say you do some demos and some crafts and cooking.

517
00:32:12.411 --> 00:32:16.580
We will do that.
Absolutely.
Uh,
and Judy Chang asks,

518
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.800
you publish your calendar online.

519
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.770
It's full of activities from your book tour and a TV appearances,

520
00:32:21.771 --> 00:32:24.200
mulching your garden,
polishing your silverware,

521
00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:28.580
how many people work on your household staff and how has your sleep each night?

522
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.460
Oh,
this,

523
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:34.600
<v 3>the sleeping sorta of like crazy.
Uh,
and it depends on where we are,</v>

524
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:37.770
what I'm thinking about and what I'm doing.
But in terms of households have,

525
00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:41.540
I have three houses,
uh,
they and they're all open all the time,

526
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:44.720
so I want to be able to their uses laboratory,

527
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:48.770
so I want to be able to go there and they're clean and dust free and ready for

528
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:51.370
pictures.
Um,
so,
um,

529
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.610
anywhere from two and a house to more depending on,

530
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.630
on what we really need to do.
It's a staffing is,
is,
um,

531
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.250
is always a challenge.
Uh,
and keeping a good staff.

532
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:07.550
My one of my housekeepers has been with me for 30 years.

533
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:10.820
One has been with me for 27 years,
uh,
there,

534
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.540
and they really know where everything is and I have a lot of stuff.
So

535
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:22.540
<v 0>how much of a role does search play in your day to day?
What do you search?</v>

536
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.520
<v 3>Oh,
uh,</v>

537
00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.360
it's a very important part of my day because I do a lot of writing and,

538
00:33:28.361 --> 00:33:31.220
um,
and I oftentimes have to,
uh,

539
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:36.000
find out something about something,
so I will use it for my research.

540
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:41.160
Um,
it's a much,
much quicker than going to the local library or to down the,

541
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.980
down the road from my house.
I can't do that.
And,
uh,
so it has,

542
00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:49.590
is a tremendously wonderful timesaver.
Uh,
but at that,
that's it.

543
00:33:49.591 --> 00:33:54.000
I use it for lots of other things to shopping,
of course,
a comparison,

544
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:58.260
shopping of course.
Um,
for,
uh,
the research for,

545
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.910
um,
uh,
information like maps,
uh,

546
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.870
very important to me to know where I'm going and how I'm getting there.
Uh,

547
00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:09.120
so I use it for a lot of things

548
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.740
<v 0>and we're working on more.
I know that actually when I met you in your studio,</v>

549
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:17.220
there was this amazing a ceramic bowl.
Uh,

550
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.520
it was just very organic wreckage,
urban bold,

551
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.710
determine ball and Martha said like,
okay,

552
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:24.230
when are you going to have a search technology that's going to help me figure

553
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:28.090
out where this goal came from and where I can get more of it we're working on.

554
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.880
We don't have visual search that quite that could mean if it doesn't have a bar

555
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:35.280
<v 3>code on it or it doesn't,
it's not a well known,
well known object,
uh,</v>

556
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.520
to be able to,
to photograph it and,
and,

557
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.240
and find it in somebody's catalog that is happening.

558
00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:43.310
I know it's happening more and more every single day.

559
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.460
<v 0>The day we have Google goggles which can recognize landmarks and products and</v>

560
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:48.650
have things like bar codes or text on them.
But we're,

561
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.690
we are working on that visual recognition.

562
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.480
I'm going to ask Martha one more question and then we'll go ahead and open up to

563
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:55.580
audience questions.
So if you want to move to the microphones,

564
00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:58.940
if you have a question,
we'll open it up in just a second.
Uh,

565
00:34:58.941 --> 00:35:01.580
but nice question is about youtube.
So we talked a little bit about search.

566
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.830
You're really active on Youtube,
lots of,

567
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.850
lots of amazing clips that can teach people how to do crafts and cooking.

568
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.920
How do you decide what goes on Youtube?

569
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.660
How do you know what your users really want to see?
Well,
okay,

570
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.040
<v 3>we're always experimenting and uh,</v>

571
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.270
and during holiday times they want to know how to do Turkey one oh one.

572
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.940
They want to know how to make your program boost.

573
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.550
They want to know how to fold a fitted sheet.

574
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:28.990
They want to know how to fold a tee shirt.
I mean,
it's,

575
00:35:28.991 --> 00:35:33.590
it's amazing how many different things people really need and want.

576
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.450
Uh,
and we try to keep up with that.

577
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.070
<v 0>That's cool.
Okay,
let's go ahead and,
and</v>

578
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.340
<v 3>go to the audience here.
Hi.
Hi.
Thanks for being here,
Martha.</v>

579
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:42.780
It's great to hear from you.
Thank you.

580
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.290
You've grown your business into a complete lifestyle empire,

581
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:47.880
but how do you keep challenging yourself?

582
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:51.640
What would you like to accomplish the next five to 10 years?
Well,

583
00:35:51.641 --> 00:35:55.630
in the next five to 10 years I would like to work with,
uh,
uh,

584
00:35:55.631 --> 00:35:56.900
some of the more,

585
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.090
more impressively progressive people that I've met.

586
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:05.950
I would like to develop on new ways of thinking about things.
Um,

587
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:10.570
I would like to build my store,
which I haven't built yet.
And uh,
so there's,

588
00:36:10.571 --> 00:36:15.270
there's a lot of things to do.
Great.
Thank you.
This is great.

589
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.640
This is definitely not as serious of a question.
It's sort of silly,

590
00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:22.070
but how do you fold a fitted sheet?

591
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

592
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:25.090
<v 3>Oh y'all,</v>

593
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.090
quarter by quarter by quarter your has in and there's a certain way which corner

594
00:36:29.091 --> 00:36:33.500
to take.
One,
two,
three,
four.
And it does fold quite nicely.
Not,

595
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.070
not perfectly,
but very nicely.
And it'll fit in your linen closet.

596
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.170
But my suggestion to all busy people do your laundry,
dry the sheet,

597
00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:43.100
put it back on the bed.

598
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.423
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

599
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.310
<v 2>Practical and men,
and not every three weeks,
by the way,</v>

600
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.370
I took a survey on Twitter and ask them how often do they change their bids?

601
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.660
I was horrified.
Horrified.

602
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.220
I mean really the average was two weeks.

603
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.530
<v 3>That's really bad.</v>

604
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

605
00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.970
<v 2>Well you have to worry about these people who are online all the time.</v>

606
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.590
They get all those surveys,
I guess.

607
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.490
<v 4>Yeah.
So you created so many recipes,
maybe thousands.</v>

608
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.330
How did you manage to stay sheet at the same time?
Stay what stat?

609
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.223
Heat.

610
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.340
<v 3>Physically fit.
Oh,
fit.
Oh my God.
Um,</v>

611
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.800
well it's hard because I eat a lot.
I have to taste a lot.

612
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.390
I'll get off a show and then they'll in the kitchen and my test kitchen,
a TV,

613
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.540
they'll have 44 different causal.

614
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:47.310
For me to taste of choose the best croissant,
it's really hard.
But uh,
uh,

615
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.260
and,
and it's,
it's interesting,

616
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:53.580
but it's also difficult and I exercise a lot.
I'm a,

617
00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:56.530
I'm not a maniac,
but I exercise a lot.
I eat really well,

618
00:37:56.531 --> 00:37:59.280
at least for my own organic garden.
I'm going to see your garden here.

619
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:03.030
I understand.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I want to see it.
I grow,

620
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:05.640
I grow up pretty much all my food.
Okay.

621
00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.293
<v 4>He's in,
uh,</v>

622
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.780
any natural limitations of number of recipes in the world?

623
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.720
<v 3>Uh,
I don't think so.
I think,
I think recipes are,
um,</v>

624
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.070
can be altered by a teaspoon of this or a tablespoon of that.

625
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:25.230
And I think,
uh,
we have created original recipes in our company.
Oh,

626
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.831
many,

627
00:38:25.831 --> 00:38:30.831
many thousands of recipes and they're in many of the 75 books that we've created

628
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:34.560
and all those magazines.
And we're,
um,
we have,

629
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:36.970
we have a good recipe search on our,
on our site.

630
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.970
<v 5>Good.
Thank you.
Let's go here.</v>

631
00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.910
<v 6>Thanks again for calling Martha.
This is awesome.
Um,</v>

632
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.480
so I'm curious what you're surrounded by a gourmet organic food and,

633
00:38:47.481 --> 00:38:51.080
and for everyone to sort of look to you as an example and all of this,

634
00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:54.500
are there times when you just want to close the door and splurge and eat like a

635
00:38:54.501 --> 00:38:55.360
TV dinner?
Okay.

636
00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:59.210
<v 1>MMM.</v>

637
00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:04.000
<v 3>I haven't found a TV dinner that is that enticing.
Yes.
Uh,</v>

638
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.431
and I,

639
00:39:04.431 --> 00:39:08.150
and I've tasted a lot just to see what's really out there and what people are

640
00:39:08.151 --> 00:39:11.780
putting in their children's stomachs.
And I,
it's pretty depressing.
Uh,

641
00:39:11.781 --> 00:39:14.930
we're working on food now and um,
and it's,

642
00:39:14.931 --> 00:39:19.640
it's very interesting to see who is doing good prepared foods for the

643
00:39:19.641 --> 00:39:24.620
marketplace,
a good ingredients for the marketplace.
I am a very,

644
00:39:24.621 --> 00:39:28.250
very staunch supporter of non factory farming.

645
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.940
I hate what's going on in,

646
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.430
in the factory farms in America and I cannot,

647
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.360
I cannot abide the,

648
00:39:36.361 --> 00:39:39.920
the cruelty to the animals that were being fed to the,
uh,

649
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.710
the way grains are being grown.
Uh,

650
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.970
all this gluten intolerance it's going on is a very serious problem.

651
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:51.860
And why,
why when I was growing up,
nobody was allergic to wheat.
I don't,

652
00:39:51.861 --> 00:39:53.780
I didn't know one person.
I didn't know.

653
00:39:53.781 --> 00:39:57.110
I didn't know one person with a peanut allergy.
I didn't know.

654
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.500
And I don't think it's the peanuts and I don't think it's the wheat.

655
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:05.120
I really think it's,
what's the processing?
I think it's the way it's being grown.

656
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.680
I think it's the way it's being sprayed,
a fertilized,
uh,
all of that.

657
00:40:09.681 --> 00:40:14.030
And we have to really,
really as a country pay attention to that.

658
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.733
Thanks.
Okay.

659
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.750
<v 1>It is true</v>

660
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.070
<v 3>allergies.
Yeah.
So one of the three of us two and then having gluten allergies.</v>

661
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:25.923
Yeah.

662
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.360
<v 5>Hello Martha.
Thank you for being here.</v>

663
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:33.700
I have actually a business related question.
As a leader of an organization,

664
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.120
how do you continue to have all of your staff meet the same level of excellence

665
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:44.170
and continue to innovate year over year in the areas of creative design,

666
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:47.230
et Cetera?
Well,
you tried to hire in the first place,

667
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:51.520
people who have the same DNA as you have a,

668
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:53.150
you want them to be interested,
interested

669
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:57.590
<v 3>in the core content areas of your particular kind of organization.</v>

670
00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.130
And we were very,
very,
very good at that.

671
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:06.320
As an organization grows on that can get away from you and you can be less

672
00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:11.321
choosy or less fussy or maybe there's not as many talented people in those

673
00:41:11.541 --> 00:41:15.380
specific areas as there used to be because there's more competition.

674
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.210
It's a V it's an ongoing challenging problem for any company.

675
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:24.520
And a,
you just have to have a very good HR department.
Uh,

676
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:27.850
and one who is looking at a good,
a good search department,
uh,

677
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:32.150
human resources to find the right people,
uh,
for your particular company.

678
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.010
You know,
sometimes I'll people and I say,
God,
what are they doing here?
You know,

679
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.380
not physically,
I don't mean physically,
but when I see what they create,

680
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:42.380
what the heck are they doing in this,
in this environment?

681
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:47.420
They just don't have it.
And you have to really be very,
very careful about that.

682
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.450
Hiring is something here.
I can go.
Let me take,
I know,
I know.

683
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.010
<v 0>Yeah.
Hi,
I'm,
he picked,
inspired me so much.
She created my own home.
I'm for you.</v>

684
00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:58.881
I discovered you.

685
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:02.870
I couldn't make potato and now I'm bringing pies to all the holiday of it.
Good.

686
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.950
It's awesome.
And I know you have a small corner on your website and in Europe,

687
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:08.510
magazines dedicated to kids,

688
00:42:08.511 --> 00:42:11.180
but I was wondering if you were really thinking about expanding that to get our

689
00:42:11.181 --> 00:42:12.230
kids to create more.

690
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.530
<v 3>Um,
we had a wonderful,
a baby magazine and a wonderful kids magazine,
uh,</v>

691
00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.350
about Oh eight or nine years ago.
Uh,

692
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.520
it was a fantastic publication of I want to bring that back.

693
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:30.600
And the reason that we stopped publishing it was advertised lack of advertising.

694
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.670
Uh,
there's not very many magazines devoted to the raising of children to the

695
00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.730
teaching of kids.
And I think the Internet is a,

696
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.670
is a more appropriate place actually for that intro,
for that information.
And uh,

697
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.270
we are working on plans to Rayanne live in or in live enliven that,
uh,

698
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.970
that area.
So a watch for it.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.070
<v 0>Hi.
Hi.</v>

700
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.070
Obviously you've had a very successful business career today and looking back

701
00:42:57.071 --> 00:43:01.190
over everything related to your company,
what is the one decision that you,

702
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.420
in retrospect,
you wouldn't have made knowing what you know now?

703
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:09.080
<v 3>Um,
well I had one horrible stumbling,</v>

704
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.700
which was a stock sale unrelated to the company,

705
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.540
unrelated to anything.
I was on a plane.
I mean I can go through the whole thing,

706
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:22.160
the whole litany of the,
of the disaster.
Um,
I would avoid disasters,

707
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:25.520
like legal problems like that forever

708
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.960
because that sets you back terribly and it could have destroyed my company,

709
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.010
but the customers never left.

710
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:42.260
I advertisers did take scope to the sidelines for a while.
It's,

711
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:43.300
it's,
it's,
and,

712
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:48.310
and rebuilding something that's beautiful and useful and good is a lot harder

713
00:43:50.031 --> 00:43:54.800
than building it.
So the rebuilding process is painful for me because I'm,
I,

714
00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.220
I like,
I never go the same route to the same place ever.
If I can,

715
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.010
if I can avoid it.
And you know,
if there's a straight line,

716
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:02.440
I will go circuitous leads.

717
00:44:02.441 --> 00:44:05.720
So I might see something new because my motto is see something,

718
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:07.240
learn something new every day.

719
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.960
So avoiding avoiding with the help of maybe,
um,

720
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.230
you know,
really the best advisors,
uh,

721
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:20.231
or something you just avoid if you can avoid a disaster and,

722
00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:24.890
uh,
and if,
if you fall into that,

723
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.810
into that Crevasse,
um,
get out of it in the,
in the fastest,
best,

724
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.320
cleanest way possible.

725
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.960
<v 1>Okay.
Thank you.
So,</v>

726
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.750
<v 0>and let's take two more questions.
Hi Martha.
It's good to have you at Google.</v>

727
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.380
Um,
so I don't actually quite enjoy cooking,

728
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:45.100
but I think it's because I don't know how to cook.
So my question is,

729
00:44:45.101 --> 00:44:49.180
how do you keep it fun in the kitchen?
What's your advice for someone like me?

730
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.290
Well,
I think

731
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:55.000
<v 3>you should take some great cooking lessons if you don't really know how to cook.</v>

732
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.880
And it's hard to teach yourself how to cook.

733
00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:03.310
I watched people and I like to sit like at a Sushi bar and I sat watching Nobu

734
00:45:05.831 --> 00:45:10.000
himself,
do Sushi for a long time,
eating there quite often.

735
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:14.260
And he finally let me cut Sushi with him and he gave me a Sushi chefs code,

736
00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.880
which I'm very proud of because very few people get a Nobu Sushi coat.

737
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:20.910
Um,
and uh,

738
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:25.780
so I watch and I learned by Nih and I learned by emulating the very,

739
00:45:25.781 --> 00:45:26.381
very best.

740
00:45:26.381 --> 00:45:30.850
I'm lucky at my job because I can invite any chef on my show and learn from him.

741
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:36.000
We had Thomas Keller on the other day,
the way he uses his hands and the way his,

742
00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.700
the precise nature of his cooking is so,

743
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:44.890
so interesting.
Uh,
and so you should,
if you're interested in eating,

744
00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.970
you should be interested in how that food is made and then it might induce you

745
00:45:48.971 --> 00:45:49.804
to learn.

746
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.920
<v 1>Thank you.
Yep.</v>

747
00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.390
<v 5>Hi Martha.
Thank you for being here.
I have one question.
Um,
you're very,</v>

748
00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.990
you're very successful.
I would like to ask you,

749
00:45:59.991 --> 00:46:01.970
I'm sure you had some difficult times.

750
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.780
How did you put yourself together again and those difficult times?

751
00:46:05.781 --> 00:46:08.420
It just kept on going.
Well,
I'm very strong.

752
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.810
<v 3>I have good,
good,
a solid family.
Genes behind me have longevity and,</v>

753
00:46:13.811 --> 00:46:15.770
and strange and um,

754
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.430
and when you know that you are okay,

755
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.710
you're okay after of just keep telling yourself and it's,
it's really about,

756
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.370
um,
uh,
not,
not so much self preservation as,
uh,

757
00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.130
as knowing that,
uh,

758
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.680
what you're doing is useful and good and uh,

759
00:46:33.681 --> 00:46:36.950
and profitable and,
uh,
an interesting,

760
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.970
it's a simple,
simple little formula.

761
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:42.703
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

762
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.730
<v 0>Okay.
Well there's one question I always like to ask.
Yes.</v>

763
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.490
Which is what is the best piece of advice you've ever received?
Oh,

764
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.630
the one that stands out in your mind who were just like,
Oh,

765
00:46:52.631 --> 00:46:55.630
like somehow I've carried that with me or it wasn't just a really critical

766
00:46:55.631 --> 00:46:56.390
moment.

767
00:46:56.390 --> 00:47:00.260
<v 3>Well,
my dad,
um,
when I was about 16,</v>

768
00:47:00.261 --> 00:47:04.670
I think applying to college,
um,
I was sat there and I said,
you know,
dad were,

769
00:47:04.671 --> 00:47:09.500
where should I go?
Which,
you know,
and he said,
you know,
Martha,
um,

770
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:10.910
you're,
you're a smart girl.

771
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:16.150
You can do pretty much anything you want and you make up your mind.

772
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.750
And that was,
uh,
that was when he said,
you can do anything you want.

773
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.800
I think that that kind of encouragement is invaluable for life.

774
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.970
<v 0>And let's talk a little bit about the future.
Oh,</v>

775
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.950
where do you think the do it yourself industry is going?

776
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.040
Where does it go in the future?
In five years,
in 10 years?
How does it,

777
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.390
how does it change shape?

778
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.460
<v 3>Well,
one reason that I'm on a book tour right now is because,
um,
you know,</v>

779
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:45.160
after so many books,
do you think,
oh,
do you have to go on another book tour?

780
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:49.180
I get to see people face to face.
And um,

781
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.020
and last night at Macy's in Costa Mesa and south,
uh,

782
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:55.260
I guess that's south of La.
Um,

783
00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.130
there were so many young people in line,
young mothers with babies.

784
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:03.400
So many babies came.
And this isn't it,
seven o'clock at night,

785
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.100
the babies were there,
the mothers,
young mothers were there,

786
00:48:06.101 --> 00:48:07.960
their husbands were there.
Um,

787
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.770
I can see that the craving for good,
solid,

788
00:48:11.771 --> 00:48:14.080
how to information is alive and well.

789
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.970
And I think that that's why the kind of work that I do in our company does,

790
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:23.170
in terms of teaching and inspiring is a,
is very important.

791
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:24.300
And,
um,

792
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:28.810
and if you forget how to learn even the homeliest chores,

793
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.940
um,
you're not gonna,
you're just,
you can't live.
You can't.

794
00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:39.580
And it's,
um,
you know,
we're not all billionaires.
We're not all millionaires.
Uh,

795
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:41.710
we all have challenges in life,

796
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:46.570
but knowing how to do things so things can be done well I think is very

797
00:48:46.571 --> 00:48:49.150
important for the rest of your life.

798
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:53.350
<v 0>And on that note today is the book has,
uh,
entertaining,</v>

799
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.140
entertaining and entertaining.
Well,
uh,

800
00:48:56.141 --> 00:49:00.820
we actually have books for the first two rows.
If you reach underneath your seat,

801
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:02.440
Oh,
where's that card underneath?

802
00:49:02.441 --> 00:49:06.820
And you get a voucher for today's book.
Uh,

803
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:10.090
and Martin Martha's book.
We're going to have a book signing.

804
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.410
It's going to be in Seville tech talk from noon to one.
So Martha will be there,

805
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.080
uh,
signing books.
You can also buy the book.

806
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:20.710
They are so you can buy the book and how birth assignment get a chance to,
to,

807
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.140
to meet her for the next hour.

808
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:26.410
We're all going to go and show you some of what we're up to at x here at Google.

809
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:29.140
One and how are we doing?
How are we get things done here?

810
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.090
But this has just been so wonderful.

811
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.150
It's such an honor to have you here and you've been just so wonderful this

812
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:35.650
morning.
Let's give Martha a really warm

813
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:37.320
<v 1>thank you.</v>
