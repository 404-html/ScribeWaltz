1
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.700
Thank you everyone for coming to our talks at Google event today with Tina

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.110
Sharkey.
It's great to have you,
Tina.

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.640
<v 0>So psyched to be here.
And we brought Brian in the snack,</v>

4
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.210
so if you're on the live stream,
we'll figure out how to get them to you later.

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.600
But anyone in the room,
feel free to get up,
get some snacks.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.750
I won't feel insulted.
I'll be really happy actually.
So

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.630
<v 2>Tina is the cofounder and CEO of brandless,</v>

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.470
which is an ecommerce startup that's looking to shake things up in the industry

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.640
by offering high quality products at a really affordable price point.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.760
Great to have you again.
It's awesome to be here.
Uh,

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.940
can you tell us a little bit about brandless in your own words?
So

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
<v 0>brandless um,
my cofounder,
Ido Leffler and I,
um,</v>

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.880
we were sort of feeling like modern consumption was just very,
very broken.

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.930
Um,

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.930
and that meant that if people really understood what things cost versus what

16
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:04.620
they pay for them,
um,
they'd be in his words like riding in the streets.

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.431
Um,

18
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.980
I don't know that I thought people would be riding in the streets but that there

19
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:08.381
was this,

20
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:13.381
this perception that better had to cost more and it actually really doesn't and

21
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:18.630
so when we found him brandless we were really trying to act like this very high

22
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.780
level,
try and make sense of consumption.

23
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:26.781
There was a sense that there were the haves and the haves nots and that people

24
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.510
couldn't actually find what they were looking for.

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.340
Shop the values they believed in,

26
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:37.341
whether it was their dietary values like I'm gluten free or I'm kosher or Vegan

27
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.370
or I like to eat organic or it was their belief systems.

28
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
I don't want animal testing,
I want non GMO,
I'm,
I want certain foods,

29
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.670
certain things that I reached for every day to sort of live up to my value

30
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:54.300
system.
If in fact they were to use that as their shopping filter,

31
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.680
they would definitely be paying a premium for everything because their value

32
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.890
system actually comes at a premium but it doesn't have to.

33
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730
And so at brandless at the highest level,

34
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.080
we're trying to democratize access to goodness,

35
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.850
starting with everyday essentials,
which is everything on brandless is $3,

36
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:16.440
sometimes it's two or three or three for three.
And all of our food is non-gmo.

37
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.010
Most of it is organic,
tons of it as gluten free.

38
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.120
And all of our beauty and our personal care or shaving gel,

39
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:27.840
our shampoo or conditioner are,
I'm hand pains,
et Cetera,

40
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:32.130
are all completely clean.
Which means in the case of beauty and personal care,

41
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.160
it's free of animal testing.

42
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.900
It's free of SLS is a phosphate of sole face of,
of synthetic dyes,
et cetera.

43
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.270
And every single category that we develop at brandless,

44
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.320
we use that filter to say what really matters in that particular category.

45
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.500
So for example,
when we do cleaning,
um,

46
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.600
our cleaning products like our multi surface cleaner,
our toilet bowl cleaner,
um,

47
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.370
they are EPA safer choice certified.
Um,

48
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.470
everything that we do is just $3 or two for three or three for three.

49
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.660
But everything is very much created for what we consider the modern lifestyle.

50
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.230
<v 2>How do you set yourself apart from other ecommerce startups that have been</v>

51
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.650
coming up over the last few years?
For example,
the honest company,

52
00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:17.950
which I think is doing similar,
uh,

53
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.690
non GMO healthy products.

54
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.930
<v 0>So as a startup,
you know,</v>

55
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.010
first and foremost we're a community and we're a community of people who believe

56
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:30.140
that everyone deserves better.
Um,

57
00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:34.250
I can't really say what honest is doing because I don't know a ton about that

58
00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:39.251
company other than to say that the pricing structure at brainless,

59
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.160
um,
everything that we sell is brand tax free.

60
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.500
So what we mean by that is we have eliminated all the inefficiencies in the

61
00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:53.180
system for what things cost to produce versus what you're paying for them.

62
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.540
And so I don't know how honest does that by being a community that goes directly

63
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.970
to the consumers and makes things for the people that we serve,

64
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.690
we are developing the products.
Um,

65
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.690
we're putting them into our distribution centers and we're sending them directly

66
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:09.524
to you.

67
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.790
And so if you were looking at national brands that have the same quality as
ours,

68
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:17.390
organic coconut oil,
organic olive oils,

69
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.700
organic feminine hygiene,
um,
all the non GMO food on average,

70
00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:27.701
you're saving 40% of brand tax savings of national brands of similar quality

71
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.980
when it comes to things like clean beauty,
clean personal care and clean,
um,

72
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.790
um,
hygiene,
it's as high as 300 to 400% savings.

73
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.290
So I can't tell you what honest his system is and how they do that,

74
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.530
but ours is really about a community that is connected around a higher purpose,

75
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.130
which is that,
you know,
the doing is what matters in life.

76
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.810
When you check out at brandless,
um,

77
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.680
there's something extra in your shopping cart and that's a meal that we

78
00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:02.681
partnered with feeding America to buy 'em on your behalf and in your honor to

79
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:06.410
feed those who don't have $3,
if you're a member of the more,

80
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:07.280
which is our membership.

81
00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:09.950
And I'll talk about that a little later because there's a surprise coming for

82
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:11.490
all of you.
Um,

83
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.410
will donate 10 meals in your honor and every time you shop we donate two meals.

84
00:05:15.411 --> 00:05:20.300
If you're a member in the first 18 weeks of being in service,
uh,

85
00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:25.301
we've already donated over 150,000 meals to feeding America both to be deployed

86
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:30.170
to the disaster relief zones in California and Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico

87
00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:33.790
where we don't ship,
but we still are trying to do what we can,
um,

88
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.500
as well as to the people facing hunger in this country,

89
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.960
in everyday systems all over the nation.

90
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.420
<v 2>You mentioned the brand tax,</v>

91
00:05:41.421 --> 00:05:43.550
but maybe a few of us here are familiar with that term.

92
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.020
Could you tell us a little bit about that?

93
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.671
<v 0>Yes.</v>

94
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:48.550
You wouldn't be familiar with it because we made it up and we trademarked it.
Uh,

95
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.330
but we were trying to find a way to actually describe to people like what we

96
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:54.700
meant by that inefficiency in the system.

97
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.090
So when you think about the cost of less per se in our organic tomato sauce is

98
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:05.210
as an example.
So we make three different kinds of tomato sauces,
[inaudible],

99
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.120
garlic and tomato and basil.
They're all organic.
Um,

100
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.950
and we work with our partner to do that.
At that point,

101
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.860
we then send them to our distribution center and we send them to you.

102
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.670
That's not how most other tomato sauce is distributed.

103
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.330
It's often created at that manufacturers.

104
00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:24.890
Sometimes the brand owns the manufacturer.

105
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.500
Sometimes they partner with somebody who's making it for them.

106
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.610
They then have to distribute it,
so sometimes,

107
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:33.950
especially in the organics and naturals market,

108
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.430
you can't sell directly to a store like a whole foods.

109
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.700
You have to go through a distributor and then that distributor takes a

110
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:44.240
percentage.
Then you sell it,
let's say to whole foods and it's,

111
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.900
let's say it's a special tomato sauce that you want to have on a special shelf.

112
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.470
Okay,
well then whole foods gets their markup and that shelf has a special cost.

113
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.110
Let's say there's already a sauce on that shelf.
Well,

114
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.590
you have to then remove that sauce potentially and put your sauce.

115
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:00.410
Let's say you want to do an end cap,
which is like at the end of the aisle,

116
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:04.160
sometimes you see those specials or you have somebody out there sampling the

117
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:08.930
sauce for you.
The point is that all of those touches,
and there's many,

118
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:12.500
many,
many,
many more,
you end up paying for that,

119
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.740
which is all on top of the cost of the sauce to begin with.

120
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.100
So if a time that sauce leaves the manufacturer and ends up on your pasta,

121
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.800
it could be,
you know,
two,
three,

122
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:29.030
four times of what it actually costs to make.
I mean,
everything is different,

123
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.490
but if you're benchmarking it against a brand,

124
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:36.020
like an organic of similar quality and you're going to see on average those

125
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:39.620
types of savings.
So we roll that into this idea of brand tax free,

126
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.360
which is to say that we're trying and every which way that we can to eliminate

127
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:45.194
that middleman.

128
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.640
Every product is different because most products are sold differently,
you know,

129
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:54.470
so the way a tomato sauce gets distributed might not be the same way.
You know,

130
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:58.580
we also sell plates and bowls and cups and knives and things like that.

131
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.700
So every system is different.
But in general,

132
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:06.370
wherever we can be completely efficient and pass on whatever our,

133
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.670
you know,
costs are to you by offering everything at one simple $3 price.

134
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.070
<v 2>I think something that characterizes Googlers,</v>

135
00:08:14.071 --> 00:08:17.310
even though we work at a big company is that we're pretty entrepreneurial in

136
00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:20.880
nature and people are always thinking about what kind of product they could

137
00:08:20.881 --> 00:08:24.510
potentially go out and start making or what kind of startup they'll go and
found.

138
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.200
Um,

139
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.490
so maybe could you tell us a little bit about your journey that led you to come

140
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:33.140
up with the idea for brandless and how your previous work experience influenced

141
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:35.460
your decision to start this company in particular?

142
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.890
<v 0>Yeah,
well I would say that,
um,
first of all,</v>

143
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.370
the only reason I was even keen to start another company because I didn't think

144
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:47.060
I was going to do that.
Um,
I sort of liken being an entrepreneur,

145
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.570
especially as a woman to like childbirth.
If you remembered what it felt like,

146
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:51.950
you wouldn't do it again.
Um,

147
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.560
so somehow there's some gene in your brain that helps you forget that because I

148
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:59.100
do have two awesome sons.
So clearly that didn't happen to me.

149
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.850
And I think entrepreneurship and startups are very similar.
Um,

150
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.360
which is that it's a birth process and it's hard.
Um,

151
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.170
and it's unpredictable,
but it's completely awesome.
Um,

152
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:13.350
I decided that if I was going to do another one,
um,

153
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:16.960
that I was going to do it with the first and foremost with the people I wanted

154
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.610
to be on that journey with.
And so my extraordinary cofounder,

155
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.780
Ido Leffler with somebody that I wanted to change the world with from a business

156
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:26.520
and scale and perspective.

157
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.030
And so we had been friends for like many years before we,

158
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.760
we lived in the same town.
Our families were friends.

159
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.040
I was at the hospital when his daughter was born,

160
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.580
like just really somebody I admired and I admired his career.

161
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:43.581
And he built a bunch of CPG companies that had not just great success,

162
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.530
but also had purpose and meaning.

163
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.400
And everything that I try and do in my life is rooted in sole purpose and

164
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:52.020
meaning.
So I said,

165
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:56.250
I'm going to start a company with this person and it's going to be for profit

166
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.280
and for purpose.
And we're not going to do purpose as a campaign.

167
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:02.280
We're not going to do purpose as something that's like a caboose that we're

168
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:04.920
going to like jack onto the back of it when it's giving Tuesday,

169
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:08.100
which it happens to be today.
I think giving Tuesdays amazing.

170
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.130
But I think every day should be giving Tuesday.

171
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:14.550
And that that's just a new way of thinking about the way we actually can live

172
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:19.080
our lives.
And so that journey started with the right cofounder.

173
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.520
The second thing was as my tour of duty as a venture capitalist,
you know,

174
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.580
everyone in here I'm sure in some way,
and you're a product manager.

175
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:31.200
I've been a product manager is about building things.
There's features.

176
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:34.320
So many of you may be working on features.
I've worked on many,

177
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.000
some of those features.
You know,

178
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:39.420
if you go through YC or you have one of these other incubation opportunities,

179
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.570
those features may be become products.
Um,

180
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:45.030
if that product actually has a life,

181
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:49.920
that product could get funding potentially and could become a company.
Um,

182
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.630
so of those companies that go from feature to product and company,

183
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.490
the rare exception get to be brands meaning something that people understand.

184
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.690
They,
they,
it means something more than any individual product that they ship.

185
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.943
Um,

186
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.690
very few of those brands actually have the opportunity to be category leaders.

187
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:13.290
So we're disrupting a category.
We want to be leader or even better,

188
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.730
are we going to create a new category?

189
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:18.390
So in the case of an Airbnb or a homeaway that was like,
wow,

190
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.210
it's alternative category to the travel category,

191
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.590
we're going to create a new one.

192
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.300
I would say Uber and Lyft and those companies all fall in that category to the

193
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:31.200
highest order.
If you get from feature to a product to company,

194
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:36.201
to brand to category leader would be a movement that actually not only you

195
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:38.490
creating a new category,

196
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.510
but you're inciting something that's bigger than your entire company.
Um,

197
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:46.830
that's actually about something that's about people and moving them and moving

198
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.010
society and culture to a place that you want to see and that your company

199
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:52.740
becomes one of the people in that movement.

200
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.500
But not necessarily the only person in that or the only thing in that movement,

201
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.320
that ladder,
like as an investor,

202
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:02.320
I was always looking for things that actually I felt could pass through.

203
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:05.290
I wasn't interested in investing in features or even products.

204
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.370
And if it didn't have the potential to be a brand or a category leader,

205
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:14.371
it didn't feel like something that was sort of worthy of really venture capital,

206
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.130
which is what it's there for cause it's the longterm play.
Um,

207
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:22.190
so when Edo and I landed on this idea,
um,

208
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.790
I felt like in my soul this was a movement,

209
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.450
this was something that was bigger than any individual piece of its parts.
Uh,

210
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.590
which leads to the idea of like brandless like are we generic?

211
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.520
Are we not a brand?
No,
we are unapologetically a brand.
Like,

212
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.400
but we're redefining what it means to be one.

213
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.310
And we're saying we're a brand that's based on truth.

214
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.440
That's based on authenticity and that's based on being in direct collaboration

215
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:48.760
with the people that we serve.

216
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.220
So I would say that when Google and Larry and Sergei founded this company,

217
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:59.221
it was the idea of democratizing information and that's like a big lofty goal

218
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.650
and like mission accomplished extraordinary for us.

219
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.670
Um,
but they're not the only ones doing it,

220
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:09.520
but you guys are clearly the category leaders in a category that didn't even

221
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:14.170
exist or maybe it did,
but it was like very,
very early.

222
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.850
Um,
at brandless we're trying to democratize goodness.
Um,

223
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.470
and that's like this movement,

224
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:24.730
this idea that everyone deserves better and better,
shouldn't cost more.

225
00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:25.930
Like that's just not fair.

226
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.410
But it's a very hard thing to get your brain around when somebody tells you that

227
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.320
this premium that you've been paying,
you don't need to pay.

228
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.510
And this isn't about going wholesale.

229
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.330
We're actually engineering everything from the ground up,

230
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.360
but we're in direct relationship with the people that we serve.

231
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.550
And so in doing that and being a community first,

232
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.860
we think about every single person that we have the privilege of working with.

233
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.060
Um,
they're members of our community.
And so the love letters,
the notes,

234
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:00.340
the engagement that we get back all the time,

235
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:04.210
like every minute coming into our slack channels are and all of our social

236
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:05.044
channels,

237
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.340
they can't believe that like they're in conversation with the company that

238
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:13.810
they're buying organic tomato sauce from or organic feminine hygiene from or

239
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:16.720
clean beauty from or other things like that.

240
00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:21.721
Because our attitude is if you want to be DTC direct to consumer,

241
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:25.390
then you have to be PTP,
which is person to person.

242
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.810
And so everybody that comes into our community,

243
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.220
we consider a member of our community and everyone that's not in our community,

244
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:37.570
we see as an awesome stranger that we have best intentions to hopefully bring

245
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:38.500
them along our movement.

246
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.840
What do you see as being your biggest success of the first few months?

247
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:47.060
Cause you guys just launched in the summer,
right?
Yeah.
Um Hm.

248
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.520
We're still here.
Uh,

249
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.790
so the biggest success,
um,

250
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.340
I would say that like 60 hours after our launch,
uh,

251
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.680
we got this incredible number back.
Um,
and that number was 48,

252
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.760
and that number has held every single day since then.
Um,

253
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.770
what does that mean?

254
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.100
It means that we shipped a 48 states every day and we weren't targeting 48

255
00:15:17.011 --> 00:15:21.150
states.
We weren't advertising to 48 states.
Uh,

256
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.550
we would like to shift to 50,

257
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:24.920
but we can only ship in the contiguous us right now.

258
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.650
That's why Puerto Rico gets our efforts,
but doesn't get our product yet.
Um,

259
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.290
and Alaska and Hawaii are not happy with us,
but we're trying,

260
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.600
the Canadians we really love,

261
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.080
but we keep asking them to make friends with people in Detroit or Seattle that

262
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:43.610
have like a large minivan because I just can't get it to Canada right now.
Um,

263
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.450
but the point is that that success,

264
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.900
the idea that the people that we built this for found it,

265
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.500
whether they were in Tallahassee or Tennessee or parts of Texas,

266
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.430
like they found it and the notes that we get back,

267
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.820
people who have affordable luxuries and could choose to get and shop anywhere,

268
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:09.140
but don't have access.

269
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.130
People that never thought they could have access because they can never afford

270
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:17.060
organics for their family.
People that have dietary restrictions,

271
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:20.240
it didn't know where to get these things and now can find them at affordable

272
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:23.960
prices and people who are shifting their behaviors.
For example,

273
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:26.270
we sell tree free toilet paper,

274
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.950
which means that no trees were cut down or we to make toilet tissue.

275
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.370
It's made from bamboo grasses and sugar cane.
Um,

276
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:38.060
and so that are just things that people love.

277
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:42.380
They didn't know that they could actually shop their values at affordable
prices.

278
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.090
They didn't have access to things.

279
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.880
And so some of the communities that have shown up early,
um,

280
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:52.760
like the gluten free community is a very active community online.
Um,

281
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.590
and so they found us,
um,
and that was exciting.
The vegan community,

282
00:16:57.591 --> 00:16:59.570
they found us like our,

283
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:04.220
I think it was like our first week we had gluten free Brownie mix,
gluten free.

284
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:08.810
I'm a pancake mix and gluten free blueberry muffin mix,
uh,

285
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:13.280
before we did any of the rest,
like the regular pancake or whatever.

286
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:15.440
And they sold out like in three days.

287
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.830
And we were so surprised like what just happened.

288
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.150
And then we learned that like one of the gluten free,
like very active online,
uh,

289
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.580
groups found brandless and boom,
we sold out.

290
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:28.850
I mean we're back in stock and we just didn't know that those were going to be

291
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:32.930
like interested in gateways or for example,
our first um,

292
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.520
skew of toothpaste is fluoride free.
So we thought,
you know what,

293
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:42.290
there is a growing community of people who believe that there shouldn't be

294
00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:46.820
Florida and their toothpaste.
Um,
and so we know that is a niche community,

295
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.830
but it's an important and growing one and one that's very vocal,

296
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:54.270
believe it or not.
And so we launched a fluoride free toothpaste.

297
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.321
Well what do you know?

298
00:17:55.321 --> 00:18:00.240
People like it blew up and they were using that as a doorway in to like the

299
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:03.360
entire assortment if Brown,
which has that intention,

300
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:08.160
every single bag box or bottle.
So they're just some early insights.

301
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.190
Cause you know,
we're only,
I don't know,
18,
20 weeks in,

302
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.310
but those are some of the fun,
um,

303
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.650
nuances and stories that were starting to learn every day.

304
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.730
<v 2>Yeah.
That brings me to the general question of how you think about the specific</v>

305
00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:22.650
products that you pick.
Because personally,

306
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.980
a lot of my friends who are really excited about a brand lists,

307
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.430
it's because they're vegan and they're just so excited that it's so easy for

308
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:33.750
them to access a wide variety of Vegan products at a pretty affordable price

309
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:37.920
when usually I think vegan products either tend to be really hard to find or

310
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:40.380
they tend to be expensive relative to other products.

311
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.820
So this is a really good venue for them to reach out to and have easy access to

312
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:47.100
what they need.
So how do you think about that?

313
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:48.900
Because I know you also have organic,

314
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.380
a feminine hygiene products and office supplies,

315
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:56.580
so it's a wide range of things,
but it seems like it's very thought through.

316
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.930
<v 0>Yeah.
So what's really interesting on when you go to buy shoes,</v>

317
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.630
whether you buy them online or whether you buy them in a shop,

318
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.800
the likelihood is you're probably just going and you're buying the shoes and

319
00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:08.311
you're done.

320
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:11.700
Whether it's a checkout at an online store or whether it's a physical store.

321
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And maybe if you're buying them from an online store and you don't know your

322
00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:16.680
size and they have a good return policy,

323
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:20.190
maybe you're buying two sizes and you're returning one.
That's a possibility.

324
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.290
It's very different than the consumables business in the consumables business.

325
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.070
It's about the mission and the trip.
So what does that mean?

326
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.940
That means that these are the things that you reach for every day,

327
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.500
whether you reach for them in your Pantry,

328
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:36.090
whether you reach for them under your sink,

329
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.470
whether you reach for them in your lunch room,

330
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:39.870
where your bathroom or even your purse,
um,

331
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.520
they're the things that you consume every day.

332
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.050
They're the things that you replenish all the time.
And so when we created this,

333
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.970
um,
initial assortment of products,
we're really intentional in saying,
okay,

334
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:56.420
what do people buy 52 weeks a year and how many households in America?

335
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.290
We took a very analytical approach.

336
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.590
How many households in America by that product?
Like what's the,

337
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:04.020
what we call AHPs the household penetrations.

338
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.410
And then we studied that based on every single thing that people buy and how

339
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:15.750
could we make sure that unlike shoes,
which is what I would call a one and done,

340
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:18.810
right,
these are like the baskets that people are building.

341
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.080
How can we make sure that our shelves are stocked with just what mattered where

342
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:28.740
we were creating selection and assortment and where there was,

343
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:32.670
what we call expandable consumption.
So in the case of stacks,
for example,

344
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.250
snacks is something that 98.8% of American households by,

345
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.590
um,
and they buy them 52 weeks a year.

346
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.390
And if I was to ship you a box of 10 different kinds of snacks,

347
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.530
whether or not you would eat those snacks,
um,
you might try them.

348
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.250
If you didn't want to try them for whatever reason,
you might bring them to work.

349
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.090
You might bring them to the soccer game.
You might host a,
you know,

350
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.350
Monday night football party.

351
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:02.600
Like there's lots of different ways that you might eat that snack.
Um,

352
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.360
so that's a place where we're launching,
you know,
Jalapeno Cheddar,

353
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:12.190
keenwah puffs along with,
you know,
olive oil and sea salt popcorn.

354
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.620
Um,
all of these are non GMO,

355
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:19.450
some of these organic and we're launching keen watch chips alongside of tomato,

356
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.100
tomato and basil like homeless puffs,
you know,
all kinds of yummy things.
Um,

357
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:28.750
and they're all,
some of them are here.
Um,
and so we're trying new things.

358
00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:30.280
We're experimenting with new things.

359
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.520
There are other places where you don't need to be paralyzed by 50 feet of salad

360
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:40.930
dressing,
um,
when the truth is you probably just use one,
two or three.

361
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.560
And so in that particular case,
our organic Italian dressing,

362
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:49.480
our organic balsamic vinegar dressing and organic poppy seed dressing,
um,

363
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:51.850
are the three that we know are the most popular.

364
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.220
And then we introduced one,
um,
that we're crazy about.
And that's a,

365
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.050
um,
it's a ginger,

366
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.310
a dressing that may not be everyone's taste,

367
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.140
but it's a way to try new things.
And so in that category,

368
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:12.160
we're doing just what matters.
In the case of oils and vinegars,

369
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:13.930
we launched an organic,

370
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.440
extra virgin olive oil and an organic balsamic vinegar.

371
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.470
Might we do other ones?
We might,

372
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.410
but we knew that was like the most important thing to do.

373
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.480
In the case of the holidays,

374
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.560
I'm starting in October and take you all the way through the year.

375
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.240
We have a maple,
a collection.

376
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.410
So that maple collection is what we call lto limited time offer.

377
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.120
And so we have the most incredible maple twist,
highly recommended maple cookies,

378
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.950
even maple lip balm,
maple coffees,
um,
and maple syrup.
The Maple Syrup is organic.

379
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.880
Um,
it's amazing and it's $3.
Good housekeeping just said it was,

380
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:53.080
they're like number one or number two pick for stocking stuffers,
um,

381
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.830
as like the best gift of the year,
uh,
to beautiful bottle,
et cetera.

382
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:02.070
So like looking at every single item with that lens of just what matters.

383
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.890
Not to do the over proliferation of choice,

384
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.450
but create choice where we know that you actually want choice and you want trial

385
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.040
versus in an area where you're locked into one thing or two things that we don't

386
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:18.220
need to create waste,
um,
don't create waste there.

387
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.380
So we're very intentional by product,
by category and by skew,

388
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.270
how we create them,

389
00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:29.320
what the formulations are and how we live up to our own sort of filter of just

390
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:30.154
what matters.

391
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:35.680
Is there some sort of feedback cycle with what customers want?
Do you ever get,

392
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:40.480
oh my gosh,
yes.
Um,
so the initial assortment when we launched,

393
00:23:40.481 --> 00:23:45.070
we launched with about 114 what we call sk use,
uh,
you know,
items.

394
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.520
And now we're probably north of 200.
We're probably around two 20,

395
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.150
but everything,

396
00:23:51.151 --> 00:23:55.400
since our launch has been based on the feedback of things that people were

397
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:56.234
looking for.

398
00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:01.250
So there was very much high request for 'em oatmeal's.

399
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.270
Um,
and so we launched oatmeal in a September organic oatmeal's.

400
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:07.240
We launched them in packs and we launched them in flavors.

401
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.670
There was a big request for,
um,
soups.

402
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.110
So we just launched our organic chicken broth or vegetable broth and beef broth.

403
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.320
What I love about our soups as an example,
um,

404
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:22.170
you know how you can buy in the store,
those cartons of soup.
Um,

405
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.250
the thing I hate about those is if I'm not cooking for my kids,

406
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.090
I opened one and then I feel like I'm wasting it because if I don't use the

407
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:33.020
whole cart and I have to throw it away,
what's great about this is for $3,

408
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:37.750
you actually get three,
um,
individual sizes so you can just open them,
uh,

409
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.260
for what you need.
Um,

410
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.320
we also launched m two for three of a Vegan and organic.

411
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:48.770
We have a tomato soup,
we have a butternut squash soup.

412
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:50.460
You have a red pepper soup.
Um,

413
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.940
they're awesome and they come in these little individual boxes.

414
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:56.720
So we're very intentional about that.
And people really wanted soup,

415
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.060
but we needed to do soup the [inaudible] way.

416
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:04.340
And so if we can do it the brandless way where we can be brand tax fee and we

417
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:08.900
can lend it at a price that makes sense and it lives up to our own values and we

418
00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:12.670
love the partner who can scale with us,
we're good.
Um,

419
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.890
but all of that feedback that we're getting for our future assortments,

420
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.720
we're cocreating with our community.

421
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.130
What has been one of the biggest challenges that you faced since starting out?

422
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.230
Um,
I would say that,
you know,

423
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.650
in the context of talking to the Google audience,

424
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.490
both here and in the stream,
and I'm sure this will live on youtube thereafter,

425
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.800
is that we,

426
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:42.050
in being not a feature or a product or a brand or a company or a category
leader,

427
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:45.260
but a movement,
we really need to get big,
fast.

428
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:50.240
And so I would say that scaling the company and the team,
because at brandless,

429
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:55.220
like we put people first and that starts with every single person who works at

430
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:59.900
brandless.
And so growing our team and growing it quickly,

431
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.840
but with the right people and the right filter.
You know,

432
00:26:02.841 --> 00:26:06.260
I say that when I look at my own algorithm for recruiting,

433
00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:11.170
like I totally wasted the Geo at the awesome human,
like I don't care.
Uh,

434
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.950
yes,
of course it needs to be qualified,

435
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.090
but qualifications do not Trump an awesome human factor.

436
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:21.860
And so finding the right people who not only have the skills and the confidence

437
00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:24.320
and the scale to want to be part of a startup,

438
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:28.550
but also understand scale or how to get to scale and they're excited about going

439
00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:32.900
to scale,
but they believe that the doing in life is really what matters.

440
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.890
And they want to make a difference not only by day and what their shipping and

441
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:40.910
deploying,
but in the company that we're building,
which we believe is gonna,

442
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.451
you know,

443
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:46.451
change the way people think about things and really try and just keep focusing

444
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:49.110
on the idea that everyone deserves better.

445
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.060
And that we can actually democratized goodness,
uh,
with every shipment,

446
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:57.480
with every box,
with every post,
with every tweet.
Um,

447
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.010
and with all of our intentions.

448
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:05.170
<v 2>So with brandless you kind of exists at this intersection between commerce and</v>

449
00:27:05.331 --> 00:27:06.740
then also technology.

450
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.510
Do you ever feel like there's a conflict of interest between the two sides and

451
00:27:11.511 --> 00:27:15.380
how do you decide which side to give into any one point?

452
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.650
<v 0>I would say that there's a very good chance that might happen in the future,</v>

453
00:27:20.651 --> 00:27:24.010
but because we barely have deployed like version one,

454
00:27:24.011 --> 00:27:26.770
I would say we're in an MVP plus right now.

455
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:31.990
So we haven't hit that place where those two are in conflict.
But,
uh,

456
00:27:31.991 --> 00:27:36.400
we definitely want to give people the runway to pursue their passions and to

457
00:27:36.401 --> 00:27:40.120
pursue their interests.
And so the more data that we can play with,

458
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.170
the more people are enabled to use that data,
um,

459
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:49.210
to tell the kind of stories that are going to help them move their piece and the

460
00:27:49.211 --> 00:27:50.740
larger piece of brandless forward.

461
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.300
So I'd say that we're all sort of data scientists underneath it all.
Um,
you know,

462
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:59.860
some of us have the skills and some of us have the desire to sort of understand

463
00:27:59.861 --> 00:28:00.694
those insights.

464
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.910
So triangulating between like who are our shoppers and how are they part of our

465
00:28:06.371 --> 00:28:07.204
community,

466
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.440
what are in their baskets so that we can give them more of those things and how

467
00:28:11.441 --> 00:28:14.660
can we deploy the features and functionality and to make that automagically

468
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:19.000
possible for them,
um,
uh,
in a mobile environment,
um,

469
00:28:19.001 --> 00:28:23.410
so that we can make it just super easy and mitigate,

470
00:28:23.411 --> 00:28:26.600
click fatigue,
mitigate,
you know,
scroll fatigue,
um,

471
00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:30.940
and get them in and out really fast.
So,
you know,
the smaller the screens get as,

472
00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:32.740
you know,
all too well,
you know,

473
00:28:32.741 --> 00:28:37.690
the harder it is to kind of get all those features into one scroll.
And so,

474
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.920
given that the universe is mobile first,
um,

475
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.900
how do you think about that in a non APP world?

476
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.700
Because we weren't interested in our first deployment of building an APP because

477
00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:51.610
I didn't want to put a download in someone in front of someone who hadn't met us

478
00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:54.460
yet,
but that will come over time.

479
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.510
So thinking about that balance between,
you know,
the roadmap,

480
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.230
the features and functionality,
and always,
always,

481
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.390
always putting people first.

482
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.320
And so that means both letting the employees,
um,

483
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.640
kind of scratched their data and curiosity itches and,
and,

484
00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:17.641
and try things as well as the users who we want to make it as simple and fluid

485
00:29:17.891 --> 00:29:18.940
and easiest possible.

486
00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.120
<v 2>In terms of features and functionality,
you recently announced be more,</v>

487
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.220
which is an annual membership program.

488
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.450
I think in my eyes I see it as being similar to Amazon prime.

489
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.890
So how would you say you set yourself apart from Amazon prime and how did you

490
00:29:33.891 --> 00:29:36.890
decide to start implementing this annual membership model?

491
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.430
<v 0>So I have to say that being compared to Amazon prime,</v>

492
00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.920
I take a complete form of flattery.
Um,
so,
uh,
you know,

493
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.520
we should have such problems.
More people have Amazon prime memberships,

494
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.880
then there are,
then they have land lines in America.
So,
um,

495
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.680
I think that would be awesome.
Um,
having said that,
we launched on seven 11,

496
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.550
which,
um,
I thought it was funny because it was seven 11.

497
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:05.290
Little did I know that it was like free slurpee day and Amazon Prime Day,

498
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:10.470
but somehow,
um,
we had already set the date and that was like it.
Um,

499
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.310
but it didn't seem to matter.
Having said that,
um,
like I said,

500
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.230
Brian,
this is building a community.
And so when we launched be more,

501
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.640
our goal with being more was to give people an opportunity to do more,

502
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.370
to get more and to give more.

503
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.220
And so for $36 a year,

504
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:33.680
which if you do the math and everyone in this room I know can,
um,

505
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.020
it's $3 a month and it's free shipping with any be more ordered,
no matter,

506
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:42.190
no shipping threshold.
And so in addition,
when you join,

507
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:46.810
we give 10 meals to um,
feeding America every time you check out.
Um,

508
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.530
there's two meals that are in your shopping cart that we provide priceless,

509
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.100
as priceless as part of your brand,
less experience.
Um,

510
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:59.080
and we're just trying to remove any of the friction to try and make it easy for

511
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:02.460
people to have access to brandless products,
um,

512
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.520
to be able to afford the things that they want and to be able to feel like

513
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.710
everyday is giving Tuesday and that they can actually give more,

514
00:31:11.711 --> 00:31:15.580
share more and be more engaged over time,
be more,

515
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:18.610
will be a platform for partners,
um,

516
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.220
to actually be able to maybe share more.
So for example,
on,
um,

517
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.520
black Friday,
uh,
when everyone else was slashing prices,

518
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.290
we um,
you know,
gave away a meditation App and gave,
you know,

519
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:35.380
we let people sort of think about what is brandless life mean?

520
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:40.030
Because when we say brandless,
we're not generic,
we're not private label.

521
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.630
We're saying just live more and brand less.

522
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:48.010
Like don't let somebody else tell you like that you should be taller.
Um,
there,

523
00:31:48.011 --> 00:31:51.550
your hair should be straighter,
that your teeth should look a certain way,

524
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:54.220
that you should shoot the ball a certain way.

525
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:58.810
Like we think you're already awesome and just be more,
be more if we already are.

526
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.160
Um,
and so brandless is really about empowering people to just sort of live their

527
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:07.480
best lives and not have to make a choice between what they want and what they

528
00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:10.450
can afford because people shouldn't be forced to choose.

529
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.510
We have our microphone here and

530
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.890
<v 3>so have you have a question,
raise your hand and we can get the mic to you.</v>

531
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.670
What percent of your products do you have to take a loss on to get that $3 price

532
00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:19.971
point?

533
00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:23.360
And then as you s I don't know much about how the distribution process works,

534
00:32:23.361 --> 00:32:24.230
but,
uh,

535
00:32:24.231 --> 00:32:26.750
I assume you have a limited number of warehouses or I don't know if you can

536
00:32:26.751 --> 00:32:29.840
contract through like other people's warehouses or how that works,

537
00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:30.830
but as you grow,

538
00:32:30.831 --> 00:32:34.940
can you bring the cost of those products below to actually make a profit or

539
00:32:34.941 --> 00:32:36.440
whatever on those $3 products?

540
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.020
<v 0>So,
um,</v>

541
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.200
the thing that will blow your mind is that the answer is zero.

542
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.610
There's not a single product that we are underwriting.

543
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.960
I'm at brandless not one.
Um,
now having said that,

544
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:56.450
there's different margins on different products,
but because you're not,

545
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.150
it's not like shoes where it's a one and done,

546
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.830
you're buying a basket and because you are finding the things that you reach for

547
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:08.720
every day and so it's a blended margin for sure.
Um,

548
00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.590
uh,
but there's not a single product that we are losing money on if that's the

549
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:16.370
question.
Um,
in terms of distribution centers,
um,

550
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:21.371
right now we have distribution centers in California and in the Midwest and that

551
00:33:21.921 --> 00:33:24.670
enables us to sort of try and do,
you know,

552
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.680
two days or less wherever we serve in the continental us and we'll be definitely

553
00:33:30.831 --> 00:33:33.960
scaling that,
um,
as we grow.
Um,

554
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.210
and so we're working with partners who can help us do that.
Um,

555
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.730
because we are in the consumables business.

556
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.390
It's not like you can just go to any place that's like also packing shirts,

557
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:47.810
shoes,
and um,
clearly I'm obsessed with shoes.
Um,

558
00:33:47.811 --> 00:33:52.160
but it's a different kind of distribution when you're like packaging up grocery,

559
00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:54.800
like items even in the non perishable space.
Uh,

560
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.750
but we definitely will be able to scale that.

561
00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.120
We are not shipping directly from our manufacturers.
Uh,

562
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.330
because like I said,
nobody buys one item.
Um,

563
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.470
people buy baskets because when you go on brandless you'll see it's the things

564
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:13.100
that you reach for every day.
Um,
and usually a better version of that.

565
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.030
<v 2>There's a question related to that in the dory.
Uh,</v>

566
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.730
how do you select suppliers behind brandless products?

567
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:23.090
What fraction of the products come from small businesses versus large

568
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:23.924
corporations?

569
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.740
This Brantley's plan to source more products that are produced locally or at

570
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:28.640
least in the u s

571
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.740
<v 0>so that's a fantastic question.
Uh,
we have very,</v>

572
00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:37.741
very strict and sophisticated sourcing policies and strategies because we never

573
00:34:39.761 --> 00:34:42.640
want to be to the point of that small shop.

574
00:34:42.641 --> 00:34:46.510
We never want to have our tomato sauce produced in someone's kitchen.

575
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.770
I'm not to suggest that the formulation can come from a fast fabulous recipe

576
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.120
there,
but we kind of want to be,

577
00:34:55.121 --> 00:34:59.650
I wouldn't say the smallest customer but one of those because we want to be able

578
00:34:59.651 --> 00:35:04.651
to expand and grow and we also make sure that the partners that we work with

579
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:11.140
live up to all of our standards.
So organics,
non GMO is et Cetera,
et cetera.

580
00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:14.680
And then all of the certifications that we put on the label and tell you about

581
00:35:14.681 --> 00:35:19.320
that product has passed through all of the Qa and um,

582
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.010
that they have to go through.

583
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:26.310
And I'm so all of the partners are very much put through that filter in that

584
00:35:26.921 --> 00:35:28.810
standard.
In addition,

585
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.960
we try and source as much as we can here in the u s and I would say the majority

586
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:37.120
of the assortment is um,
is developed here.

587
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.440
But there are cases where,
for example,

588
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:45.000
our pasta is our organic pastas and our organic olive oils come from Italy.

589
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.370
Um,
and so,
you know,

590
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:52.371
we are sourcing outside of the u s but it is our desire to do as much as we can

591
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:53.904
here.

592
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.400
<v 4>Hi.
Um,
so I,</v>

593
00:35:56.401 --> 00:36:00.740
I think I see a very strong value proposition there for users who actually have

594
00:36:00.741 --> 00:36:04.840
restrictions.
Like my sister is Blues Alley,
he's allergic to gluten.
So like,
uh,

595
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.980
having that wide variety is really exciting.
Um,

596
00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.380
so I'm thinking for the consumer who actually doesn't have a lot of restrictions

597
00:36:12.381 --> 00:36:16.820
or who doesn't really necessarily care about whether something is gluten free,

598
00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.510
non GMO,
um,
pound for pound,

599
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:24.700
how you actually cheaper than similar competitors.
Okay.

600
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.800
<v 0>Pound for pound.
So it's fantastic question.
Uh,
which is yes,</v>

601
00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:32.040
for those affinity groups,
the gluten frees,
the vegans,
et cetera.

602
00:36:32.041 --> 00:36:35.670
We have extraordinary products at very fair prices,

603
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.050
but also there's like not a single person in this country,
um,

604
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.700
that couldn't benefit from the on average 40% brand tax free savings,

605
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.430
um,
on national brands of equal quality.

606
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.170
So our organic peanut butters are organic.
Um,
um,

607
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.270
oils are organic sauces.

608
00:36:54.271 --> 00:36:58.770
Like if you're comparing those two organic products in,
um,

609
00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.240
at a retail location,

610
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:04.440
you're paying on average 40 to sometimes 200% more.

611
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.920
So the quality is extraordinary.
Um,

612
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.990
and their savings across the board.
Um,

613
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.420
and you shouldn't have to pay more for that.
And one thing I failed to say,

614
00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:18.680
and this is relevant to everyone in this room and everyone on the live stream.

615
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.170
Um,
but I know this is going to be on youtube for the public so I can't give away

616
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:26.990
the code,
but tomorrow when you get your perks email,
um,

617
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
we provided a special code for all Googlers to get 33% off of being more,

618
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.730
um,
so that you can have it for your families and that you can always get brown,

619
00:37:38.731 --> 00:37:42.690
listen your homes and that's for every Googler across the continental us.

620
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:46.980
So definitely please tell your lunch mates,

621
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:49.530
your cube mates,
people you see in the hallway,

622
00:37:49.531 --> 00:37:53.520
people you see on campus and that your friends across the community like

623
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:57.420
brandless is only going to be a community if the community helps us build it.

624
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.950
So we really wanted you guys to be able to participate in that way.

625
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.530
Hi,

626
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:07.850
<v 4>I was wondering if you can tell us,
and it's a non confidential information,</v>

627
00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:10.820
of course,
the most capital intensive part of your business

628
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.260
<v 0>because we have over,
you know,
we'll have by the end of the year,</v>

629
00:38:15.261 --> 00:38:19.490
probably like 250 products and then we'll be growing to more,

630
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:24.100
um,
you know,
definitely securing the inventory,
um,

631
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:29.020
putting the inventory into our distribution centers and turning that,
um,

632
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.120
is something that we're,
you know,
very,
very aware of,

633
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:36.310
but because sales are,
you know,
are gray,

634
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.710
then we're in the non perishable business,

635
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:41.770
but we're turning those things all the time.
Um,

636
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.660
but because we're a startup and we went from literally out hundred percent cold

637
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:50.980
start,
um,
we are doing everything from scratch,

638
00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:52.780
so we're building everything for the first time.

639
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:58.140
So it's not like we're optimizing our website or our servers or our data or

640
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:00.610
anything.
We're creating it.

641
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.450
The other thing about Brian lists is that we are completely vertically

642
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:05.284
integrated,

643
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:10.410
meaning that from the label to the photography to the packaging to the,

644
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.070
you know,
everything that you see at brandless,
um,

645
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.100
whether it's on Facebook or on Pinterest or on our website or in,

646
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:24.340
you know,
any setting,
everything we create ourselves.

647
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:29.790
And so we're also a content company because we're creating all of this content

648
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.340
about how to use it,
how to share it,
recipes,
all of that.

649
00:39:33.341 --> 00:39:34.990
And we're doing that all from scratch.

650
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:39.580
So there's an investment in building out the company and building out all of the

651
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:44.581
systems at all of the stories and all of those pieces and parts of,

652
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.450
um,
of making brandless um,
a community that you want to participate in.

653
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.980
<v 2>Another question from the Dory.</v>

654
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.080
How do you compete effectively with incumbents like P and g,
Unilever,
et Cetera,

655
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.190
and how do you overcome consumers' emotional attachment to love brands?

656
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.650
<v 0>I love that question.
Um,
the question is really,</v>

657
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.150
I'll take it in two parts.

658
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:11.140
The first question is how do we compete with Unilever and P and g or the,

659
00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:13.510
let's call those the incumbents.
And the installed base.

660
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.440
We're not trying to pick compete with P and g and Unilever because they don't

661
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:22.090
have any direct to consumer relationships.
So those companies,
um,

662
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.380
their customers,

663
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.160
our stores or what we call channels.

664
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.690
So whether it's Amazon or virtual store,
digital store or a physical store,

665
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.210
they don't have any direct to consumer relationships.

666
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.520
So we're not really competing with them because we're building a community.
Um,

667
00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:42.400
and they're really suppliers,
um,
to their channels.
Um,

668
00:40:42.401 --> 00:40:46.780
in terms of the second part of that question is for the beloved brands,

669
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:50.680
this stat,
especially for those in the room might come as a big surprise to you,

670
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:55.540
which is that of the top hundred CPG brands in America last year,

671
00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.880
90,
which by my math is 90%,
uh,
were in decline.

672
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.830
So the problem is that the millennial are perennial,

673
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:10.450
perennial meaning the mindset of that new consumer irrespective of their age,

674
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.350
um,
doesn't want to buy the brands they grew up with.

675
00:41:14.351 --> 00:41:16.870
There's a loss of trust.
Um,

676
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.340
there's an openness to wanting to meet companies who actually people want to do

677
00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:24.190
business with,
who believe are socially responsible,

678
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.080
who believe that they are listening and,

679
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:30.100
and living their values and that are transparent in the way in which they

680
00:41:30.101 --> 00:41:31.680
operate.
So we're,

681
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:35.510
we imagining what those relationships can be and do,
you know,

682
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:37.400
there are people that you know,

683
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:41.690
love their toothpaste or love their toilet paper.
Um,

684
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:45.680
but when you think about the amount of toothpaste and toilet paper that is

685
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:48.920
consumed in this country every day,
it's a very,

686
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:52.460
very big country and everybody,

687
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.520
at least I hope everybody is using toilet tissue of some sort and brushing their

688
00:41:59.181 --> 00:42:00.320
teeth at least once,

689
00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:03.290
but recommended three times if you were to going to go to the American dental

690
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.270
association and look at their best practices.

691
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:10.190
So there's a lot of opportunity to build new relationships and men introduced

692
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:14.330
new products and new,
um,
and new ways of buying them.

693
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.103
<v 3>Uh,</v>

694
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:19.700
so obviously there's a ton that goes into starting a company from getting people

695
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:24.380
to fill all the jobs that need to get done to,
uh,
looking for funding.
Um,

696
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:28.070
and just setting yourself for a successful setting yourself up for a successful

697
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:30.020
launch.
Can you talk about like the,
uh,

698
00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:33.140
the journey from like the day you had the idea to the day you actually launched?

699
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.990
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
so the journey of,
uh,
you know,</v>

700
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.540
incubation,
uh,
so ido and I met,
um,

701
00:42:42.541 --> 00:42:45.400
we both were doing a different jobs.

702
00:42:45.401 --> 00:42:49.840
I was running Sherpa foundry and I was a venture partner at Sherpa capital and

703
00:42:49.841 --> 00:42:52.810
he was the founding CEO of Ubi,
uh,

704
00:42:52.811 --> 00:42:57.470
the stationary supply company that gives back and cheeky the tabletop company,

705
00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.160
um,
that makes,
you know,
dishes and plates and bowls.

706
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:05.161
I'm all sold at target and around the country and probably many other companies

707
00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:08.980
that he was developing with his partners.
And we said,

708
00:43:08.981 --> 00:43:10.300
we have to do something together.

709
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.410
So that was probably maybe like even two years before,

710
00:43:14.411 --> 00:43:17.740
if not longer before we actually decided,
uh,

711
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:21.550
to start to think about what we could do together.
Um,

712
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.190
at the time that we sat down and said,

713
00:43:24.191 --> 00:43:29.191
let's incubate this and let's brainstorm from the time that we actually launched

714
00:43:30.011 --> 00:43:31.570
the company.
Um,

715
00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.600
we probably incubated it for maybe a year or a year and a half before.

716
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.190
I'm a friend who was a venture capitalist,
said,
wait,

717
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:45.910
you're incubating something.
Um,
we would love to see that.

718
00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.250
And this turned out to be,
you know,

719
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:52.290
a very sophisticated late stage and early stage investor,

720
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.520
Jeff Brody at red point.
And he said,

721
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:58.780
I want to seed fund this company because I know you and I believe in you and I

722
00:43:58.781 --> 00:44:00.670
believe in what you're doing.
Um,

723
00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:03.670
but even if I don't believe in what you're doing,
I believe in you.

724
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.010
And when you're funding a seed company,

725
00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:09.400
it's really about investing in the people because you're going to learn and

726
00:44:09.401 --> 00:44:12.430
pivot and do lots of things before you actually launch that company.

727
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:16.660
So once we secured the seed funding,

728
00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:20.830
I knew that I had to transition out of my day job.
Um,

729
00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.640
and so I replaced myself and said,
okay,

730
00:44:24.641 --> 00:44:28.480
I'm going to be the CEO of the company because I was like the acting CEO and Ito

731
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:32.280
was the acting chairman,
but we were still doing,
excuse me,

732
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:37.020
all these other things and we hadn't made any commitments to like launching it

733
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:40.770
or we hadn't taken any capital yet.
Once we started to do that,
we said,
okay,

734
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:45.771
well what are the things that we have to learn and prove to your question of the

735
00:44:45.781 --> 00:44:49.770
margin?
Um,
can we actually source these things at this price point?

736
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.990
Can we create a Ui and Ux for the packaging,

737
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:59.991
which had never really been done in CPG where everything that we do has the

738
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:03.870
attributes that matter and the way in which we label things and the way in which

739
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:08.580
we communicate the values and the attributes of every single product.
Um,

740
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.570
could we create a system that would scale once we felt like we could do that,

741
00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:16.100
we started to recruit the right people,
um,

742
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.830
who actually had the world class expertise to join our team.

743
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.910
And then once we started to do that and we realize that we felt like we had a

744
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:27.000
runway,
they're like,
we saw the path to,
to,

745
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:31.920
to actually bringing this to market.
Then a red point said,
you know what,

746
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:36.630
we want to lead the series a.
And so once that happened I said,

747
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:39.810
okay,
I'm going to like shift and be the full time CEO,

748
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.220
raise that funding and then really begin to recruit the team.

749
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.230
But um,
up until that point,
even though we knew our name was brown lists,

750
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.240
we were operating under a code name,
uh,
which is a little known story actually.

751
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:56.730
Entrepreneur magazine I think wrote about that,
which was funny.

752
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.860
They thought that was really interesting,

753
00:45:58.861 --> 00:46:03.861
which is that we operated under a phone name because we didn't want to tip our

754
00:46:03.901 --> 00:46:06.540
hand to the industries that we might be disrupting.

755
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:11.470
And so all until we raised a series a,
we were operating under a phone name.

756
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.760
We had a foe,
linkedin,
we had a foe website,

757
00:46:14.761 --> 00:46:18.270
we had full business cards for email addresses,
everything.
Um,

758
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.160
because we were in sort of supplier conversations to like make sure,

759
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:27.390
and we didn't want to sort of tip our hand to what we were actually doing.
A,

760
00:46:27.391 --> 00:46:32.170
but then once we raised a series a,
then we came out as brandless.
Uh,

761
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.410
we relaunched the website,
not the commerce site,
but the sort of marketing side,

762
00:46:36.411 --> 00:46:40.830
you know,
while we were building it.
Um,
and then we started recruiting the actual,

763
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.630
you know,
scale team engineering product,
you know,
merge,
everybody,
marketing,

764
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:48.930
et Cetera.
Um,
and we were off to the races.

765
00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:53.400
We then knew that we were going to launch in July and we didn't really need to

766
00:46:53.401 --> 00:46:55.290
raise yet.
Um,

767
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.530
but some folks had heard about our launch.

768
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.460
And so some of those folks are actually Google.
Um,

769
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.310
and NEA,
uh,
Google ventures,

770
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:09.600
not Google or alphabet.
Um,
so,
uh,

771
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.790
Google ventures in NEA came to us and said,

772
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:15.810
we're very excited about what you're doing and we know you're launching and like

773
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:20.280
three weeks or whatever.
It was very,
very tight.
And,
um,

774
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.160
but we really believe in it and we want to be a part of it.

775
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.350
And so we raised our series B,
um,
before we ever launched.

776
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:33.260
And in fact we announced the launch and the series being on the same day.
So,
um,

777
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.410
that was kinda crazy.
Um,

778
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:40.411
and then we launched on seven 11 on slurpee day and Amazon Prime Day.

779
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.573
Who knew

780
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.390
<v 5>from the,
from the time you probably at the time the idea was conceptualized,</v>

781
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:52.270
did the idea or your execution stayed on that same track or you had to pivot?

782
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.590
<v 0>That's a great question.
No,
we actually like,
it's remarkable.</v>

783
00:47:56.591 --> 00:47:59.950
I haven't talked to 'em Edo.
Um,
but uh,

784
00:47:59.951 --> 00:48:03.970
we stayed on the exact same track.
Um,

785
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:07.600
I haven't mentioned that to Edo recently that like can you believe that like our

786
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:10.480
first business plan,
like everything we thought we were going to do,
we did.

787
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.480
And in fact,
funny story was that we started,
um,

788
00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:19.240
under embargo going to talk to the media around the march time frame for the

789
00:48:19.241 --> 00:48:22.660
July launch,
which is really a long time to be under embargo.

790
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:27.100
And so we had this fun and we only had at the time,

791
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:30.400
like a PowerPoint with jpegs.
We didn't have all the,

792
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:31.780
I mean the products were being developed,

793
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:34.450
but we didn't have the products with us.
Um,

794
00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.000
so we would go in and we would talk to these journalists,

795
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:39.410
many of whom we knew because you know,
we've been doing like,
you know,

796
00:48:39.411 --> 00:48:42.400
I hadn't relationships from other companies,
whatever.
And you know,

797
00:48:42.401 --> 00:48:45.220
when I would tell the story and we would tell them about these incredible

798
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:48.700
products,
they're organic,
they're non GMO,
they're this,
they're this,
they're this.

799
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:53.860
And,
and then we'd wait like three,
two,
one,
they're all $3.

800
00:48:53.861 --> 00:48:54.940
And at that moment,

801
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:58.660
then we would go silent and the journalists would all say to us,
like,

802
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:03.130
you gotta be kidding.
Get outta here.
Stop horsing around.
And Tada.
They were like,

803
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:07.480
stop wasting our time.
We're like,
no,
they're really all $3.

804
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:10.240
Like we swear.
In fact,
that's not true.
Some are two for three,
summer,

805
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:14.710
three for three.
And so once they kind of like process that idea,

806
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:19.030
um,
and then we got them the samples under embargo,
um,
they were all like,

807
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:21.850
how quickly can I get it for myself because they loved it.

808
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:27.280
So then Ito called me up about two weeks before the launch and he said,

809
00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:31.330
I'm mad at you.
And I said,
what do you mean you're mad at me?
He said,

810
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.170
we never recorded all of those meetings.
And like on July 12th,

811
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.880
everyone will know and we can't do that.
Like,
same story.
I said,
you know what,

812
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:44.710
it's not too late.
And so our creative director,
Jenn tank,
um,
and I said,

813
00:49:44.711 --> 00:49:48.940
you know what,
we have two weeks.
So we put an ad in craigslist and we said,

814
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:53.941
we're looking for some actors to come to a food tasting at a startup in San

815
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.200
Francisco.
That's all we told them.
Um,

816
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.040
and the reason we wanted to actors was because we were on such a tight budget,

817
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:00.760
um,

818
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.300
that we were hoping that actors would more likely have like good expressions on

819
00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:07.690
their faces if we tried this,
this PR thing.
But we didn't,

820
00:50:07.691 --> 00:50:08.920
they didn't know what we were doing.

821
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.830
And we did the exact same thing except a little,

822
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:15.580
they actually got more than the journalists because they had more than jpegs.

823
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:19.930
We took the mentor generic conference room and we just put the food out just

824
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:22.930
like it's here.
Um,
and then they tasted it.

825
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.800
And then we walk them into this room.
And maybe we can put this on live stream.

826
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:30.650
I mean,
on the recorded thing.
Um,

827
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.070
the room next door to the conference room is what we call the brandless lab.

828
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.640
And it's kind of my version of the Willy Wonka chocolate room.

829
00:50:37.641 --> 00:50:40.250
There's no chocolate river,
although maybe in a new real estate,

830
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:41.720
I can get that written into the deal.

831
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:46.190
My fantasy to have a chocolate river in the office.
But that's just me.
Um,

832
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:51.420
and so
we showed them everything and we said,
all these things that you've tasted,

833
00:50:51.421 --> 00:50:53.520
that the DA,
it's all $3.

834
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:57.060
And we got the exact same reaction of the journalists.
Like,

835
00:50:57.061 --> 00:51:00.260
what are you kidding me?
Stop it.
That's a possible,
that era.

836
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.080
And then we called that awesome strangers and that was the video that we

837
00:51:04.081 --> 00:51:06.610
launched with,
which were these people coming in,

838
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.470
tasting and then seeing it and then having that reaction.
So in truth,

839
00:51:10.471 --> 00:51:14.580
we didn't change it from the beginning.
Um,
but we tried to,

840
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.390
we found that consistently the reaction now maybe if the reaction hadn't been so

841
00:51:18.391 --> 00:51:20.640
good we have changed it.
But,
um,

842
00:51:20.641 --> 00:51:23.610
the team has done such an extraordinary job at creating products that people

843
00:51:23.611 --> 00:51:24.444
really love.

844
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:26.943
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

845
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.560
<v 0>Why $3?
That's a great question.</v>

846
00:51:29.561 --> 00:51:33.490
So I would say three reasons because we love threes.
Um,

847
00:51:33.491 --> 00:51:38.491
so the first reason was that part of the brandless experience,

848
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.520
um,
and when you go and you check it out is that

849
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:48.930
all of us are completely paralyzed by what's called now the paradox of choice.

850
00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:51.450
That there's like you go to the drug store,

851
00:51:51.451 --> 00:51:53.970
you go to the supermarket and there's,
as I said before,

852
00:51:53.971 --> 00:51:58.050
50 feet of salad dressing,
300 sauces to choose from.
It's like what?

853
00:51:58.051 --> 00:52:01.710
Like how do I even choose?
So part of our,
our,
our,

854
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.790
our opportunity with to simplify everything,
including the price.

855
00:52:05.791 --> 00:52:08.580
Like what's the difference between two 89,

856
00:52:08.581 --> 00:52:13.380
four 62 m six 21 for 32.
Like it's just,

857
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:17.070
what is that?
That's like a manipulation.
So simplifying,

858
00:52:17.071 --> 00:52:22.071
it was one of our objectives being completely easy and transparent to navigate.

859
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.970
And the most important thing is that when we studied the organics and naturals

860
00:52:26.971 --> 00:52:31.740
market,
um,
the sort of what we call better for you,
organic,
Vegan,
non GMO,

861
00:52:31.741 --> 00:52:35.340
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
that market,
if you look at that filter,

862
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.220
$3 is not the entry point into that market.

863
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:43.560
And so our goal was to like what we call blow the doors off the front of the

864
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:48.561
building and make it much more accessible to a much broader swath of people

865
00:52:49.051 --> 00:52:53.760
because in our intention was that everyone deserves better and better than have

866
00:52:53.761 --> 00:52:57.510
to cost more.
And so we were very deliberate.
So it was simplification,

867
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:02.880
it was ease and making a much broader addressable audience.

868
00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:04.720
<v 6>Okay.</v>

869
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.900
<v 7>Hi.
Thank you for being here.
First of all,</v>

870
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.810
it seems like with the quality of the product and also the price point,

871
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.090
you're product is ideal for like a low income community.
Um,

872
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:22.360
do you have plans to,
I guess even with the,
well let me rephrase that.

873
00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.940
It's great for the low income community.
However,

874
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:29.110
know that there's like digital divide in those communities as well.
So are there,

875
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.770
do you have plans for your company too?

876
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.630
I really penetrate this market and really reach these customers.

877
00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.810
<v 0>Absolutely.
So I love that question because,
um,
the thing that I was saying about,</v>

878
00:53:38.811 --> 00:53:42.530
and you said what were some early surprises because when we launched it,

879
00:53:42.531 --> 00:53:45.290
we just sort of put it out there,
right?
We were like,
let's just see a,

880
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.900
if you build it,
they will come.
And they did.

881
00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:53.380
And so we've been hearing from so many people across the country that either

882
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:59.170
were living in food deserts where they didn't have access to all,

883
00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.760
you know,
organic,
non GMO is et Cetera,

884
00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:06.200
or are they couldn't afford that for their family and for their first time

885
00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:09.860
they're able to afford that and they're able to have access to it.
Um,

886
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:14.690
and the digital divide is not as bad as the food desert divide.

887
00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:19.040
And so,
uh,
what we're finding is that the installed base of,
you know,

888
00:54:19.041 --> 00:54:21.470
mobile phones and Wifi networks,
et Cetera,

889
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.700
it's much broader than the food.
Uh,
and,

890
00:54:24.701 --> 00:54:29.701
and p deeply penetrated then access to quality organic and non GMO foods and

891
00:54:30.771 --> 00:54:34.280
goods for families.
So we totally have plans,

892
00:54:34.281 --> 00:54:38.330
but we're already executing on those plans.
But we're not done.
I mean,

893
00:54:38.331 --> 00:54:40.760
we're going to go to every town.
We're going to drive,

894
00:54:40.761 --> 00:54:45.761
you know what I call the United States of goodness tour and go out and really

895
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.580
meet people.
Uh,

896
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.740
what I would like to do when those communities is not so much offered them

897
00:54:51.741 --> 00:54:54.020
brandless because they can get that today.

898
00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.370
What I would like to do is meet the awesome strangers that live there and really

899
00:54:58.371 --> 00:55:02.510
tell them that they deserve better and really tell them that they're already

900
00:55:02.511 --> 00:55:05.660
awesome and they shouldn't have a sense that they're not,

901
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.720
or that they're less than because they're not less than.

902
00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:13.120
And so if everyone starts to believe that they deserve better and that they're

903
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.710
already awesome and they can afford that,

904
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:17.780
maybe that will give them more confidence.

905
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.020
Maybe that will create a better conversation at the dinner table.

906
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:24.530
Maybe that will help people sleep better.
I mean,
we have nutritionals,

907
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:28.880
a men's Multivitamin,
a women's Multivitamin,
Melatonin,
antioxidants,

908
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:30.050
all $3,

909
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:35.290
like access to these things that they didn't have access to before because a pin

910
00:55:35.781 --> 00:55:36.411
afford it.

911
00:55:36.411 --> 00:55:41.411
B didn't have a store near them or see we're an educated about the values of

912
00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:45.680
those types of products should be changing now.
Um,

913
00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.270
but the most important thing,

914
00:55:47.271 --> 00:55:50.420
the business that would like to be in is the confidence business.

915
00:55:50.421 --> 00:55:54.890
Cause I don't care how you voted,
I don't care what your socioeconomic classes,

916
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.160
I don't care what your race,
your religion,
like any of that,

917
00:55:58.161 --> 00:55:59.790
like you deserve better.

918
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:03.580
And if you strip away all those layers and all those targets and all the ways

919
00:56:03.581 --> 00:56:07.840
that we have filtered ourselves as people,
we forgotten like what we're here for.

920
00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.400
Like we're all the same.

921
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:14.380
And this country was built on that and this company was built on the idea that

922
00:56:14.381 --> 00:56:15.580
everyone deserves it.

923
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.590
And it's not okay to have a divine whatever's happening in Washington.

924
00:56:20.591 --> 00:56:24.550
Like we can change the system.
But by going into the system,

925
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:25.870
by building another system,

926
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:29.380
I mean that's what this company was built on and that's what our company is

927
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:30.160
built on.

928
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.220
We're just trying to change a different kind of system and trying to get back to

929
00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:36.400
the values that we actually believe in as human beings.

930
00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:40.750
Like we're in the human being business and all human beings were created
equally.

931
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.680
And this idea that people have to choose,
it's just not okay.

932
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.840
But that doesn't mean everybody has $3.
And so we want to help those people too.

933
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:52.930
And that's why we partnered with feeding America.
And that's why we're trying to,

934
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:57.931
people should teach people about tangible acts of kindness because if you just

935
00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.000
make eye contact with a stranger,

936
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.510
like maybe that'll make their day better and if that makes their day better,

937
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:08.260
maybe they'll work harder or maybe there'll be kinder to their loved ones or

938
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:12.160
maybe their kids will feel more inspired and work harder.
Like who knows.

939
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:15.670
But I just think it starts with a smile from my perspective.

940
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.050
<v 8>Thank you very much for coming here.</v>

941
00:57:19.051 --> 00:57:24.020
I really love the idea behind the brand list.
Thanks.
Sure.
Since you like threes,

942
00:57:24.021 --> 00:57:26.610
I have three questions but they guidelines.

943
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.970
So the first one is about products.
Um,

944
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.600
I either send for a more expensive product,

945
00:57:33.601 --> 00:57:35.880
like olive oil is what we discussed.

946
00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.940
A three means low quantity and these potentially could mean,

947
00:57:41.521 --> 00:57:44.460
you know,
like more ways for packaging and things like that.

948
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:46.510
Do you have plans to move like,
I don't know,

949
00:57:46.511 --> 00:57:51.511
like $13 packages or something so that you can get much more,

950
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.600
uh,
uh,
you know,

951
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:58.610
like a paper on this or a olive oil or anything like that without more,

952
00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:04.080
you know,
without,
with less damage to the environment.
And,
uh,
then,
uh,

953
00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.890
the other two questions about the company.
Uh,

954
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:11.810
you said you were using phone,
uh,
for,
uh,

955
00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:16.950
um,
names and emails and stuff.
Uh,
when did you,

956
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:21.860
uh,
uh,
trademark brand less and other related,
uh,
uh,

957
00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:26.660
slogans and things like that so that you didn't dip off,
uh,
you know,
uh,

958
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:30.020
uh,
in Cubans and uh,

959
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:34.500
the third question is about the Capitol building the company.

960
00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.860
Uh,
how much did you use off the shelf components?
Uh,
you know,
sees them,

961
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:42.600
like putting things in the cloud and things like that to reduce cost on that.

962
00:58:42.601 --> 00:58:44.700
Since you are building everything from Scott,
thank you very much.

963
00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:48.800
<v 0>So I'm going to try a,
those are three very unrelated questions.</v>

964
00:58:48.801 --> 00:58:53.090
So I'm going to see how fast file my brain is and the ability to answer those.

965
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:57.650
The first question is about how we thought about limited waste in our packaging.

966
00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.610
And the answer to that is unequivocably yes.
Um,
you know,

967
00:59:01.611 --> 00:59:04.550
you have to remember that we're only sort of 20 weeks old,

968
00:59:04.551 --> 00:59:07.160
but we are working to create the most efficient,

969
00:59:07.161 --> 00:59:11.780
just what matters packaging and sizing.
Um,
whenever we can.

970
00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:16.910
I'm so you'd be surprised,
but it's like the little things.
For example,
um,

971
00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:21.210
I remember Rachel who's,
um,
our head merchant and I were talking about Ahmond's.

972
00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.530
I'm sometime in,
I don't know,
February or March.
Um,

973
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:29.410
and not only did she source and create this incredible assortment of nuts and

974
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:34.160
mixes and all of that,
but the almond bad that you buy,

975
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:36.350
um,
it's resealable.

976
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.920
And so what I love about that is that you don't have to eat all of them at once,

977
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.110
but you don't have to like clip it or throw it away or serve it.

978
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:48.470
You can actually reseal the bag.
So it's not just about the size,

979
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:52.430
it's about being very intentional in trying to make your packaging work as hard

980
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:54.890
as it can for you.
That's the first thing.

981
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.720
The second thing is about,
um,

982
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:04.160
you asked,
we first you asked about the packaging.

983
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:07.370
I know the third question was about the deployment of the capitol.
Oh,

984
01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:11.000
about when we Mark Brown lists.
So this is a funny story too,

985
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:15.800
which is that we trademark brand lists like way before we ever,

986
01:00:15.801 --> 01:00:17.120
um,
just when,

987
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:22.150
even probably before the seed and when we were just incubated the idea and all

988
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:25.610
of our NDAs people that were working with us,

989
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:30.611
both suppliers as well as potential recruits sign these NDAs.

990
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:36.220
And in the NDA it said the name brandless and not a single person actually

991
01:00:38.181 --> 01:00:39.014
noticed,

992
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.310
which I think is funny because we said that the operating name of the company

993
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:47.600
was Dosey.
Um,
but in the NDA that his people had to sign,

994
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:51.290
it said brandless in the fine print.
And nobody ever said anything,

995
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:52.430
which we just were waiting.

996
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:55.960
Cause I remember having a conversation with the lawyers know we can't put Brevis

997
01:00:55.961 --> 01:00:59.630
and the NDA.
We can't disclose.
And it turned out that we had to,

998
01:00:59.631 --> 01:01:02.260
because it was a real company that you were in a,
you know,

999
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:04.970
in nondisclosure with and nobody ever saw it.

1000
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.080
And the third question was about the use of proceeds and how we broke down the

1001
01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:12.050
budget and what we're using for cloud computing versus,

1002
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:16.670
I didn't get that last part off the shelf components.
So,
um,

1003
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.340
so that's a fantastic question too because you know,

1004
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:23.210
we could have probably launched earlier if we had gone with like,
you know,

1005
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:26.180
a Shopify or some sort of a,
you know,
a turnkey,

1006
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.330
but we really felt that in order to build the kind of community,
uh,

1007
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.400
where we really owned all of our data and that that data belong to our ability

1008
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:39.470
to be able to create the most remarkable experiences.

1009
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:43.580
And that even if we were sort of MVP,

1010
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.670
it was better to be MVP and to have the kind of,
um,

1011
01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.150
own solutions on the,
excuse me,
core,

1012
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.290
um,
the core data and architecture of what we were building.

1013
01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.760
And then when it came to like,
you know,
ESPs and other places around,
you know,

1014
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.330
emails scaling and you know,
other things like that,
uh,

1015
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:09.860
that we can work with third parties and we didn't have to build those things

1016
01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:13.700
ourselves.
But when it came to things that were like core to the experience,

1017
01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.010
those we felt we really needed to own.

1018
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.820
And so we made the decision build by license on sort of every aperture and we

1019
01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:23.070
continue to do that.
What about on the product side,

1020
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:26.370
off the shelf products that then you brand us brand lists.

1021
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.010
Do you do any of that as well?
Um,
well there,

1022
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.590
there is no such thing as an off the shelf product.

1023
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:35.820
I would say that in the case of what is a proprietary formulation,
um,

1024
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:39.990
when it comes to organic brown sugar,
organic flour,
organic sugar,

1025
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.910
organic Oregano,
like there's not a lot of formulation that's happening there.

1026
01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:49.290
It's so it's like the packaging and the just what matters when it comes to sort

1027
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:50.250
of,
you know,

1028
01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:55.251
are things where we are a cocreating and co formulating with our partners.

1029
01:02:56.010 --> 01:03:00.930
You know,
we look at everything.
Um,
you know,
on a,
a case by case basis.

1030
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:05.220
Great.
Well thank you everyone for coming.
It was great to have you tank.
