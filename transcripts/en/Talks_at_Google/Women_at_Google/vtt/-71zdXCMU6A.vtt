WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.140
I am really excited to have such a full room and I know we have a lot of people

2
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:10.860
on the live stream and a lot more people still who can't make either and are

3
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:14.730
looking forward to seeing this up on youtube,
which will be the case.
Uh,

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.930
in the next few days.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.320
I'm really excited to introduce Professor Carol Dweck from Stanford University.

6
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.800
She's the Lewis and Virginia eat and professor of psychology.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.810
She is best known for her work on mindsets that people use to guide their

8
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:31.644
behavior.

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.850
She earned a BA in psychology from Columbia University and then a phd in

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.410
psychology from Yale sees the author of a bestselling book,

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.530
a mindset,
the new psychology of success.
And despite traffic,
uh,

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.000
a bunch of books arrived at the back of the room,

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.180
which you can purchase afterwards.
I certainly encourage you to do so.

14
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
There's Mike,
well thumbs copy,
it sold over a million copies.

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.380
So there are many of your friends out there who have enjoyed this work.

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.450
She's a frequent speaker,

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.350
has spoken on the Ted Stage Multiple Times at the United Nations,

18
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:08.490
the White House among other prestigious organizations.

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
Her work has won so many awards that I find named them all.

20
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:14.760
That would be the entire talk.
So I'm not going to do that.

21
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.640
And now that I have incredibly boosted or are you go,

22
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.040
I'd like to bring up professor to way

23
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.870
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.110
<v 0>All right,
before we get into mindsets,</v>

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.250
I want you to share what we've learned from what is now the widely discredited

26
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:36.220
theory of self esteem and the self,

27
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.960
<v 2>the steam.
In the 1990s,</v>

28
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.320
the self esteem movement took over the world.
Uh,

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.050
we were told to tell everyone how fabulous,
brilliant,

30
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:49.621
talented,

31
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:54.621
special day where all the time this was going to motivate them and boost their

32
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:58.740
achievement.
Instead,
as you said,

33
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:00.600
it was a complete disaster.

34
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.010
It was led to the acceptance of mediocrity.

35
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
It didn't challenge people to fulfill their potential.

36
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.360
And our search showed telling people they're smart actually backfires.

37
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.970
It makes them afraid of challenges.

38
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.971
It makes them a fold and the face of obstacles because they're worried,

39
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.100
oh,
does this not look smart?
Am I not smart?

40
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:29.940
The whole currency is built around smart.
Yes.

41
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.090
<v 0>So what triggered your interest in,</v>

42
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:35.580
in going deeper and in researching how people are motivated and learn and how

43
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:38.400
did that lead to your definition of mindsets?

44
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.380
<v 2>I was always interested in why some people wilted in the face of failure,</v>

45
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.320
shied away from challenges when people who were no more talented or able or

46
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.370
embracing challenges and thriving in the face of failure.

47
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.740
Ultimately,

48
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.741
this led to our discovery of the mindsets and what we found was that some people

49
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.880
believe their talents and abilities are just these fixed traits.

50
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.950
You have a certain amount and that's it.

51
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.910
But other people believe talents and abilities can be developed through hard

52
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:22.630
work,
good strategies,
good mentoring from others.
Um,

53
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.160
through years of work,

54
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:29.161
we found that having a fixed mindset led you to be afraid of challenges that

55
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.961
might unmask and your deficiencies made you withdraw and the face of difficulty

56
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.260
because you felt stupid.
You didn't want to feel stupid.

57
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.420
And when other people don't think you were stupid.

58
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.940
Whereas having this growth mindset,

59
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.970
the idea that your abilities could be developed made you think,

60
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.120
why waste my time looking smart when I couldn't be getting smarter?

61
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.330
And I do that through taking on challenges.

62
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.630
I do that through seeing,
seeing them through.

63
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.600
Now growth mindset doesn't mean everyone's the same,

64
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:07.000
that they don't different talent and abilities.

65
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.090
It just means everyone can grow.

66
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.670
<v 0>It's sort of building on that you really can't watch a sports broadcast or the</v>

67
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.200
TV show.
America's got talent,

68
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.890
which has telling them the name without hearing hotel did that player is,

69
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.450
or seeing someone performed the ballet and then say she has tremendous talent.

70
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.310
Um,
what role,
if any,
does innate talent play?
Yeah,

71
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.950
<v 2>well they do have talent now when we were watching them,</v>

72
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.220
but I think it's created a nation that thinks when they see someone displaying

73
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:43.620
talent or incredible performance,

74
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.860
they were born that way and they've had this inevitable rise to great success.

75
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.110
I teach a freshman seminar at Stanford every year and I have my students do an

76
00:04:55.111 --> 00:05:00.111
assignment where they do research on their hero and almost invariably they think

77
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:06.411
that hero just catapulted to success because of this amazing inborn talent.

78
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.210
Um,

79
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.210
but every single time they find that the hero put in inordinate amounts of work,

80
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.030
um,
met with obstacles and really powered through them.

81
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.840
Uh,
so I don't rule out the idea,

82
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.841
the fact that some people are born with passions and talents and build those,

83
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.110
but many people who never achieve anything are also born with talents and

84
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.950
passions that they don't see through.
Um,
and uh,
what's there,

85
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:44.070
what we come with.
That's the raw material that you,

86
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.800
you've got to develop Michael Jordan.
It turns out,

87
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.820
wasn't particularly talented until he went at it so ferociously more ferociously

88
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.920
than anyone else.

89
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.540
<v 0>So you talked about over over lunch we had an itching discussion with part of</v>

90
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.500
the team here about a growth mindset,
fixed mindset.

91
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.590
It's a great simplified way to think of it.
Yeah.
People can have both.

92
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.920
And it's more of a spectrum.
Talk a little bit more about,
about how you can be,

93
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:10.910
it'd be have both mine

94
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.940
<v 2>since
we're all a mixture.
Um,</v>

95
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it's true that you can have a fixed mindset in one area and a growth mindset and

96
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:26.220
other area.
But even,
and it's true that it's a spectrum man,

97
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:29.610
a dichotomy,
but it's a really dynamic,

98
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.230
even in a given area,
sometimes you're in a fixed mindset using,

99
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.540
oh,
uh,
my ability to fix.
I have to prove them.
I have to look smart.

100
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:44.490
I can't show that I'm working too hard.
People might not think I'm so smart,

101
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.330
and other times we could be more in a growth mindset.

102
00:06:48.331 --> 00:06:53.331
So what we have to start doing is looking for what triggers that?

103
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.190
Because the fixed mindset holds us back.

104
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.550
We have to start looking for what triggers it and all of us,
even me.
Um,

105
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.710
what happens when you're facing a big challenge?
Uh,

106
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.740
do you worry about,
well,
I'm going to unmask deficiencies.

107
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.150
What happens when there's a setback?
Do you think maybe I'm not good at this?

108
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.000
What happens when you're receiving criticism?

109
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.640
Do you get angry and defensive?

110
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.850
What happens when you see someone who's better at you and what you're good at?

111
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.760
Do you feel jealous and resentful or do you feel inspired?

112
00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:34.180
Maybe I can learn from that person.
Maybe they can mentor me.
Uh,

113
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.070
so watch out at these trigger moments.

114
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.280
See how you're feeling and see if you can get yourself into more of a growth

115
00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:44.184
mindset.

116
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.630
<v 0>So I actually,
I have two children,
two daughters,
uh,</v>

117
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.260
college age and high school age.
I,
I read your book,
uh,

118
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.210
after my older daughter was,
was uh,
approaching high school,

119
00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:57.150
but my younger daughter benefited from it to the point where I've banned the two

120
00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:00.510
s words that our house smart and stupid.
I never used the ladder,

121
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.380
but I was very guilty of using the former and raise your hands if you've used,

122
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:07.770
if you've told a friend or a child or a loved one,
how smart they are,

123
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.700
deal.
What's that?

124
00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:14.460
Words are really powerful is one thing I took away from your book.

125
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.310
Talk about trigger words like that.
SMART,

126
00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:20.430
stupid and how those can work against your best intentions.

127
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.470
<v 2>Yes.
When you call someone smart,</v>

128
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.630
you put them in a box or really you're kind of putting them on a pedestal and

129
00:08:30.631 --> 00:08:35.440
their life becomes organized around deserving the pedestal,

130
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:36.900
staying on the pedestal.

131
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.320
And you can only do that by narrowing your life to include only things.

132
00:08:44.011 --> 00:08:48.480
You're sure you're good at only things you're sure you can succeed at.

133
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.410
Um,
when we tell someone you did that so quickly,

134
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.360
I'm so impressed they here.
If I didn't do it quickly,

135
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:58.950
you wouldn't be impressed.

136
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.720
And a lot of things take a long time.
Um,
or Yay,

137
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.690
you got an,
you got an a without working then use,
they think,

138
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.120
oh,
if I work,

139
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.320
you're not going to think I'm smart at math.
Say.

140
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.890
And so that you're just very subtly conveying these ideas that I'm smart.

141
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.640
People don't make mistakes.
Smart people don't have to work hard.

142
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.840
The most important thing in the world is to be smarter and look smarter at all

143
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:31.381
times.

144
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:36.381
And then people start narrowing their world so they can succeed within that

145
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:37.620
fixed mindset.

146
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.530
<v 0>So one thing a Google that we're obsessed with is,
is,
is proving things for data.</v>

147
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.310
And I think one of the compelling arguments made was around the research you did

148
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.970
with children in a school environment to talk about some of that early research

149
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:54.050
and how it's evolved to reinforce that,
that there's weight behind this concept.

150
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.320
<v 2>Yes,
we've done research now with</v>

151
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.400
tens of thousands of students.

152
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.670
First finding that those who naturally have a growth mindset do better.

153
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.450
We've traced them over challenging,

154
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.450
especially in challenging courses like premed,

155
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:20.340
organic chemistry or challenging transitions.
Um,

156
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.880
seventh grade high school,
college transitions.

157
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:26.190
We've studied all of those recently.

158
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:31.191
We studied all of the 10th grade students in the country of Chile and we are

159
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:33.390
170,000.

160
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.350
And we found that at every level of family income,

161
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:42.351
those who believe they could develop their intelligence performed substantially

162
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:47.700
higher on achievement tests.
And those who thought they couldn't.

163
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.350
And the most striking thing was that among the poorest kids,

164
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.810
those who had a growth mindset,

165
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.530
we're performing at the level of much wealthier kids.
Um,

166
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.940
but importantly,
cause those are correlations.

167
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:08.150
We've done a number of studies where we have taught students at growth mindset,

168
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:14.090
the idea that every time they do a really hard task and stick to it,

169
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.990
the neurons in their brain form new connections and they can get smarter.

170
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.110
And when we show them how to put that into practice,
um,

171
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.340
we have found that students who learn this fair better across challenging

172
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:34.830
courses and transitions.
Uh,
we just,
uh,
showed that in,
um,

173
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.750
a study of women in stem classes at,

174
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.460
um,
at universities around the country.
Uh,
but we've showed that,

175
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.490
shown that at the transition to college transition to high school and s and so

176
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:50.400
forth.

177
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.400
So teaching a growth mindset leads kids to take on the challenges dick to them

178
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.710
and improve.

179
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.330
<v 0>So in our current education culture,
and then I want to switch into,</v>

180
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.520
in the work environment,

181
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.640
there's such an obsession with standardized tests and those tests having a

182
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.110
Marilyn material impact on teachers advancement and even in some cases their

183
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.720
income.
How do you,
uh,

184
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.330
how do school systems battle on that front at the same time?
Uh,

185
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.510
tackle growth mindset,

186
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:25.230
which is more about working hard and process than the actual end result.

187
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.143
<v 2>Yes.</v>

188
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:32.140
It's such an interesting story because standardized tests were brought in for

189
00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:33.284
good reason.

190
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.950
There were students in certain parts of the country and in certain schools who

191
00:12:39.081 --> 00:12:43.970
were performing so poorly and nobody knew.
And nobody cared.

192
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.330
And it was an attempt to say let's not cheat kids out of a good education.

193
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:55.150
But we all know the unanticipated an an an an intended consequences school

194
00:12:56.961 --> 00:13:01.961
became about standardized tests and many teachers feeling that their jobs or

195
00:13:05.121 --> 00:13:09.050
their raises were on the line taught to the test the entire year.

196
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.400
How warning could that be for teachers or for students?

197
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.170
Um,
so,

198
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.560
and we did research to show that a lot of students think that those tests

199
00:13:21.081 --> 00:13:25.250
measure how smart they are and how smart they'll be when they grow up.

200
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.700
So they're nervous about them and the whole year is spent on them when in fact,

201
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.490
if you just taught kids and uh,

202
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.310
in a way that made them love learning

203
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.300
to love challenges,
know how to stick to them,
um,

204
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.640
feel the thrill of improvement,

205
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.440
then the test score would come as a byproduct of that.

206
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.690
Finland,
the country that does so well on all of these international tests,

207
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.990
they don't teach to the test.
They teach,

208
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:08.210
the teachers love teaching,
the kids love learning and they do well on the test.

209
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.040
Let's get back to that here.

210
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.650
<v 0>So going into the corporate environment,</v>

211
00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:17.651
can you actually think of an organization is a growth mindset organization or a

212
00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:20.390
fixed mindset organization?

213
00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:23.940
You do talk about Enron and then your book is an example of a,

214
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.460
probably not the positive side.

215
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.270
So talk about how you could look at it from an organizational level and then if

216
00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:32.880
you want your culture to be a growth lights at culture,
how do you start to,

217
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.310
<v 2>yes,
yes.
Um,</v>

218
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:40.430
so in my book I identify organizations that I'm valued talent,

219
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.640
raw talent above all else or that valued,

220
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.133
um,

221
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.680
believed in everyone's to improve and develop and valued.
That.

222
00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.170
In our recent work,
we've actually gone in and asked the people,

223
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:05.470
we asked employees in different fortune 500 organizations,

224
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.700
well,
what mindset does your company have?

225
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.170
Is it a company that believes in fixed talent and worships it?

226
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.890
Or is it a company that believes everyone can develop their abilities and really

227
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:27.220
provides these opportunities?
And,
uh,

228
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.230
what we found was there was remarkable consensus within organizations about,

229
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:33.980
um,

230
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.510
which mindset their organization has and more important,

231
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.610
it made a big difference.

232
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.680
<v 0>So in terms of that difference,
uh,</v>

233
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.670
you can kind of compare and contrast companies that you view as leaders in

234
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:49.850
growth mindset versus those that have struggled,
uh,

235
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.250
maybe because of a fixed mindset or culture.

236
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.691
<v 2>Well,</v>

237
00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:57.691
in this research we found that employees and fixed mindset,

238
00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.710
let me go the other way.

239
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.890
That employees and growth mindset organizations said they felt more empowered by

240
00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:08.410
the organization and more committed to it,

241
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.630
whereas their counterparts in the more fixed mindset organizations,
uh,

242
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.520
kind of had one foot out the door waiting for the next highest bidder.

243
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.720
But to me,
uh,

244
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.090
what was even more interesting is that the people in growth mindset

245
00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:29.950
organizations said their company's valued creativity,

246
00:16:29.951 --> 00:16:33.400
innovation,
and they really put their money where their mouth was.

247
00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:37.270
So if you took a reasonable risk and it didn't work out,
they said,

248
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.370
my company has my back,

249
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.220
my company really values teamwork was another thing they said in the growth

250
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:49.450
mindset organizations in the more fixed mindset organizations,

251
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.910
the employees said,
yeah,

252
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:55.360
the company talks innovation and creativity.

253
00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:00.310
But if things don't work out,
someone pays the price.
And finally,

254
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:04.600
the managers in the growth mindset organizations said,

255
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.873
um,

256
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:11.070
that their employees had tremendous potential to rise within the organization,

257
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:16.760
become stars,
joined management.
Um,

258
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.190
whereas,

259
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.390
and I love this finding cause in the fixed mindset organization,

260
00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:26.260
they're worshiping the talent and hiring the talent and paying to keep the

261
00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:26.980
talent.

262
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.310
But if you years later they're not saying there are a lot of people who have

263
00:17:30.311 --> 00:17:32.800
potential to rise in the organization,

264
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.030
either they've left or they don't have that potential anymore.

265
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.120
<v 0>Many of us in the room and participate in interviewing potential candidates for</v>

266
00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:43.980
Google.
So let's assume for a second that,

267
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.730
that Google's trying to have a growth mindset that it is that,

268
00:17:47.731 --> 00:17:52.731
what are strategies interviewers can use to help identify that training people

269
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:56.670
or identify that someone would be open to going down that path?

270
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.230
<v 2>Great question.
Uh,
I worked with a major league baseball team,</v>

271
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.430
so I'll talk about that first,
um,
to device questions,
uh,

272
00:18:07.431 --> 00:18:11.270
that they could ask to potential draft choices.
Uh,

273
00:18:11.271 --> 00:18:14.890
one was how'd you get so good at baseball?

274
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.030
And some of them said,
well,
you know,
I was born with this natural talent.

275
00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:24.160
And others said,
well,
my father and I,
we worked at it constantly.

276
00:18:24.161 --> 00:18:26.260
We had a batting cage in the back yard.
He filmed me,

277
00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:29.230
we watched the tapes and so forth.
Um,

278
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.850
another one was,
um,

279
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.620
thinking about on field success in the major leagues,

280
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.210
what do you think you'd have to change?
And some of them said things like,

281
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.990
I'll have to get used to the cheering of larger crowds.

282
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.550
And others said,
maybe everything,

283
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.230
I'll have to take all my skills to a new level.
It's a whole new ball game.

284
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.530
So this knowledge that you might have to really reorganize,

285
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.170
redefine yourself and build new skills,
it's really important.

286
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.840
Taking that to the corporate setting.

287
00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:12.250
First I might ask people what their greatest failures were.

288
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.140
See whether they take responsibility and,
um,

289
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.060
what they did with that failure.

290
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.100
Did they capitalize on it to do something

291
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.050
even better than they could have imagined?
Did,

292
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.250
did they use it to put value added back into the company?

293
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:38.380
Or on the other hand did they say,
well,
I,
I had this failure,

294
00:19:38.381 --> 00:19:42.130
I worked too hard.
Or you know,
do they make it something that's really,

295
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.860
uh,
that really reflects well on them or was it someone else's fall?

296
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:53.300
And then this kind of readiness to learn readiness to,
um,

297
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.220
share credit,
these,
these kinds of questions.

298
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.200
<v 0>But I've debated this,
uh,
your,
your,
uh,</v>

299
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.820
theories of buying set with colleagues over lunch,
particularly my last company,

300
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.800
there was really this resistance to except that talent and,
or,
uh,

301
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:14.420
intelligence were in any way malleable.
But talk about that for a minute.

302
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.960
His intelligence truly something that's valuable and maybe are there

303
00:20:17.961 --> 00:20:22.010
physiological differences between,
um,
uh,

304
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.730
people that you've researched that are identified as growth mindset or fixed

305
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.613
bikes.

306
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.200
<v 2>So we absolutely know that skills and abilities are malleable and that's kind of</v>

307
00:20:36.081 --> 00:20:39.440
what counts.
That's what turns itself into performance.

308
00:20:39.441 --> 00:20:42.380
But there have been fascinating studies,
um,

309
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.730
at first of all looking into the brains of fixed and mindset people as they,

310
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.590
um,
work on a hard task and make errors.

311
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:55.600
And you see that,
um,

312
00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.050
the people who are in a growth mindset or having the relevant areas of the brain

313
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:07.951
really light up catch fire as they processed the errors and correct them,

314
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.280
whereas in the brains of the people who are in more of a fixed mindset,

315
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.990
very little is going on.

316
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.290
They're seeing their errors and they're moving on as quickly as possible.

317
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.450
But my favorite study along these lines,
um,
tracked,
um,

318
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.080
teenagers,
uh,
from the age of 14 to 18.
Um,

319
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.090
the teenage brain.
Our brains are still very malleable,

320
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:37.510
but the teenage brain is unbelievably malleable.

321
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:40.990
It's a time of tremendous potential growth.

322
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.160
And what they found over those four years was that,
um,

323
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.960
there were some kids who gained a lot in Iq points in math or verbal areas and

324
00:21:55.421 --> 00:22:00.421
there were others that lost a lot of points and it tracked with the density of

325
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:06.820
their neurons in the relevant parts of their brains.
So,

326
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.471
uh,

327
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:13.471
we believe it's the kids who really went at it and took on the challenges and

328
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:15.790
worked hard.

329
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.590
We're creating these denser neurons and the others who didn't use it

330
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.043
<v 0>lost it.</v>

331
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:27.000
And I thought another interesting aspect of your research was,

332
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.420
and this could apply in education at home or in or in business,

333
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.140
is the proclivity to cheat,
uh,

334
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.080
based on the mindset that I've talked a little bit about that.

335
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.240
<v 2>Yes.
Um,</v>

336
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.060
we have studied that directly and we see that cheating,
um,

337
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.200
is more the desire to achieve and the actual cheating is more prevalent within a

338
00:22:48.931 --> 00:22:53.160
fixed mindset.
Um,
within a fixed mindset.

339
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:58.190
If say you haven't done well on a subject before but you want a good grade,

340
00:22:59.101 --> 00:23:03.760
you feel like,
oh,
I have to find some circuitous means.
Um,

341
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.020
but if you feel that there are many ways that you can do better through actual

342
00:23:09.511 --> 00:23:12.270
learning,
you're more likely to do that.

343
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.470
So in one study after a poor grade,
um,

344
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:22.010
students who held more of a fixed mindset of their intelligence actually said in

345
00:23:22.411 --> 00:23:26.790
advance.
They're seriously considering cheating on the next test.

346
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.350
<v 0>So when you're in your recent Ted talk,
oh,
I want to say one more thing.</v>

347
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.790
<v 2>In,
in,
in our business study,</v>

348
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.570
the people in the fixed mindset organizations said cheating and deception where

349
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:46.750
much more prevalent.
And think about it.

350
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.620
If I have to be smarter than you,
if I have to be the superstar,

351
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.720
I'm going to consider all different ways to look better than you look.

352
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.620
And if I have to keep secrets from you or hoard my knowledge from other people,

353
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:04.280
I'm going to do that.

354
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.970
But in the growth mindset organization where people are collaborating and

355
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.460
learning and tackling challenges together,
where's the cheating going to come in?

356
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.323
It isn't.

357
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.020
<v 0>So if a company,
uh,
observes that behavior and a couple of you to scale,</v>

358
00:24:22.021 --> 00:24:25.200
let's say it's not a company of 10 people that have hundreds or thousands and

359
00:24:25.201 --> 00:24:27.630
they recognize this is we have a culture problem,

360
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.860
how do you go about even trying to tackle that where some of these strategies

361
00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:34.470
companies can use if they decide we want to shift the culture,

362
00:24:34.471 --> 00:24:37.690
we know it's going to take time.
It's not just a switch that you flip,

363
00:24:37.691 --> 00:24:40.740
but what are some of the strategies or company could employ to change the

364
00:24:40.741 --> 00:24:41.200
culture?

365
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.560
<v 2>So I think,
uh,
the,</v>

366
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.040
the best thing is for the message to come down from the top where they don't

367
00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:53.140
just announce where a growth mindset culture,

368
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:58.500
they really explain what the new value system is.

369
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.000
The new value system on taking on challenges,

370
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.420
on rewarding a reasonable risk on teamwork,

371
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.540
on sharing information,
um,
uh,

372
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.800
giving performance evaluations that speak to people's growth and contribution to

373
00:25:22.541 --> 00:25:26.800
the company in terms of learning and um,

374
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.720
uh,
salary increases that take into account.

375
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.640
Uh,
did someone take on challenges,
improve,

376
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.470
help other people improve where they a good team player?

377
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.540
Uh,
bottom line counts,
but these things also count.

378
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.720
So to have to kind of talk growth mindset talk without backing it up.

379
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.580
I don't think that's going to happen.

380
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.410
If you have the old reward system that's um,
uh,

381
00:25:59.411 --> 00:26:04.060
rewarding kind of individual jockeying for a claim in power,

382
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.570
but if you back it up with evaluations,

383
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.700
rewards and,

384
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:15.270
and mentoring and what a growth mindset deeply means and how it can be enacted

385
00:26:17.081 --> 00:26:21.850
within the job,
I think that that's a great start.

386
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.370
<v 0>A new recent Ted talk he talked about the power of yet,</v>

387
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.200
which I thought was a very interesting concept of,

388
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.390
a little bit about what you meant by that.

389
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.740
<v 2>Yes.
Um,</v>

390
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:35.970
it all started when I learned about a high school in Chicago where students had

391
00:26:36.641 --> 00:26:40.660
to pass maybe 84 units to graduate.

392
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.970
And if they didn't pass a unit,
they got the grade.
Not yet.

393
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.570
I thought that isn't that great because if you get a failing grade,

394
00:26:49.571 --> 00:26:54.080
do you think I hate this,
I'm outta here.
I'm no good at this.
Um,

395
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.980
and you kind of lose your steam,
but not yet.
It means,
hey,
you're,

396
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.500
you're on a trajectory,
a learning trajectory.

397
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:05.070
Maybe you're not as the finish line,
but you're on your way there.

398
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.870
And the students went around the school unabashedly saying to each other,

399
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:13.890
how many,
not yet.
Do you have?
I is do you have,

400
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.060
so we started a program of research.

401
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:23.030
It's still continuing on the word yet.
And um,
uh,

402
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:28.130
showing that saying not yet after a wrong answer keeps up motivation and

403
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.160
encourages persistence.
Uh,

404
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:37.180
so just saying and listen to yourself if sometimes you say,

405
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:40.620
I'm not a person or I could never didn't move,

406
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.020
then just add the word yet.
And if it takes a very,
or,

407
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.490
or if one of your employees as I can't do,
I'm no good at this.
Yeah.

408
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:55.580
It takes a very fixed mindset statement and it puts it in a whole different

409
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:59.310
growth mindset con context.

410
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.420
<v 0>Just a second.
Last question for me is,</v>

411
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.430
is you did some itching research very recently around a gaming and gave me

412
00:28:07.641 --> 00:28:10.880
applied to math and talk a little about how you were able to incorporate your

413
00:28:10.881 --> 00:28:13.220
concept of the growth mindset into that experience.

414
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.500
<v 2>We teamed up with,
um,</v>

415
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.680
Azurin Popovich and his colleagues at the University of Washington to create a

416
00:28:22.791 --> 00:28:25.040
mass game,
uh,

417
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.690
called brain points that incorporated growth mindset principles.

418
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:35.170
There were algorithms built into the game that detected the student's effort,

419
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.030
their use of strategies and their improvement.

420
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.690
Okay.
And then in our experiment,

421
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.960
we compared Barain points to the standard version of the game.

422
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:58.630
Now the standard version of the game is that your usual game where the more you

423
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.270
zoom through and answer problems correctly,

424
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.680
the more you rack up points,
not in brain points.

425
00:29:06.681 --> 00:29:11.120
Actually a few to through it apologizes to you and said you didn't earn any

426
00:29:11.121 --> 00:29:13.460
points that time.
We're sorry,

427
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.000
we'll give you something more challenging the next time.
Um,

428
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:23.350
so what happened was this first students played,

429
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.540
uh,
these were a great school students.

430
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.350
They played longer cause they could leave the game at any point.

431
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.500
They played significantly longer.
Um,

432
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:38.600
they used more strategies.
We dropped in difficult problems.

433
00:29:38.601 --> 00:29:42.100
Occasionally they s they persevered them longer.

434
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:47.320
But this was my favorite finding in the standard version.

435
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.510
It was mostly the high achievers who played to the end.

436
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:58.230
But in the brand points version,
they,
they stayed in,

437
00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.940
they play to the end.
They liked it.

438
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.360
But so many more lower and medium achievers also stayed till the end.

439
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.120
Cool.

440
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.130
<v 0>So what keeps you up at night as you think about where your research can go on?</v>

441
00:30:11.131 --> 00:30:13.490
Because like any scientific endeavor,
it's closer.

442
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.190
You're being challenged and revisiting what,

443
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:19.190
what keeps you up at night worrying about where your theory can be right or

444
00:30:19.191 --> 00:30:20.450
wrong or approved.

445
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:21.630
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

446
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.260
<v 2>Yes.</v>

447
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.260
I always had this attitude of challenging my ideas and my theories because if

448
00:30:29.821 --> 00:30:32.580
you're wrong,
you want to know it as soon as possible.

449
00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:35.310
You don't want to spend your life on it.
Um,

450
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:40.610
so what keeps me up at night in a good way are different areas where it could be

451
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.730
applied.
So we have a whole program of research on,
um,

452
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.800
peace in the Middle East where we're using mindset,
um,

453
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.020
principals,

454
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.333
<v 3>mmm.</v>

455
00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:00.270
<v 2>I'm not minimizing the hugeness of the problem,</v>

456
00:31:00.271 --> 00:31:03.060
but we're using mindset principles too.

457
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.620
<v 3>MMM.
MMM.</v>

458
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.480
<v 2>Try to build some greater understanding.
Um,</v>

459
00:31:09.481 --> 00:31:14.481
so I love to think of ways that we can extend it into areas we never thought of

460
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.200
before.
Uh,

461
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.680
I love to think of ways to implement it so that more kids who need this way of

462
00:31:26.731 --> 00:31:28.590
thinking can benefit from it.

463
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:34.220
And something that also keeps me up at night is the fear that people are

464
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.410
developing what I'm calling a false growth mindset.

465
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.490
It's this idea.
If it's good,
I have it.

466
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.690
So a lot of people are kind of declaring they have it,

467
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.240
but they don't.

468
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:58.010
They think it just means open minded or being a nice person or um,

469
00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.190
there,
um,

470
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.420
maybe they're saying they have it from fixed mindset reasons that I want you to

471
00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:08.040
judge me,
um,
as,
as being the right kind of person.
Um,

472
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.270
so developing a growth mindset is really a journey.

473
00:32:12.271 --> 00:32:16.280
It's a lifelong journey of,
um,
of,
uh,

474
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.820
monitoring your trigger points and,
and trying to approach things.

475
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.590
And I'm more growth mindset way of taking on the challenges,
sticking to them,

476
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.770
learning from them.
Um,
so,
um,

477
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.210
right now I'm writing something for educators that I'm calling false growth

478
00:32:33.211 --> 00:32:37.080
mindset,
um,
to,
um,

479
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.820
to tell them no,
you can't just say it.

480
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.840
You have to take a journey because we're doing research now showing that many

481
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:49.841
teachers and parents who say they have a growth mindset are actually responding

482
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:54.620
to kids in ways that are creating fixed mindsets for the kids.

483
00:32:55.310 --> 00:33:00.290
So those are,
that's kind of the array of things that keep me up at night.

484
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.660
But that said,
I do sleep pretty good.

485
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.470
<v 0>Wow.
All right.
With that,
we'll open up for questions from the,
uh,</v>

486
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.840
from the audience and I'm going to take a quick look at the dory too.

487
00:33:09.841 --> 00:33:11.340
So the Mike's give you passed around.

488
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.110
<v 2>Hi.
Um,</v>

489
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.300
I was introduced to fix your broken a couple of years ago and I have like 15

490
00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:22.230
nieces and nephews and I find myself when I'm with them,

491
00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:25.830
I don't know what to say to them because I don't want to be like,

492
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.890
oh you're so smart cause I'm not supposed to use that word or whatever.

493
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.360
But then I,
it's like,

494
00:33:30.361 --> 00:33:35.340
I forget what to say when they're telling me about friends at school or problems

495
00:33:35.341 --> 00:33:38.880
they're having.
It's things like that sounds really hard.
I mean,

496
00:33:38.881 --> 00:33:42.030
am I just supposed to say like,
well that's hard.
You know,
I can do hard things.

497
00:33:42.031 --> 00:33:46.890
You can do hard things.
Do you have any advice?
Okay.
Okay,

498
00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:50.810
the good.
The question is,
if you can't say smart,

499
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:56.120
what can you say?
You can say so many other things.

500
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.930
One thing is you can just show interest in the,

501
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:05.390
in the process that the child or other person is engaging in it.

502
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.470
And our research,

503
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.920
that's what we've shown is effective focusing on the process or appreciating the

504
00:34:12.561 --> 00:34:17.240
process someone is,
is engaging in or that has engaged in.

505
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:21.440
So just show interest,
ask questions,

506
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.590
give encouragement.
If they've,
um,

507
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:28.460
been grappling with something and they've tried new strategies or,

508
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:32.540
or stuck to the strategies,
um,
one parent said,
oh,

509
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:37.430
I hate it cause I can't appreciate when my child does something great.

510
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:42.320
It's like,
well where did you get that from?
Of course you can appreciate it,

511
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.070
but then tie it to something they engaged in.

512
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.020
Oh you couldn't do that yesterday.
You made progress.
That's so exciting.

513
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.610
Oh that's great.

514
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:57.370
You really stuck to it and learned it.
Or,
uh,

515
00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.400
you tried all different ways and look,
that worked.
So you're,
you're,

516
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.640
you're really appreciating some outcome where they are and you're talking about

517
00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:13.400
how they got there.
But if you don't have that information,

518
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.590
just ask them never praise effort that isn't there.

519
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.520
<v 0>Got a question from our dory and then we'll go back to the room.</v>

520
00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:24.720
So a question for the door.
He is,

521
00:35:24.721 --> 00:35:29.130
how do you think shame plays a role in growth and the growth mindset fixed

522
00:35:29.131 --> 00:35:29.964
versus growth?

523
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.270
<v 2>Oh,
that's a great question.</v>

524
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.940
We have studied that and um,

525
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.990
we have shown that shame is a big factor and a fixed mindset.

526
00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.560
Um,
you don't want to take on a challenge.

527
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.660
It's humiliating to have a setback within a fixed mindset.

528
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:56.310
It means you're not the person you want to be and other people aren't going to

529
00:35:56.311 --> 00:36:00.600
look at you in the same way we've studied in an adolescence.

530
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.773
Um,

531
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.160
adolescents in a fixed mindset feel incredible shame when they are excluded or

532
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:14.400
rejected and that makes them want to lash out violently.

533
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.640
Uh,
so this and research,
uh,
of,
uh,

534
00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:20.790
of for many years,

535
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:25.791
many people's research has shown that shame is not a productive emotion.

536
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.660
It makes you want to hide or lash out,

537
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:36.260
both of which are not going to get you in the long run where you want to be in a

538
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:40.860
growth mindset,
you can feel very disappointed.

539
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:45.240
You can feel her,
you can feel guilty,

540
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:46.980
you can feel a lot of things,

541
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:52.310
but these are emotions that allow you to go forward and be constructive

542
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.860
<v 4>computer science,
education and diversity in that.</v>

543
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:08.990
So I'm curious if you've looked into how stereotypes may interact with growth

544
00:37:08.991 --> 00:37:13.430
mindset.
Like for instance,
you know,
thinking that math is not for girls,

545
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:15.380
how does that interact with growth mindset?

546
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.330
<v 2>Yes.
Um,</v>

547
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.360
so how does the growth mindset interact with stereotypes?

548
00:37:22.851 --> 00:37:26.690
We've done extensive research on that.
Um,

549
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.640
we find a,

550
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:33.910
so a fixed mindset would be the belief that I can't do math,

551
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.360
girls can't do math,
et cetera.

552
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.690
And a growth mindset is it's a learned set of skills.

553
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.340
Anyone can get better at them.
So notice first of all,

554
00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:49.070
that a stereotype is a fixed mindset label.

555
00:37:49.071 --> 00:37:52.430
It says it's fixed and certain groups have in certain groups don't.

556
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.440
But in our research,

557
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:59.441
we also find that when females have a fixed mindset about math or computer

558
00:38:00.951 --> 00:38:05.060
science,
they're more vulnerable to the stereotypes.

559
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.710
Um,
so in one study that we did at Columbia University,

560
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.720
we found that when women in Calculus had a fixed mindset about their calculus,

561
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.360
their math abilities,

562
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.020
when they encountered stereotyping,

563
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.940
where they felt their classmates or the professors thought women weren't as good

564
00:38:28.941 --> 00:38:32.030
as men,
they fell prey to that.

565
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:37.570
So as we track them over their semester,
they started thinking,

566
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:41.350
I don't belong here.
I don't like this anymore.

567
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:45.010
I don't have confidence.
I can succeed in this area.

568
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.050
And ultimately they did not intend to as much to take it in the future.

569
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.540
Whereas this,
they had a growth mindset.

570
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:57.430
They did not like the stereotyping,
but it didn't speak to them.

571
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.453
It didn't,

572
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:05.020
they didn't believe that they couldn't improve,

573
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:09.670
learn and succeed.
They mean so they maintained their confidence.

574
00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:14.530
They maintain their enjoyment of math and they maintain their,
um,

575
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.140
desire to take math in the future.

576
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:22.410
We just finished a study of women in computer science and are finding very

577
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:23.980
similar things.

578
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:29.190
In addition to finding that teaching a growth mindset is helping women with Stan

579
00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:34.150
the stereotypes,
maintain their interest,

580
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:38.590
maintain the sense that it's a field they belong in.
And,

581
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:43.690
um,
these result in higher grades in the course.

582
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.190
So we're very,

583
00:39:45.191 --> 00:39:50.191
very interested in that intersection between,

584
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.920
um,
growth mindset and stereotyping.

585
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:59.250
We also are finding at the transition to college that learning a growth mindset

586
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.860
helps,
um,

587
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.290
students from underrepresented groups in general,

588
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:13.770
even more because it helps them deal with stereotypes that they might encounter.

589
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.320
Interesting.

590
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.430
<v 0>Got Another question here,
which I think is an interesting a take.</v>

591
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.990
Do you see any context in which a fixed mindset is more beneficial than a growth

592
00:40:24.991 --> 00:40:25.824
mindset?

593
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.000
<v 2>Well,</v>

594
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
first let me say that a gross mindset doesn't require you to go around improving

595
00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.070
everything.
You can focus and you can decide,
no,
I'm not going to do that.
No,

596
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.390
I'm not going to do that,
but we're search,
uh,
uh,
not my research,

597
00:40:41.391 --> 00:40:46.391
but the research of others has in fact looked at this question and found two

598
00:40:47.631 --> 00:40:50.840
areas so far and which a fixed mindset is better.

599
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.150
One is sexual orientation.

600
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:59.230
People who accept that this is who they are and this is who they're meant to be,

601
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:00.291
um,

602
00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:05.291
seem to be better adjusted than people who think I should be changing.

603
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:10.520
And the other is,
um,
aging.

604
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:16.190
So it's,
it's nice to feel you can stay young,

605
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.500
um,
through exercise and so forth.

606
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:23.480
But people who run around nipping and tucking and the Tummy Tuck and the this,

607
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:26.690
that and the other.
And it's kind of a Jess Brit,

608
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.670
a attempt to,
um,

609
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:35.540
retain extreme youth.
That doesn't seem to be so great either.

610
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.420
But when it comes to skill areas,

611
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:43.421
it looks like a growth mindset is typically more avid advantageous.

612
00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:50.130
<v 4>Could you identify specific behaviors?</v>

613
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:55.610
Did one can try to advance you on the journey for an open mindset?

614
00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:01.430
And how do you know that you're not kidding yourself or falsely believing that

615
00:42:02.251 --> 00:42:04.950
you are one?
How do you know when you got there?
Yes.

616
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:06.923
<v 2>Great question.</v>

617
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:12.050
What are some specific behaviors do you can do to get yourself on the road to a

618
00:42:13.351 --> 00:42:17.130
growth mindset?
Here are some ideas.

619
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.080
So first,

620
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:24.450
if you have a choice of something safe versus a challenge,

621
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.910
take the challenge.
If you hit an obstacle,

622
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:34.620
try to interpret it in a growth mindset way.

623
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.310
So what can I learn from this?
What can I do?
Now,

624
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.570
as I mentioned before,
if you see someone who's better than you,

625
00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.990
go learn from them.
Uh,

626
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:51.020
so those are a set of behaviors you can start doing in addition to as a also

627
00:42:54.661 --> 00:42:59.160
mentioned before,
monitoring those fixed mindset triggers.

628
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.310
And the thing is that

629
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.920
it's a journey that one is always on.

630
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:12.950
It's not ever the case that you've arrived at a full permanent growth mindset.

631
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.520
It's something how that you have to look at all the time because even I hear,

632
00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:26.070
so listen to that voice in your head at the trigger points.

633
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.640
Cause even I hear myself saying sometimes in my head,

634
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:34.530
I was never good at that.
Whoa,
what did I say that?

635
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.270
So listen to the,
that voice.

636
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.150
It's constantly running in your head.

637
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:46.890
And I actually recommend that as a very,
very first step.

638
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:52.260
Um,
the first few weeks that you embark on this journey,

639
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.620
don't push yourself to exhibit any growth mindset characteristics.

640
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.900
Just listen to that voice that says,

641
00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:08.370
jump try this.
You might look foolish.
You made a mistake.

642
00:44:08.371 --> 00:44:12.610
If people knew that they wouldn't look at you in the same way,
uh,

643
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:15.000
that person's better than me.
I hate them.

644
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.750
Just whatever that voice is saying and your head,

645
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.730
listen to it and even do it with friends.

646
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.720
Discuss it.

647
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.700
Or when you see someone doing something that looks effortless,
are you thinking,

648
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:31.950
oh,
they're just brilliant,
talented.

649
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:37.140
Catch yourself thinking that or someone who's struggling.
Um,
do you,

650
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:41.820
are you thinking,
oh,
they're not really good at that.
Albert Einstein says,

651
00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.070
I,
I'm not that smart.

652
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:48.210
I'm not smarter than other people in Amen did you said I just stick to things

653
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:52.470
longer.
That's why people thought it was slow originally.

654
00:44:52.471 --> 00:44:56.610
He knew he didn't understand time,
space,

655
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:58.830
energy and so forth.

656
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.790
So I would say the very first step is the first few weeks.

657
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:07.110
Just listen to that fixed mindset voice.
It's there.

658
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.910
We all have it.
And if you don't hear it,
it will rule your behavior.

659
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.710
<v 4>Thank you for coming.
I actually read your book right before I started at Google.</v>

660
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:21.630
And I know I have a very fixed mindset and this is sort of a fixed mindset

661
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:24.630
question even.
But have you seen,
um,

662
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:28.020
patterns in who,
you know,

663
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.750
which kids have fixed mindsets?
Do you see,
is it,

664
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.840
are there differences across socioeconomic lines?

665
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:35.940
Do you see that certain teachers,

666
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.770
most of their students will have the growth mindset or,
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

667
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:44.160
Do you see patterns with who has the growth,
the growth mindset and how,

668
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.470
how does that happen to kids?

669
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.390
<v 2>Yes.
So first of all,</v>

670
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:52.950
I don't rule out that there could be temperamental factors.

671
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.620
You kids pop out differently and um,

672
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.050
some of them you see they're tearing around the world.

673
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:05.430
May they fall down,
they get up.
And then other,
uh,
other kids,

674
00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:09.540
you look at them sideways and they think,
what did I do?
Um,

675
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.000
so there could be these temperamental factors,

676
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:15.810
but we've shown the environment is really powerful.

677
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.900
We actually did a study where we looked at mother's praise to babies and found

678
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:23.640
that the praise they gave to their one,

679
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:27.900
two and three year olds predicted the child's mindset and desire for challenge

680
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:32.360
five years later.
So that environment is powerful.
Uh,

681
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:37.370
another thing we found is that the way parents react to kids' mistakes is a big

682
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:43.740
determinant of the child's mindset.
Parent can say,
I have a growth mindset,

683
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.710
but if,
if a child makes a mistake and they

684
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.930
act like it's negative,
important to be negative,

685
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:56.280
or even if they excuse it and gloss over it in a way that communicates to the

686
00:46:56.281 --> 00:46:57.510
child,
it's negative.

687
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:03.120
That child is more likely to have more of a fixed mindset.

688
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:07.020
So yeah,
there can be temperamental input.

689
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.520
The environment is powerful.
Right.

690
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:15.680
<v 0>I want to thank you so much for taking time to come to Google today and for the</v>

691
00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:18.610
terrific turnout that we have here,
and I know a virtually to the livestream,

692
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:19.453
so thank you very much.

693
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.020
<v 1>Pleasure.</v>
