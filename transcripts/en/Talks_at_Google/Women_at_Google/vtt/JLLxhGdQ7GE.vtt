1
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.330
Thank you all for joining us this afternoon for another talks at Google event.

2
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.490
We're very thrilled to have Alison being from lonely planet,
uh,

3
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:16.180
to speak to us today about high impacts travel.

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.040
And she's the author of over 45 books for lonely planet specifically for us

5
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.360
locally here,
the San Francisco Coastal California ones among others.

6
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.620
And so she'll talk about her experiences writing for lonely planet and when

7
00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:32.770
she's not doing that,
she also helps Google out with our,

8
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.000
our brand studio and works and rights for several other publications nationwide

9
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.450
as well.
So please join me in welcoming Alison to Google.
Thanks.

10
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.950
<v 1>So,
um,
we're going to be talking a little bit today about high impact travel.</v>

11
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.290
We as,
as you know,
um,
you can't,
uh,

12
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.430
by the time you arrive in an airplane,

13
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.350
you already have a huge carbon footprint to offset and um,

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.180
and travel is more satisfying when it's a positive exchange because nobody likes

15
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:08.200
to be a burden or show up empty handed.
When a friend invites you to dinner,

16
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.470
you just automatically ask what you can bring and making that contribution,

17
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.304
it feels really good.

18
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.650
So when you travel to an unfamiliar place,
you don't even know who to ask,
what.

19
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.100
You could bring a showing up with nothing to offer,

20
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.020
gets things started on the wrong foot.

21
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:29.110
You've already got that carbon footprint to think about.
Um,

22
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.870
and it feels like a lopsided transaction.

23
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.650
It's a drain on local resources and it feels awkward.

24
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.750
So to make a positive impression,

25
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.290
sometimes we show up with a kind of a token gift.

26
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.050
I'm a San Francisco giants tee shirt,
maybe,
um,

27
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.620
three time world series champions,
you know,
well,

28
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:58.480
neither did my lonely planet editor in London.
He was not very impressed.

29
00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:02.450
It was like baseball.
We have cricket.
So,
um,

30
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.610
yeah,

31
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.990
it went over better in a Moroccan village and the High Atlas Mountains where I

32
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:12.991
brought a tee shirt a and it was promptly torn up into strips and woven into her

33
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:17.980
rug.
So it's not what I pictured,
but you know.
Okay.
Um,

34
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.490
but it was a terrible flop in Italy where,
um,

35
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.410
the horrified Italian friend I gave it to,
uh,
gave me a lecture saying,

36
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:30.610
you need to,
yeah,
Americans need to make your tee shirts fit more tightly.

37
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.890
And he was like,
for the sake of humanity,
you know,
fix your fashion.
So,

38
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.870
uh,
I learned the hard way.
But you know,
as a travel writer,
that's my job.

39
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.370
I make mistakes so that you don't have to make them.
So don't bring the t shirts.

40
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.210
Um,
bring something else,
brings something more meaningful.

41
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.220
Like what,

42
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.470
so I'm glad you asked the first thing you can bring his suitcase space.

43
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.400
So travelers often pride themselves traveling light,

44
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.360
but they're missing out on an opportunity to connect with people in their

45
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:09.361
destination because carrying just a little extra weight is a small but tangible

46
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.080
act of kindness that creates powerful bonds.

47
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.840
And there are two important things.

48
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.030
You probably have room for it in your suitcase.

49
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.680
One is specific supplies or in kind donations for a destination nonprofit.

50
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.060
Be Sure to ask what that nonprofit needs most.
Um,
you know,

51
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.680
don't assume that San Francisco giants tee shirts or Google swag or whatever you

52
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:38.410
happen to have on hand is going to be welcome,

53
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.470
especially if you don't have enough to go around.
This is a,
uh,

54
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.000
an orphanage that I visited in Ethiopia and,
um,
uh,

55
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.820
definitely didn't need,
um,
San Francisco giants tee shirts,

56
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.790
but donations were most welcome.

57
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.940
<v 3>MMM.</v>

58
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.940
<v 1>Last summer when I was invited to work on a public awareness campaign for the</v>

59
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.520
Ethiopian Midwives Association,
I asked what hospital supplies might be helpful.

60
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.630
They asked me to bring pediatric breathing tubes,

61
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.040
which are inexpensive here,

62
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:15.810
but really hard to come by there and they're essential to rescue newborns with

63
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:17.040
respiratory problems.

64
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.003
<v 3>Okay.</v>

65
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.550
<v 1>At the time I was working at Apple,
um,</v>

66
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.290
and when I told colleagues there that what I was doing,
they wanted me to,

67
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.880
they wanted to send tubes to.

68
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.950
So I found out the maximum number I could carry and I weighed my luggage to the

69
00:04:33.951 --> 00:04:38.240
last ounce and all of those tubes have been put to use already.

70
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.400
And let me say,
not one of those was woven into a rug.
In fact,

71
00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:48.020
they were used by the doctors you see in this photo.
This is,
um,
uh,

72
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.290
birth ceremony that I was invited to attend and Ethiopia.

73
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.000
And if I look a little awkward,

74
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:57.170
it's because I had a terrible cold that day and I was trying not to touch

75
00:04:57.171 --> 00:05:02.030
anything to make the baby's sick.
But the doctor said,
don't worry,
you're fine.

76
00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:06.840
It'll be good for the antibodies,
for the babies.
So there you go.
Doctors.

77
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.770
Um,
here's something you're probably already doing.
Uh,

78
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.970
tell colleagues and friends where you're going and ask that people who lived in

79
00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:19.780
that area,
if you could take them for coffee or lunch,
uh,

80
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.950
to get their suggestions so far,
that's mostly benefiting you,
right?

81
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.480
But at lunch,

82
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.530
if there's anything they might like you to deliver to their friends or family

83
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.460
while you're there,
ask nothing huge.

84
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:36.860
Just momentos photos,
letters,

85
00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:41.030
maybe a birthday gift for a kid and deliver it in person.

86
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.210
This is a really meaningful gesture.

87
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.050
Many people with family abroad can't get away for visits very often.

88
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.250
And many people are concerned about reentry to the u s right now.

89
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.060
Even if your colleague or friend says no things,
they won't forget your kindness.

90
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.960
This is a photo of a inside of a guest house where I stayed in Ethiopia and the,

91
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.770
these are items that previous guests had sent to the host.

92
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800
She had a thing for baskets and tin ware and tea sets and had some from all

93
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:17.150
over.
Um,

94
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.580
I brought her Benadryl cause she had allergies and um,

95
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.430
was really suffering from high pollen counts while I was there.
And uh,

96
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.720
she liked the Benadryl and I'm invited back so that worked

97
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.473
<v 0>okay.</v>

98
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.910
<v 1>If they do give you a Momento to deliver,</v>

99
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.230
that's a great way to make new friends or instant relatives in an unfamiliar

100
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:44.180
place.
When my best friend was living in Zimbabwe,
a guy she was dating,

101
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.210
visited San Francisco and he brought me a bundle of letters from my friend and a

102
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:52.580
colleague,
a collage he had made about a trip they took together.

103
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.373
Smart move.

104
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.450
That's one way to win the approval of your girlfriend's best friend.

105
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.050
They're now married and as their friend,

106
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:09.040
I had the honor of being the justice of the peace at their wedding ceremony.

107
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.470
That's me right there.
That's that.

108
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

109
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.620
<v 1>Okay.
So your suitcase is fully loaded.
Nice.
Now.</v>

110
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:19.640
What else can you bring?

111
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.473
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

112
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.180
<v 1>research skills.
So while the assumption here,</v>

113
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.980
I'm guessing you know how to search online probably better than anyone on the

114
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:34.610
planet.
So I'm about to tell you something that you already know,

115
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.020
especially all you product people.
Um,
to maximize positive impact,

116
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.880
you must do advanced research,
um,

117
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.310
before you even buy a ticket research to figure out where you want to go,

118
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.670
where you want to stay,
what you want to eat,
what you want to do,

119
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.650
and use impact as a filter and pro tip here,

120
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.030
lonely planet flags,
hotels,
restaurants,
sites,
stores,

121
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:03.820
bars and other venues with a proven commitment to sustainability in our books to

122
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.420
just look for the leaf icon.

123
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.560
Okay,
so maybe you don't want to power search on your day off.
I get that,

124
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.250
but don't count on just showing up and asking a local for pointers in Venice,

125
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.830
locals off often complained to me that tourists,

126
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:23.990
we're always asking them for directions.

127
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.880
At first I thought they were exaggerating until I did the math.

128
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.150
Even if every tourist as for directions,

129
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.180
only once each Phoenician would be asked on average three times a day.

130
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.210
And Venetian directions are complicated.

131
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.430
There are hundreds of foot bridges and canals.

132
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.270
It takes time to answer and that gets to be an imposition.

133
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.590
So I made sure are lonely planet Venice maps were really thorough and I also

134
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.070
tourists to consider getting lost part of the adventure.
Um,

135
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.860
I like to think maybe some Venetians are being asked for directions only twice a

136
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:05.694
day now.

137
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.500
And here you can see some of the difficulty that Google maps is up against with

138
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.730
satellite imagery.

139
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.800
Tried to show where streets end in Venice,
but you know,

140
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.520
we walk those roots.
Um,

141
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.470
also when you do get information from a local,
say thanks,
then stealth,

142
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.350
the leaf fact check that information,

143
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.660
even with the best intentions,

144
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.460
some locals will cheerfully give you the wrong information as this happened to

145
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:37.860
you.
Okay.
Um,

146
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.520
they assume they know all the best places in their town,

147
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:46.521
but the truth is we get a lazy in our backyards were comfortable here.

148
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:52.071
We can't always be tracking sustainable restaurant practices or nonprofit

149
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:57.210
initiatives,
especially when it's sunny out.
Oh,
by the way,

150
00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:02.100
these guys are the proud owners of a lonely planet leaf icon.

151
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.450
They have practice sustainable fishing,
uh,
support,

152
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.520
sustainable fishing.
They serve exclusively.

153
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:13.521
Venetian food is El Outco in Venice and that's Francesco and his son Mateo

154
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:15.330
behind him.
Quite a team.

155
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.840
I interviewed them.
That's how I know their names.

156
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.610
Otherwise I'm usually in Cognito,

157
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.670
so I know all too well.

158
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.700
The problem of potentially I'm overlooking something in your own backyard.

159
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.650
I think I know my city of San Francisco until I set out to write the lonely

160
00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:42.940
planet guide to San Francisco and it turns out I know my neighborhood pretty

161
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:45.820
well and I know the path I take to and from work.

162
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.170
Everything else requires intensive research.

163
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.640
So I Google search like crazy.
I interview people,

164
00:10:54.641 --> 00:10:58.180
I visit places I uncover through research,
um,

165
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.650
eavesdrop heavily.
I'm listening.
If you're in that restaurant with me,

166
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:06.880
I'm probably trying to hear whether or not you're liking your food.
Um,

167
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.730
and I ask questions of everyone.
I meet at a destination,

168
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.641
for example,

169
00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:16.870
recent research indicated that many diners were complaining about a Newish

170
00:11:16.871 --> 00:11:21.490
restaurant in San Francisco called Calla that for adding it flat,

171
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:22.870
20% service fee.

172
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.820
So I went to Calla in Kognito to eat dinner there and I asked people there about

173
00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.040
it.
Um,

174
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.850
my server was especially glad I asked her directly because it's important to her

175
00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:36.310
and she feels it's been misconstrued online.

176
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.050
I hear that kind of thing can happen.
Um,

177
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.300
turns out that they're fixed service fee is part of a city program to

178
00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:47.020
rehabilitate people who have been incarcerated for nonviolent crimes,

179
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.580
usually drug related,

180
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.690
ensuring a consistent income so that they can get back on their feet.

181
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.390
And with substance abuse treatment programs,

182
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.740
the story checks out.

183
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:04.130
So now I can eat a Kela and I will because it's that good and I can feel good

184
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.640
about that service fee and I can recommend it to you in good conscience.

185
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.760
So you filled your luggage,

186
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.450
you've done your research to figure out where you can have an impact without

187
00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:19.980
entirely leaving it up to the locals to educate you.
This is all good,

188
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.770
but there's something else you may be able to offer.

189
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.130
<v 3>Okay.</v>

190
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:31.130
<v 1>A willingness to go the extra mile or 30 every dollar you spend in rural areas</v>

191
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.610
is circulated through the community four to 10 times more than in cities.

192
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.970
This is something we discovered when I was at Airbnb.

193
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.380
The travelers economic impact in rural areas is exponential.

194
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.680
But looking at travel industry data,

195
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.710
we also discovered that most people don't venture more than two hours beyond

196
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:56.124
city limits.

197
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.383
<v 3>Okay?</v>

198
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.970
<v 1>That's a lost opportunity for rural areas,</v>

199
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.550
but it's our loss as travelers too.

200
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.850
We're missing out on some really enriching experiences.

201
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.040
An absolutely beautiful places.

202
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.250
Sometimes these places are not set up for travelers,

203
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.970
so you have to do extra research to find out where to stay,

204
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.770
what to do and what to eat.

205
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.250
This is a first communion that we stumbled into and Kampala,

206
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.500
Chapala Mexico,
um,
and were invited to participate

207
00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.850
and it's just a few hours outside of muscle on about two and a half.

208
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.120
And by the way,
this previous image as well,

209
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.580
two and a half hours from Rome and said town of Sodano in Tuscany.

210
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.390
So not everybody can do this extra bit of research,

211
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:56.370
but you can because you are Google.
So look,

212
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.750
I'm not saying it's easy.
Um,

213
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:03.830
once I was assigned by lonely planet to find sustainable tourism options in the

214
00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:08.400
remote Ibu Gomez Valley and Morocco's high atlas mountains,

215
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.850
previous additions of lonely planet,

216
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:15.030
Morocco mentioned that it was a beautiful place,

217
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:18.570
ideal for hiking,
but it sounded kind of scary.

218
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.940
A road's washed out,

219
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
food could be scarce and few people spoke European languages or Arabic.

220
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.430
By then I had already seen one San Francisco giants tee shirt torn to shreds.

221
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.520
So I knew I had to do my research before I came.

222
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:37.720
<v 3>Okay.</v>

223
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.310
<v 1>So I hired a Tasha head speaking guy from the area with a four wheel drive car.</v>

224
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.300
And together we visited villages carved out of cliff faces.

225
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.380
We asked people in village elders,
what do you do here?

226
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.990
What would you like people to know about this place?

227
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.170
Are their talents or skills you'd like to share?

228
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.490
And I asked them all the same question we're trying to answer today.

229
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.100
If people would like to repay your hospitality,
how can they best do that?

230
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.150
Working in this collaborative way with villagers.
We met along the valley.

231
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.410
We were able to find ways to support initiatives they'd had in the works for

232
00:15:17.411 --> 00:15:20.500
years.
By the time we left the valley,

233
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.910
there were working models in place for an afterschool t program at a center for

234
00:15:24.911 --> 00:15:26.620
disabled adults in [inaudible].

235
00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.340
There was a postcard pen pal project to support language acquisition for Eco

236
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.440
Trekking guides and Toboggan and there were go cheese tastings with a women's

237
00:15:37.441 --> 00:15:41.460
goat herd collective,
which they started against the will of their parents.

238
00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:45.610
By the way,
six years later,

239
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.060
these programs are all flourishing travelers.

240
00:15:49.061 --> 00:15:53.950
Financial support and overwhelmingly positive social media posts have helped

241
00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:58.390
expand accessibility for disabled people in the valley and created new jobs

242
00:15:58.391 --> 00:15:59.710
through ECO travel.

243
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

244
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.640
<v 1>The women's goat cheese cooperative has tripled in size and received</v>

245
00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:08.770
international slow food prices for their cheese.

246
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.570
Roads have even improved much to the relief of the local donkeys,

247
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.100
and that's the thing about sustainable travel.

248
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.790
It's not as difficult as you might think to be a trailblazer.

249
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.680
All I needed to do was go a bit further out of my way and ask a few more

250
00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:33.681
questions than I typically ask and when more people go further and ask more,

251
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.590
we can all accomplish even more.
It's exponential.

252
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.750
Here's how I know that last time I was in Morocco,

253
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.100
I ran a work session with Peace Corps volunteers to identify ways to involve

254
00:16:47.101 --> 00:16:49.620
travelers in local development efforts.

255
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.000
They brought it back to their communities who held their own work sessions.

256
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.950
Morocco is also the biggest peace corp site in the Middle East and that

257
00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:02.760
information has now been shared with sites across the Middle East.

258
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:07.200
I also got a lot out of,
it.

259
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.780
Turns out that sustainable travel road trips are totally bonding experiences.

260
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:19.010
Mohamed nor the colleague who accompanied me as a driver in translator is now a

261
00:17:19.441 --> 00:17:23.220
friend of mine for life and as the result of our travels,

262
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.560
he's moved to the Ibu Gomez Valley.

263
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.060
He started his own eco travel business and now trains in mentors,

264
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.680
Eco travel guides.
Like I said,
exponential impact.

265
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

266
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.450
<v 1>Okay,
so now you've got a full suitcase.
You've done your research on impact.</v>

267
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.840
You're ready to go further and ask more.
Excellent.

268
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.570
I can almost feel your exponential coming almost.

269
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.110
There's one more thing you can bring with you.

270
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.540
A passion or belief that transcends borders.

271
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.580
This could be a big idea like net neutrality or refugee support or a vision to

272
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:09.510
end human trafficking.

273
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.440
That guy on the lower left is my Google brand studio colleague Ruben Santa's.

274
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:16.374
Hi Ruben,

275
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.810
who joined a team of eight Googlers in Nepal for a 20% project with [inaudible]

276
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.300
dot org to fight human trafficking.

277
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.200
They met with girls in safe houses who had escaped slavery and are now studying

278
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.030
learning vocational skills and becoming advocates for girls still in captivity.

279
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.223
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

280
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.480
<v 1>Ruben and the Google team used their everyday problem solving skills to support</v>

281
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.240
some of the NGOs making an impact on the ground.

282
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

283
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.910
<v 1>I asked Ruben to describe the impact of the trip on him personally and he</v>

284
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:55.380
answered me with this photo.

285
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.223
<v 0>Okay.</v>

286
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.060
<v 1>Another Google Brand Studio Coworker Ryan Chin,</v>

287
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.390
just came back from a 20% project with net hope.

288
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.920
An organization that sets up Wifi at refugee camps in Greece.

289
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.420
This is a camp inside a departure hall in Greece for Afghan refugees

290
00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.180
between interviewing refugees.
He would decompress by drawing.

291
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.590
People started looking over his shoulder and asking if he would draw them.

292
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.970
That's Ryan in the middle.

293
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.900
So he started sharing his pictures with the people around him,

294
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.060
people living in tents who had almost nothing but they had rations.

295
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.380
And because it's human nature to reciprocate,
he was invited for tea.

296
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.630
So Ryan drew even more pictures and as host shared even more of their stories

297
00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:54.464
with him.

298
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.850
And this is Mustafa holding one of Ryan's drawings.

299
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

300
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:07.410
<v 1>Ryan graciously allowed me to share some of his pictures with you today so that</v>

301
00:20:07.511 --> 00:20:10.030
you can start to get to know refugees as he did.

302
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:15.040
And maybe some of you will want to volunteer with net hope and install a more

303
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.020
routers and more refugee camps.

304
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.133
<v 0>Okay.</v>

305
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.650
<v 1>I wish I could draw like Ryan,
but I can't.</v>

306
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.710
My passions are simpler.
Like corn.

307
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.830
I was raised in a corn growing country in Indiana,
and two big upsides of humid,

308
00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:38.831
who's your summers were one diving into limestone quarry pools and to corn on

309
00:20:39.351 --> 00:20:42.440
the cob.
Turns out Cory jumping.

310
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:47.441
It's kind of dangerous and technically illegal and tasty corn is getting harder

311
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:48.964
to find.

312
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.180
In the 1980s most farms in my county were bought out by agribusiness and now the

313
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:58.600
corn and my county is the kind used for cattle feed and those compostable

314
00:20:58.601 --> 00:20:59.560
takeout boxes.

315
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.520
But when harvest time comes around,
I still crave corn.

316
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.560
So I did my research to find out where farmers still grow tasty heirloom corn,

317
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:13.030
like the kind I ate as a kid.

318
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.860
The answer Google gave me Wahaca Mexico.

319
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.710
Okay Google,
so how do I get to that corner?

320
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.473
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

321
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.170
<v 1>turns out global exchange was organizing a trip to Wahaca for day of the dead.</v>

322
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.000
I don't go for organized trips.
It's my job to organize other people's trips,

323
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:38.280
but global exchange does fantastic research tracking food justice initiatives,

324
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:44.070
the itinerary they suggested included visits to a taqueria that exclusively uses

325
00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:45.330
rare varietals of corn.

326
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.900
They have 33 different corns on that menu and this is an image from day of the

327
00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:51.780
dead.

328
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.370
This young woman is dressed and address made entirely of corn husks and corn

329
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:57.204
kernels.

330
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.300
You can see some of the different colors of the heirloom corn is grown in a

331
00:22:02.301 --> 00:22:06.210
while ago,
but even more importantly,

332
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.860
the trip introduced me to Zappo tech farmers who started seeing cord bank seed

333
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.610
corn banking to preserve heirloom varietals.

334
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.830
When I got a whiff of that corn cooking,
I thought,
yeah,
this,
I get it.

335
00:22:19.831 --> 00:22:24.090
This is food worth fighting for and this is food worth saving for future

336
00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:26.880
generations.
So thank you Google.

337
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:32.100
I finally found that corn I've been craving,
but I also found my new food heroes.

338
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.980
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

339
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.180
<v 1>Now back to you
already.
You have a full suitcase,</v>

340
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.150
solid background research on sustainable travel,

341
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.680
an itinerary with a rural area where you're planning to ask bonus questions and

342
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.830
a passion you're ready to pursue to the ends of the earth.

343
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.310
But there is one last thing you can share.

344
00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.100
The thing that Google shares every day,

345
00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:58.893
<v 3>okay?</v>

346
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.740
<v 1>You know this one information.</v>

347
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.010
This is a an Italian muralist.
It says,
um,
uh,

348
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.300
let's all give each other a hand.

349
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.963
<v 3>MMM.</v>

350
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.560
<v 1>So as part of the application to join that global exchange trip to Wahaca,</v>

351
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.640
they asked me what I was going to do with the information I gathered in stories.

352
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:22.360
I heard.
Look,
here I am telling you about it.

353
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.280
So that's one promise I've kept today.

354
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.580
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

355
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.400
<v 1>But there are other ways to circulate information.
You know,</v>

356
00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:31.770
the drill right posts,

357
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:37.020
host Wikipedia hack days to correct misinformation and add to our global

358
00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:41.640
knowledge about remote places that may not have access to information sharing

359
00:23:41.641 --> 00:23:42.474
directly.

360
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.630
Reuben put together this crowdfunding campaign for effect.org and he whizzed

361
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:51.800
past his goal.
Um,
but I promised him I'd say this,

362
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.020
you can still donate and volunteer with effect.org.
So Ruben,

363
00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.820
that's another promise I've kept today.

364
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.560
Or you can do what Ryan did and volunteer to install Wifi for people who really

365
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:07.394
need it.

366
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.760
This boy drew his family a house with the crayons Ryan brought notice it has a w

367
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.680
net hope wifi access points.

368
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.100
Join no networks with the people you meet.

369
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.540
Widen the circle to make room for people to be heard and get to know each other.

370
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:29.230
You'll learn stuff including some really random facts about breathing tubes and

371
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:32.210
go chase and you'll make friends for life.

372
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.910
And one day after all this travel,

373
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:42.500
you may be invited to hang out with people whose work you sincerely admire,

374
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.200
people you've been meaning to thank for a while and you won't have to show up

375
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:51.410
empty handed or wind up bringing tee shirts.
No one wants,

376
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.810
you'll have some information they might actually be able to use to help them

377
00:24:56.811 --> 00:25:00.800
make their next trip more meaningful.
This just happened to me.

378
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.240
Next time it's your turn.
Let's make this exponential.

379
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.390
<v 0>Okay,</v>

380
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.223
<v 1>one last thing.</v>

381
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.570
I'm headed to Uganda next month to work on a cervical cancer awareness campaign.

382
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.910
So if you have family or friends in Uganda,
I like to take you for lunch.

383
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.020
You out for lunch.

384
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.370
And when I offered to deliver a Momento to your friends and family in Uganda,

385
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.100
you know,
I mean it.
Thank you.

386
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.730
<v 2>Tying with the message that you said and how it relates to the creation of the</v>

387
00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:40.520
books.
You know,
the,
the idea to go one,
you know,

388
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.620
tenant attacks your miles down the road and,
and you know,
how,

389
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.040
how do you balance that with,
um,
you know,

390
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.620
now everybody's going 10 x or miles down the road and they're all selling.
Um,

391
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.830
you have specialty heirloom corn and,
you know,
how,
how do you,
you know,
not,

392
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:58.690
not overwhelm and keep pushing the frontiers right now when you suggest that

393
00:25:58.691 --> 00:25:59.540
people go places?

394
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.870
<v 1>Well,
the,
the other part of that,
um,
going further is asking more,
right?</v>

395
00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.320
So you don't just go for the corn.
Um,

396
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.670
you meet the farmers and then you asked the farmers what,

397
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.620
what else was happening in the communities.

398
00:26:13.621 --> 00:26:18.390
And suddenly some of the slides I didn't put in here.
They say,
well,
you know,
uh,

399
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:23.040
I like to do woodwork in my spare time.
Oh,
duty.
You know,
and it turns out that,

400
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.750
you know,
the farmers in this village where I went for the corn,
let's be honest.

401
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.850
Um,
have fantastic,
I mean,
it,
it,
it's a surprise.

402
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.810
It's not sort of UNESCO a claimed are preserved.

403
00:26:36.811 --> 00:26:40.350
It's just a matter of time really.
But it's um,
uh,

404
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:44.640
farmers have been doing woodworking in that area for hundreds of years now and

405
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:49.230
donating it to the local church.
So the woodworking splendid,
right?

406
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.110
So you just keep asking more people and you say,
Oh,

407
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:56.190
well anybody else making interesting food or doing something interesting in

408
00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:59.130
their spare time and they will point you towards the next village and they will

409
00:26:59.131 --> 00:27:00.660
point you towards the,
you know,

410
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:04.680
their cousin across the valley who makes this really interesting corn drink

411
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.860
fermented.
That's a more powerful than you expect.

412
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.510
That was tasty but strong.
So yeah,
just keep continuing,

413
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.010
use your curiosity to keep,
to keep pushing past the limit.
And it doesn't,

414
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.970
it certainly,
it doesn't take a journalistic background to do that.

415
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.570
It just takes your sort of natural,

416
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.310
the curiosity that you apply every work,
every day at work here,
uh,

417
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.760
to your travel.
Thank you for presenting.

418
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.040
It's great to hear your information and how to do it.

419
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:44.150
How do you manage the language barriers or differences to really getting in and

420
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:49.830
understanding the culture and meeting the people who may not speak the languages

421
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:54.090
that you do?
Yeah.
So it is helpful to do some,

422
00:27:54.091 --> 00:27:57.090
some language learning before you,
before you go,
if you can,

423
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.610
especially if you know you're going to be going to remote areas,

424
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.880
but there's nothing preventing anyone from hiring a local translator or guide.

425
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.840
I mean,
there are fixers who are,
who are used to this kind of thing,
um,

426
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.250
who you can hire as an independent traveler.
Um,

427
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.710
I just lucked out that,
you know,

428
00:28:16.711 --> 00:28:21.180
when I was referred to a series of,
of,
uh,

429
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.060
translators,
um,
somebody said,
well,

430
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:27.790
this guy is really more of a geologist.
And I said,
Aha.

431
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.100
Because I knew the area that we were going to,
um,
was this,

432
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:36.240
this is known for,
um,
uh,

433
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.240
having prehistoric fossil sites.

434
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:44.630
And I knew that I would want to see what other types of information I could get

435
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:49.080
out of him as a local expert.
So it's trying to find,
you know,

436
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.730
trying to see if you can double up,

437
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.880
can the person who's taking you someplace also provide you with some additional

438
00:28:55.921 --> 00:28:56.754
language learning?

439
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.020
Do they have insights from their own interests or careers or background that

440
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:05.790
they can bring to that,
that story for you?
Um,
and also,

441
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:06.690
you know,
again,

442
00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:10.020
because you don't want to rely on locals to give you all this information

443
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.890
triangulate.
Um,

444
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.560
see if you can make connections with places that you're going.

445
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.040
So instead of saying,
okay,
take me to wherever is important.

446
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:24.750
And then somebody takes you just to the one famous mosque in town and meanwhile

447
00:29:24.751 --> 00:29:27.230
you're passing right by this phenomenal,
you know,

448
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.250
school where in [inaudible] where they,
um,

449
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:35.640
where adults are doing vocational training and lifelong learning and offering

450
00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:39.420
tea to passers by.
You know.
So,
um,

451
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:44.510
if you don't leave it entirely up to your local expert but find it,

452
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.750
try to make some local contacts and find some information about where you're

453
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:52.390
headed.
Um,
dem not also turns out,

454
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:55.780
in addition to having this phenomenal school,
um,

455
00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.930
it is renowned for its olive oil and a particular type of couscous,

456
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.720
which remains to this day.
Like I dream about that cause gifts.

457
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.050
So,
uh,
if you do your own kind of background research,

458
00:30:11.051 --> 00:30:15.670
historical research,
you may come across things that even even locals don't know.

459
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.073
Yup.

460
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.340
<v 4>One last question then.</v>

461
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:32.090
<v 1>What we do,
we do consider paths also.
Um,
uh,
we're aware,</v>

462
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.540
uh,
particularly in,

463
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:38.541
in destinations like Morocco where people can be dependent on a guidebook a lot

464
00:30:38.571 --> 00:30:43.280
because,
um,
it's a,
a key source of information.
Uh,
San Francisco,

465
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.760
there's a lot of information available readily online.
Um,

466
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:51.140
not so much in the kind of outer reaches of the Sahara desert.

467
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:55.620
So,
um,
uh,
but you have to be mindful,
um,

468
00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.700
as a travel writer to constantly be checking and shifting.

469
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.620
So that one,
you know,

470
00:31:03.621 --> 00:31:07.520
you're not enriching the one merchant in town who happens to sell water,

471
00:31:07.521 --> 00:31:12.470
who's in the book.
It's just somebody else also selling water,
you know,
probably.

472
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.800
Can you say,
oh,
along this,

473
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:20.510
this particular block,
there are several people who sell,
sell water.

474
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:25.780
So you want to be mindful of not having an undue impact on,

475
00:31:26.271 --> 00:31:29.960
uh,
uh,
on a remote community.
Uh,
and again,

476
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:33.470
like continuing every time to check,
see what's going on,

477
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:38.030
see how that money is being spent.
You know,
is it,
is it being,

478
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.960
is that the community seeing the benefit or is it really just that one water

479
00:31:41.961 --> 00:31:45.290
seller?
Um,
we had,
um,
there's a,

480
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.930
a story in Morocco.
Um,

481
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.990
there was an oasis that gets bypassed because it's not along a side road was

482
00:31:55.221 --> 00:31:56.720
built,
a bigger road was built.

483
00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.970
And so now this town that has a bit historic ag Dez has been completely

484
00:32:01.971 --> 00:32:05.690
bypassed.
And,
uh,
I thought,
hmm,
I want to,

485
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:10.550
I want to find out what's going on there.
And I had done some,

486
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.210
some research with nonprofits and they said,
yeah,
there's a,

487
00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.700
there's a community garden that's opened up there.

488
00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:21.260
I'm not really sure what they're up to,
but you know,
a few,
few like gardens.

489
00:32:21.261 --> 00:32:24.540
And I knew that,
um,
uh,
um,

490
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:29.660
English folks who are big audience for lonely planet guidebooks are really

491
00:32:29.661 --> 00:32:32.060
passionate about gardening.
I thought,
I better check out the garden.

492
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:37.070
So I went and it turns out that it's a communally organized garden that was

493
00:32:37.071 --> 00:32:42.071
started by some teachers who noticed that kids were falling asleep in class.

494
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.820
Um,
and we're not growing very much.

495
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.890
And they realized that it connected with malnourishment.

496
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.920
They weren't getting enough of a range of nutrients to support them in their

497
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.490
development.
And,
uh,
so the community got together and they said,
look,

498
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:05.810
we've got this patch of land at the center,
we've got one well in town,

499
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.290
maybe we can agree to,
uh,

500
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:15.430
send some of irrigate that one patch that doesn't belong to any one person and

501
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:20.540
all grow vegetables together and agree that this is going to be for the families

502
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:24.270
who need it most.
And then if there's leftover,
then it goes to the,

503
00:33:24.271 --> 00:33:26.990
it's the other families.
And then if there's,
you know,

504
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:30.530
they couldn't actually imagine a time when there would be leftover after that.

505
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.790
Um,
so I met with them and I said,
you know,

506
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.000
can people come and visit your garden without disrupting your gardening?
Uh,

507
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.460
and they said,
sure.
Anytime.
And I was like,
okay,

508
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.600
well actually it's possible you would get a lot of people interested in this

509
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:45.500
garden,
so let's,

510
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.070
let's set some times and let's set a meeting place and let's figure out who's

511
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:53.390
going to be able to let them in and show them around.
Um,
so they,

512
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.700
they thought it was clearly,
they were like,
wow,

513
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.110
this just a garden that we've started in our village on my own.

514
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.230
I can't imagine tourists really want to see it,
but,
okay.
Um,

515
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.970
and the next time I came they said,
first of all,

516
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.980
the garden had grown.
Second of all,

517
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.520
the children had grown and were paying attention in class.

518
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:15.980
They had a,
they had diverse,

519
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:20.930
been able to diversify what they were growing from simple sort of beans and root

520
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:23.090
vegetables.
They were able to grow tomatoes.

521
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.670
They were selling them now to other villages.

522
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.460
So they were able to buy books for the school as well.

523
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.520
So it had this huge knock on effect.

524
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:36.260
And it was all individual travelers coming through saying,
hey,
um,

525
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:40.800
we had provided a,
um,
uh,
arrange saying,
you know,

526
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.280
if you want to plant one row of beans,

527
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:48.200
you could leave a donation of like $5 and that would do that for this community.

528
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:53.300
And people were crazy generous.
And we're like,
wow,

529
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.850
we want you to be able to do,
grow as much food as your community needs.
Um,

530
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:03.770
and uh,
and so they were very moved by that.
The next time I came back they said,

531
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:07.340
okay,
so this is great.
Our,
our community is doing well.

532
00:35:07.341 --> 00:35:11.540
We're able to help out neighboring villages.
Two,
two pilot,

533
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:15.860
similar projects.
And they said,
but one thing we never realized,

534
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.830
we never thought of ourselves as environmental leaders.
And,

535
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.380
and we've had people come to us from,
from,
you know,

536
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.490
visitors from,
not just from the UK but from Bangladesh,

537
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:32.090
from Latin America,
from all these other places saying,

538
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.140
we could do this in the place that I'm from.

539
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:41.610
Do you mind if I borrow this idea?
And very open source.
So they're like,

540
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.610
yes,
we'll tell you how to do it.
We'll tell you how to scale it.

541
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.870
We now have expertise to offer,
right?
We can,

542
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.430
we can help you model this.

543
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.110
So that all happened just because there was,

544
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.230
you know,
I was thinking actually of our users,

545
00:35:58.231 --> 00:36:02.820
I was thinking of British people being interested in gardens,
and in fact,

546
00:36:02.821 --> 00:36:06.270
it had this tremendous impact.
Um,
uh,

547
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.950
and that's something that anybody could do.
It doesn't have to be,

548
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.950
um,
you all have a phenomenal platform.
Um,

549
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.310
and you invent new platforms all the time.

550
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:23.270
So thinking creatively about how you can support an effort that is ongoing.

551
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.040
Like that's,
that's,
that's just what you do at Google.
Um,

552
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.550
you think about users all the time.

553
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.380
So if you think about your travel the same way,
what can you do?

554
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:41.880
What small thing can you do?
What platform can you provide?
Um,
it's a,

555
00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:45.270
it's a powerful tool.
Thank you very much.
Thanks so much,
cliff.

556
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.080
