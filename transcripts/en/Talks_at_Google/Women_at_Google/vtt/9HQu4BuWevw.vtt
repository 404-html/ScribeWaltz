00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.020
First time at Google.
So welcome.
Thank you.
This is amazing.

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.020
So tell us a little bit how you got started on your blog.
Um,

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
well my husband John and I started the blog in 2012 I had been blogging,

4
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.943
um,

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
kind of in another space or on another website for a couple of years and it just

6
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.680
never really did well.
Um,

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.040
it was kind of a lifestyle blog and it was kind of my training wheels and I

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.820
started the more recipes and people really started to resonate with that.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.230
And so once we kind of figured out what was working and what wasn't working with

10
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:38.160
that blog,
um,

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.190
I just kind of came up with the idea to make a blog that kind of represented the

12
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.370
way that I cooked at home,
which is extremely simple.
I'm kind of lazy,

13
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:49.470
kind of impatient as most people are.

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.970
And most of the times I would go to a food blog and I would love the photo,

15
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:57.330
love the idea,
and I would see ingredients that I could never find.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.550
And it took two hours and I just was never going to make it.

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.620
And so that's kind of the heart of our blog.
That's where it came from.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.610
Um,
and the reason that we decided to call it minimalist Baker is because we were

19
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:12.120
also getting really into like simple living in minimalism at the time.

20
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.680
And I have a sweet tooth,
so that's kind of where the name came from.
Um,

21
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.040
and I think that people are drawn to websites that they know what the messages

22
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.980
right away when they come.

23
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.730
Like you don't want to have to search to find out what this person is about,

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.780
which is why we decided to make all the recipes 10 ingredients or last 30

25
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:32.260
minutes or less or one bowl.
Um,

26
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.510
and that's huge really how I cook when I make us dinners.
So,

27
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.310
um,
yeah,
so we've been doing it now for four years,
full time for three years.

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.250
And John does all the techie design,

29
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.880
Google things and I just jumped here with us today to say hi John.

30
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.310
Welcome.
Yeah.

31
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.900
So your new book is specifically focused in that space.
Yes.

32
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.920
So the book,

33
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.000
basically our readers started asking us for something that they could get food

34
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.300
on.
I cook from that didn't require an iPad or their iPhone out.

35
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.360
And so we've been doing that for,

36
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.100
or we started working on that in early 2015 and um,

37
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.260
it's called minimal stickers,
everyday cooking.

38
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.700
And I kind of wanted it to be a collection of breakfast,
lunch,
dinner,
sides,

39
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:22.620
desserts,
so that it truly is kind of covers all the basis in terms of,

40
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.460
you know,
what you would want to cook from your kitchen on everyday basis.
Sorry.

41
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.340
And we're going to try a couple of those recipes today.
Yes.

42
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:32.760
So what are we going to have?
So,
um,
we're going to try to recipes.

43
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:37.230
I'm the first one is a southwest sweet potato,
black bean dip.

44
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.470
It's good for it.
And you guys do sports.
Do you guys watch sporting events?

45
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.260
It'd be really great for that.
We don't watch sports,

46
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.290
but we liked it and it's not required.
Yeah.

47
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.110
And that one I believe comes together in like 30 minutes.
Yes.

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.390
And it's gluten free.
Very,
very simple.

49
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.800
And then the other one is a butternut squash pasta.
Um,

50
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.200
there are so many ways that you can make alternative sauces.
Um,

51
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.700
if you're dairy free,
if you're Vegan,
I have lactose intolerance.

52
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.710
So that's kind of why I started experimenting with alternative sauces and I

53
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.910
didn't write the book on that.

54
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.560
This is kind of like my inspired version and I actually have since created more

55
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.740
sauce recipes that I gravitate more toward.

56
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:24.280
But this one is excellent for fall and you get a whole serving of vegetables

57
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.690
with your pasta.

58
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.640
So it's kind of Nice space and you do quite a bit of Vegan cooking as well.
Yeah,

59
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.360
that's become the focus for the blog because I'm lactose intolerance and I'm was

60
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.490
mostly eating vegetarian anyways.
Um,

61
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:39.610
and I love experimenting with egg free and dairy free baking.

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
That's kind of has become the focus for the blog and most people know us for

63
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:48.010
Vegan gluten free things.
Fabulous.
We'll let's go.
Okay,
let's do it.

64
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.690
So we're going to start with the dip and kind of the first thing you want to do,

65
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.550
make sure you've rinsed off your sweet potato,

66
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:59.350
which I assume they have absolutely can confirm sweet potatoes plan.

67
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.210
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
And you're just going to kind of,

68
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.010
you don't have to remove the skin or anything.

69
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.700
I'm just chop it up and you're just going to one of,

70
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.770
kind of cut it into bite sized cubes.
Being very careful.

71
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.250
Obviously
I have accidentally cut myself before.

72
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.710
I think if you haven't accidentally cut yourself,
I'm not cooking and math,

73
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.810
you're like not the real deal.

74
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.340
My chef teammates tell me a good cut is your first like real badge of honor and

75
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:34.150
a kitchens.
Yeah,
quite a chicken.
I tried to avoid it,

76
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:36.790
but they tell me how it makes you really super religious.
So feel,

77
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:38.080
feel safe in math.
Yeah.

78
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.720
John usually comes down to check on all my injuries during the day.

79
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:43.180
Like I burned myself again.
He's like,
stop doing that.

80
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.870
It's like it's part of the kid badges of honor.
Just on her.
Yeah.

81
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.280
So I think,
um,

82
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.330
I kind of learned early on that there is a big difference in,

83
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.950
especially with sweet potatoes when it comes to organic and nonorganic the

84
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.660
flavor and the texture of organic sweet potatoes is in majorly better than

85
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:06.580
nonorganic.
And I'm sure you're all very smart,

86
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.910
intelligent people and you probably know that organic produce is better,
but,
um,

87
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.980
just for the sheer sake of flavor,
organic sweet potatoes are so,

88
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.090
so much better and you don't have to add as much,
you know,

89
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.550
oil and salt and sweet near to them because they're just naturally already

90
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.360
tasting a lot better.
Are there other um,

91
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.910
produce items you feel strongly are significantly better from a taste

92
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:32.350
perspective when organic?
I think most of the squashes are actually,
um,

93
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.100
I can usually tell a big difference with apples and strawberries especially just

94
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.720
you know,
things that are in season are going to taste better as well.
Um,

95
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.160
so yeah,
but mostly I think the biggest one has been sweet potatoes actually.

96
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.960
So all is you're going to do is just drizzle on a little bit of cooking oil.

97
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:54.961
I usually use like melted coconut oil at home cause it's a really nice source of

98
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.500
healthy fats.

99
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.050
And then all you're going to see his knees with is a little bit of salts and

100
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.530
Maple Syrup just to kind of bring out their sweetness a little bit more.

101
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.500
Just drizzle that on
our flat top.

102
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:14.740
Just wants to talk to you first.
I'm sorry.
They're

103
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.450
supposed to be a safety feature is often an annoyance feature I can say from

104
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:24.950
personal experience.
And then this is just cumin,
Chili powder,

105
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:29.720
sin and cinnamon,
which enhances the flavor even more,
adds a little bit of spice.

106
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:34.160
So a little bit of salty,
sweet,
savory spice mixed.
Love it.

107
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.130
You don't really have to add a lot of sweet potatoes because they're already so

108
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.200
delicious.
Um,

109
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.830
but this just kind of enhances their flavor and make some pop in the actual dip.

110
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.310
So you're going to roast these for about 20 minutes at three 75 or just until

111
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.110
they're tender.
Um,

112
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.320
because we don't have that much time.

113
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:58.800
We already have some rusted through the magic of preparation.
So

114
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.680
while we did at you guys,
um,
came out perfectly.
I'm so impressed.

115
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:10.910
I mean,
I didn't even do this so I can't take the credit.
But yeah,

116
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:13.460
essentially the rest of the dip is very simple.

117
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.790
I'm going to go ahead and put these ingredients in here and then we'll look up

118
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.350
the sauce.
This is just fresh corn.

119
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:23.351
You can also use canned corn if you can't find a whole corn on the cob.

120
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.530
And then this is just diced red onion,
black beans.

121
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:32.270
You could also use pinto beans,
um,
or other beans.
Or if you don't like beans,

122
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.270
keen walk would actually be an excellent substitution.

123
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.520
And then just a little bit of fresh Cilantro.

124
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.490
So that makes up the bulk of,
can I set things on here?
Okay.

125
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.980
It might be,
if it beeps,
we'll just tell it to stop.
Yeah.
Oh,

126
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.770
I think I will actually use this both for the sauce.

127
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.530
So we are going to,

128
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.130
essentially the sauce is just a slightly saucy or guacamole and I kind of like

129
00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:09.801
to have the avocado and then cut it in cubes so it smashes up a lot easier.

130
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.260
Usually a few knock it,
it comes off.

131
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.670
Make sure you don't cut your hand that you've not be good.
Yeah,

132
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.500
I don't think I want that.

133
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.560
Another badge of honor at Google today on camera as so once it's cubed you can

134
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:32.510
just kind of scoop it out like so

135
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.450
you can be fancy and use a potato Masher I like just using a fork cause I think

136
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:41.284
it's faster

137
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.520
and you can usually tell if the avocado is ripe.
Obviously it's soft,

138
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:53.050
but also when you buy it,
there's usually a little,
um,

139
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.190
I don't know what it's called,
like stem at the top.

140
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.780
And if you take it off and it's green,

141
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:01.860
that means it's still fresh and it's going to be good because sometimes you open

142
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.340
avocado and it's brown in it.
Makes sure we're just ruined your day,
you know?

143
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.770
And that can also help you avoid squeezing them.

144
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:12.100
So everyone else who comes through doesn't get bruised stuff.
Avocados.
Yeah.

145
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.650
So you're just going to mash up your avocado.

146
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:20.670
It doesn't have to be perfect.
You can actually,
if you like,

147
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.720
kind of the chunkier guacamole texture,
you could just leave a lot of it whole.

148
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.960
Um,
and so yeah,

149
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.710
we're also going to be adding some lime juice.

150
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.360
I have a fancy juicer at home,
but before I had a juicer,

151
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:40.860
I just kind of stuck a fork in there and juice it out like this.

152
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.200
It's just adds a little bit of acidity to the dip.

153
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:49.560
Since we have quite a bit of sweetness going on with the sweet potatoes,

154
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.550
it also helps keep the avocado from browning.

155
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

156
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.511
<v 0>Okay.</v>

157
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:05.511
And then we're also just going to add a pinch of salt and a little bit of olive

158
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:13.010
oil just to send it out.
Phew.

159
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.100
Trying to avoid fats.
That's optional.
You don't have to.

160
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.010
And then just a tiny bit more of,

161
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.980
you can use a Ga bay nectar here or just maple syrup.

162
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.090
I think it just kind of,
I don't know.
In most of the sauces that I make,

163
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:31.091
I like to have a acidity and saltiness and a little bit of sweetness,

164
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:34.580
which is why I like adding the maple syrup in there

165
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.510
so you can just kind of taste as you go.
Um,

166
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.140
this is looking just about right and now we're just going to,

167
00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:51.520
Oh,
I lost my mixing bowls,
my mixing spoons.

168
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.260
Certain we have more.
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

169
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

170
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.690
<v 0>And you can make this step ahead of time.
It would actually be,</v>

171
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:10.330
I think the flavor kind of gets better the longer it marinades.

172
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.723
<v 2>Okay.</v>

173
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.120
<v 0>Once it's kind of mixed together you can taste it and see if it needs more lime</v>

174
00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:22.070
juice,
more solid,
more maple syrup.

175
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.940
I'm usually adding more of all these things,
um,

176
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.930
because I like big flavorful dishes and then we're just going to finish it with

177
00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:33.020
a little bit more fresh Cilantro and just kind of for some more color.

178
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.390
And
that's essentially it.

179
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:40.820
I'm just going to scoop some into my serving dish here.

180
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.800
Cilantro is sometimes a controversial ingredient here at Google as as many

181
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.420
people I think in general have a reaction in a bad way to the taste.

182
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:54.070
Is there another herb you might recommend or another garnish might play with if

183
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:59.050
you say wanted to avoid Cilantro?
Um,
yeah.

184
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:02.740
John doesn't like Cilantro so I know the struggle is real in our house.

185
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.920
It's real.
Real here.
Likes how many people don't like Cilantro here.

186
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.680
Okay.
So sorry.
No,
how to throw for who to throw food out later.
Um,

187
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.070
you could easily just leave out saunter to be honest,
it's not a key ingredient.

188
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:22.660
You could also use parsley.
Mint might actually add a nice flavor,
um,

189
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.460
really kind of whatever you have on hand.

190
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:26.680
But if you have like an adversity to salon show,

191
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:29.950
you might not like the taste of other herbs as well.

192
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:34.360
Like maybe parsley would be too similar.
So maybe just leave it out.
If so,

193
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.570
feel free to leave it out or as we tried to do here,

194
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:41.380
you could put it on this side and then your guests could perhaps that.
Yeah.
Yes.

195
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.980
Oh,
well it's in the dip.
So sorry about that guys.
We already mixed it.

196
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.720
Totally fine.
So you can serve that.
I'm actually,
I just made this,

197
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:52.480
her finance today and she just ate it like a Burrito bowl with a fork.

198
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.590
But usually I serve it with chips.
Um,
that's,
yeah,

199
00:12:56.591 --> 00:13:01.450
that's our first raising to me.
Um,
okay,
so pasta shall we?

200
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.270
Yeah.
So,
okay.

201
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:08.620
How many of you guys have made a Vegan like cheese sauce?
Oh,

202
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.630
you guys experts.
I know what I'm working with here.
Okay.
So,
uh,

203
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.920
personally I like to use kind of like the cheaper almond milk that you get at

204
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:21.370
the store because if you get too high of quality of almond milk,

205
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.100
the flavor if of the almonds is way too strong.

206
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.760
I kind of like using the cheapo ones that you know,

207
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:32.050
like are a dollar a carton because they're kind of mostly water.
Um,

208
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:37.290
but for kind of the sake of showing you guys what a nut milk looks like,

209
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.160
I sometimes make my own at home.
It is quite simple.
Um,

210
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.490
you basically can just make your own at home in that way you can control how

211
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:48.190
much water is in it and you can control the flavor and you don't have to add

212
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:50.950
sweeteners,
which oftentimes is brands do.

213
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.430
So this is just one cup of soaked almonds.

214
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.690
You can soak them overnight and cold water.
Or if you're in a hurry,

215
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:02.070
which I usually am because I forget,
uh,
you can just pour,

216
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.740
I'm really hot water over them,
let them soak for an hour and they're good to go.

217
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.730
Okay.
And this is five cups of filtered water

218
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.650
and it's going to get very loud.

219
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.500
<v 1>There we go.
Here we go.</v>

220
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.020
<v 0>So normally I would let that go for about a minute or two.
Really.</v>

221
00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:44.590
The longer you blend your nut milks,
the more um,

222
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.650
kind of meat you're going to get out of it and the creamy or your sauces are

223
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:50.440
going to be.
And so,
um,

224
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.750
but the sake of time I will go ahead and pour it out.

225
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.230
Usually what I do is that you can buy nut milk bags.

226
00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:01.650
Do you guys know what those are?
No.
Okay.
You guys are so cool.
Um,

227
00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.960
I don't actually have a nut milk bag,
so I'm not that fancy.

228
00:15:03.961 --> 00:15:06.570
I just put like a really thin,

229
00:15:06.571 --> 00:15:11.130
clean towel over and mixing bowl and just pour it over.
Uh,

230
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.540
but today we're going to use this kind of sieve contraption here and you're

231
00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:19.720
essentially just trying to get out any of the extra,
um,

232
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:25.370
bits of almonds that may be left behind because that makes sure not milk tastes

233
00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:27.540
gritty and that's not what we want.

234
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.790
So you can see kind of at this stage or when you're blending,

235
00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:36.450
you can add dates to sweeten our maple syrup or add vanilla if you want to have

236
00:15:36.451 --> 00:15:37.860
like vanilla almond milk.

237
00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:41.820
But since we're going to be making a savory sauce today,

238
00:15:41.821 --> 00:15:45.330
you don't really want any of that extra sweetness.
Um,

239
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.290
and of course you can use other nuts as well.
I think he's will not to be great.

240
00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:53.100
You can make oatmeal,
you can make hemp seed milk.
Um,

241
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.970
it's the same general principle.
So similar methodology,

242
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.900
different route ingredient.
Yeah.
Um,

243
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.850
you don't need to soak things like oats for as long as nuts,

244
00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:06.090
just because nuts are kind of hard and um,

245
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.740
you need to soak them to open them up and get the flavor on.
So yeah.

246
00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:14.250
And then you have about four to five cups of almond milk and that will keep in

247
00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:17.910
the fridge for a few days.
I think I'm just gonna set this over here.

248
00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:21.660
I feel incredibly lazy for purchasing almond milk if it's really,
I mean,

249
00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:23.340
I still purchase almond milk.
I just,

250
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.720
I think that it's nice to know how to make it because I honestly think the taste

251
00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:30.390
is better.
Um,
but you,
you know,

252
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.240
for the average person who's working all day and you needed to go home at night,

253
00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:37.020
like he don't need to be making your own if you don't want to.
Okay.

254
00:16:37.021 --> 00:16:42.000
So do you guys know how to cut up butternut squash is,
yes.

255
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.210
Have you guys done that?
It's dangerous.
It's super dangerous.
I had,
I watched him.

256
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.730
Do you have tips?
I would love it.

257
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.580
I watched a youtube video like three times before I attempted it,

258
00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:55.040
so I didn't hurt myself.
Um,
butternut squash is just pretty firm.
Um,

259
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.780
and so they're kind of difficult to peel,

260
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:03.230
but essentially all you want to do is cut off the top and the bottom so you have

261
00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:04.921
a stable base.

262
00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:08.640
And then I also like to cut off the bulb from the kind of skinny top part.
Yeah.

263
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

264
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.420
<v 0>And then you want to peel it,</v>

265
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:19.340
which you can do a with a vegetable peeler.
I don't,
I've never used this one,

266
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:23.720
so we'll see how this goes.
I actually kind of just prefer using the knife.

267
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:25.970
I think it's a lot easier.
You have more control.

268
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.753
<v 2>Okay.</v>

269
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.600
<v 0>Um,
it's butternut squash I think is the most difficult,
but you can,</v>

270
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.160
I think it's also equally difficult to do pumpkin sometimes.
Um,

271
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.120
but the more you do it,

272
00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:44.121
the really it's so much easier it gets and it's not that difficult.

273
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.960
And I use butternut squash a lot during the fall.
Um,

274
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.320
kind of when it's in season and really fresh.

275
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.500
And then you just want to scoop out the seeds,

276
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:57.240
which I will attempt to do with the spoon.

277
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.320
But you can also do this with kind of like a melon baller that might actually be

278
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.360
easier,
perhaps that robust,
that might work a little bit better.

279
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.810
Now you're essentially just trying to get all the seeds out

280
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.720
and there's a lot of seeds.
So I might actually just do a half.

281
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.700
You actually only need two cups of,
he would butternut squash for this.

282
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.580
If you're in a super big hurry like I was yesterday,

283
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.420
you can despite cubed butternut squash at the store.
Um,

284
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.070
but for those of you who might get like CSA boxes or if you just want to know

285
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.090
kind of how to do it,

286
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.940
it is nice to know that it's very easy to do at home and you probably saved

287
00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:43.970
money that way as well.

288
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.400
Does anybody have any questions for Dana while she's diligently getting the

289
00:18:52.401 --> 00:18:53.234
squash?

290
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.880
So for that,
for our TV audience,

291
00:19:01.881 --> 00:19:05.660
the question is what do you do with the almond pulp once it's strained?

292
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.990
You can do a lot of things with the almond pope.
Um,

293
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.840
you can dry it out in the oven and then add it to baked goods.
Um,
for instance,

294
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:17.480
like banana breads really easy to make gluten free.

295
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.560
So that's what I ended up doing a,

296
00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:23.330
the times is just kind of dragging it out and keeping it on hand.

297
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.750
You can also add it just like it is two things.

298
00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:28.980
Like say I'm

299
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.370
a date based desserts,
which are some of my favorite vegan desserts.

300
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.920
Just blend up some dates,
throw in the almond pulp,

301
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.670
throwing in some nuts and Roman to balls and they're like little energy bites.

302
00:19:40.671 --> 00:19:45.110
That way,
you're not wasting any part of the almond,
which is nice.

303
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.640
Um,
if you just write out and the oven,
I think it just like three 50 for,

304
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.050
I don't know,
15 to 20 minutes.

305
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.120
You don't want it to start looking like burnt or brown.

306
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.230
You just want to basically remove the moisture from it.

307
00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.000
And then you have kind of like the almond milk that you buy at the store.
Um,

308
00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:04.550
it has been processed slightly differently,
but it's this,

309
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.540
it's the same exact texture.
Um,

310
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:12.010
and then I think that's the easiest thing you can do with it.
Um,

311
00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:13.700
and then you can just kind of,

312
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.050
the way that I make things gluten free is sub in oat flour,

313
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:21.530
almond meal and a gluten free blend.
Um,

314
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.680
and that usually takes the place of the all purpose flour and favorite gluten

315
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:32.670
free blend cause there's a lot of them.
Yeah.
So I have my unblend,

316
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.980
um,
that I use on the blog,
but is in terms of store bought,

317
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.840
I really like Bob's red mill,

318
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.980
their new one to one gluten free baking blend is pretty,

319
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.040
it's pretty spot on.
It has a really nice light,

320
00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:50.740
airy texture and it has a nice blend of ingredients.
Um,

321
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.070
and yeah,
that tends to be my go to.

322
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.630
So does anybody else have any favorite gluten-free blends?
I'm,

323
00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.830
there's always more that I haven't tried.

324
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.490
<v 2>Yeah.
Bob's,</v>

325
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.890
<v 0>it's pretty good.
They kind of have it figured out.</v>

326
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.510
I've also heard good things about the,
I think it's called Cup for cup.
Yeah.

327
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:13.850
And he's that one to great effect,

328
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.470
but it's certainly a selectively in terms of what I'm making.
Right?

329
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.190
Yeah.
And I think that one is a little bit more pricey too,
so,
um,
likely.

330
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.350
So there's,

331
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:29.150
there's so many great blogs now that are s like just strictly gluten free,

332
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:34.130
um,
in terms of like baking and you can go and try a million different blends.

333
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.100
The one that I have is a pretty good all purpose blend.
Um,

334
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.060
but I've been trying new ones from other sites as well and there's just like a

335
00:21:41.061 --> 00:21:45.170
lot of really beautiful blends out there for different purposes.
Okay.

336
00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:46.850
So we have most,
we'll just call it good.

337
00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:51.740
We have most of the squash cubes and you're just going to add a little bit of

338
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.700
oil.
Again,
I would probably use coconut oil or avocado at home,

339
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.640
a little bit of salt and we're going to throw it in there right along that side.

340
00:22:01.641 --> 00:22:05.960
The sweet potatoes and betterness.
Squash doesn't take that long to bake,

341
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.890
usually only like 15 to 20 minutes.
And you're just looking for a soft texture.

342
00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:12.080
Like when you put Polka fork in,
it should fall out,

343
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.580
which we have here isn't just
um,

344
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:22.690
so I'm just going to saute up some garlic to add some kick to the sauce and

345
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.610
because we're going to be blending and it doesn't have to be finally a minster.

346
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:27.981
Anything,

347
00:22:27.981 --> 00:22:32.981
just kind of a loose chop so it gets evenly cooked and we're just going to add a

348
00:22:34.671 --> 00:22:36.440
little bit of olive oil to the pan.

349
00:22:36.441 --> 00:22:40.430
I believe a few tablespoons going off of memory here.

350
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.960
No we are,
I haven't tried this recipe with roasted garlic,

351
00:22:48.961 --> 00:22:53.100
but I would think it would pair really well with the flavors of the

352
00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:00.300
squash.
It's going to rinse this off.
So,

353
00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:01.770
as I'm sure most of you guys know,

354
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:05.310
you aren't looking for like burnt garlic because that's an awful flavor.

355
00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:08.130
You're just looking for it to be slightly browned,

356
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.740
not should only take a couple of minutes.
Kind of while that's happening,

357
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.340
I think I will go ahead and add my squash to the blender.
Um,

358
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.700
you don't have to have a nice high speed blender.

359
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:25.840
You could probably do this in a food processor,
but I just kind of like,
um,

360
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.100
the texture that highspeed blenders give sauces because there's like zero

361
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:31.460
grittiness,
um,

362
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.910
which can kind of be a problem sometimes with Vegan sausages.
Um,

363
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:41.620
we're also going to add nutritional yeast.
This is,
I actually,

364
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.930
I don't even know what nutrition nutritional yeast is.

365
00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:48.380
I know that it has be 12 it and it tastes like cheese
and it's,

366
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:51.790
I call it fairy dust for,
for vegans.
Um,
uh,

367
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.800
we're also going to be adding some salt to the sauce and a bit of pepper.

368
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.010
Um,
and I also like to add in some Vegan parmesan cheese,

369
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:07.220
which is basically just raw cashews,
nutritional yeast,

370
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:11.450
garlic powder and sea salt.
And it ends up tasting an incredible amount,

371
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.320
like real parmesan cheese and I basically put it on everything.

372
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.080
We're also going to add a little bit of vegetable broth.
Umm,

373
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:25.940
if you don't have broth you can just sub all almond milk and an unsweetened

374
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:30.710
planed almond milk.
If you have an allergy,
you could also sub rice milk.

375
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.990
I would probably stay away from soy milk because it has kind of an intense

376
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:36.824
flavor.

377
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.230
And let's just pretend that this is perfectly,

378
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:47.150
it's really brown.
You have to,
because it is really,
really brown.

379
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:48.860
I would probably let it go a couple more minutes,

380
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:52.220
but I kind of liked the flavor of raw garlic as well,

381
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:55.700
so that's fine depending on the,

382
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.390
how much do you like spicy food?
I guess we'll turn this baby off.

383
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:05.630
Well,
yeah,
we're good.
We're good.
You can also throw in a little red pepper flake,

384
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:10.430
which I usually prefer.
Um,
you can also add chili garlic sauce.

385
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.300
Um,
you don't need much of this because it's quite strong,

386
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.280
but because the butternut squash,
when it rose up,
it gets a tiny bit sweet.

387
00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:22.610
I just feel that it needs to be offset with something a little bit spicier

388
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.131
and when you're bundling it,

389
00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:39.030
you'll kind of be able to tell how thick the sauce is getting.

390
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.060
Right now it's looking more of like a puree,

391
00:25:42.061 --> 00:25:45.840
so I'm just going to add in the rest of my almond milk and a little bit more

392
00:25:45.841 --> 00:25:50.460
broth.
You're looking for a thick but pourable consistency.

393
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.050
Okay.

394
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:09.430
That's looking just about right and I just realized I need the cooktop again,

395
00:26:09.431 --> 00:26:13.600
so we're just trying to put it back on the stove to warm it up.

396
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.820
It's ready as it is,

397
00:26:15.821 --> 00:26:20.821
but just to kind of heated up and develop the flavors a little bit more.

398
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.070
It is still looking a little bit thick,

399
00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:29.071
so I might add in just a tiny bit more of my water or almond milk is fine too.

400
00:26:29.711 --> 00:26:31.170
The colors beautiful.

401
00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:35.590
It's reminiscent of beloved Mac and cheese.

402
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:41.350
That's kind of the great thing about using vegetable purees as the base for your

403
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:46.200
sauces is because they add such a color that looks like there's actually cheese

404
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:50.490
in it when there's not.
So yeah,

405
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:54.180
I think I'm just going to grab a little bit more water and thin it down a little

406
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:55.014
bit

407
00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.380
and you're just going to warm that up and I'm looking for a whisk.
Yeah.

408
00:27:03.381 --> 00:27:07.820
So you're just going to kind of heat it up.
And while this is happening,

409
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.270
cooking some pasta.
I'm eating gluten free at the moment,

410
00:27:11.271 --> 00:27:13.940
so I usually am going for a gluten free pasta,

411
00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:18.941
which I've actually been very impressed with the quality of a gluten free passes

412
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.240
that you can find at the store now.
It's like they're undetectable gluten free,

413
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.450
which is great.
That's big progress.
It is big progress.

414
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.060
Do you have a favorite specifically from a brand perspective?

415
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.800
So trader Joe's has a great organic brown rice and Chenwa um,
pasta,

416
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:38.510
which um,
I really think it doesn't taste like,

417
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.460
I don't think it tastes much different then.
Maybe I'll try that.
Yeah,

418
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.270
if you like it silly,
I think it's good.
If you let it sit too long,

419
00:27:47.271 --> 00:27:51.290
it can kind of get a little bit gummy.
It's true.
Regular Pasta too though,

420
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:53.230
or pasta too.
Um,
and yeah.

421
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:58.260
Then you're just going to add in your cooked pasta and give it a toss and you're

422
00:28:00.621 --> 00:28:02.730
basically good to go.
Um,

423
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.920
the only other things I would add as a garnish here would be more Vegan parmesan

424
00:28:06.921 --> 00:28:10.250
cheese because I always put more vegan.
Parmesan cheese on my pasta is,

425
00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:14.750
it just adds a lot more flavor.
Um,
but yeah,

426
00:28:14.751 --> 00:28:16.040
that's essentially,
it

427
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.420
smells amazing.
If you can't smell it where you're sitting,

428
00:28:22.421 --> 00:28:24.490
I can tell you it smells amazing.

429
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:29.230
And the sauce to pasta ratio is probably a little bit heavy,

430
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.140
but I kind of personally like that.
So

431
00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.800
thanks there.
And then,
yeah,

432
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.100
just kind of finish it up with some garnishes just to make it look a little bit

433
00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:41.170
more pretty.
Um,

434
00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:44.830
if you are interested in another more,

435
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:49.831
I guess I have developed more pasta sauces since this recipe that I almost like

436
00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:55.000
a little bit more just by making that pasta.

437
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.270
This pasta is wonderful and beautiful and special,

438
00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.950
but if you had other pastas you might like them.
Also,
there's a lot of,
um,

439
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.650
I have a lot of Mac and cheese recipes on the site using different things.

440
00:29:05.651 --> 00:29:08.110
So you can experiment with a lot of different bases,

441
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:11.680
but this is great for fall and it's great to get a serving of vegetables with

442
00:29:11.681 --> 00:29:15.250
your pasta.
So I love it.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

443
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.290
<v 1>Does anybody</v>

444
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.490
<v 0>have any questions for Dana?</v>

445
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.570
How do you balance your love of food and having to maintain a blog to promote it

446
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:29.100
and really the upkeep aspect of running a blog professionally.
Sure.

447
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.610
Um,

448
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:34.610
well I genuinely do love cooking and developing recipes and eating all day.

449
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:39.000
And so I think that you kind of have to have a heart for it.
Um,

450
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.540
as I'm sure most people who do it would be able to confirm.

451
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:45.880
But I also make sure that,

452
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.670
and John always encourages me just to make the things that I'm interested in

453
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:52.730
making and the things that I love.
Otherwise it can feel really constraining,
um,

454
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.590
to like you,
you want to,
you know,
make our recipe that gets good search traffic.

455
00:29:56.591 --> 00:29:58.990
Well,
like is that actually what you get excited about in the morning?

456
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.280
So generally the things that I'm making during the week or the recipes that I

457
00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:06.730
schedule out are ones that I am really interested in trying.

458
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.370
Like I love Mac and cheese.
So how can I make that for vegans?

459
00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:12.850
Or how can I make that,
um,
tastes just as good as the real thing.

460
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.550
So it sounds like authenticity.
Yeah.
He like,

461
00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:20.551
you have to really love what you're doing and not get too worried about forcing

462
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:24.490
it to make it successful.
Yeah.
And the further you get along,

463
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:27.370
like we've been doing it for four years,
it is sometimes hard to remember that.

464
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:30.550
And it can be a struggle some days like,
oh,
this is a business.

465
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:32.290
It's not fun anymore.
But we,

466
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.530
it's just the two of us and we have a lot of fun and we love working at home and

467
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:40.570
I love cooking.
So it's,
it's usually pretty easy to keep that in mind.

468
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.230
Do you have formal culinary training and then how would you more specifically

469
00:30:44.231 --> 00:30:48.100
recommend like Vegan culinary training so you don't have to see your point

470
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.100
called compromise your principles to get traditional culinary training?

471
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.270
I don't have traditional culinary training.
I've worked in a humorous,

472
00:30:55.271 --> 00:30:58.870
the number of restaurants,
like probably 20 restaurants.

473
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.600
I've been a server and a host and I've been,

474
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.430
I'm also prepared foods that I did get a really good handle on cooking that way.

475
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.740
And then I'm watching the food network,

476
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:11.650
honestly just learning like how does Emeril Lagasse chop an onion?

477
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:15.670
And then I would try it.
Um,
and then just a lot of experimentation.

478
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.080
I have wondered about going to culinary school,
but like you said,

479
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:21.490
I don't know if I would want to do it.

480
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:25.750
The traditional route of having to learn how to make butter sauces because I

481
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:27.550
personally couldn't try it or if I'm gluten free,

482
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:30.730
I don't know if I could try like a souffle.
Um,

483
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:35.050
but I did just butchering aspect I imagine would be a huge turnout.
Yeah.

484
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.200
But I think that more and more programs are understanding that.

485
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.070
And I actually just spoke with a friend who went to a culinary program in New

486
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.390
York City that was fused with nutrition and she's Vegan and at the time she was

487
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:48.480
being,
when she went through the program.
And,
um,

488
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.390
they were able to kind of accommodate for all the different students diets,

489
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.720
which was very encouraging to me because prior to that,

490
00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:58.330
I didn't think that you could go to culinary school without doing the

491
00:31:58.331 --> 00:31:58.990
traditional,

492
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.800
the traditional kind of French methods of like the butchering and the cheese

493
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:05.380
sauces in the F souffle's and those types of things.

494
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:09.920
So I think that if you do some research,
there are definitely options.
Um,

495
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.830
and even in a city like Portland where we live,

496
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:15.430
there are a number of restaurants that do cooking classes and there's businesses

497
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:19.450
that are solely based around teaching people,
um,
cooking.

498
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.600
So I haven't done any research on if there's Vegan options,

499
00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:25.540
but I'm sure there there are,
yeah.

500
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.990
Like tips for the experimentation process and any,

501
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:33.610
any guard rails that can help abort fails.
And then how do you manage your fails?

502
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:38.350
Yeah.
Um,
John is good to remind me that it's all experimentation,

503
00:32:38.351 --> 00:32:41.840
so he'll come down like,
oh,
my recipes fail today and I had to throw them away,

504
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.340
but compost them hope.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
definitely composting them.

505
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.580
Yeah.
It's just a part of the process.

506
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:54.581
I mean I kind of see what I do as the learning what doesn't work.

507
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:59.900
So you kind of don't have to do that at home.
Um,
but you know,

508
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:02.480
I would say for every recipe I try,

509
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:05.630
I'm testing it two to three times and that means that the first two times just

510
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:05.931
aren't,

511
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:09.560
it just didn't go well or maybe I have something in mind and I just can't figure

512
00:33:09.561 --> 00:33:09.771
it out.

513
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:13.730
And so I just set it aside for the day because I've tried it five times and it

514
00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:15.740
didn't work.
Um,
so that's,
yeah,

515
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:20.300
it's just part of the process and hopefully you can find reliable blogs out

516
00:33:20.301 --> 00:33:22.910
there that kind of see you in the right direction.
Um,

517
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.440
and there are more and more blogs all the time specifically focusing on gluten

518
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:29.060
free cooking,
plant based cooking.

519
00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:32.570
So I think it's getting easier to become vegan and gluten free.

520
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.660
Maybe use those as a jumping off point.
Yeah.
Experimentation.
Yeah,

521
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.060
that's what I do,
frankly.

522
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:43.061
I look at five different ways somebody said to do something and core elements

523
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:48.140
that can be combined and figure it must be important.
I use those.
Yeah,

524
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:48.860
exactly.

525
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.700
Cause I always like to don't want to feel constrained by it but I also know you

526
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:56.060
know people like Dana or are failing for us in that regard.

527
00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:58.850
So I try to acknowledge that and use that to my benefit.

528
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.280
And I think it's helpful too when you're trying to attempt something.

529
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.590
Say like uh,
like a cheese sauce it,

530
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.990
this one isn't a great example of it but the one,

531
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:08.570
the newest one on the blog the best,

532
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:11.390
I think it's called the best gluten free Mac and cheese or Vegan Mac and cheese.

533
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:15.830
I just went and looked at like how does the best French chef make a cheese
sauce?

534
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:18.410
And then I just tried to mock that.
But with Vegan ingredients,

535
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:22.700
I think that it's really helpful on recipes like that where you,

536
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.740
you kind of want to know what the basics are.

537
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:28.130
You want to know what the foundational principles are so that when you go to

538
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:30.700
attempt it you kind of have some frame of mind you're in.

539
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.020
You're not just like throwing a bunch of stuff in the blender and hoping it

540
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:37.610
turns out.
I think you can at least follow like a methodology stuff.
Right,

541
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.810
right.
I usually go to like [inaudible] Garten and out in brown because they,

542
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.500
they know and they've tested and they've tried and they're like seasoned chefs.

543
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:49.970
Like that way I kind of have some type of path to go off of when I'm trying to

544
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.710
veganize something or make it gluten free.

545
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:56.711
I Kenji Lopez all is great too cause he speaks really about the why behind why

546
00:34:57.141 --> 00:35:02.060
recipes work and you can use that for experimentation because you won't take out

547
00:35:02.061 --> 00:35:03.290
those core elements.
Right.

548
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:08.210
That are make or break best recommendations for someone transitioning off of

549
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:09.890
dairy.
Yes.

550
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.360
Vegan Parmesan cheese I think is a huge life saver because I used to put

551
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.720
parmesan cheese on everything and then it was just stripped away in my life

552
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:22.520
wasn't complete.
So what life was it Seamus?
Yeah.
So once I realized like,

553
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:25.010
oh I can still make cheese sauces,
I can still have pizza.

554
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:29.540
Like I bring my Parmesan Shaker to the restaurants.
It's very tacky.
Like,
oh no,

555
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:33.530
wait,
I have my own,
I think in Portland,
in the bay area,

556
00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.670
you can get away with that for sure.
Yeah.
Well I'm,

557
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.550
and in Portland sometimes you go to pizza shops and they have nutritional use on

558
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:40.800
the counter.
So it makes it a lot easier.

559
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:44.820
You are not alone testing out a lot of or just trying out a lot of the different

560
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.330
um,
dairy alternatives.
Like,
um,
diet cheese is great.

561
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.170
I know some people don't love it,
but I think it's kind of an acquired taste.

562
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:55.620
And then the further I get away from having had cheese,

563
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:59.460
I kind of forget what it was like.
Um,
but it just takes time,

564
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:03.150
like any breakup.
But the good thing is,

565
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:07.770
is that a lot of companies are putting more and more plant based items on the

566
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:11.670
market and there's amazing Vegan cheeses now that like our soft cheeses and hard

567
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:14.890
cheeses that genuinely do you taste like the real thing.
Um,

568
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.320
and of course all the different nut milks you can make.
Um,
I don't miss,
you know,

569
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:20.970
dairy because there's coconut milk,

570
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:24.930
ice cream and I can put the Parmesan cheese on my pizza.
And,

571
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.770
um,
yeah,
I mean,
there's definitely some things that I miss,

572
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:32.150
but I think that there are so many alternatives.
Um,

573
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.570
so I think just like finding out what,
um,

574
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.760
what are the things that you missed most about it?

575
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:41.760
And then trying to find substitutions.
Like I really missed ice cream,

576
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:44.760
so that's why I have so many ice cream recipes on the blog.

577
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:49.110
There's like 15 or something.
So it sounds good to me.
Yeah.

578
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.510
Well,
thank you so much for joining us.

579
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.500
I'm glad you were able to come to Google and especially to share this with all,

580
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.400
all of us today.
Yeah.
Thanks for having me.
