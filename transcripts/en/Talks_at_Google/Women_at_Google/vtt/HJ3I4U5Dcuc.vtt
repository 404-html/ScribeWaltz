00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.020
Everyone.
How are you?
Monday?
Monday lunchtime.
We awake.
Yeah.

2
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.790
Hello.
Uh,
Indiana,

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.060
thank you so much for being here and sharing with us at Google.

4
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.060
Um,
we could not be more thrilled and as you can see,

5
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:25.810
you got a huge lunchtime crowd coming out.
I only see empty.

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.880
I'm only lean focusing on the MTC.

7
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:32.380
It's where are those people that my manager hates me because whenever I play,

8
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.650
I'll play like a packed house and I'll say to people in the front that just

9
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:37.870
probably their kid got sick and then couldn't make.
And I'm like,

10
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:42.130
what did we sell those two fucking seats in the front?
He's like,
I did.

11
00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:46.960
I swear to God,
I hate it.
Just makes me insecure.
Anyway,
his,
sorry.

12
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.950
Am I allowed to curse?
I go,
yeah.
Yeah,
you're good.
Uh,
this is an adult audience,

13
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:55.870
so we're good.
Nobody's here's ever curse in their whole life.
See it now.

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.580
Um,
so thank you for coming.
You have a new album out.
Uh,

15
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.700
and one that is,

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.530
I think somebody has told me deeply personal to you and we'd love to lead off

17
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:11.410
there of sort of your journey.
And,

18
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.020
and sort of what led you to this album?

19
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.860
I had most people's albums deeply personal.
I mean everybody asks me that,
which,

20
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
and it is,
it's true,
but,
um,
I dunno.

21
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.090
It's like whose album isn't,

22
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.630
who's the album do with love that isn't deeply per right.
Right,
right.

23
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:33.240
One would hope,
but,
um,
uh,
but mine is,
I know,

24
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.460
um,
yeah,
I dunno.
I,
you know,

25
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.780
the last three or four years,
no,
about three years I guess.
Um,

26
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.310
I,
I had like a lot of,

27
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.020
um,
conflicting dynamics,
I guess you could say.
I,
um,

28
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.580
the simultaneously going through a divorce while frozen was going on its whole

29
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.640
crazy trajectory.

30
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.640
So I literally would go from singing at the Oscars to heading to a mediation

31
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:10.650
agreement discussing like visitation about my son,
you know,
so,
um,

32
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.860
it was just professionally speaking and an incredible time and personally

33
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:21.840
speaking,
you know,
very complicated.
So,
um,
I had a lot to,

34
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.600
to write about and um,

35
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.210
it just felt like a good time to get back in the studio and,
you know,

36
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.100
put it into some music.
Awesome.
Um,

37
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.130
I thank you for going there so early in the Carson.
He was amazing.
Um,
uh,

38
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.600
and you know,

39
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:45.230
as you were sort of building the album as well and just being the theater geek

40
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.750
than I am,
I'm thinking about the time in place.

41
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:51.230
We are in theater right now with what's happened with Hamilton,

42
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.370
what we're seeing in sort of transformative and you've really been a part of

43
00:02:55.371 --> 00:03:00.070
some of the most transformative shows in theater period.
Um,

44
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.870
everybody rent,
right and right.
There's the applause.
Yeah.
Right.

45
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.740
Um,
and not to mention wicked.
Uh,
yeah,

46
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.590
there we go.
Just to right there and I do one every 10 years,

47
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.510
one Zike guys kind of project every 10 years.
And um,
the rest I,

48
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.290
I,

49
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.250
I starve and I'm going to spirity and then all of a sudden I get a job and it's

50
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:28.660
like,
oh,
that's a big deal.
And then I'm back on top again.
But uh,

51
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.360
you basically just drop the mic constantly.

52
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.870
I wish I was cool enough to actually do a mic drop like that,
but,
um,
no,

53
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.880
I've been really,
really lucky.

54
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.930
But I also have experienced the ebb and flow of this industry,

55
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.010
which I think is why I'm able to really enjoy when those moments happen because

56
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:54.570
I,
I know how fleeting they can be.
And um,

57
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.970
you know,
so I'm,
I actually,
um,
more than ever can like,

58
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.320
um,

59
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.320
get onstage and I'm taking the moment and realize how lucky I am and who knows

60
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:14.500
what's going to happen tomorrow.
And wow,
people showed up and you know,

61
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.220
but that,
that all started with my first professional experience,

62
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:23.221
which was rent and that entire mindset of our composer passing away on the night

63
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:30.190
of our,
first of our,
I think it was our invited dress,

64
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.630
which is like the night before an audience.
Um,

65
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.200
actually it was,
no,
it was the first preview cause there wasn't no invited dress.

66
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:39.940
Yeah.
Um,
anyway,

67
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:43.480
so when your career starts with that kind of,

68
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.210
um,
uh,
event,

69
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.280
it kind of dictates how you,

70
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.390
how you see this industry and your art and um,

71
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.580
gives you a perspective.
Um,

72
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.020
and I was lucky cause we were at a young age that that happened and we could

73
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.570
have like lost perspective and objectivity.

74
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.590
But instead of getting caught up in all of the magazines and the accolades,

75
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.310
our cast actually I've never worked in any show that this has ever happened

76
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:23.710
since.
Um,
we didn't miss not one person,

77
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:28.410
Mr Show for six at least six months,
um,

78
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.040
eight shows a week singing at the top of our lungs because we were so committed

79
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.170
to whether we were sick or not to getting up there and making sure we put out

80
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.880
his message,
you know,
it was just,
that was the most important thing.
Wow,

81
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.780
that's amazing.
Um,
and with that,

82
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.680
I hadn't even thought about that actually in the context of that question,
um,

83
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.010
before them and when you talked about the ebbs and flows and obviously that was

84
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:56.650
both again,
at the same time,
that sort of trajectory,

85
00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:58.160
which we about actually up top

86
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.780
<v 1>with your album now as well.</v>

87
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:04.520
The sort of the conflicting of motions of the high and the low at the same time,

88
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.790
which is the same thing that happened with rent up to that point,

89
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:11.660
which is the stuff we can't really Google is before rent.
Well,

90
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.220
you know what,

91
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.610
what was the seed that got planted in you wanting to do theater or wanting to

92
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.900
sing all the time?

93
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.090
What was that driving force for you that led you to that sort of first big

94
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:31.070
professional moment of rent that you feel prepared you for,
you know,
or did it?

95
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.240
<v 0>Oh yeah,
there are different ones.</v>

96
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.450
It's Kinda like saying what your first love was.
Was it the,

97
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.320
the kid in kindergarten that like kissed you on the cheek or is it the guy who

98
00:06:40.321 --> 00:06:45.210
first said sex with,
I mean,
which like what's first love really,
right.

99
00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:49.690
So,
um,
that's a really bad example.
Okay.

100
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.530
We're just getting real here.
But I do,
I always think about that.

101
00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:55.590
It's like when people say first level,
I think I really loved this kid,

102
00:06:55.591 --> 00:06:57.720
Evan Beller when I was in kindergarten,

103
00:06:57.721 --> 00:07:01.170
but certainly didn't let him go up my shirt or anything.
Do you know what I mean?

104
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.513
So,

105
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.030
mmm.
Is it early?
It's a really,

106
00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:15.300
I'm just,
I think I'm tired of the album came out this week and I,

107
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.100
I've been like surprising drag shows and gay clubs at midnight.

108
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:23.370
And I'm like,
I dunno what times that when I'm on.
Um,

109
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.400
so you're going to get me a little delirious and stick foot directly into mouth.

110
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.080
Um,
what was the question again?
Oh,
uh,
oh yeah,
first like moment.
Right.

111
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.430
Um,
well,
yeah.
So my point being,
it could either be when my,
my gram,

112
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.760
father,
Nathan,
um,
Grandpa Nat,
you know,

113
00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:46.761
would put a fake toy microphone in my hand when I was five and do shows with me

114
00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:49.590
and the living room or a,

115
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:53.520
it could be when I sang at this a talent show,

116
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.220
um,
we're up in the Catskills where the Jews all go.
Um,

117
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.660
and uh,

118
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.710
it was a family trip and our parents sent us to the day camp when we did a

119
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:09.711
little talent show and I sang the way we were with a full on long island accent

120
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.560
and,
but everybody's percolating,
you know,

121
00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:18.330
there people turn to my parents and said,
oh,
she could be special,

122
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.440
you know,
so like,
I don't know.
There is,
there's those times.

123
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.300
Um,
and that was about theater.
Yeah.
Oh,

124
00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:30.420
it could have been the time where my grandmother took me to see a star is born

125
00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:34.140
with Barbra Streisand and Chris Christopherson.
That kind of changed my life,

126
00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:39.141
that idea of being put on a stage and having a win over an audience of people

127
00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:44.610
that were booing you and being so good and captivating that that stopped them

128
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:49.380
all in their tracks.
Something like that about that was amazing to me.

129
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.210
And then,
um,
parents got divorced when I was teenager and,
um,

130
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.160
my was dating this,
this cool guy that really believed in me a lot and said,

131
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:01.710
you should write music.
And,
um,

132
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.900
knew some guy that was in the wedding bar Mitzvah,
seen in long island.
Um,

133
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.640
and,

134
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.640
and helped me lie about my age because I was 15 and illegally driving to all of

135
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:18.300
these gigs and got me a Gig with Tony Syeda and the Echos in ocean side.
And,

136
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.230
um,
and I knew like three songs.
Um,

137
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.880
it was what a feeling from flashdance evergreen and like,

138
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.110
um,
I forget that song,
like the Sunshine Song.
Um,

139
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.400
anyway,
I can't think.
But,
um,
and then I,
um,

140
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.690
and I started doing weddings and bar Mitzvahs and having to learn all of this

141
00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:43.970
music.
And it was like an education for me.

142
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:47.690
I had to learn like Motown and Aretha and jazz,

143
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.740
Billie holiday and Ella Fitzgerald and all of a sudden then I didn't want to

144
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.290
necessarily do theater.
I wanted to be like a rock star.

145
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.500
So I went back and forth between Annie when I was little and Peter Pan and then

146
00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:04.160
wanting to write my music and record and all that.

147
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:09.190
And so it's been a constant dance for me even till this day sitting here with

148
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:12.950
you trying to get people to accept me,

149
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.900
my desire to cross over from the theater and be,
uh,

150
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.940
have integrity as a rock or a pop singer,
songwriter.

151
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.850
Um,
it's just followed me this little

152
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.093
<v 2>mmm</v>

153
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.680
<v 0>dance,
trying to straddle both places and be accepted in both.</v>

154
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.050
<v 1>And do you feel like,
um,
that's really,
by the way,</v>

155
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:41.930
I'm just picturing you sitting at bar and Bat Mitzvahs like in my head.
Uh,

156
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.380
and did you feel like with this album and sort of,
you know,

157
00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:51.490
even just looking at the track list and people's comments sort of really picking

158
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:55.930
up on your pop track in a real way,
like the intentionality of there,

159
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:59.590
of all the genre crossing because of your influences,
um,

160
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.650
sort of what was your thought process there and what do you hope,

161
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:06.310
like as we all listen to the album,
what we hear from you,
um,

162
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.600
as part of that journey?

163
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.560
<v 0>Yeah.
Thanks for asking that.
Um,
what's funny though,</v>

164
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.070
I've done a couple albums before this that it meant more to me the sole

165
00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:18.160
crossover thing and it didn't happen.

166
00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:20.810
I got dropped or I sold like three albums or whatever.

167
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.250
So at this point in my life,
so many things have happened that,
um,

168
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.460
that I'm proud of and I get up on stage and I do a concert and it's,

169
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.180
I cry,
I,
the setlist is a,
is a chronology of my life,

170
00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:42.740
of the songs in my life.
And some of it's defying gravity from wicked.

171
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:45.950
And some of it's an old Joni Mitchell song cause it inspired me.

172
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:50.060
And then there's let it go from frozen,
and then there's original music.

173
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.950
And I used to worry that that was confusing in some way and didn't have the

174
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:56.130
cohesion.
But now I realize the cohesion,

175
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.040
the common denominator is me and all of my experiences and I'm almost,
you know,

176
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.330
and I'm 45 years old and this is,
this is who I am is the life I've led.

177
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.290
And so I gotta stop trying to worry.

178
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.900
I got to stop worrying about it,
you know?
And,
um,

179
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.370
so when I went in the studio this time,
I picked producers that I love that,

180
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.530
that have worked with people that I really admire.
But once we got in there,

181
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.640
we just wrote music and hung out and recorded.
And,
and I,

182
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.650
I stopped worrying about that.
All I cared about was that they,
um,

183
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.230
they supported me being honest and trying different things and,

184
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.660
and,
um,
but what I think has happened is it is,
it has a really cool current,

185
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.130
mainstream kind of sound.
And so,
you know,
hopefully,
uh,

186
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.140
I just want to expand my audience really.
That's all right.

187
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.290
<v 1>Love that.
And it's,
it's really interesting also sort of given the context,</v>

188
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.950
interestingly of this sort of groundbreaking theater,

189
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:59.410
you've been a part of that sort of bent also,

190
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.680
what is theater on what the music is that is in theater.

191
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.550
And I thinking about rent and in rock,
um,
and you know,

192
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.720
wicked really taking us into like full Broadway,
big belt number,
you know,

193
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.500
and thinking even about the trajectory of theater itself right now.
Um,
you know,

194
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.270
with Hamilton and a lot of experimenting happening and also with the advent of

195
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:19.631
digital,

196
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:22.960
I mean we're here at Google and thinking about all the artists that are sort of

197
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.670
genre crossing because there's no box you have to like,

198
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.220
<v 0>exactly.
And we'd have more control as artists.</v>

199
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:31.320
We can put our selves in south promote.

200
00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:36.230
We don't have to rely just on our label understanding us.
We can reconstruct,

201
00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:39.600
contrast the public to just want to hear music,
love music.

202
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:44.100
And like so many of the theater vans I have,
they're amazing music,
um,

203
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.180
efficient autos.
You know,
they,
they love music.
They're not just theater kids.

204
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.230
They love everything.
They just love good music and good writing.
So,
um,

205
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.130
why not just put it out there and let,
let the people find it?
You know?

206
00:13:56.131 --> 00:14:00.780
So that's really empowering for artists now to not back in the day when I was

207
00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:02.130
trying to,
you know,

208
00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:06.930
get a record deal and playing down at the bitter end and in the village,

209
00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:07.351
you know,

210
00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:10.950
and it was all about just getting a record deal and the label and being accepted

211
00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:14.130
by these people and now,
you know,
as long as you can tour,

212
00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:18.060
which is the most important thing to me to be able to make a paycheck and go out

213
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:23.040
and sing and on a stage for people,
then I have the power back,

214
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:24.270
which is exciting.

215
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.300
<v 1>It's amazing.
I mean I feel like if I took a poll right now with the audience,</v>

216
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.130
how many of you are just obsessed with this woman's voice in general?
Right,

217
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.270
exactly.
I think your voice,
not to say defy,

218
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:41.950
but it does defies like any particular giant,
no,
the pun was too easy.

219
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:47.050
Um,
but it,
it,
it really does defy any particular genre.
I think we all,

220
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:49.240
you just started at,
we're all obsessed with your voice.

221
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.090
And what you're bringing is an artist.
So I think in that way,
this is,

222
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.940
<v 0>well my,
um,
I've been working with,</v>

223
00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:59.110
I'm a voice teacher for over 20 years.
Um,

224
00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.620
she's not the kind of teacher that you would think.
Um,

225
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.010
I before her,
when I was younger,
I studied classically,
you know,
but,
um,

226
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.080
that might start listening to all of the other music.
I thought,
well,

227
00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:16.060
I don't want to sound like that,
you know,
like a lot of,
um,

228
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.310
people sound when they've been overly trained and then they try to sing soulful

229
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.660
music or whatever.
Um,
and hers restorative,
um,

230
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.360
hers,
her technique is actually the untraining,
this sort of,

231
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.320
I mean,

232
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.740
she prepares me how to breathe and keep my voice so I can do eight shows a week

233
00:15:35.741 --> 00:15:38.980
and I hurt myself and I can build my range and all of that stuff.

234
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:42.580
So we definitely have a regiment that I can explain if that anybody's interested

235
00:15:42.581 --> 00:15:42.851
in that.

236
00:15:42.851 --> 00:15:47.851
But the point being is about singing from a place of speaking as opposed to

237
00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:48.874
like,

238
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.783
<v 1>you know,</v>

239
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.830
<v 0>doesn't sound like any of us talk.
Right?
So,</v>

240
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.360
not nothing against that kind of singing,
but my particular,
um,

241
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.590
you know,
what I gravitate to is coming from speaking,

242
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.580
even if it's the way I would yell at you on a playground if I was a kid.

243
00:16:05.581 --> 00:16:07.200
That's just my higher part of my voice.

244
00:16:07.201 --> 00:16:12.000
But it all comes from how we would communicate,
you know,
as humans is real,

245
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.040
our real voice.
And so,

246
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:18.060
and I believe that that's what makes people sound people,

247
00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.620
gives people,

248
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.900
gives an audience a real connection to somebody because they're really talking

249
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.550
and not performing over producing the s the sound.
So,

250
00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:32.880
um,
I dunno,
I dunno why I told you that.
I forget what you said.

251
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.240
<v 1>No,
that's perfect because we were just having a conversation.
So here we are.</v>

252
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.950
So sorry,
I keep taking the coffee.
It's not really helping.
I'm just like,
no,

253
00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:44.070
it's a,
maybe it is helping and I'm just like,
why buy buy,
buy,
buy.
I know.

254
00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:44.701
It's amazing.

255
00:16:44.701 --> 00:16:47.700
I think everybody's had wrapped like sort of just shaking their head in

256
00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:51.300
agreement with you that relate-ability.
Um,
and like you were saying earlier,

257
00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:55.770
this sort of artifice between you and the audience has sort of disappeared in so

258
00:16:55.771 --> 00:16:59.610
many ways that that connection of what you're talking about really singing in a

259
00:16:59.611 --> 00:17:00.960
way that's accessible

260
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.940
<v 0>to human speaking.
Yeah.
The only thing working against that is that</v>

261
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.460
we are,

262
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.460
we all listen to music that's been fixed and auto tune so much that now what is

263
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:19.620
perfect and imperfect is,
uh,
can be debated.

264
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.650
And when you go to a live concert,

265
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.350
are you really hearing people are not?

266
00:17:25.351 --> 00:17:30.351
And so when you actually hear someone that's chooses to actually sing,

267
00:17:30.661 --> 00:17:34.860
even when she has a bad cold or it's that time a month or she was up at three in

268
00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:39.690
the morning where their son or fighting with her boyfriend and I don't sound

269
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.040
perfect,
it's,
uh,
it's caused a lot of,
um,

270
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.670
it's taken some of the love out of it.
For me,

271
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.510
the social takes a lot out of it because,

272
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.610
because I read it like an asshole.
Um,
and uh,

273
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.170
you know,
that people can just go on there and immediately talk about everything.

274
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.800
And so,
um,
it's,
it's made,
it,

275
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.380
it's made it harder to enjoy it.

276
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:12.270
I have to really kind of like turn it off and find the love of singing and also

277
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:13.500
remember that

278
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.890
there have been many shows where I've sung and not been top of my game and

279
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:23.100
people still are in tears,
are still feel something.
And I remember,
oh,

280
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:26.160
it's not because I had a really high note that makes someone feel something.

281
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:29.160
It's cause you're,
what you're communicating is a person.

282
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:31.830
So I have to remember that,
but my whole life has been about,

283
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.730
my entire identity has been based on the fact that when I was a young girl,

284
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:39.780
I had this voice.
And so as I've gotten older I've had to understand that,

285
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.640
you know,
I have a lot more to offer the world and just being a singer.
And,
um,

286
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.760
but sometimes I,
I forget that myself.

287
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.510
<v 1>Well,
it also comes from even the earlier days you were saying,
um,</v>

288
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.480
you were sort of taught to think about songwriting early,
very early on,
which,
um,

289
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.560
I would imagine has actually helped in terms of thinking beyond just where the

290
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:05.830
pigeon holes might be,
you know,
with people thinking about you.
And,

291
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.420
and with that W,

292
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.600
were there any for you like defining moments in your career,

293
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.200
either joyous or really tough.
I know we talked about a bit about rent,

294
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:20.910
but have there been any other moments for you that just really stand out as an

295
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:25.911
artist or maybe in a moment that you suddenly felt like you had defined maybe

296
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.890
one of those boxes that somebody had maybe put you in?

297
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.120
<v 0>Um,
yeah.
Well,</v>

298
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.840
the success of let it go and frozen because,
um,

299
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:42.490
you said like with rent that it was this rock pop musical and you would think

300
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:47.980
that then that would open doors for me to be able to walk,
uh,

301
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.970
between all of these lines.
But it wasn't,

302
00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:54.971
whenever I'd go into a recording studio with a big time producer songwriter,

303
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.710
they'd sort of admonished me and say like,
Oh,

304
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.430
you're too expressive.
Yeah.
It's all that Broadway training,
you know,
are we,

305
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.820
you have to sound more like Sheryl Crow,
throw it away,
you know?
And then,
um,

306
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.160
and,
and so,
I'm sorry,
I lost my train of thought.
So then,

307
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:18.110
um,
helped me is defining moments where you sort of broke the box.
Yeah.

308
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.890
And so they would have all of these rules like theater people never,
you know,

309
00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:25.310
never going to get on the radio on a pop station and then all of us and cut to

310
00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:28.220
like 15 years later,

311
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.600
I'm like taking my kids to school and z 100 on,
I hear let it go.
I'm like,

312
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.430
what the hell?
You know,
you just can't,
you can't worry about those rules.

313
00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:41.600
And I did for a long time and you just got to keep moving and going and taking

314
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:45.860
work that makes you feel good and surround yourself with people that,
you know,

315
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.890
that teacher stuff just keep going because the trends and the rules,

316
00:20:49.891 --> 00:20:52.240
they always break.
And move and change.

317
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:55.960
And I'm all of a sudden you hear like a bridge,
like what,
what's the bridge in?

318
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.680
And let it goes.

319
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.510
Like I'm frozen fractals all around and it's like this crazy lyrics would never

320
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:04.300
be in a pop song that fractals,

321
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:10.060
fractals,
not me,
I didn't write it,
but like,
you know,

322
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.950
so,
but it's become like this huge pop culture moment,
you know,

323
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:19.000
so go figure and fuck all those people that like wrote me off.

324
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:23.210
So you know,
that's a big,
that was a big defining moment,

325
00:21:23.211 --> 00:21:25.490
a teaching moment for me just to know.
You just,

326
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.700
you can't keep following a trend because by the time you get there,

327
00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:32.330
it's changed already.
So just keep doing your thing.
Um,

328
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.780
um,
this album's a big deal just cause you know,
when you're,
I was with my,

329
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:44.150
my ex husband for were married a long time,
but together even longer,

330
00:21:44.151 --> 00:21:49.070
so like 16 years and grew up together.
And um,

331
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.070
so to figure out how to separate yourself,

332
00:21:52.071 --> 00:21:56.250
who you are separate from that person and um,

333
00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.580
to be creative without worrying about what he would think,

334
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.890
um,
was interesting.
Um,
and liberating too,

335
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.260
to just get in the studio and go and not worry.
Um,

336
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.410
and figuring out how to stop regretting all of that stuff and pave the way for

337
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:24.110
some new exciting stuff to happen.
You know,
I got engaged recently.

338
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.933
<v 3>Ooh,</v>

339
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.620
<v 1>you regulations.
Thanks.
Um,
and with that,
just thinking,</v>

340
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.490
I mean even about let it go and this sort of in the new album and when,

341
00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:41.260
where that came from the journey.
Um,
I think,
you know,

342
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.430
at least from what I've seen and I work a lot on,

343
00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:47.370
on inclusion issues and representation issues as part of my day job.
Um,
yeah,

344
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.380
<v 0>I was just in the bathroom stall and there's a thing about inclusion as I was</v>

345
00:22:51.381 --> 00:22:55.550
sitting on the toilet.
Yeah,
you've put a thing in front of me about inclusion,

346
00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.180
learning on the loo,
learning on the loo.
Okay.
Got It.
I was reading it,

347
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.850
it was effective if somebody in here who did that fantastic Dni at Google.

348
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.750
Um,
and

349
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.340
<v 1>you know,
the,
the fun part about that is we work with a lot of artists,
you know,</v>

350
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.100
who are,

351
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.580
are viewed as role models in the industry and sort of as our friend Gina Davis

352
00:23:17.581 --> 00:23:20.790
says,
if you can see it,
you can be it.
Um,
and given fro them,

353
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:22.530
you brought up frozen and let it go.

354
00:23:22.531 --> 00:23:25.890
And now actually sort of defining yourself entirely in a,

355
00:23:25.891 --> 00:23:29.500
in this way with the album and this new moment,
um,

356
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.940
who was a role model in your life and have you felt that that idea of a role

357
00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:41.100
model fall on you now,
given how many little girls and boys,
you know,

358
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.340
kind of latched on to your music who may have not known you before,

359
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.280
what's that been like?

360
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.900
<v 0>And,
and can you trace it to somebody in your own life?
Yeah,
yeah.
Well,</v>

361
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:54.550
first of all,
my,
my sister's a huge role model for me.
She's my younger sister,

362
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.190
three and a half years younger than me,
but,
um,

363
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.590
she got married and had kids before me.

364
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.780
So our roles are reversed in a lot of ways.

365
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:07.190
I'd go to her for the wisdom of certain things.
And um,

366
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.380
she,
uh,

367
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.310
got remarried so she went through a bunch of crap and,
um,

368
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.350
handled it so gracefully and had these,

369
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.620
she was single and had these two little tiny boys at the time.

370
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.640
And because she grew up with a sister that was always like,

371
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.270
I know what I'm doing with my life.
I'm singing,
I want to be famous.

372
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:32.300
And she was like,
ah,
I have no idea what to do.
And I have this,

373
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.360
I knowing sister's shadow too,
to walk around.

374
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.480
And it took her longer to figure out what you want to do with their life.

375
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:40.460
And then she did.
She,

376
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:45.260
she's this amazing teacher and a writer is writing a book.
And um,

377
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:45.981
but she did it.

378
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:48.920
She went back to school and got her master's with the two little kids.

379
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:52.360
And so anyway,
just her strength and um,

380
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.920
grace really,
it's been a inspiration to me.

381
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.240
Super,
super smart and eloquent.
And,
um,

382
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.900
the role model thing with me and the characters I played and they're always

383
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:09.320
connecting to young audiences is,
is a beautiful thing.

384
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:14.300
And it's also daunting responsibility,
uh,
one is that there's,

385
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:18.500
the age disparity is getting even bigger and bigger.
So,
you know,

386
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.100
now I like the frozen thing and there's like six year olds and then there's me,

387
00:25:24.701 --> 00:25:26.830
I'm coming.
So like I do a concert,

388
00:25:26.831 --> 00:25:29.800
I'm on stage talking like a truck driver.

389
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.530
And then I looked down and there's just like a mom with a little girl in the

390
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:36.190
blue dress in front of me and I'm talking about how so and so on,
oh,

391
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:40.780
at my shirt and this,
you know,
so,
and then I realized,
Oh fuck,
you know,
like,

392
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.730
and then I do that.
And then it's like,
it's this constant mess.
So,
um,

393
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.590
and the manager's like,
could you please watch your mouth?
Are these young kids?

394
00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:55.480
I'm like,
I got,
I made me.
And uh,
so it's hard,

395
00:25:55.481 --> 00:25:58.670
you know,
also the,
there's that,
but then there's also the,

396
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.530
the part of just all these amazing characters I've gotten the play about like,

397
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.000
um,
um,
you know,

398
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.050
young women finding their,

399
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.440
finding themselves,

400
00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:18.441
embracing this thing and them that's super unique and beautiful,

401
00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:22.230
but sort of looked down upon by society.

402
00:26:22.231 --> 00:26:24.960
And then they finally harness it,

403
00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:28.950
embrace it and do amazing things with that.
That whole idea,

404
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:34.230
um,
is great,
but it's not always who I am,

405
00:26:34.231 --> 00:26:34.890
you know.

406
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:39.890
So I specifically put creep by Radiohead and my set last year when I was on tour

407
00:26:41.551 --> 00:26:45.720
because it was an opportunity to sing a song about feeling completely despicable

408
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.750
and letting them know that like,

409
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.990
I don't always feel like letting it go or defying gravity.

410
00:26:51.991 --> 00:26:55.710
It's not easy to wake up every day and sing songs like that and you shouldn't

411
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:56.161
have to,

412
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:59.160
sometimes you just want to feel really sorry for yourself and stay in bed and

413
00:26:59.161 --> 00:26:59.994
that's okay too.

414
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.170
That's how I've been grappling with it.

415
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.640
<v 1>Um,
that's awesome.</v>

416
00:27:06.641 --> 00:27:11.610
I just had this vision of you in bed and the creed song playing legs over.
Um,

417
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.740
and it's so real.
I think this is a true,
by the way,

418
00:27:14.741 --> 00:27:19.480
with everybody we've talked to in that space is this sort of pressure to be on

419
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.460
for especially the little kids and,
and how to balance that with,
you know,

420
00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.000
being a real human,
um,

421
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.680
and that may be showing them that you're a real human is actually even a more

422
00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:34.510
impactful thing.
Yeah.
Um,
and with that,
you know,

423
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.500
in that vein,
you know,
just doing a little bit of research on you before this,

424
00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:40.090
there was an some exciting,

425
00:27:40.091 --> 00:27:44.440
real work that you've done with kids and also in the philanthropy and activism

426
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.951
space,

427
00:27:44.951 --> 00:27:49.060
which I didn't want us to go without talking about cause it's so important.
Um,

428
00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:49.990
weird factoid.

429
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.650
My high school was the first high school outside of the city of New York to

430
00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:57.700
support Broadway cares,
equity fights,
AIDS in Marietta,
Georgia,

431
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.200
where Lgbtq rights were not very welcome at the time that we started collecting

432
00:28:02.201 --> 00:28:06.760
donations.
And so I was particularly moved by your activism in that space.

433
00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.400
So thank you.
Um,

434
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.530
and would love if you'd like to talk a little bit about what you've done and

435
00:28:11.531 --> 00:28:14.560
what you've been working on.
Maybe what's to come in that space?

436
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.170
<v 0>Well,
I was lucky enough as a kid,</v>

437
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.310
my parents would send me away to sleep away camp.
You know,
it's,

438
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.980
it's a Jewish east coast thing to do.
And,
um,

439
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.650
it was a privileged thing.
And,
um,

440
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.040
but it was a wonderful experience and opportunity to escape,

441
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:34.960
to kind of rewrite yourself as a kid if you didn't enjoy your school year.

442
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.300
It's a place to bond and make new friends and

443
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.940
<v 4>MMM.</v>

444
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.180
<v 0>Find yourself really.</v>

445
00:28:41.181 --> 00:28:45.020
And I always wanted to have a camp and then as I got older and I

446
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.283
<v 4>mmm.</v>

447
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:53.630
<v 0>Started to have these experiences in these projects where it was connecting to</v>

448
00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:56.310
young women,
especially,

449
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:58.003
<v 4>mmm.</v>

450
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.940
<v 0>Young women trying to find their voice,</v>

451
00:29:00.941 --> 00:29:04.720
I realized that the camp had to be more than just what I experienced when I was

452
00:29:04.721 --> 00:29:08.230
younger and,
um,
be more meaningful than that.

453
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.360
And so my college roommate,

454
00:29:10.361 --> 00:29:15.361
who's much smarter than me and was sick and tired of hearing me talk about this

455
00:29:15.491 --> 00:29:18.340
dream pipe dream.
And so she galvanized the whole thing.

456
00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:21.690
She's a business major lawyer,
you know,
type a personality.

457
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:24.190
He got the thing together and um,

458
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.170
it's called the broader way and it's ours.
We're going on our seventh year.

459
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.280
It's a 10 day program where we take a bunch of inner city girls,

460
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.310
mostly from Harlem and lower east side,
um,

461
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.540
up to the Berkshire Mountains in Massachusetts,
uh,

462
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:45.670
for days to like a college campus that we lease the property for now.
Eventually,

463
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:48.910
hopefully we'll have our own place.
Um,

464
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.510
and we sing and we dance and we swam.
And um,

465
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.980
Jenny into story who's like an incredible Broadway composer,

466
00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.530
wrote fun home and ton of things.

467
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.770
She's kind of like my creative director and we bring up amazing veteran

468
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.820
performers that come and work with them.

469
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.530
But the whole thing is not to put on like Oklahoma with these girls.
It's um,

470
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.820
we encourage them to write a lot.

471
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.240
They do a lot of spoken word.
They write their own songs,
lyrics,

472
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:22.010
they choreograph their own movement.
Um,

473
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.520
and so at the end of the 10 days,

474
00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:29.521
they come into back into New York to a theater that's usually thank thankfully

475
00:30:29.801 --> 00:30:34.510
given to us for the night and we put on a recital concert.

476
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:39.460
If you will,
that's a complete,
um,
um,

477
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.480
a collage of their,

478
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.600
their original work.
Um,
so it's,

479
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:50.410
um,

480
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.980
and so we started with 30 girls the first year and now it's become a four year

481
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:54.460
program.

482
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.460
And we've now at the point where our original girls came back and were a cit

483
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:03.340
yes.
Um,
only the ones that we felt were capable of doing that.

484
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.680
Um,
cause he's still are only 15.
So,
uh,

485
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.870
and yeah.

486
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.060
And so now we're up to like 80 girls or something and it's a,

487
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.360
it's a,
that's a huge responsibility.
Um,
and it's hard.

488
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:24.370
All the fundraising and all that stuff and also wanting to keep tabs on them

489
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:28.750
through the year because I always find even as adults when we're involved in

490
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:32.770
like a really amazing project and then we're finished,
we kind of crash,
you know,

491
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.280
and so imagine these girls who have these kind of shitty home life,

492
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:40.630
a lot of them,
and they go from this magical 10 days and then they go back in.

493
00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:43.290
So I want to make sure they felt like,
you know,

494
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.220
it wasn't over and through the year we can,

495
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.590
can we do little reunions and when they go see shows together and we go see art

496
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:53.560
and,
um,
tap dance,

497
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.680
we have like dance things and whatever.
Anyway,

498
00:31:56.681 --> 00:32:01.540
so it's a constant evolve,
constantly involving foundation,

499
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.230
want to get to the point where we have college funds for them and things like

500
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:07.600
that.
But that's all in the future.

501
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.890
<v 1>That's amazing.
Thanks.
That's really awesome.
Thanks.
Um,
and um,</v>

502
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.710
it just,
it gets me thinking also about,
um,

503
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.910
sort of this journey you were talking about earlier about role modeling because

504
00:32:19.911 --> 00:32:24.620
in a way that's a place where you're becoming very human to them and them to

505
00:32:24.621 --> 00:32:28.400
you.
And I think that's really awesome,
uh,
and remarkable.
Um,

506
00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:32.090
and with that,
I want to do two more questions.

507
00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:33.830
That'd be my mistake of not asking.

508
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.490
I would like to do some word association before we turn it over to the audience.

509
00:32:37.491 --> 00:32:39.860
It should be fun.
Everybody,
especially given

510
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.510
<v 0>that I'm said coffee.
Yeah.
Chuck.
Uh,
um,</v>

511
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:49.700
and um,
and also,
um,
and then I had one more in here.

512
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.230
Oh,
before I do that.
Yeah.
What's the ones that we do work at Google?

513
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.800
What's the one thing that we couldn't Google search about you.

514
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

515
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:05.130
<v 0>Uh,
so there's a lot out there.</v>

516
00:33:05.131 --> 00:33:09.030
I know and I don't know,
um,

517
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.010
would you like us to know that you wouldn't normally talk about?

518
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.900
Because as you see,
I'm an open book,
so it's like I don't really high that much,

519
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.890
but

520
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.963
<v 2>mmm.</v>

521
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:27.570
<v 0>Pretty much a slob.
I'm not dirty.</v>

522
00:33:27.571 --> 00:33:31.920
There's a difference between dirty and messy.
I don't like,
you know,

523
00:33:31.921 --> 00:33:35.040
like oatmeal,
like left out for ANZ to eat.
I don't like that.

524
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:38.510
I like the counter to be cleaned,
but like my clothes are everywhere.

525
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:43.050
The bathroom's a mess.
The towels,
the things that,
um,

526
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.010
the beds hardly ever made and less people are coming over and I want to pretend

527
00:33:47.011 --> 00:33:49.950
that it's clean.
Um,

528
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.480
<v 2>yeah.</v>

529
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.330
<v 0>I love that.
By the way,
I also am messy and not dirty.</v>

530
00:33:55.331 --> 00:33:59.050
There is a distinct difference.
Yeah.
I shower,
yeah,
the time.

531
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.920
Thank God Harris Clean.
I just don't like putting things in way.

532
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.790
I'm not very organized.
If you take anything away from here.

533
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.950
We both showered today.
Yes.

534
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.400
But we don't make the bed and showered last night and this morning brushed my

535
00:34:14.681 --> 00:34:16.650
teeth even.
Wow.

536
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.750
Which is a lot for a mother who by the way got up,

537
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:24.490
my son was slept at Dad's last night but he couldn't take them to school this

538
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:29.490
morning and I didn't want the nanny to do that cause I had enough time so I got

539
00:34:30.551 --> 00:34:35.270
up,
made his lunches because dad never makes us good lunch.
I do.
And then um,

540
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:41.800
drove over there,
which is 10 minutes away completely in my pajamas.

541
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.500
Didn't brush my teeth,
rolled out of bed yet.

542
00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.530
I did it on Friday and the Paparazzi got a picture of me doing that,

543
00:34:47.531 --> 00:34:49.740
which was really nice.
Um,

544
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.970
I was dropping him off at Dad's and they said I was going to daycare Brit

545
00:34:54.971 --> 00:34:57.310
dropping him off at daycare and it was actually his house.

546
00:34:57.311 --> 00:35:01.780
It was taste house is like,
I'm like get your facts straight like I'm for anyway.

547
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.460
What was I saying?
So Oh like,

548
00:35:03.461 --> 00:35:05.620
so I was just a mass this morning and the lunch is the thing.

549
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.120
Got Him to school 10 minutes late.

550
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:11.740
Every mom at the schools like perfectly quaffed with like three kids and a job,

551
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:12.341
I don't know.

552
00:35:12.341 --> 00:35:16.330
And me and like Amy Poehler or like we both go to the school and she's the only

553
00:35:16.331 --> 00:35:17.620
one I know.
Like she'll roll out of,

554
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.790
I could tell she rolled out of bed and a PJ's and got the kid to school like

555
00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:24.370
within a second of being late.
And I'm like,

556
00:35:24.371 --> 00:35:28.060
thank God for Amy because these other moms are so annoying.

557
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.420
Respect,
respect that.
I see some heads nodding in the room.
Yes.
We all love that.

558
00:35:34.421 --> 00:35:37.120
We'd been there right on.
Oh,
I see some hands.

559
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:42.060
You got to sleep in like cool sweatpants that were the Lego cool rock and roll

560
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:44.510
boot.
Looks like you meant it,
but you just slept in your,

561
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.160
where'd the PJ's to school?

562
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:51.940
Put on the cool boot and it's like you meant to happen that isn't protips.

563
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.160
Yes.
Yeah.
And only have one kid.
Tammy's mom's have three,

564
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.980
so I don't know.
And they're skinny.
You know what I mean?
That's outlay man.

565
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.040
That like we can't explain it and explain that.

566
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.340
I'm telling you and then you can you work and all you want to do is eat a Bagel.

567
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.930
I go,
I'm like,
can we please,
I know that's like the minute I get there,

568
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:14.730
I have to order from this deli.
I've always,

569
00:36:14.731 --> 00:36:18.840
or I still know that phone number by by heart do through 909 three three,
seven,

570
00:36:18.841 --> 00:36:23.610
three.
It's big along the Corner Deli.
I like,
it's crazy.
I have to have a Bagel,

571
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:26.160
cream cheese,
a black and white cookie.

572
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.980
It's like going to the movies and you have to have popcorn as students.

573
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.430
I get to New York gets what I have anyway.
I'm sorry.
It's that.
No,
no.

574
00:36:32.431 --> 00:36:33.600
Did we all write down that number?

575
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:36.270
I feel like that was a really good bagel wreck.
If for al of us here,

576
00:36:36.271 --> 00:36:40.420
we have a huge New York office,
so this is actually great.
Um,

577
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.080
and so with that,
before we turn it over to the audience,

578
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:47.160
I'm sure there's a lot of burning questions.
A quick word.
Association.

579
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.550
One word.
First one that pops in your mind.
You're ready?
No.

580
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.120
<v 2>Okay.</v>

581
00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:55.953
<v 0>Progress.</v>

582
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.280
Uh Oh,
this is how I'm going to be honest.

583
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.600
That's not the name of my boyfriend.
Fiance.
I hate that word.

584
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.980
His name's Aaron progress.
I don't know why he popped in.
I think cause he's,

585
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.300
he's um,

586
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:15.390
<v 2>okay.</v>

587
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:19.680
<v 0>Yeah,
cause I think he makes me a better person.
He's a used to be an actor,</v>

588
00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:21.720
but now he's this amazing,
um,

589
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.000
addiction specialists and has his master's in psychology and works in this,

590
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.090
uh,
Rehab.
And uh,

591
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.700
he's a a Neanderthal,
but he communicates well and uh,

592
00:37:35.701 --> 00:37:40.280
he makes,
he's just a,
I feel like,
you know,

593
00:37:40.281 --> 00:37:43.580
I'm my best self when I'm with him.
So I hate that I made it about a man.

594
00:37:43.581 --> 00:37:48.410
But I did hear we are progress to guy.
We'll try another one.

595
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.150
Uh,
music,

596
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.760
uh,
Walker came into my mind,
my son Walker,

597
00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.700
because I finally,
he won't,
he hates Mommy's singing.
He hates frozen,

598
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.553
hates it all.

599
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.170
But I got him to sit down at the piano with me.

600
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.660
I just shut my piano from New York to my new house in La.
And,
uh,

601
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.600
I got him to sit with me and you know,
you can't tell a kid,

602
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.840
you can't tell my son to do something.
He has to find it on his own.

603
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:21.120
Otherwise he's like,
but,
um,

604
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:25.650
we started writing a little song on the piano together and uh,
we,

605
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.530
we titled it and um,

606
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:29.830
<v 2>okay.</v>

607
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:34.180
<v 0>It was called,
what was it called,
the fire firehouse or something.
I don't know.</v>

608
00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:38.830
Anyway,
it was a lot life scary base notes cause he's into zombies and Werewolf.

609
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:39.790
But um,

610
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.970
but that was music to me cause I've been waiting to have like a moment where I

611
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:47.890
could somehow inspire him with my musicality.
I love that

612
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.560
theater,
uh,

613
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.450
home theater,
Tom to me,

614
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.680
no matter what has happened in my career,
ups and downs,

615
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:09.520
I always can go back and I end up falling into wonderful show.

616
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:11.920
Whether it's hugely successful or not.

617
00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:16.720
I have this experience with a cast and community and

618
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.233
you know,

619
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.380
recording music is sort of more of more solitary experience in theater is

620
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.050
family.
And,
um,

621
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:34.300
so yeah,
home
and time.
Time t.

622
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:38.670
I.
M.
E.
Yeah.
Time.
Time.

623
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

624
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:45.170
<v 0>MMM.
I'm blanking.
Time.</v>

625
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.460
Time for me.
His age maybe.
Uh,

626
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:56.680
yeah,
the man wants me to have a baby and I'm like,

627
00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.730
just forget it man.
Sled.
So it's time,

628
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:04.150
like is there enough time?
And if there is,

629
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:09.151
do I even want to do that with this time or do I want to travel and have a life

630
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.900
now?
Um,
so it's kind of about the,

631
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:18.280
the clock ticking time.
I love it.
I lied.
Last one.
Joy.

632
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.680
Joy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

633
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.710
Joy is jumping on the train is the trampoline that I built my house jumping with

634
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.650
both boys.
Total release of energy.
Just

635
00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.680
jumping on a trampoline.
It's like so much fun and I love it.
Yeah,

636
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.100
I love it.
And with that,
I'd love to turn over to the audience.

637
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:43.600
We have some mics in the middle.
Anybody want to come up and ask a question?
Oh,

638
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:48.360
we already have one.
Excellent.
It's funny you have the mix.

639
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.350
You probably can just ask me.
I probably won't even need this.

640
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.040
<v 5>Hi there.
My name is Shannon.
Um,
first of all,</v>

641
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.050
I just want to make a comment before,
um,

642
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:02.700
thank you for coming out and I just want to tell you that,
um,
I grew up like,

643
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.110
just so looking up to you,

644
00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:08.190
I lived in Arizona and like I'm sure we all like listen to you and maybe didn't

645
00:41:08.191 --> 00:41:11.640
get to see you on Broadway and it was so cool cause you came here to the Greek

646
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.810
is your first time I think performing and I came and saw you and it was awesome

647
00:41:15.811 --> 00:41:17.880
because you,
you were so real.

648
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:22.050
I loved even just the times in between the music more than like your actual

649
00:41:22.051 --> 00:41:26.160
singing.
So it's cool to see you like to be honest,

650
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.570
like reshape that.
It was.

651
00:41:27.571 --> 00:41:31.080
So I just say like I'm sure you in case you don't hear it enough cause you said

652
00:41:31.081 --> 00:41:34.760
about the social and I'm sure there are people saying good and bad but like keep

653
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:38.120
being like you and authentic and real cause like thank you.

654
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.470
We'll do respect that.
So thank you.
Thank you.
Um,
now we'll get to my question.

655
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.610
So I'm,

656
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:48.440
I'm always fascinated by like how people prepare for roles and so I'd love to

657
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:50.840
hear about when you prepared,

658
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:54.620
how was it like preparing for like Maureen and Alpha Ba and that time in your

659
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:57.020
life versus preparing for like Liz,
which was like,

660
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:00.740
you're kind of come back to New York and maybe that character reflected more of

661
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:04.630
like you or I don't know,
I'm just maybe guessing.
Yeah.

662
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.860
And then how you prepare for like your album,

663
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:11.861
like how does it like juxtapose the preparation for like a character versus

664
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:13.070
like,
Eh,

665
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.550
<v 0>well there's technical preparation,
which if it involves music,</v>

666
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:21.020
then there's like the singing aspect.
Literally this,
the,

667
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:26.430
the athleticism of what that entails and preparing that,

668
00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:31.160
which means the teacher I told you about it means like treating myself.

669
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:33.290
Like if it,
like if you're going to run the marathon,

670
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:36.260
you wouldn't go run 26 miles out of nowhere.
Right?
You build up.

671
00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:40.700
So I do all this preparation.
I meet with her,
we go through all the music,

672
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:44.180
we pick all the things like,
oh,
that's going to be hard on a matinee.

673
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:49.160
And like I w I start singing,
um,
a certain amount of time,

674
00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:51.530
literally time myself,
15 minutes a day for a week,

675
00:42:51.531 --> 00:42:54.560
and then I start to move it up and all of a sudden my boys gets bigger and the

676
00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:59.510
range gets bigger.
So,
and so I,
I treat that like an athlete.
Um,

677
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.200
and then as far as characters go,
it's changed because,
um,

678
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:08.090
I feel like I have more of a technique and a process as I've gotten older.

679
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.440
When I was younger,
I used to kind of just throw it out there.
Um,

680
00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.270
but,
uh,
um,

681
00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.900
how do I prepare?
Um,

682
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:25.360
I,

683
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.360
it's more to me about the words less about worrying about like how does it feel

684
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:34.010
to wear green makeup or,
you know,
um,

685
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:38.220
I mean I went and watched the wizard of Oz and like watched,
um,
Martha,

686
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.400
Margaret Hamilton and,
but that was just to kind of get some cool ideas to,

687
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:48.160
to play off of and a fun cackle and her laugh,
you know,

688
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:53.090
whatever.
But for the most part it's about the language,
the words,
um,

689
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.880
knowing them in such a way,
um,
that it's,

690
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.250
it's like song in a way to me so that I can,

691
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.590
it's like jazz so I can just be in the moment and,

692
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.580
and riff off of that.
Um,

693
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.563
<v 2>okay.</v>

694
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.510
<v 0>Yeah.
It's about being,</v>

695
00:44:12.511 --> 00:44:16.680
knowing that so well that you can just be open and receive.
Um,
so,

696
00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.710
um,
I'm not doing any good.

697
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.770
Am I giving you a good explanation of that and then that was great.
Yeah.

698
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.970
Thank you.
Thank you.

699
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

700
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:29.443
<v 0>Oh yes.</v>

701
00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:33.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

702
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.230
<v 6>Uh,
so when you are in the middle of,</v>

703
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:40.700
of a run on Broadway or something,
what is your daily routine like?

704
00:44:40.701 --> 00:44:41.810
What's it really like?

705
00:44:41.811 --> 00:44:46.690
Are you one of those people that rolls out of bed at noon and then I was worried

706
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.420
cause you work late.
Right?
But what,
what does that really like?

707
00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:52.920
I'd like to get a picture of,
okay,
prove it.

708
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.810
Life pre baby and then there's postmate well I was also going to secondarily,

709
00:44:56.811 --> 00:44:59.780
I'm,
I'm sure it was different now than it was when we are doing rent.

710
00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:04.400
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
it's sleep.
It's sleep,
sleep,
sleep is the best.</v>

711
00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:06.620
Healing for a voice,
first of all.

712
00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:09.890
So as much sleep as possible always.

713
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.900
But sometimes you can't.

714
00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.710
And if you're nervous you don't sleep well either like the night before.

715
00:45:15.711 --> 00:45:20.630
But when you're in like a routine,
I,
I come home and watch a movie.
I'm,
I am,

716
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:25.670
I wound up so I get home and I'm up late because I still can't go to sleep.

717
00:45:25.851 --> 00:45:30.800
I just did it performance so that adrenaline is still wearing off.
So then yeah,

718
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:34.010
sleep in.
I steam all the time.

719
00:45:34.011 --> 00:45:37.340
I'm like a big steam so I will sit and like in a shower,

720
00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:41.120
I'm not good for California,
waste a lot of water,
but like steam,

721
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.980
I vocalize,
um,
you know,
um,

722
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:50.300
and,
and then make my way over to the theater.

723
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.040
But with the,
the child is just changed it because all of a sudden

724
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.800
and just,
I couldn't,
I couldn't get the sleep,
I couldn't get the,

725
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:04.620
everything was just,
it was just thrown up in upheaval.

726
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.100
But I ended up,
I feel like I ended up enjoying myself more on stage.

727
00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:13.610
Now I have a child because I'm like,
well,
I can't be perfect.

728
00:46:13.611 --> 00:46:17.870
So you know,
what can I do?
He had a fever and I'm trying to be a good mom.

729
00:46:17.871 --> 00:46:19.010
So I get up there and I,

730
00:46:19.011 --> 00:46:22.310
and then I ended up doing better because I'm more relaxed because I just throw

731
00:46:22.311 --> 00:46:24.710
caution to the wind as opposed to like I work,

732
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:29.120
I warmed up for 25 minutes and I didn't drink any wine and I didn't smoke any

733
00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:32.090
cigarettes and I'm perfect.
Perfect,
perfect.
And then I still miss the note.

734
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.590
Oh my God.
You know,
so now I'm like,
I'm more of a human being and,
um,

735
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.660
I,
I enjoy myself more.

736
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.100
<v 6>That's great.
Thank you.
Yeah.</v>

737
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:48.390
<v 7>Other one?
Yes.
Oh,
first off,
congratulations on your album.
I,</v>

738
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:53.690
as another parent,
I really enjoyed the cinnamon and perfect story.
Thank you.
Um,

739
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:58.530
now it's more like a story on myself because when I,
after I heard you singing,

740
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:01.360
defying gravity and wicked,
um,

741
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.250
it inspired me to start singing lessons because I have no theater background.

742
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:06.780
I was singing background.
I'm a total geek,

743
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.270
but I started taking private assists a couple of years.

744
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.210
I even started a course here at work.

745
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.840
Some of the members are here and just sick.
I've always wanted to sing,

746
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:20.370
but I've never felt as inspired as I did when I heard you sing defying gravity.

747
00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:22.380
And I just wanted it to be able to sing along with that.

748
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:27.060
And my singing instructors also started off trying to teach me how to sing.

749
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:30.400
Kind of like you the whole belt by shouting.

750
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:34.410
<v 0>Yeah.
Which is a lot like your healthy,
healthy shouting.
Exactly.</v>

751
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.700
Without destroying my truck.
Well,

752
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:39.940
cause like children scream all the time and they never walk around with

753
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:44.050
Laryngitis.
So they do it in a way that's very free.
So that,

754
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:46.270
that's the thought process.
Not like screaming.

755
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:50.600
It's that idea that you call cross at the playground,
a friend.
You're like,
okay,

756
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:55.110
Hey John,
it's the same thing.
Yeah.

757
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.740
That's how I think of it.
And I,

758
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:02.170
and I would listen to the Shaka Khan and Aretha Franklin and actually mimic them

759
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:07.030
all the time to figure out,
well how are they doing that?
And uh,
so the best

760
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:14.260
way to learn,
I think is to emulate people.
And then because we are who we are,

761
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:18.670
it'll never be them.
It will still be unique and true to us.
So you'll,
you know,

762
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.650
anyway,
I'm sorry I cut you off.
No,
not at all.

763
00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:25.700
I just want to let you know how your singing has touched me.
Oh,
thank you.

764
00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.240
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
So what are you singing in the choir?

765
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:32.300
What do you guys,
what kind of music?
We kind of sing everything.

766
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:38.570
Um,
we,
it was like summertime,
we sing this new music.
Oh,
fun.

767
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.420
Yeah,
that's great.
I actually miss being in a choir.

768
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:47.660
Well maybe,
uh,
if you would like to sing in a choir.

769
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.343
I'm just,

770
00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:53.850
I've just connecting dots here as the moderator.

771
00:48:53.851 --> 00:48:58.010
It feels like opportunities a bad,
very out of practice.

772
00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.250
Now with the four part harmony and everything.
Is it,
it's,
it's coed.

773
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.610
It's obviously,
yeah,
it's very cool.
Oh,

774
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:14.610
<v 8>so I have something I've been wondering ever since I saw in chanted.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

775
00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.260
and uh,
at this point you had,
you know,
very well established yourself,

776
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.560
both in terms of your acting and singing prowess.

777
00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:28.310
So it surprised me seeing you in a musical movie role without a song and the

778
00:49:28.351 --> 00:49:30.990
whole movie.
So,
uh,
do you have any thoughts on,

779
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:35.960
<v 0>well it wasn't written as a singing part and so I actually was so flattered</v>

780
00:49:35.961 --> 00:49:39.230
because I was like,
I know I'm an actress.
I'm not just a singer,
you know,

781
00:49:39.231 --> 00:49:42.260
so I was happy and relieved to not have to worry about saying cause a lot of

782
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.960
times it's,
you know,
it's a relief not to sing.
Um,

783
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:51.380
or to worry about having it all there so that I was happy about that.

784
00:49:51.381 --> 00:49:52.490
But once I was in it,

785
00:49:52.491 --> 00:49:56.450
they wrote something and then it ended up just being superfluous cause they were

786
00:49:56.451 --> 00:50:00.200
trying too hard.
Dave wrote a whole song for me and the prints at the end,

787
00:50:00.201 --> 00:50:04.790
James Marsden and it got cut and he'd do it too.
I was so excited.
He was like,

788
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.480
this is totally got ending up on the cutting room floor.
I was like,
no,
it's not.

789
00:50:09.481 --> 00:50:12.240
It's awesome.
He's like,
there's no reason for the song to be in this movie.

790
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.073
They are going to totally.

791
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.600
But thank you for thinking of that.

792
00:50:17.601 --> 00:50:21.200
But I was actually happy and I then I got to take my first day of rehearsal on

793
00:50:21.201 --> 00:50:23.510
that movie.
I had to show up at a dance studio,

794
00:50:23.511 --> 00:50:28.511
ballroom dance studio and dance with Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden this

795
00:50:28.521 --> 00:50:32.630
close and learn.
And I'm not a dance.
People think cause I'm from Broadway,

796
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:36.560
I can dance,
I can not.
It takes them like I have to have a special um,

797
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.760
session with the choreography to teach me eight counts.
That's like how bad am.

798
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.760
But um,

799
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.790
just imagine having to go with those two hot guys and like stand this close and

800
00:50:45.791 --> 00:50:50.570
like try to be,
ah,
it was heaven and it was how at the same time it's like,

801
00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.010
well thank you for satisfying my curiosity.

802
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:58.990
I think everybody just had this wonderful vision in their heads.

803
00:50:58.991 --> 00:51:02.290
If those two bed at exactly the same time and you have to like have your,

804
00:51:02.291 --> 00:51:04.780
but you know,
it's like dirty dancing.
This is my dance space.

805
00:51:04.781 --> 00:51:06.340
This is your dance phase.
You know,

806
00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.880
he's going to like touch my on like that.

807
00:51:09.881 --> 00:51:13.950
You know how he does when he like Patrick Swayze doesn't thing,
you know?

808
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:18.070
And so now she's like tickled by it.
That's how it felt.
It's all,

809
00:51:18.071 --> 00:51:21.160
just take a moment and take that in for you know what I'm talking about.
Right.

810
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:25.360
And then we,
okay.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
We got an enthusiastic,

811
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:31.810
um,
any other questions?
We have time for one or two more.
Anybody.
Oh,

812
00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:33.483
look at that.

813
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

814
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.490
<v 0>Hi,
I'm Tom.
So I was wondering,</v>

815
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:41.500
do you have a favorite song and how often does your favorite song change?

816
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:46.810
Yeah,
I don't,
cause it does change depending on how I feel.
Um,

817
00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:51.010
I can tell you that the things people would think I get sick of like let it go

818
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:54.670
or define gravity.
I don't get sick of singing them.
Um,

819
00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.360
maybe it's the creature of theater or that I am where you always looking for

820
00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:04.480
something new.
Just the tiniest thing from show to show to keep it fresh.

821
00:52:04.481 --> 00:52:07.930
So that's something that's an exercise that I enjoy.

822
00:52:07.931 --> 00:52:12.760
So either it's a little girl on the front row and I go like,
oh,

823
00:52:12.761 --> 00:52:14.140
I'm going to sing,
let it go to her today.

824
00:52:14.141 --> 00:52:19.141
She'd never saw a concert or I sing it to my son or I think of a new melody

825
00:52:19.841 --> 00:52:22.420
because I'm sick and I have to like come up with something different because I

826
00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:24.760
can't hit the high notes.
So then I'm like,
oh,
that was cool.
You know,

827
00:52:24.761 --> 00:52:29.710
whatever it is,
I give myself those exercises so that can be fun.
Um,

828
00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.720
but there's not,
it changes depending on the,
the day.
Really.

829
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:39.370
That's the cool thing about music is like what you bring to it.

830
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.690
The song kind of unfolds differently.
Um,

831
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.720
I used to sing both sides now Joni Mitchell,

832
00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:49.120
and that was a great song that would sort of

833
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:53.300
just [inaudible] um,

834
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.420
reveal itself to me differently every time I sang it,

835
00:52:56.421 --> 00:53:01.100
depending on what perspective I had,
you know,
so that was nice.

836
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.770
I love it.
We hosted you in the Joni Mitchell room without even knowing this.

837
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:11.090
Yeah.
She hears the conference room we were in.
It was old Joni Mitchell.
Really?

838
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:14.430
Yeah.
Look at that.
Everybody.
Um,

839
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.340
I know we have to wrap up because people have to get to their,
their next,
uh,

840
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.000
meetings.
Unfortunately in the workday,

841
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:24.460
although I'm sure everybody would like to stay here for another hour.
Yeah.
Um,
if,

842
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.010
if you could think of

843
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:31.010
<v 1>one piece of advice that you received that you'd want to share with all of us</v>

844
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:34.440
today,
like what's the thing that always sticks out in your mind?

845
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.200
<v 0>Piece of advice.
I don't know.
Is it helpful?</v>

846
00:53:38.201 --> 00:53:42.860
And in this arena,
I guess it could be in any,
in life,

847
00:53:42.861 --> 00:53:45.190
Serena.
Um,

848
00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:47.923
<v 2>okay.</v>

849
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.490
<v 0>Yeah.
It's just,
I feel like</v>

850
00:53:55.340 --> 00:54:00.340
nobody's looking for a copy or clown of somebody else.

851
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:06.430
So as much as we want to be like other people and admire their people,

852
00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.520
the more we figure out what makes us completely unique,

853
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:14.780
that will be the most desired thing,

854
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:19.370
whether it's in the arts or it's in business or,
um,

855
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.680
so when you find that thing that sets you apart,

856
00:54:21.681 --> 00:54:26.600
that's the thing that's gonna get you,
make you more desirable and,

857
00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.980
and successful.
So look,

858
00:54:30.981 --> 00:54:35.510
one more younger.
We think we should be like other people,
you know?

859
00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.410
And it's not till we realize that is,

860
00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.330
if we're is authentic as we can possibly be,

861
00:54:41.331 --> 00:54:46.060
that eventually that will you,

862
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:50.000
you will reveal yourself to the world.
That's awesome.

863
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.480
<v 1>Um,
thank you for that and thank you for being here.
Thank you guys.</v>

864
