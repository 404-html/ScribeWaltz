1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.430
Well,
welcome everyone.
Thank you for being here.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.490
I'm excited to take some time today to talk about this new book and to introduce

3
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:15.280
you to the author and my friend Amy Karem.
Um,

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.330
she is the author of the book the China factor,
which we'll talk about today.
Uh,

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.890
for those of you who haven't read it yet,
it's been endorsed by Harvard,

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.440
Stanford and um,

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.280
the four words written by the chairman of the Silicon Valley Bank.
Um,

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.650
she was recently,

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.220
she and the book recently quoted in a Forbes article for those of you in the

10
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:39.130
room,
which is at the back,
uh,
that talked about,
uh,

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.110
Hillary and Donald,
for those of you here in the u s and how that,

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.460
this topic that she talks about is actually the one common factor between the

13
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.060
two of them as if you have a chance to read that article,
please do.
Um,

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.020
personally,
she was born and raised in,
uh,
bless you,
Canada,
uh,

15
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.520
which is how we know each other.
And,
um,

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
she started her interest in the area of international business and international

17
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.000
development through her education,
uh,

18
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.090
which she did both in French and in English.
Uh,

19
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.710
her major passion of course is bringing a high tech to emerging countries and

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.310
helping them with their developmental goals as well as ensuring that western

21
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.940
based companies develop their cultural Iq,
um,

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.870
to be successful in building those partnerships.
Um,

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.310
she's so passionate about this topic that she,
uh,
after working in the bay area,

24
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.840
uh,
with Cisco for many,
many years,
uh,

25
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.120
started her own consultancy practice and training organization.

26
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.320
She's a corporate instructor with Stanford on global expansion strategy and

27
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:44.940
competitive strategy and has also developed her own workshops,
uh,
as well.

28
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.530
So I'm excited to get started.

29
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.940
Please ask questions along the way if you've got questions or commentary.
Uh,

30
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.820
we're looking forward to this being interactive,
so thank you for your time.

31
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.500
We also have books at the back and Amy will be signing them later as well.
Well,

32
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.560
let's get started.
Welcome.
Happy to be here.
Um,
so tell me,

33
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.520
for those of us that haven't,
uh,
deep dive the book,

34
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.760
tell us about the China factor.
What's it about?
Um,
all right,

35
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.000
but before we get into the book,
I just wanted to take a survey.

36
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.950
How many of you have either worked in or with,
or for emerging markets?

37
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.490
Anybody familiar with?
Raise your hand.
Okay,
great.
We've got,

38
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.480
we've got a small handful.
All right,
super.
I just wanted to set the stage.

39
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.780
I'd love for this to be interactive.
So if you have comments,

40
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:32.610
we'd love to hear from you questions.
Um,
and just,
let's make this a,

41
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:37.290
a learning thing all across the board.
Um,
so about the China factor,

42
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:42.291
what I wanted to start off with is what it's not about necessarily a,

43
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.900
so it's not about how to do business in China,

44
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.200
although it would be useful for you if you were to use it for that purpose.

45
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.390
But what is it is,
uh,
the main,

46
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.920
the main intention of it is to equip Western based companies,

47
00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.560
uh,

48
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.560
with strategies and tactics and knowledge in a better competing with emerging

49
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.750
entrance like those from China.
So China has risen a,

50
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.250
they're doing a great job.

51
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280
They're a strong force in our economy and they do business differently.

52
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.731
And the,
uh,

53
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.660
the premise is that we as western based companies need to change our game a

54
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:27.340
little bit.
We need to know that emerging competitors,
uh,

55
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.260
have different approaches and we need to be more creative about that.

56
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.813
Um,

57
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.090
the other element is the innovation advantage and how do we protect or maintain

58
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:43.840
and evolve our innovation advantage.
And,
uh,
that's,

59
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.610
that's a big element in the book too.

60
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:50.350
So we'd take a look at some innovation models,
um,
and how,
uh,

61
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.310
how we can be innovating maybe a little bit differently or learning from each

62
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:55.630
other in terms of innovation.

63
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.560
So the book starts out with a little synopsis of what,

64
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.510
what really has happened,
right?
How to,
how to China become so strong.

65
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:09.130
What are the strengths and weaknesses of each side,
right?
The West and the east.

66
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.290
Uh,
and then we get into,
uh,
a comparison using the five part framework.

67
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.480
Uh,
this is how China or emerging competitors and,
or emerging competitors,

68
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:21.910
how they do business.
And then ultimately,

69
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.190
how can western based companies do business differently using that five part

70
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:27.790
framework.

71
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.870
And then we close with some detailed case studies just to give you an idea of

72
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.750
how all these elements come together.
Thank you for that.

73
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.830
And so share with the audience what this is based on.
Where did you,

74
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:42.640
where did the research come from?
What does that look like?
Oh yeah.
Okay.
So,
uh,

75
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.120
I worked at Cisco for over 10 years and a good part of those years,

76
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.350
uh,
about four of those years I led a competitive,

77
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.500
a sales support program that was sponsored by the CEO at the time.

78
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.840
So the fun part was,
uh,

79
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.440
Cisco was going to emerging markets in a big way.

80
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:07.390
They said emerging markets was important.
And also,
uh,
emerging competitors.
We're,

81
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.240
we're becoming a stronger force in,
in challenging us.

82
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.430
And so we created this program.
I was the global escalation point.
And so the,

83
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.020
the salespeople from around the world would tell me about their strategic deals

84
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:24.290
that they couldn't deal with on their own regionally,
uh,

85
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.210
that had to do with a competitors specifically from China.

86
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.070
And then the other part of the job was that I was to report,

87
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.970
um,
you know,
from a competitive intelligence perspective back to,
uh,

88
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.030
executive management saying,
hey,
this is what's happening in the field.

89
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.060
This is what we need to be more successful.

90
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:47.380
This is how we need to change or what resources we need to bring to bear in

91
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.410
order for this,
um,
you know,

92
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.820
for us to be more successful in this new global environment.
And so,
uh,

93
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:58.490
the results were,
uh,
opening.
It's just like,
wow,

94
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:03.170
this isn't business as usual.
It's not like some of our domestic competitors.
Um,

95
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:07.580
it's not a product superiority play anymore.
It's here.

96
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.150
It's like my box is better than your box,
so I'll win the business.

97
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.340
And that's not what was happening,

98
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.840
especially in emerging markets and especially with some emerging competitors.
So,

99
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.770
uh,
that was the catalyst for me to say,
wow,
this is not a trend.

100
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.190
This is not a blip.
This is,
I think,
you know,
here to stay.

101
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.280
And I wanted to share my learnings with other western based companies.

102
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.190
I know it's based on,
it's not just based on your time in Cisco though.

103
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.220
That's a yes.
Thank you.
So you,
right.
So that was the catalyst.
Um,

104
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.340
and then I left Cisco and I did a lot of research and it's based on a lot of

105
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:45.290
other companies as well.
You'll notice that the end,

106
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:49.400
even there's a case study of show May,
which is a China based,

107
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.130
a smartphone company,
a pinnacle engines,
which is the startup,
um,

108
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.710
who actually developed their products just for emerging markets and other

109
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.180
companies.
Like we talked about apple,

110
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:02.930
we talked about HP and we talk about intuit and it's also other industries as

111
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.470
well.
So I've,
I've tried to pepper it in with other,

112
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.170
other data points as well.
For sure.
It's you,

113
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.990
so you just talked about some eyeopening,
uh,

114
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.540
surprises in some of your work as a thread.

115
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.210
Do you want to give some examples of those?
Maybe share a couple?
Sure,
sure.
So,
uh,

116
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.420
first is the severe price discounting and that's no shocker,
right?

117
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:26.720
Most of us know that that's generally a pretty

118
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.170
consistent market penetration strategy,
but there was really no bottom to it.

119
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.300
Excuse me.
So I,
I encountered a lot of escalations where they'd say,

120
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.290
Hey,
my competitors just discounted me by another,
you know,

121
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.390
25%.
I need,
I need approval for another,
another discount.

122
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:52.130
And so we realized that that that wasn't going to be a successful strategy for

123
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:55.310
either either competitor and even for the customer.
It wasn't a winning game.

124
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.060
So that was one big thread.
The other was financing,

125
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.250
which we didn't really get into very much as a Western base company.
And,

126
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.430
and that's a real helpful tool for emerging customers.

127
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.690
Um,
so you know,
this,
this competitor would,
uh,

128
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.790
help them with financing and to an extreme degree,
right?
Sometimes they would,
uh,

129
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.790
help finance over a very long period of time.

130
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.240
And that was a real great value to these emerging markets customers.

131
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.400
And then another huge trend,
a huge element that came up was politics,

132
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:32.990
the use of politics,
uh,
to influence business decisions.
And we're like,
Whoa,

133
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.120
where did that come from?
Like,
what do we do about that?
You know,

134
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.010
I would get escalated complaints,
you know,
from emerging markets.

135
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:42.350
It's like we've been working this deal for two years.

136
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.130
We had an bag and the 11th hour,
you know,
they just said it was,
uh,

137
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.610
an influence from above.
We have no idea where it came from.
Right.

138
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:53.750
And it was government to government influencing for business decisions at a more

139
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:55.350
granular level.
Yeah.

140
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.180
So politics is interesting and something that Google obviously is,
had,

141
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.850
um,
some experience with as well.

142
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.540
So do you want to talk a little bit more about some of the,

143
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.780
the practical things that you had to think about and actually do for,

144
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.860
for success with?
Yeah,
sure,
sure.

145
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.710
So politics is a huge element of,
of the whole strategy.

146
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:21.390
And so because it was so important in the way we had to re vector our strategy,

147
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.250
uh,
so another part of my job was to chain the sales teams worldwide on how to

148
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:30.860
position a visa vi certain types of competitors.
And so,
uh,

149
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.300
in in the book I outlined five part framework as I mentioned,
and I added,

150
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.230
um,
for those of you who are business geeks,
four p's of marketing,
right?

151
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.120
Product Price,
place promotion.
Uh,
so I created the fifth p,
which is politics,

152
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.830
right?
So I had the five p's of global marketing framework and politics.

153
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.720
So back to your specific question.
Um,
it does,
it happens at the,

154
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.780
at a high level and you have your executive management making pretty big

155
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:02.250
decisions,
right?
In terms of market access.

156
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.410
So because this has become such a big world,
but it's small at the same time,

157
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.990
uh,
we need market access.

158
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:13.830
We want to play in other people's sandboxes as I say.
Um,

159
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.460
but there's certain rules and there are certain limitations that we need to

160
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.670
encounter.
And you folks know better than I,
right?

161
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.660
When Google pulled out of China in 2010,
right,

162
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.110
for censorship reasons,
et Cetera,
that was a big decision.

163
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.790
And the implications were,
you know,
they're a huge,
right.

164
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.910
You could have affected maybe like 1.4,

165
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:39.150
1.5 billion people in terms of access to knowledge,

166
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.380
but there were really good reasons.
And those were the,
uh,

167
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.410
the boundaries within which a Western based company decided that they did not

168
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:53.670
want to operate.
However,
right?
Recent headlines is there going back in,
right?

169
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:58.500
So market access is really important.
And,
and reach is really important.

170
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.670
So the political element is knowing that coopertition is,

171
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.270
is the new element.
It's not that new,
but it's,

172
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.030
it's an integral part of a strategy going forward,
right?
It's,

173
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.280
it's not us versus them.
I call it dusk a little bit,
right?

174
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:18.570
When you combine the two words,
it's how do we all play together,

175
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.040
um,
within our own,
uh,
you know,
uh,
boundaries and,

176
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:27.660
and desirables,
um,
to get ultimately the success that we need.

177
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.470
So that's,
that's it at a high level.
Um,
and then how do you,

178
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.970
how do we at the working level,
uh,

179
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.850
deal with politics and politics even happens at the organizational level,
right?

180
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.350
And,
and generally there's a pretty negative connotation to politics.

181
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.070
Um,
but what I'm trying to say in the book is it's really important.

182
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:50.490
We can't ignore it anymore and we,
we need to embrace it and apply it.

183
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:55.090
So how do we apply it from a sales perspective?
Uh,
what we did was educated,

184
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:58.440
we educated the sales teams on some of the,
uh,

185
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.930
tools available from the u s government,
for example.

186
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:06.190
And the local governments in,
uh,
the,
you know,
different countries,

187
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.980
how can they engage with their own government to help influence their own sales

188
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.940
locally?
So reaching out to the consulates,
how do you get involved?

189
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:20.290
How do you know that some of these deal opportunities are happening early on in

190
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:22.720
the game?
How do you escalate a,
some,

191
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:27.580
maybe unfair trade issues that you're experiencing so that there's maybe some

192
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.750
intervention sooner than later and it's not at the 11th hour when we oftentimes

193
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:36.280
hear about it.
And then we also organizationally changed,
uh,

194
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.780
and were able to convince the senior vice president of government affairs to

195
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:45.490
shift the focus from just a policy perspective to um,

196
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.790
helping with sales objectives,
right?

197
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:53.470
So using that influence that they have in the government affairs group for more

198
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:57.880
of the,
uh,
the end result in,
in terms of numbers and not just policy.

199
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.680
And that was really effective too.
Uh,

200
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.570
we went to Washington DC and we escalated some of our concerns.

201
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.270
So there's a lot we can do.
And,
and I think it's really,
uh,

202
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.970
the point of learning from each other.
It's okay,
this is the situation.

203
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:16.300
How can you mirror and then tap into your own resources?

204
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.240
You talk you some great examples in the book.

205
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.530
I think it'd be interesting for this audience tear of your perspective on how

206
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:28.150
Western based companies could potentially evolve or change things that to think

207
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.990
about doing differently.
Yeah.
So I,
there's a list,

208
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.460
of course we all love lists and there's a list of 13 things,

209
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.480
recommendations that we can do.
And ironically it ended up on chapter 13.

210
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:45.130
So I think that's a really good luck thing for,
um,
some cultures.

211
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.110
Mine maybe,
but,
um,

212
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.980
so very simply go global.

213
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.200
A lot of times a Western based companies have been hesitant and I don't mean

214
00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:58.360
Google,
let's,
let's just set a story.

215
00:13:58.361 --> 00:14:01.810
There's a lot of companies that have already gone global and get the global

216
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:05.470
thing,
but I'm just generalizing here.
It's don't be afraid to go global.
It's,

217
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.240
we need to,
um,
the second part is,
okay,
while you're out there,
you know,
let's,

218
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.910
let's move out of emerging markets being a novelty.

219
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.480
And I think a lot of western based companies dabble in emerging markets.
Oh yeah.

220
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.400
It's really cool.
Let's,
let's try it out.

221
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.880
Let's throw a few people and in there and see how it works out.
Oh,

222
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.240
not making the Roi that we need got to pull out,
right?

223
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.030
It needs to be a longer term investment.

224
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.610
It needs to be a commitment and you need to know that it's,

225
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.500
it's not just a temporary thing.
Um,
other things like product development,

226
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:40.240
make sure that your product development is catering or customizing to local

227
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:42.940
customer needs.
We can't just recycle.
It's not,
oh,

228
00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:44.890
this is a mature product in this market.

229
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:47.770
Let's just throw it over the fence and see if they're going to like our old

230
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:48.220
product.

231
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.950
You had a great example that we talked about recently on that and something that

232
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:53.690
you were working with,
with Cisco when you were,

233
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.010
when they were bringing product to market to your mind,
we talked about.
Yeah.

234
00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.800
Yeah.
So,
um,
and that's,
yeah,

235
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:05.720
that's the other challenge with a really successful innovative companies,

236
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.050
right?

237
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.050
Who have a print premium based product is we're really proud of our innovations

238
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:13.970
and our products.
And I was hosting a,

239
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.530
some ministers from an African country and,
uh,

240
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.160
they nicely,

241
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.410
politely sat through the presentation at the executive briefing center and we

242
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:29.210
were talking about how great our super core router was and all the features and

243
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:32.000
functionality and it's the best out there.
And,

244
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.710
and then at the end they just,
you know,

245
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.110
they asked us a question politely thank you for the presentation and,
um,

246
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.770
how,
how does your product deal with power surges,

247
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.140
what and um,
right.

248
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.410
And so in a lot of emerging countries,
uh,

249
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.350
the power goes on and off because it's inconsistent and when the power comes on,

250
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:59.370
there is a power surge and sometimes the power surge is so strong it comes

251
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:02.570
through and blows up the equipment.

252
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.460
So we're asking them to invest millions of dollars in this super duper core

253
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:09.260
router.
And,
uh,

254
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:14.060
we haven't helped them protect that investment by knowing,
you know,

255
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:18.470
a very small detail of their needs.
Right.
So of course,

256
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:21.590
the presenter was caught off guard,
hadn't done their homework,

257
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:26.400
didn't really know what the true customer needs were.
And,
uh,
you know,

258
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.400
we didn't get to answer the question really well,

259
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:32.060
so thank you for bringing that up.
And so it's,
it's these little nuances,
right?

260
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.640
Do you look through the list and you're like,
yes,
I know that,

261
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.980
but do we really know these things?

262
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:40.640
Do we really think of these things before we just jump in?
Right,

263
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.990
right down to the execution detail,
uh,
loosely.

264
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.620
How do we think about how do we develop product for countries where or,
and,

265
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:51.470
or people where we are not right?
How do we do that effectively?

266
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.630
Is that remotely close?
Yeah,
really good question.
And,
uh,

267
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:56.840
whether it's good or bad,

268
00:16:56.841 --> 00:17:01.580
really it's the business case that makes it happen or not.
And uh,
that,

269
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.020
that was a little bit of the challenge that I've encountered in the past is,

270
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.830
um,
you can say,
you know,
emerging markets really needs this.

271
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.820
And then management will say,
show me the numbers,
give me the estimates.

272
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.320
What is the,
what are the forecasts?

273
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.490
So if you can give them some sort of revenue projections,
a but then the,

274
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.980
the quick answer is going to be,
oh,

275
00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:25.610
but that's so small relative to our larger revenue stream.

276
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.850
So my other angle to that is the strategic importance of addressing that market

277
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:35.210
with that product or that solution.
Right?

278
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:40.211
So it's the opportunity cost of not being there and a lot of companies are

279
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:44.210
punished and if they're not right when you're a slow to market,

280
00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:47.090
and I talk a little bit about this in there,
it's time to market is,

281
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.780
is really important and you dilly dally and think about and analyze too long

282
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.690
because there are so many other competitors out there ready and waiting and,

283
00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.810
and addressing that market.
So even if you do decide eventually,

284
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:04.020
sure we're going to play,
you may have missed that window and it's,

285
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.470
it's the longer term view.
Um,
you know,
you asked me last question,

286
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:11.440
but recommendations,
it's really comes down to really committing and,

287
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:16.050
and having that longer term strategic view that,
that enables that.

288
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.380
I think what's interesting about your point is as a developer,

289
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:23.370
so someone who is in product development as opposed to the sales side,

290
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:26.990
you actually talk about something in your book about relationships and you know,

291
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.420
patients in the long term and how important that is.

292
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:34.770
So I wonder how much that plays into sort of the development lifecycle and

293
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.670
thinking about making sure that your relationships are long term and you're in

294
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:41.760
there for the long haul.
Yeah,
huge.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Especially,

295
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.380
and then when you develop those relationships,
you get that real,
um,
you know,

296
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.000
uh,
on the street data that helps you support that case.

297
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.820
You talked about right at the very beginning,

298
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:55.620
you've talked about the innovation advantage.

299
00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:00.770
So tell us how Western based companies can maintain the innovation advantage.

300
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.790
Yeah.
Uh,
thanks for,
for coming back to that.
Uh,

301
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.990
so the key crux of it is the innovation vantage is the,
the,
the coveted prize,

302
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:13.560
the white flag at the top of the mountain.
Right at the beginning of the book,

303
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:17.070
we talk about strengths and weaknesses of each side,
but ultimately

304
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.500
every,
I'm generalizing,
but right.
Every,
every company and,
uh,

305
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.700
east to west really wants to be innovative because that's really where the next,

306
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.440
uh,
phase of growth comes from.
Um,
and so we see contingents of,

307
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.520
of emerging,
um,

308
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.770
folks coming to silicon valley wanting to learn the secret of how are,

309
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.290
how silicon valley innovative,
how do you do it?

310
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:44.520
How do you become creative with the ideas that we have to also be creative too.

311
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.400
We have to be innovative at being innovative.

312
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.780
So you can't just the rest on your laurels.
Uh,

313
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.820
this whole concept of innovation is evolving and as more players from different

314
00:19:56.191 --> 00:20:00.660
backgrounds are becoming innovative,
they're bringing different business models.

315
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:04.050
So we talk about five different business models and a couple of them are

316
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:07.170
business model innovation,
right?
That's coming from the east.

317
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.260
What do they really good at?
They're really good at commercializing things.
Um,

318
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.140
and again,
I'm going to generalize.

319
00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:15.720
We're really good at making things really cool things,

320
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.400
but they're really good at making money yet from really cool things or even

321
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:23.220
making money from,
okay,
cool things.

322
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.530
But it's that whole business model innovation.

323
00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:29.580
And then we also talk about a supply chain or process innovation.

324
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.880
I mean there's the reputation of manufacturing.

325
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.320
They've got it down to t,
you know,
so a one,

326
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.760
a venture capitalist who I interviewed in the book said,
you know,

327
00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:45.690
all this business about bringing manufacturing back to America.

328
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.310
We don't have the efficiencies,

329
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:51.700
we don't have the ecosystems yet to do that.

330
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.180
And some of the eastern countries do.
Right.
Um,

331
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.690
and we need to either establish that ecosystem or just understand that,

332
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.820
right?
Like that there's,

333
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.330
there's a different source of innovation happening out there.
Yeah.

334
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.720
I'm just generalizing to be more encompassing.
Like it's,

335
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.810
it's based out of China and I don't want to just pigeon hole China as being the

336
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:16.750
manufacturing giant because they're evolving out of that.

337
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.420
And other countries are,
are,
are growing into that.
Right?

338
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:21.310
Bangladesh and Vietnam are becoming so,

339
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.640
but I mean it's even humorous to see an emerging country like Mexico outsourcing

340
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.180
to China or they have done in the past outsourcing their manufacturing to China.

341
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:34.960
It's like their unemployment,
unemployment's high,
why can't it is right.

342
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.050
It is so efficient there.
They're so smart about it.

343
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.860
And let's not even think about the shipping costs right alone.
So it Matt.

344
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.120
So that's what I'm saying.
All I'm saying is let's get more creative.

345
00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:50.380
Let's figure out what's our,
what's our innovation two.
Dot.
Oh.
Like,

346
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:55.150
or five dot.
Or whatever the revenue that we're on.
How are we going to,
you know,

347
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.720
step up our game and learn from others as well.
So you,

348
00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:01.150
we talked a little yesterday about,
um,

349
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.540
a company companies that you thought were doing this well or an example of a

350
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.490
model that's doing this well.
Are doing a good,
oh yeah,
let's talk about your own,

351
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.260
uh,
Hugo Barra.
Okay.
So shall may recruited a Hugo Barra.

352
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.170
That's one of the 13,
right?
Talent is one of the recommendations.

353
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.150
They recruited your own,
uh,
Hugo Barra who is running the android,
uh,

354
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.460
product line here.
They made a VP global of shall may,
uh,

355
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.870
they used their phone is based on the android platform,
um,

356
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.840
but they've been criticized for it looking like an iPhone.
Okay.

357
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.430
So they're doing the mix and match and then they've applied it to their Chinese

358
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:42.220
market.
And,
um,
they're,

359
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:45.490
they've capitalized on the local,
you know,
the,

360
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.410
the Chinese social media phenomenon.

361
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:51.880
I think it's WeChat that everybody's a all over right.
And,

362
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:57.040
um,
they have fans right there cut.
They're not customers,
they're called fans.

363
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.480
And there's direct access to the fan base and they tell them what's working with

364
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:02.500
the phone.
So,
wow.

365
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:07.501
They just shaved off millions of r and d because the actual users end users are

366
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:11.980
telling them what they need to have improved.
They have like real time,

367
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:16.900
like almost weekly software updates,
right?
So they're not waiting for the next,

368
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.793
you know,

369
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:23.020
iPhone six s to come out in eight months with lineups around the corner.

370
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.720
Right?
There's that regular updates,
which is also,
you know,

371
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:29.290
the android platform that enables that.
So they've,
they've adapted,

372
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:33.760
they've taken innovation from all over,
including the talent,

373
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.070
right?
Put it in a different market,

374
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.390
use the local market dynamics to make it super successful.

375
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.080
And what I really like about this example too is they are not,
uh,

376
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.520
they're very shrewd about knowing that this model isn't going to necessarily

377
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:52.260
work as they go to other countries,
uh,

378
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.780
as they do their market expansion strategy.
So for example,
in the Philippines,

379
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.350
they're not,
uh,
they're,
they don't do a lot of chat,
right?

380
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:03.440
They don't do a lot of Twitter and they know that.
So they're like,
okay,

381
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:06.260
that's not going to be a success element for us.

382
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.000
Nor is the fact that our CEO is a rock star in China.
Right?

383
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:11.940
So that's not going to be,

384
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.280
how are we going to modify our market expansion strategy to be successful

385
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:19.730
elsewhere?
So yeah,
that's,
that's just one example of,

386
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.460
of doing a combined strategy.

387
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.260
How worried should western companies be about Ip?
It's a big deal.
Uh,

388
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.760
everybody should be worried about it.

389
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.000
Eastern companies should be worried about it too.
Um,
and that's,

390
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.040
that's the ongoing debate.
In fact,

391
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:39.250
there was another headline recently about the word iPhone being used for another

392
00:24:40.401 --> 00:24:44.330
product.
I think they were just leather goods in China and it was in the courts.

393
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.220
I hear some head nods,
right?
Uh,

394
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:51.221
there was a debate over many years and their court said it was okay.

395
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.840
So then you get into intellectual,
uh,
sorry,

396
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:57.800
international law and regulation,

397
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.950
and then sometimes you bring in the,
the World Trade Organization.

398
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:03.860
What does the World Trade Organization say or do?

399
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.160
But then you have to figure out,
does that person or you know,

400
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:11.240
does that country or that competitor care,
right?
What are the implications?

401
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.290
So yes,
uh,
we need to care.
And in fact,
uh,

402
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:19.040
Michelle Lee is doing a really great job of that and she's quoted in the book

403
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:23.820
too.
Um,
she's heading up the whole intellectual property,
uh,

404
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.370
issue,
uh,
for the u s government.
And,
uh,
you know,

405
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:33.560
and this comes up with the whole,
uh,
TPP,
um,
issue,
right?

406
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:36.500
The Trans Pacific partnership agreement.

407
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.950
And a lot of people saying this is great.
And then a lot of people are saying,

408
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.030
we better be careful because what's that going to mean for,

409
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.230
for our own protection?
And it goes both ways.
Right?
So that's,

410
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:50.360
and that's comes back to politics as well.
There's,

411
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.600
there's that back and forth in terms of protectionist measure measures.
Um,

412
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.250
I know recently of course,
you know,
and you,
you know,
as well,

413
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:03.390
China has pulled back on market access to a lot of western based countries,
um,

414
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.480
for different reasons of course.
But it's,
it's not all in trying to say it's,

415
00:26:07.481 --> 00:26:11.110
it's both.
It goes both ways.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

416
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.660
the government is looking at it I guess is the short answer and uh,

417
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.440
be very prudent and careful.
Yeah.

418
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.880
So in what way can governments be helpful and play a role and in what way can

419
00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:26.870
they not be helpful?
Okay.
Uh,
so governments,
uh,

420
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.000
are there for you.
The,
uh,
the,
uh,
trade groups,

421
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.000
the trade commissions,

422
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:37.040
they have contingents that take you out and help you,
uh,

423
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:40.970
with market access and they give you the lay of the land.
They give you contacts,

424
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.630
right.
And they give you the heads up on what yes.
What no to do.

425
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:46.783
Um,

426
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.590
and one of the challenges with that as well is that,
uh,

427
00:26:53.591 --> 00:26:56.920
we have a very fair government and they don't play favorites.

428
00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.350
So the extreme right,
the extent to which they will help,

429
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.340
uh,
companies has to be very,
uh,

430
00:27:06.341 --> 00:27:09.460
is very limited because they have to be very fair to everyone.

431
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.960
They can't favor any particular company in a particular industry.

432
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.760
So it gets very tricky and they're very aware of that challenge,
uh,

433
00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.480
because it's other,

434
00:27:19.481 --> 00:27:23.680
other countries' governments are much more aggressive,
uh,

435
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.720
when it does come to,
you know,
presenting a certain company abroad.
Um,

436
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.090
so I guess they're looking at it,

437
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.120
but it's very difficult to change based on our democratic fairness system.

438
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.110
Um,
and what was the second part of that?
How can they not be helpful?
Yeah,

439
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.910
that's helpful.
Yeah.
Um,
and,

440
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.700
and they need to just get more involved.
To be honest.
There's a lot of groups.

441
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.350
So for example,
in the high tech industry,
uh,

442
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.360
they have even competitors have been coming together to share some of their

443
00:27:55.361 --> 00:27:58.990
challenges and their complaints and going as,
um,

444
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.410
as a cooperative group to the government to present some of these challenges and

445
00:28:02.411 --> 00:28:07.411
ask them to make some changes and how they present or represent us abroad.

446
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.330
I mean quite simply,
even with the trade agreements,
what,

447
00:28:10.331 --> 00:28:13.120
how are we really leveraging those,
like,
uh,

448
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:17.400
like China and other companies or countries do.
Um,
so there is,

449
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.500
there are ways that we can step it up,
but I think it's,
it's a,

450
00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:22.150
it's a slow ongoing process.

451
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.170
Companies that you think are just not doing this all,

452
00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.520
or did you see examples of this not working well?
Yeah,

453
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:32.410
sometimes we're just too arrogant and we don't,
I,
I'm going to generalize.

454
00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:36.760
I don't want to name names,
but yeah,
as,
uh,
as Western based companies,

455
00:28:36.761 --> 00:28:41.510
we don't get it sometimes.
And,
um,
and that know,

456
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.650
I talk about Cultural Iq and the book and again,

457
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.600
we've all been very sensitized to that,

458
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.000
especially here in the u s and in Silicon Valley.

459
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.550
But it's really taking it to that next,
uh,

460
00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.580
next step and really appreciating the local nuances before we just dive in

461
00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.380
because they'll quickly,
you know,
throw us out and,
and then we,

462
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.180
we look baffled when,
when it doesn't,
um,
it doesn't work.

463
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.020
I'm just,
I'm just thinking back to like,

464
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.840
just even a stint that I did in South Africa and,
uh,

465
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:16.070
we went in and literally for two days now I did a little bit of meetings,
did it,

466
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.890
I'm embarrassed to say a 24 hour safari.
Yes.

467
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.700
We did see almost all the animals that we needed to see in 24 hours.

468
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.180
It was ours and we flew out and we felt really good about it.
Um,

469
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.950
but we didn't get the business,
you know,
it's just why,
why didn't they?

470
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.840
Well,
because you can't,
you can't just swoop in,
fly on.
Right.
And,
uh,

471
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.680
expect to build that relationship instantly just because we're,

472
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.860
we've got brand equity.

473
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:47.430
There was a piece in the question about financing and government involvement in

474
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.080
financing,
specifically using China as an example.

475
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:55.350
And whether that's a model that will continue or whether the model will actually

476
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.500
look very different.
Yeah.
And then,
uh,
there's,

477
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.050
there was a second part we'll get to too.
It was really interesting.
Uh,
so yeah,

478
00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:02.831
let's get it to the front.

479
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:06.090
I'm glad you brought that up because this is a really huge,
uh,

480
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.600
challenge for Western based Con,
uh,
countries and companies.

481
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.870
Uh,
so the good news is,
and,
and,
and I,

482
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.580
and I'm happy to talk about this because I've,

483
00:30:17.581 --> 00:30:20.800
I've been very passionate about it,
is we have a lot of,
uh,

484
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.820
international development banks that can tap into this,
right?

485
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:28.420
So I would get the complaints,
it's like,
hey,
how do I compete with this?

486
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:32.770
There's financing and they just gave this company $10 billion over this amount

487
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:37.000
of time.
Like,
sorry,
we don't,
we don't have that kind of cash to give out,

488
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:41.560
nor would we,
because that's not what we do.
However,
let's look at these programs.

489
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.950
So there are international development banks that you can tap into.

490
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.880
You can allocate maybe half a head count or one or two head counts for it.

491
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.480
And all you do is comb the projects that are coming up.

492
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:56.290
There was cash waiting to be had.
And it's,

493
00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.760
it's really bridging that private sector to that customer in the emerging

494
00:31:00.761 --> 00:31:02.020
country and saying,
hey,

495
00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:07.021
we can help you with that development and let us help you fill out the forms and

496
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.710
Whoa,
well,
ah,

497
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.280
you just helped your customer finance the purchase of your equipment.

498
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.230
And by the way,

499
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:19.210
you just establish a relationship because you're helping them execute in ways

500
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:23.170
that they may not have.
So that's just one small way to do it.
Um,

501
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:28.410
and then it's also companies can get a little bit more assertive with risk

502
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:30.840
taking.
Uh,

503
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:35.820
so Cisco had know Cisco capital and we were very conservative about who was

504
00:31:35.821 --> 00:31:40.350
Cisco capital,
um,
put money out to.
But eventually we,

505
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.630
we came to the realization that hey,

506
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:47.760
we're really serious about emerging markets and perhaps we are,
you know,

507
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.110
ready to have a fund,

508
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.110
a special strategic fund for key business.

509
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:55.810
That is a really important for us to win.

510
00:31:56.110 --> 00:32:00.640
And we're going to be very diligent about assessing who we lend that money too.

511
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.600
But Hey,
why not?
Right.
And that just shows a little bit more of a commitment.

512
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.820
Now let's get back to your question.

513
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.570
You also talked about pockets in the world that would influence product

514
00:32:10.571 --> 00:32:12.220
development because of the financing?

515
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.193
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

516
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.880
<v 0>Yes.
The quick answer is yes.</v>

517
00:32:15.881 --> 00:32:20.881
So she's essentially saying base based on local market needs and trends,

518
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.810
especially from a technology usage.
Is that going to f,
uh,

519
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.740
influence product development,
uh,

520
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.140
locally and it's not going to be centralized,
right?

521
00:32:32.141 --> 00:32:36.970
It's innovation not going to be centralized in,
in one place.
Absolutely.
Yes.

522
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.630
Yes.
I say very emphatically.
That's the point.

523
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.900
We need to start looking at that and localizing innovation,
uh,

524
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:51.020
based on local customer needs.
How are people using this material like today?

525
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.770
Yeah,
so I,
I did take a lot of pride in the fact that this is,
uh,

526
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.330
I wanted it to be a practical guide,
like a toolbox for business people to,

527
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.690
to kind of go through and see what they can implement.
So,
um,

528
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:07.200
it's a checklist.
It's,
there's a framework inside.
I even have like a,

529
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.480
a rough template in the back where you can get your folks together and

530
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:14.960
strategize about your next global expansion,
um,

531
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.790
endeavor and ask yourself certain questions.
Uh,

532
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.090
but I'm also giving workshops and I like to facilitate the discussion and get

533
00:33:23.091 --> 00:33:23.924
the ball rolling.

534
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.810
And either a lot of times it's at corporations,
uh,

535
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:33.740
with similar teams that are trying to build their global expansion strategy and

536
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:38.090
it's stirring the pot and getting them to think about certain elements.
And,
and,

537
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.920
um,
I love seeing the,
the thread of influence,
right?
So it's,

538
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.730
it's looking at the five p's framework and as simple as it may sound,
uh,

539
00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:50.490
when you look at the competitive,
uh,
uh,

540
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.170
dynamic that might rebut your strategy,

541
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:59.120
it really shows you how you might want to reconsider and how one,
um,

542
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.980
you know,
decision in one element or one area will influence,

543
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.390
uh,
the other areas.
So it's,

544
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.860
it's that puppeteering and really thinking it through,
uh,

545
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:14.120
through the workshops and the courses that it really makes,
you know,

546
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:18.430
makes an impact at the end.
Great.
Um,
just maybe on a closing note,
um,

547
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.330
there's so much in this book and it's,

548
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.400
and it's a wonderful to read and they're controversial pieces and one can

549
00:34:25.921 --> 00:34:30.630
sometimes leave feeling worried and or challenged,
but you are so positive.
So,

550
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.310
um,
tell us what,
what makes you so positive just about this topic?

551
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.830
Um,
I think the reinforcement from industry,

552
00:34:41.831 --> 00:34:45.490
from people that have lived at,
um,
people who were there,

553
00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:49.180
you mentioned 10 Wilcox who wrote the foreword.
I mean,
just,

554
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.500
just the validation from people out there that are like,
this is this.
Yes,

555
00:34:53.501 --> 00:34:55.090
this is a need.
This needs to be done.

556
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.630
And the idea that we all do need to work together.

557
00:34:58.631 --> 00:35:01.900
The idea that it's coopertition,
it's no longer a competition game.

558
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:06.250
We need to learn how to learn from each other,
uh,
equally.
Um,
and,

559
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.510
and that's also playing each other's sandboxes and learning how to do that

560
00:35:10.511 --> 00:35:15.511
respectfully given our are different boundaries and limitations.

561
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.540
So I just,
I just think it's necessary.

562
00:35:19.541 --> 00:35:21.490
We just need to figure out how to,

563
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:26.830
to recalibrate and everybody will be successful.
Great.

564
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.850
Thank you.
Well,
thank you for that.

565
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:32.060
Amy's going to stick around a little bit to answer questions for those of you

566
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:35.080
