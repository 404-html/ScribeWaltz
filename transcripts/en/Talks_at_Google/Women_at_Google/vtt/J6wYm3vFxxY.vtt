00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.210
Welcome Dorie Clark.

14
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.550
<v 1>Thank you.
So in a little Google,</v>

15
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.030
we live in a world today that is getting faster.
By the minute,

16
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.700
the average employee gets more than a hundred emails per day and that rate is

17
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:12.010
growing by 15% a year.

18
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.690
Very soon it's going to be unsustainable if it's not already.

19
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.100
You guys here at Google probably are already in the forefront of that.

20
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.670
We live in a world where in the past minute that sue has been introducing me,

21
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.750
a hundred hours of video was uploaded to your very own product,

22
00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:36.751
to youtube with all of that people and information is streaming at you 20 years

23
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:40.060
ago,

24
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.060
it may have made good sense to follow your mom or dad's advice to just keep your

25
00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:50.230
head down and do good work and that that would eventually be noticed and

26
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:51.064
rewarded.

27
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.260
But these days with people being so bombarded with information,

28
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.410
with tweets and meetings and emails and text messages and snapchats and

29
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:06.310
Instagrams coming at them,
it's too much for people to take in.

30
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.950
If we don't find a way to take control of our careers and to stand out,

31
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.140
we risk being left behind.

32
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.630
That's why I wrote the book stand out because I wanted to try to understand

33
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.290
among the people who are considered the very best in their field,

34
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.700
how did they get there?

35
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.090
How did they come up with the ideas that they became known for and how did they

36
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:32.980
actually get recognized and build a following around them?

37
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.900
So I spent a couple of years interviewing about 50 top experts in a cross

38
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:39.070
section of different fields.

39
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:43.930
Everything from genomics to real estate to urban planning,

40
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.940
to business,
to productivity,

41
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.180
to try to understand what enables the top performers today to really get noticed

42
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.980
and have their true talents scene so that hopefully we can apply some of those

43
00:02:56.981 --> 00:03:00.820
same lessons to regular professionals today.

44
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.350
What are the first things that I wanted to talk about because I've been

45
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.190
traveling around the country in the past couple of months since standout came

46
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:14.191
out is the fact that sometimes when I'm having conversations with people about

47
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.160
this,
they say,
Oh,
you know,
this is,
this is great.
Yeah,
I get it.

48
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.990
That we need to stand out,
that it's important to,
you know,

49
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.780
have breakthrough ideas,
but that's something that's good for other people.

50
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.310
That's,
that's not me.
I'm just a regular person.
I'm not a genius.

51
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.190
I don't know that I can really do this.

52
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.410
And one of my very favorite examples actually is Starbucks.

53
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.620
Something that even just walking here from the tea,

54
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.110
you see a million of them on every corner.

55
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.470
Howard Schultz didn't invent coffee,

56
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.260
he didn't invent coffee shops.

57
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.070
What he came up with was a slightly different way to do a coffee shop,

58
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.770
and yet that was enough to create a multibillion dollar worldwide empire.

59
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.990
You don't need to be Einstein.

60
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:09.550
You don't need to create the theory of relativity or to discover a new element

61
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:10.840
on the periodic table.

62
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.830
What you need to do is find a slightly different way to look at the world and

63
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.390
fortunately because of your unique experiences,

64
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.140
because no one sees the world exactly the way that you do.

65
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.800
That's something that actually is eminently possible.

66
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.880
One of the people that I profile in stand out is this woman.

67
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.140
Her name is Rose Schumann.

68
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.750
Rose grew up in suburban Maryland and when she was 18 years old,

69
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.520
she took a family trip to Nicaragua because that's where her stepmother was
from.

70
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.300
It was shortly after the end of the contra war and rose went down with her

71
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.970
family and she had never seen anything like it.

72
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.570
She grew up in a comfortable suburban environment and she was exposed for the

73
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:06.061
first time to a country where all of the institutions that we take for granted

74
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.810
weren't operating.

75
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.100
There was one operative streetlight in the entire country.

76
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.310
There's poverty unlike anything she had ever seen before,

77
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.020
and she decided that she wanted to do something about it,

78
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.000
and so she did.
She went off to college,
she studied development.

79
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.470
She got a job after she graduated in an Ngo and she started working on the

80
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.740
problems and rolling up her sleeves.
Now,

81
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.720
one of the most common myths about innovation,
about creativity,

82
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:42.721
about coming up with breakthrough ideas is that the people who have them have

83
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.020
these these bolts of insights.
You know,

84
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.990
suddenly the muses are whispering in their ear and they know what they have to

85
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:53.170
do and then they go and do it and sure,

86
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.480
I'm sure in some cases it works like that,

87
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.700
but for the vast majority of people,

88
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.680
and I think this is really important for the vast majority of people,

89
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.150
you don't start with a brilliant idea and then execute it.

90
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.720
When I interviewed these 50 top thought leaders to try to understand what made

91
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.890
them tick.
What I heard again and again was actually the opposite of that.

92
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.470
You start by caring about something.
You start with curiosity.

93
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.980
You start by having a passion to explore something and in the process of diving

94
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.200
into it,
learning about it,

95
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.880
seeing what it's made of and how you can make a contribution.

96
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.390
That is how you can determine where you can have an impact and what kind of

97
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:46.790
change you can make.
In Rose's case,

98
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.680
she had been working on these issues for several years before lightening struck

99
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:56.150
her.
One day she was walking around and she saw one of these,

100
00:06:56.151 --> 00:07:00.980
she saw call box like you'd see at a transit station.
Pretty simple.

101
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.100
Push a button,
talk to somebody on the other end of the line,

102
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.790
ask a question or make a complaint,
get your problem solved,

103
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.460
and rose saw this and she realized that this problem that had been in the back

104
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:14.900
of her mind for so long,

105
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.260
how do you get the power of the Internet and bring it to the world's poorest 1

106
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.770
billion people?
That might actually be how to do it.

107
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.310
There's a lot of strategies that people have talked about,

108
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:30.350
about how to bring the Internet to the poor,

109
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.360
but they involve a lot of steps.
You have to give them laptops.

110
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:38.750
You have to keep the laptops safe from the elements or from theft.

111
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.010
You have to make sure that people are literate so that they can use the
internet.

112
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.120
You have to make sure they're literate in a language that exists on the
Internet.

113
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.230
You can't really keep,
you can't really take all of those things for granted,

114
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.800
but rose realized with a simple push of a button,

115
00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.040
if you could wire it up so that people could talk to someone who spoke their

116
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.480
language on the other end of the line.

117
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.240
That's how they could get access to the full power of what the Internet could

118
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:11.480
offer.
So she launched an initiative called the question box,

119
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.440
which today is operating in many cities in India and Africa.

120
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.540
That was a lightening bolt in some ways.
In a moment,
looking around,

121
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.250
paying attention.
She saw it,

122
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.070
but you hardly ever start with a lightening bolt.
You start by caring,

123
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.930
you start by looking at your own experiences.

124
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.760
The way that you see the world uniquely for Rose hadn't been to Nicaragua.

125
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.620
She hadn't taken that family trip.

126
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.480
She probably never would have dug deeply enough to find that solution.

127
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.520
For all of us.
We have things that we've studied,
passions,
hobbies,

128
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.090
cultural backgrounds,
things that we've experienced.

129
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.860
Oftentimes that's the point.

130
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.820
So in the course of researching standout,

131
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:04.350
I discovered that there are five principal areas of finding your breakthrough

132
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.670
idea,
five chief ways that with all of these thinkers,

133
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.840
you don't have to do all of these,

134
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:14.841
but it's a bit of a smorgasbord where people draw from one or maybe two and it

135
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:20.640
begins to inspire a cascade of the kind of breakthrough ideas they get known

136
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:21.210
for.

137
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.830
So I wanted to share with you some of the stories about them in hopes that maybe

138
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:30.831
some of them might be a trigger for you to go deeper and develop further.

139
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.900
Some of the ideas that you are nurturing.
This gentleman is named Eric Shot.

140
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.080
He's actually someone I used to consult for.

141
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:44.490
He's the head of a genomics research institute at Mount Sinai Hospital in New

142
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.240
York.

143
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.920
What's significant about Eric and part of why I included him in stand out is

144
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:54.921
that today he's actually one of the most cited scientific researchers in the

145
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:55.531
world.

146
00:09:55.531 --> 00:10:00.450
He's done more than 200 peer reviewed papers on almost any disease imaginable,

147
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.350
but the reason he's been so successful in the world of biology,

148
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.430
interestingly enough,
is that he didn't start in biology.

149
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.030
His initial training was in math and computer science and as you guys might

150
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:15.660
appreciate more than most,

151
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.950
that gave him a quantitative way of looking at the world,

152
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.160
a quantitative orientation so that when he entered biology later in his career

153
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.900
and he looked at it,
he realized that the power of big data,

154
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.460
which was just starting to become possible thanks to the rapid progress in

155
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:38.430
genetic sequencing that was happening in the late nineties and early two

156
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:42.930
thousands people weren't taking advantage of that because classically trained

157
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:46.800
biologists hadn't needed quantitative skills in that way,

158
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.100
but because Eric had come from a different world,

159
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.280
he saw the potential and dove into it and it enabled him to make breakthroughs

160
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:58.560
much faster than almost anyone else.

161
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.160
One of the key elements when it comes to innovation is combining disciplines,

162
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:07.050
combining perspectives.

163
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.590
It becomes incredibly hard if you are too steeped in one methodology,

164
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.240
whether it is the methodology of a discipline or even just the methodology,

165
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:22.920
the ideology of one company.
One way of looking at the world.

166
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.670
If all you know is one thing,
it becomes very,

167
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.440
very hard to tell the difference between doing something one way because that is

168
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:36.441
the best way or the only way that works and doing it one way because it's habit.

169
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.250
If you bring different perspectives together,

170
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.520
you're able to question and to see what is mere habit and what if the

171
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:52.611
circumstances have changed in the interim might be ripe for disruption and more

172
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.760
productive change.

173
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

174
00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.550
<v 1>The second thing that I learned in talking to these thought leaders about how to</v>

175
00:12:01.551 --> 00:12:06.551
develop breakthrough ideas is the importance of what I will call tackling a

176
00:12:06.621 --> 00:12:08.150
worthy challenge.

177
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.320
Now I do a lot of podcast interviews.

178
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.030
I have done well over a hundred of them,
uh,
since the launch of stand out.

179
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.200
And what are the questions that they often ask in the podcast is,
you know,
who,

180
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.320
who are the entrepreneurs that,
uh,
that people admire.

181
00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:28.190
And I listened to lots of other podcasts and so I've heard a cross section of

182
00:12:28.191 --> 00:12:31.790
answers and I'd be curious what you guys think.

183
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:36.050
But when other entrepreneurs and writers are interviewed,

184
00:12:36.051 --> 00:12:39.500
what I hear on these podcasts and uh,
in write ups,

185
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.960
probably nine times out of 10,

186
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:47.290
if they are citing a living person who is their greatest inspiration,

187
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.420
they always cite Elon Musk.

188
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.200
And the reason I think they do that is that he is someone who probably more

189
00:12:57.621 --> 00:13:02.420
unabashedly than most,
is willing to aim big and to think big

190
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.120
solar power,
exploring the heavens,

191
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.380
electric cars,
those are challenges so big.

192
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.790
They get people excited.

193
00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.690
That's what fuels Google in many ways.

194
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.560
All the exciting initiatives that you guys are doing with Google x and beyond

195
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.790
their projects that attract the greatest minds.

196
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.990
People want to be a part of them.
Peter Diamandis,

197
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.180
who's a business author and Silicon Valley thinker has a saying that I like.

198
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.890
The fastest way to make $1 billion is to help a billion people.

199
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.970
There is a power in a big idea because it becomes easier to get other people on

200
00:13:47.241 --> 00:13:50.750
board with you to get other people excited,
to give you funding,

201
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.180
to help you to join with you.

202
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.720
You get the talent you need and that creates momentum.

203
00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.560
This woman here is named Rita Gunther Mcgrath.

204
00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:05.540
She's a professor at Columbia and a couple of years ago she wrote a book called

205
00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:10.541
the end of Competitive Advantage and the book has been lauded reader in fact has

206
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.340
has been named one of the top 10 management thinkers in the world and part of

207
00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:17.600
the reason for that,

208
00:14:17.601 --> 00:14:22.520
and part of the reason I talked to her about this is that in her book she took

209
00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:27.521
on one of the most cherished ideas in management thinking the idea of

210
00:14:28.191 --> 00:14:33.170
competitive advantage,
Michael Porter and others for a long time,

211
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.730
you know for decades the,

212
00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:39.731
the wisdom in business was that you needed as a business to find a competitive

213
00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:42.950
advantage and then keep it at all costs.

214
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.340
What is your sustainable competitive advantage?

215
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.970
Rita Mcgrath was one of the first thinkers to begin to probe idea in light of

216
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:53.510
the changes,

217
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.050
massively disruptive changes that we have been experiencing in our economy.

218
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.380
The fact that know the pace is picking up even it's been picking up so fast that

219
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.230
even regular everyday customers are seeing it.

220
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.450
People who carried a blackberry five years ago almost certainly don't have a

221
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:14.990
blackberry today.
People who shopped at circuit city,

222
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.560
people who shopped at borders are not shopping there today.

223
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.000
We see it with our own eyes and Rita was one of the first people to write a

224
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:28.001
detailed book about what to do in that new environment when sustainable

225
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.380
competitive advantage is gone.

226
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.870
How do you bake innovation into everything that you do?
What's the next step?

227
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.440
That's a question that people care about.

228
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.080
If you can ride the wave,

229
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.460
if you can find an idea that people are already interested in,

230
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.520
that people are already talking about and want an answer to and begin to make a

231
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:53.480
move towards solving it,

232
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.970
the power of that will bring people along with you and help your idea gain

233
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:02.180
traction.
Now another strategy,

234
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:06.560
a third strategy that I discovered in the course of talking to these experts is

235
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:11.420
the niche strategy.
This gentleman here is named,
so Paul Ear,
uh,
today,

236
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:15.350
he's a professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles,

237
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.510
but he didn't start out there when he was a baby.

238
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.170
His mother rescued him and his four siblings and they escaped together from the

239
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.700
Kamir Rouge in Cambodia.
She was able,

240
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:36.260
amazingly in the midst of all the killing and genocide going on to get her

241
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.640
entire family out.

242
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.110
And first they were refugees in France and then eventually they made it to the

243
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:43.220
United States.

244
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.020
So Paul grew up and did well in school,

245
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.710
pursued an academic career and decided to become a political scientist.

246
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.060
But in academia as,
as you guys know,
um,
you know the,

247
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:03.070
the foundation of Google is page rank and a and p where does page rank come

248
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:06.680
from?
Well,
it was inspired by academic citations.

249
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:10.490
The more citations you have,
the better off you are.

250
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.260
And if you are an aspiring young academic,
where the incentives are,

251
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.940
is that you want to write about a topic that is sexy that everyone is talking

252
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:23.360
about so that everyone will cite you.
That's,
that's the,

253
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.960
the sheer mathematics of getting jobs in academia.

254
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:32.810
So if you're a political economists,
what do you study?
China,
maybe India,
Brazil,

255
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.570
some of these burgeoning growing economies.

256
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.530
But so Paul wants to do something different.

257
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.070
He wanted to understand his homeland.

258
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.100
That is why he was doing what he was doing.

259
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.760
He wanted to understand it and he wanted to find ways to give back because he

260
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:54.450
says I was lucky to get out of Cambodia alive.

261
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.580
So he became a Cambodian specialist.

262
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.800
It might seem like the kiss of death for young academic in Cambodia is an

263
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:08.520
interesting place,
but it's certainly not yet,
uh,
a superpower.

264
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:13.980
But what's so Paul's example shows and part of why I wanted to include him in

265
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:17.120
stand out is it sometimes counterintuitively,

266
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.530
the narrower you go at first,

267
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.920
if you keep the orientation that the first door you enter isn't the last door,

268
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.380
it's just the hallway and there are doors off of it.

269
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.030
If that's how you begin thinking about your professional life,

270
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.440
you can go in a lot of surprising and powerful directions.

271
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:46.070
So Paul wrote his dissertation about foreign aid in Cambodia and so he developed

272
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.590
an expertise in foreign aid.
Generally I was great,

273
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.340
but perhaps more surprising is the fact that one of the things that he ended up

274
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:57.720
studying in the course of study in Cambodia was livestock.

275
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.900
He had to write a paper,
um,

276
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.120
because his advisor was advising an agricultural commission for the UN and might

277
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:10.320
seem pretty random.
But when the bird flu epidemic struck,

278
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.431
it turned out that,

279
00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:16.431
so Paul was one of the few experts operating in America who actually had deep

280
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.960
familiarity with Southeast Asian livestock practices and he became a noted

281
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:25.320
expert on avian flu,
in fact,

282
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.690
starting again with Cambodia.
So Paul was able to give a very popular Ted talk,

283
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.250
which if you guys haven't seen it,
I recommend it about criminal justice.

284
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.120
And his entry point was the Kamir Rouge tribunals.

285
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.550
You start with Cambodia,

286
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:47.180
but you end up with a world if you can establish an expertise in a narrow enough

287
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:49.644
area.

288
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.890
There's a phenomenon in psychology known as the halo effect.

289
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.400
And essentially what it says is that if you come to be recognized as having

290
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:01.530
expertise for one thing,

291
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:07.010
you will be viewed in general by people as talented and smart and good.

292
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.860
This is why we get the phenomenon of actors who get to be politicians or

293
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.970
business leaders who,
who gets to,
uh,
to move into other fields.

294
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.430
It's because people generalize.

295
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.600
And so if you are able to own a niche and go deep,

296
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.440
that gives you a powerful base,

297
00:20:27.441 --> 00:20:32.441
a powerful toehold to expand out and develop your brand as someone who's really

298
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:33.594
knowledgeable.

299
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.130
Another area which I think often gets overlooked,

300
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.060
but I think particularly in a place like Google can be really powerful,

301
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.240
is research.
Doing research.

302
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.400
I talk to people sometimes when I'm advising businesses and professionals about

303
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:54.250
this,
they say,
oh,
well,
you know,
that's great.
Sure.
Of course,

304
00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:55.420
research can be helpful,

305
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.780
but I don't have time to do a doctorate or I don't have the money to do a

306
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:02.620
national survey.
Of course.
I mean,
those things are great,

307
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.950
but research even on small levels can be incredibly useful and powerful as a

308
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:13.600
tool.
It could be case studies,
it could be reviews,

309
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.340
it could be white papers.

310
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:20.230
It could be somehow just going deep to provide some kind of,

311
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.090
uh,
of quantitative new information or qualitative for that matter.

312
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.770
And my favorite example of this is this gentleman here,

313
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.160
his name is Michael Waxen Berg and Michael I discovered was an it manager for a

314
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:41.620
financial services company.
That was his job.
It was an is his job,

315
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.620
but completely inadvertently.

316
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.270
He was able to develop a really lucrative and enjoyable sideline for himself.

317
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.610
It all started about 15 years ago.

318
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.210
He was living in New York City with his family and he had just gotten the

319
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:59.160
announcement that his Condo,
a hit,
you know,

320
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.040
the apartment that he was living in was going to be condo wised and he had to

321
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:07.330
make a decision about whether his family would buy their unit.
So Michael,

322
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.090
you know,
he,
he was a,
he was a data driven guy.

323
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:12.010
He wanted to make a good decision about this.

324
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.770
So we started going to open houses and visiting them.

325
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.110
That's not very different than what you or I might do,

326
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:22.650
but what he did do that was very different was he started writing reviews of the

327
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:26.290
properties that he visited,
not,
you know,

328
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.190
quick one line displaces great.
This place sucks.

329
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.980
Really detailed reviews.

330
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.300
It started out more for his own benefit than anything just so he could keep them

331
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:41.500
straight.
But instead of keeping that information to himself,

332
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.610
he posted it publicly on a real estate website called StreetEasy.

333
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.000
And as a result,
as he posted more and more,

334
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.840
he started getting emails off the website with people saying,

335
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.470
I love your reviews.
They're fantastic.
Will you represent me?

336
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:01.030
And he had to write back and say,
well,
thank you so much,
but I'm not a realtor.

337
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.770
And so he started advising people just for fun on the side,

338
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.260
but they couldn't give him any money.
He wasn't licensed.

339
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:11.290
They'd give him boxes of chocolates or bottles of wine,

340
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.780
but he couldn't really do anything with it.

341
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.790
But more and more people started coming to him and eventually a realtor

342
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.390
approached him and said,
look,
you already have a client base.

343
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.560
If you haven't done this yet,
I will sponsor you to become a realtor.

344
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.340
And so Michael got his license and now for years has been operating with no

345
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:37.540
marketing whatsoever,
a side business,
as a real estate agent,

346
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.140
selling houses here and there,
and having people come to him.

347
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.800
On the strength of his reviews.
Now for me,

348
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:48.920
what's critical here?
This didn't,
this didn't cost money.

349
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.810
It took a little time,

350
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.130
but it's nothing that any of us can't do.

351
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.510
Sometimes people think research and they think it has to be technical.

352
00:23:59.511 --> 00:24:01.100
They think it has to be complicated,

353
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.700
but whether it's a review of real estate,

354
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.230
whether it's writing up a in in depth report about something.

355
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.210
We live in a world now,

356
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:16.300
the Internet world where everyone has an opinion where in fact half of what you

357
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:20.540
look at is someone's opinion about someone's opinion about someone's opinion

358
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.980
about the Kardashians.

359
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.570
What we need more of is facts.

360
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.040
Well we need more of is people who are doing what Michael did with thoughtful

361
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.930
research,
thoughtful primary source research.

362
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.040
That's something that with a little time and effort any of us can do.

363
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:41.601
Finally,

364
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:46.601
the fifth strategy that I discovered in the course of writing stand out was what

365
00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:51.020
I call creating a framework.
Some of you guys may know this guy,

366
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:53.110
he has a lot of devotees.

367
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.110
His name is David Allen and he is the powerhouse behind getting things done.

368
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.190
The productivity system.
Now,

369
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.670
part of what I would argue makes David Allen and getting things done so popular,

370
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:08.090
so powerful,

371
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:13.100
is the fact that just about everybody these days has some kind of productivity

372
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:17.600
tip about,
Oh,
do this with your inbox or do that with your to do list.

373
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.360
David Allen has a system.

374
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.950
He has a thorough system that helps you understand and explain not just here's

375
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:32.150
what to do now,
but to put productivity into context.

376
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.400
When you,
we often think,
you know,
people have been doing this for decades.

377
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:40.550
People have been doing this for for hundreds of years.

378
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.790
All everything that that should have been said has been said,

379
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.100
but not really.

380
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.240
It wasn't until 30 years ago that Robert Cialdini developed the six principles

381
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:56.630
of influence and persuasion.
I mean,

382
00:25:56.631 --> 00:26:01.240
people have been studying persuasion from the beginning of time.
I mean,

383
00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:04.310
you look back hundreds of years,
you see Mackey valleys,

384
00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:09.311
the prince people care about what it takes to persuade someone of something.

385
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.300
But Robert Cialdini was able,
you know,

386
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.720
great eminent researcher from Arizona State University was able to be the first

387
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:20.990
person to say,
you know what?
When it comes to influence and persuasion,

388
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.860
there's actually only six ways to do it.
Here's what they are,

389
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.230
and it turned out that was so helpful.
That was so instructive.

390
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.920
Almost anytime.
Now that influence and persuasion has mentioned,

391
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:38.450
Robert Cialdini is mentioned along with it now with David Allen.

392
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.850
Anytime somebody says,
oh,
I'm so stressed out,

393
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:43.860
I have way too many emails to respond to people say,

394
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.960
have you thought about getting things done?

395
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.440
If you can create an explanatory framework,

396
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:54.510
whether it's Maslow's hierarchy of needs or Elizabeth Kubler Ross's five stages

397
00:26:54.511 --> 00:26:59.400
of grief,
anything like that,
I mean those are famous examples,

398
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.740
but even on the microscopic level,

399
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.750
if you can create structures that help people understand a task,

400
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:09.990
better,
a job,
better,
uh,
fields better,

401
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.780
that can be enormously powerful.
In fact,
going a little metta,

402
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.430
that's what I'm trying to do with stand out is to try to help explain the

403
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:25.431
strategies of how to become a recognized expert in your field.

404
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.400
But of course,
coming up with the idea is only half the battle.

405
00:27:29.401 --> 00:27:30.600
It's only the first step.

406
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:35.220
And so I wanted to just touch briefly on this question of how do you build a

407
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:37.820
following around your idea?
How do you get it known?

408
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.650
How do you get it recognized by other people?

409
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.440
I'll argue based on the research that I did interviewing these top thought

410
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:47.070
leaders,

411
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:52.070
that it is a three step process to share your idea with the world and really

412
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:56.370
begin to have it gained momentum and be fully recognized.

413
00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.200
The first step is building your network.
The second step,
building your audience,

414
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.910
the third building your community.
I'll tackle them in turn.

415
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.660
This woman is Corey Anderson and I profiled her and stand out as kind of the

416
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:15.990
exemplar of building your network because she had,

417
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.820
I have known her for a number of years,

418
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:21.450
but it actually wasn't until I started talking to her for this book that I

419
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:24.840
discovered.
This story that she had that I thought was so remarkable.

420
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.720
I knew I had to share it,
carry it.

421
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:32.721
Turns out it used to be a journalist and in 1989 she created a kind of

422
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:39.210
mastermind group of fellow journalists where they would get together monthly

423
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.910
trade ideas.
About stories about the profession,

424
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:46.710
about how to do their jobs better.
And it was so,
it was so powerful for her.

425
00:28:46.711 --> 00:28:48.000
It was such a good experience,

426
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:51.810
such a good learning experience that a few years later when she had shifted over

427
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.610
to become a professional speaker,

428
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.760
she started a second mastermind group in 1994 of fellow speakers to do the same

429
00:28:59.131 --> 00:29:00.450
thing,
just you know,

430
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.260
half a dozen or so people meeting once a month to trade ideas.

431
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.620
Now a lot of people do something like that,

432
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:13.070
but what I thought was amazing was that it turns out Karrie is still meeting

433
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.910
with these groups 20 and 25 years later,

434
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.680
she is meeting monthly with the same people and she says that this is actually

435
00:29:22.681 --> 00:29:26.730
been one of the most singular professional experiences of her life.

436
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.410
Now,

437
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.940
the moral of the story is not that we all need to start a mastermind groups that

438
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:36.720
lasts the quarter century,
although I'm sure it would be beneficial.

439
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.980
But what I take from her experience is that the most important thing,

440
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:43.210
the most important step,

441
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:46.660
and I heard this again and again from the thought leaders that I profiled,

442
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.170
you have to start with a base of people.

443
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.440
You have to start with a small base of trusted colleagues that you respect and

444
00:29:56.141 --> 00:30:01.141
listened to and have honest connections with so that they aren't afraid to tell

445
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:05.680
you when your idea is amazing and they aren't afraid to tell you when your idea

446
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:10.681
is bad so that you can refine it and by the time you share it with the world,

447
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:14.980
by the time you begin building a broader audience,

448
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.880
it's in as good a shape as it can possibly be.
Too.

449
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:23.881
Few of us have this because we're responding to stimuli all day long.

450
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.710
Maybe we need to listen to David Allen a little bit more because for a lot of
us,

451
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:32.110
the people we hang out with,
the people we spend time with,

452
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.050
it's the people who email us.
Who Do you have coffee with?

453
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:39.160
Who Do you have lunch with?
Well,
guess what?
For a lot of us,
it's whoever asks.

454
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.380
That's not how it should be.

455
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.330
We need to be more deliberate about thinking through who are the three people to

456
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:51.070
five people that the eight people that we most want to be spending time with.

457
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:53.740
The people that we want to learn from,

458
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:56.770
the people we truly respect and who raise our game.

459
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.950
If we can be proactive about spending time with them,

460
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:05.430
that is one of the most important career moves that we can make because they can

461
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:09.520
provide us with the insights and support that we need.

462
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.560
That's the first step.
The second step of course,

463
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.550
because if an idea is going to spread,
it can't just be with people.
You know?

464
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.470
The second step is building your audience and fortunately these days we have

465
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.430
more ability than ever to do something like that.

466
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.790
We are able to blog about it to give speeches like this about it and we can

467
00:31:33.281 --> 00:31:38.020
tweet.
We can go on Pinterest,
we can share it on social media,
we can do webinars,

468
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:42.040
we can have podcasts.
There's a million ways of spreading it,

469
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:48.180
but still we have a lot of people who are shy about standing out,

470
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:54.010
people who are nervous about sharing their ideas for fear that they might be

471
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:56.920
shot down.
But first of all,

472
00:31:56.921 --> 00:32:00.610
if you have this trusted group of advisors who have given you feedback,

473
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.190
then by the time your idea of reaches the place where you're able to begin

474
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:09.880
sharing it with the world,
you've already had some smart eyes looking at it.

475
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:14.890
There's already a pretty good chance that your idea has some merit to it.

476
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.920
But really the way that I think about this,

477
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:23.370
and I take the image from a conversation I had with a thinker named John Hagel

478
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:25.300
from Deloitte Center for the edge.

479
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.260
He said that putting your ideas out there,

480
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:33.880
whether it's blogging or using some other method,
it's like putting a light out.

481
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.600
It's like it's like sharing a beacon and putting it out there so that likeminded

482
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160
people can see it and come to you in this noisy,

483
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:50.660
crowded world.
We have to make ourselves discoverable.

484
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.380
There are with 7 billion people in the world.

485
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.070
There are people who care about the things that you care about.

486
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:01.340
There are people who see the world the same way that you do.

487
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:06.200
There are people who need your ideas,
but it's loud.

488
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.630
There's a lot of material out there.

489
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.790
They have to be able to find you and they can't do it unless we are willing to

490
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.980
step up and share our ideas.

491
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:21.080
And it could be something as simple as putting out a blog post on linkedin or

492
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.090
starting a Twitter account where you don't even have to put out your own ideas.

493
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.571
At first,

494
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:30.740
it can just be curating what you think is interesting around subjects you care

495
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:31.520
about.

496
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.520
But it's beginning to find a way to put the pings out into the universe to see

497
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.770
if you get an echo back.

498
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.270
Now we're all busy and one of the challenges,

499
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:48.500
I hear this talking to people all the time is okay,
don't worry,
that's great,

500
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:53.180
but how do I have time to create content or be active on social media or any of

501
00:33:53.181 --> 00:33:56.430
these things?
When I have a crazy job and I'm,

502
00:33:56.431 --> 00:34:01.431
I'm busy and I'm being stretched too thin anyway and I respect that.

503
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:04.730
I think that's true for,
for most of us if not all of us.

504
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.540
I think the key here and something that I want to highlight,

505
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.990
something I talk about in stand out is the power of leverage.

506
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:16.010
Some of you may recognize this guy,
he's fairly well known in the tech space.

507
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.380
Robert Scoble,
um,
you know,

508
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:23.270
well known opinion leader in technology and when I interviewed Robert for this

509
00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:25.520
book,
he told me something interesting.

510
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:30.320
He is somebody who gets hundreds if not thousands of emails a day.

511
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.680
It's constantly uh,
being uh,

512
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.980
being contacted by startups that would like to talk to him or get his advice or

513
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.110
have him feature them in some forum.

514
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.150
And what he says when he told me is that when someone asks him a question,

515
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.110
when the email him a question,
he writes back and he says,

516
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:52.640
I would be happy to answer your question but not on email.

517
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.620
What he tells them instead is that they should post their question on Quora,

518
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.570
the question and answer website.

519
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.900
And that he will answer it there and the reason he says he does it is that he

520
00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:10.400
says,
if I email someone the answer,
I've helped one person,

521
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.310
but if I put the answer on the Internet,

522
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.860
I'm able to help five people or 50 people or 500 people.

523
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.560
That's how we need to start thinking.

524
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.520
All of us have too many meetings.

525
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.250
All of us suffer from too little time.

526
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:33.800
If we can begin to think strategically about how we can leverage our impact,

527
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.490
leverage our ideas,
share them with more people with the same amount of effort,

528
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:43.800
that's what it's going to take to enable our ideas to really grow and spread.

529
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:45.803
Finally,

530
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:50.810
what I discovered in the course of researching stand out is that when you start

531
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.790
with building your network,
you start small.

532
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.320
You start with this close knit trusted group,
you move to building your audience,

533
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.630
going one to many,
talking to a larger group.
Those are all important steps.

534
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.930
But when an idea fully take shape,
when it begins to,

535
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.950
to grow to a level where things are happening on its own,

536
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:14.730
where the dominoes are falling,

537
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.830
what happens in that moment is that your audience that has been listening to you

538
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.990
starts talking to each other.

539
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.830
And that is the moment where an audience becomes a community.

540
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.400
So one example,
perhaps,
uh,

541
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.960
near and dear to some of your tech hearts,
uh,
the lean startup,

542
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.970
this is Eric Reese,
the author of that book bestseller a couple of years ago.

543
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:44.810
Today there are more than 750,000 people worldwide who are registered for lean

544
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:48.990
startup meetup groups.

545
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.150
That's more people certainly than Eric Reese could address in a room,

546
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.720
maybe even in a year,
maybe even in a lifetime.

547
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:03.350
It's a huge number of people who are voluntarily organizing around that idea.

548
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.940
And what I discovered in the course of writing and researching standout is that

549
00:37:08.941 --> 00:37:11.490
if you want your idea to go viral,

550
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.780
if you want your audience members to start talking to each other about them and

551
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:19.740
forming a community around your idea,
two things need to happen.

552
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.900
There's a technical element.

553
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.220
You want to try to find a way to make it easy for people to talk to each other.

554
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.480
Maybe it's by having a conference like in the lean startup does every year.

555
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.530
Maybe it's by having meetup groups where people can get together around the

556
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:37.830
world.
Eric Reese will sometimes call in,
you know,

557
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:40.740
he'll do Skype calls with new chapters to encourage them.

558
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:46.060
Maybe it's creating an online message board or a,
uh,
a Google groups or you know,

559
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.100
some form of online discussion,
a Facebook page,

560
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.120
whatever it is.

561
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.440
But some way that people can be in touch with each other directly and have those

562
00:37:55.441 --> 00:38:00.441
conversations without you because an idea will always spread farther if you're

563
00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:04.770
not the only one saying it.
But that's the technical element.

564
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:10.020
Even more than the technical is the philosophical.

565
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.460
If your idea is really going to spread from the beginning,

566
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.820
something important needs to be baked into your idea and that is it has to have

567
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:24.000
value for people other than yourself.

568
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:29.370
The reason that people are going to spread ideas is that they feel that it's

569
00:38:29.371 --> 00:38:32.910
relevant to their own lives.
They see themselves in it.

570
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.950
They feel that it's helpful for Eric Reese.

571
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:41.110
It's not about supporting him or Megan,
his book a bestseller.
That's nice,

572
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.240
but what people care about is making it less likely that their startup is going

573
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:47.074
to fail.

574
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.480
They're having these conversations because they want to be more successful and

575
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:53.770
they view that as a tool.

576
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:58.630
If your idea has utility for other people,

577
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.200
if other people can see in it a way to better their own lives,

578
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.940
they want to share that message and they're going to be excited to do so.

579
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.180
And that is how you can build a movement in today's society moving faster than

580
00:39:14.171 --> 00:39:15.004
ever.

581
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.300
It is increasingly critical to stand out.

582
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.530
In fact,
standing out is no longer optional.

583
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.860
We need to find ways to make an impact

584
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.310
in an internet driven society.
There's a race to the bottle.

585
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.470
People are being commoditized.

586
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.900
They're looking for the lowest price option and we need to give employers and

587
00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:47.550
customers a reason to choose us specifically.

588
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.460
We have to find a way to stand out.

589
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:55.770
It doesn't mean that every single person has to be a world expert in something,

590
00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:01.700
but it does mean that whether it's in our company or in our department or in our

591
00:40:02.521 --> 00:40:06.510
community,
it's increasingly essential for us to ask,

592
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.380
what can I do that no one else can do?

593
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.770
What can I do better than anyone else?

594
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.980
How can I bring my unique experiences to bear on this problem or on this

595
00:40:21.061 --> 00:40:21.894
challenge?

596
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:27.480
We used to live in a world where what mattered most was how you were similar to

597
00:40:27.481 --> 00:40:31.230
everybody else.
Did you think the same way?
Did you tow the company line?

598
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.640
What matters most today is the differences you bring and the fact that you do

599
00:40:38.821 --> 00:40:43.350
see the world differently than everyone else.
That's the power of standing out.

600
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.820
Thank you very much.

601
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.600
Anyway,
now that I know that there actually is time for questions,

602
00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:58.070
I would love to take any or any of your comments if you would,
uh,

603
00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.220
if you would like to have them.

604
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.180
<v 3>Uh,
yeah.
You talked about,
um,</v>

605
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.220
how having a broad experience can help,
uh,

606
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.820
you come up with new and interesting ideas.

607
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.280
You also talked about finding a niche and diving deep.

608
00:41:11.281 --> 00:41:13.530
How do you sort of balance those two aspects?

609
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.880
<v 1>Fantastic question.</v>

610
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
How do you balance the distinction between going broad and drawing from all

611
00:41:20.131 --> 00:41:24.270
kinds of experiences and also niching down?
So number one,

612
00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:28.070
you don't necessarily have to do both.
You could choose either approaching,

613
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.870
either one,
could be a winning approach,
but let's,

614
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.150
let's say you wanted to do them both.
Um,
so I'm going to make up an example.

615
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:40.310
Let's say you work at Google and you have,

616
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.430
uh,
you have a special passion,
um,
all your life.

617
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:47.780
You have been a really serious jazz musician and that that's something that's

618
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.860
pretty distinct from everyone else here.
Um,
you know,
let's,
let's pretend,

619
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.760
so if that's the case,
um,
that would be drawing in those things.

620
00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:00.380
What can you do to niche down?
Let's say you decide,
I mean,

621
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:04.760
I know I'm within Google.
Uh,
one of the great things that I've heard from the,

622
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:08.000
the many friends that I have working in the company is that there's a lot of

623
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:11.420
opportunity for people to move around into different job roles,

624
00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:15.960
different offices.
Uh,
in a lot of ways,
um,
after rotations in,

625
00:42:15.961 --> 00:42:18.500
in certain areas,
you can sort of raise your hand and say,
Hey,

626
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:21.760
I'm interested in moving over here.
Maybe,
uh,

627
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.040
because of this background you have decided that there's a particular niche that

628
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:32.711
you might be able to dive deep on that you have a special relationship to let's

629
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:39.131
say wearable technology for musicians and how that could improve the sonic

630
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:43.700
experience.
Uh,
if they're wearing some whatever,
whatever.

631
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:48.080
And I don't know enough about either technology or music to be able to get more

632
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:49.130
specific than that,

633
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:54.310
but it's by bringing together the different elements of what excites you and

634
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:56.840
what's different.
We're,

635
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.660
because you're doing this digging and exploration,

636
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.930
you can start to see in the process of looking into it where there might be

637
00:43:05.451 --> 00:43:08.180
elements that could be helpful.
You could do the same thing with,
you know,

638
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:11.490
with running or sports or whatever.
But there's a,

639
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.560
there's places that you can go deep and because you have ties to that community

640
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.080
and a special understanding as a practitioner,
um,

641
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:24.920
you have immediately more credibility and probably more knowledge starting in on

642
00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:27.410
it.
They can give you an advantage when you niche down.

643
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.950
Does that answer your question?
Great,
thank you.
Hi.

644
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.993
<v 4>Hello.</v>

645
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:37.010
So how do you avoid the selection bias that comes with just looking at people

646
00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:42.011
who succeeded and then maybe something that most of them did is actually a thing

647
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:45.620
that most of the time doesn't work well for the people who do it,

648
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.410
but you're not looking at the people who didn't succeed.
So you don't know,

649
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.330
you know,
how do you avoid that issue?

650
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.880
<v 1>Fantastic question.
You don't is my answer.
I,</v>

651
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.100
one of my goals is a,

652
00:43:57.101 --> 00:44:02.020
I actually started my career as a journalist and so my ambition from the start

653
00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.021
was to,

654
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:07.720
to go deep and to tell interesting qualitative stories about the people who were

655
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.100
the most successful today.

656
00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:14.340
I agree with you entirely that a cross sectional study of,

657
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:19.030
uh,
of people who have succeeded,
people who have failed,
you know,

658
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:21.700
that sort of big picture,
you know,
big data.

659
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:24.190
Even maybe we can get Eric shot on it.
Uh,

660
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:29.370
look at success in failure today in a variety of fields would be a really

661
00:44:29.771 --> 00:44:33.060
interesting and worthy problem to tackle.

662
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.480
It was not the problem that I tackled.
However,
um,
for me,

663
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:38.590
I was really interested in,
uh,

664
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.470
in going deep and having a more qualitative view of some of the people that,

665
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.470
that I,
I think personally are pretty interesting.
If you,

666
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:49.290
if any of you guys follow a business literature,

667
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.390
I spoke with Dan Pink with uh,
Tom Peters,
with Robert Cialdini,

668
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.250
you know,
with David Allen as I mentioned,
uh,
with Seth Goden.
Uh,

669
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.660
so they were pretty,
uh,

670
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:04.710
pretty cool folks and then in other fields I also drew from them as well.

671
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:09.450
But great point.
Absolutely.
I was mostly trying to tell a different story.

672
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:11.423
Yes.

673
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.830
<v 5>All right,
thanks.
Thanks for your talk.
And uh,</v>

674
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.340
a lot of the factors that you point out,
I can sort of see in play when I,

675
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.830
when I look at some successful people,

676
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.910
but I'm interested in some factors that also seemed to often pop up that you

677
00:45:24.911 --> 00:45:27.740
didn't mention and curious where you fit them in.
Uh,

678
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.220
things that I often see pop up,
you know,
the role of luck.

679
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.310
You haven't mentioned with a couple of your people that,
you know,

680
00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:37.090
all of a sudden out of the blue,
there was the avian flu,
right?
And then bang,

681
00:45:37.091 --> 00:45:39.520
he was a superstar,
right?
So there's the role of luck.

682
00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.890
There's the role of not just your social network,

683
00:45:41.891 --> 00:45:44.290
but having likened the right people in your social network,
right?

684
00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:47.700
The powerful people,
the ones who actually make the key decisions.
Uh,

685
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.720
and finally there's a,
you know,

686
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.700
this dynamic that everybody else is trying to stand out too.
Right?

687
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.530
And so you're sort of in a sea of competition of everybody trying to stand out,

688
00:45:56.531 --> 00:46:01.330
which you sort of alluded to,
but beyond,
you know,
the general advice,

689
00:46:01.331 --> 00:46:02.890
like how do you pop out to the top of that?

690
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.680
So I don't know a lot of factors at play.
What do you think?

691
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.710
<v 1>Fantastic.
I love it.
So,
interestingly enough,</v>

692
00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:13.020
I actually have nearly a whole chapter on the role of luck in the book.
So,
uh,

693
00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.250
I hope you've,
uh,
you've been able to grab a coffee,

694
00:46:15.251 --> 00:46:18.900
but I'll tell you guys briefly,
luck is actually one of the,
uh,

695
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:22.120
the more interesting elements of this.
And one that,

696
00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.270
that oftentimes I actually closed the talk,
uh,
with,

697
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.950
so they're here and Cambridge actually very close to here.
Um,

698
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.330
there's a,
there's a venture capital firm called cue ball partners.

699
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:39.420
It's run by a guy named Anthony Chan and a and some of his partners a few years

700
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.740
ago,
they wrote a book called hearts smarts,
guts and luck.
Um,

701
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.600
it came out actually from,
from Harvard Business Review Press,

702
00:46:46.601 --> 00:46:51.050
which published my first book reinventing you.
And interestingly enough,
so they,

703
00:46:51.051 --> 00:46:52.720
they did a pretty wide ranging,

704
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:57.750
a study of entrepreneurs who had been successful and the broke people down into

705
00:46:59.051 --> 00:47:03.220
four personality types actually.
And you can even go to their website,

706
00:47:03.221 --> 00:47:06.640
they have something called the eat the entrepreneurial assessment test,

707
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.720
which is kind of fun to take.
And uh,

708
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:13.390
it shows you what your dominant personality type is.
The first three,

709
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:18.490
you know,
to me make fairly intuitive sense,
right?
Hearts driven,
smart,
striven,

710
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.443
guts driven.

711
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:24.510
We can all imagine scenarios where people are able to succeed because of those

712
00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:29.830
qualities.
The one there was a little bit more mystifying was luck driven.

713
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.300
What does that even mean?
But it turns out if you peel it back,

714
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.750
interestingly enough,
the research begins to show,
of course,

715
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:41.740
luck is something that we can only attribute post facto,
right?

716
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:45.730
You don't know in the moment that something is is lucky.
It's kind of like,
oh,

717
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:48.790
after it plays out,
how does it,
you know?
Then it becomes lucky.

718
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.310
What does it look like in the moment?
However,

719
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.760
it turns out that lucky entrepreneurs or top executives are people who actually

720
00:47:58.961 --> 00:48:03.490
have a different personality type than the other types of successful

721
00:48:03.491 --> 00:48:04.324
professionals.

722
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:09.510
They are typically more laid back and they exhibit in large quantities.

723
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:15.030
Two really important attributes that all of us can develop more of in our lives.

724
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.170
One is curiosity and the other is humility,

725
00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.220
and the reason that this plays in is so many of the people,

726
00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:28.990
so many of the successful professionals that they profiled,
they have a mission,

727
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:33.100
right?
Part of what makes them successful is they're so focused.
They say,

728
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:35.230
you know,
I'm going to go to this meeting and I'm going to,

729
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.960
I'm going to meet the head of marketing for Ford,

730
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.630
or I'm going to go to this meeting and I'm going to meet venture capitalists who

731
00:48:40.631 --> 00:48:45.190
will give me my series a funding,
or whatever it is.
But they have,

732
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.160
they have this idea in their head and if,

733
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.820
if they don't see things that look like they look like that,

734
00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:53.560
they will barrel through.

735
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:59.040
Whereas a lucky entrepreneur or executive is someone who is far more willing to

736
00:48:59.891 --> 00:49:03.430
just sit back and say,
oh,
this person seems interesting.
I'll talk to them.

737
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.950
And they wait and they see how it plays out and they have the conversation and

738
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:11.650
they are curious enough to want to learn about that person.

739
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:16.890
And they are humble enough to realize that they have something to learn from

740
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:18.214
that person.

741
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.810
And years later that is what plays out and turns to luck.

742
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:24.190
So I think that's,

743
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.760
that's one of the coolest things that I learned from that book.

744
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:29.680
And from that research research.
Uh,

745
00:49:29.681 --> 00:49:34.450
also Richard Weisman is a psychologist who's done a lot of research into luck.

746
00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.830
Um,
one suggestion that he has,
which you guys can apply if you're interested.

747
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:43.930
There's a factor that,
you know,
that comes into play with almost all humans,

748
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:48.931
which is that we really tend to be drawn to people who are like us.

749
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.310
You know,
this is,
this is natural.

750
00:49:51.311 --> 00:49:55.420
It's not necessarily good in terms of diversity or innovation or whatever.

751
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:59.500
And so Richard Wiseman actually talked about somebody that he interviewed,
um,

752
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.370
and this guy,

753
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.120
the way that he broke out of that is that he made a rule for himself.

754
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:06.730
If he was going to a networking event or a cocktail party,

755
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.200
that he would pick a color in advance and he would only talk to people wearing

756
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:16.180
that color so that he would be forced to choose different people than he might

757
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:21.100
normally to talk to.
And that's a way to increase our luck.
So I think,

758
00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:25.000
uh,
you know,
it's a really rich topic.
I,

759
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:28.250
let's talk more afterwards about your other points,
but,
uh,
I love him.

760
00:50:28.251 --> 00:50:31.610
Really good questions,
man.
What's a,
what was your question or comment?

761
00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.690
<v 6>Thank you very much for this talk.
It's,
it's really great information.</v>

762
00:50:34.691 --> 00:50:39.190
So I'm just following up on something you just said about being flexible and

763
00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.600
open.
Um,
which is kind of a natural way that I approach things.

764
00:50:43.601 --> 00:50:47.420
But when you first said earlier about being deliberate,
I said,
ah,

765
00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:48.670
that's what I need to introduce.

766
00:50:48.671 --> 00:50:53.671
So how do you reconcile being flexible and seeing what's out there and allowing

767
00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:57.260
yourself to see the possibilities was being deliberate and actually moving in a

768
00:50:57.261 --> 00:50:58.420
direction that you want to go?

769
00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:03.070
<v 1>Yeah,
so it's,
it's an important question and you know,
in many ways it's,</v>

770
00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:07.280
it's similar to the,
you know,
going wide versus going narrow.
Um,

771
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:12.220
I would say in general,
we can choose to play to our strengths,

772
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:16.750
whatever our strength is.
However,
there is a way to bring them together.
I mean,

773
00:51:16.751 --> 00:51:21.550
certainly in terms of a lot of the,
uh,
the career research that I do,
um,
you know,

774
00:51:21.551 --> 00:51:25.930
one piece of advice that I would give to,
uh,
to the professionals that,
uh,

775
00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:30.760
that I counsel and work with in my consulting business is have a plan,
you know,

776
00:51:30.761 --> 00:51:33.160
have a,
but treated as a hypothesis.

777
00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:37.420
It's something that you're moving toward so that you are moving towards

778
00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:41.530
something so that you have some degree of forward momentum but don't allow it to

779
00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:42.490
lock you in.

780
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:47.200
If you see something over to the side that is better or is more interesting or

781
00:51:47.201 --> 00:51:50.920
something that you literally just could not have predicted because you couldn't

782
00:51:50.921 --> 00:51:55.921
have even seen it until you reached the halfway point in your march toward that

783
00:51:56.051 --> 00:51:59.700
new thing,
then feel free to veer off and go do that.
Um,

784
00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:04.690
but always have something that at least provisionally you're working toward so

785
00:52:04.691 --> 00:52:08.800
that you're able to enjoy the benefits of forward momentum and seeing things

786
00:52:08.801 --> 00:52:11.800
from new vistas that you previously wouldn't have been able to.

787
00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:13.760
<v 7>Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

788
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.780
<v 8>So my question is about</v>

789
00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:19.943
<v 7>mmm.</v>

790
00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:25.490
<v 8>Doing like promoting an idea on your own like through a startup versus taking</v>

791
00:52:27.091 --> 00:52:29.460
advantage of the momentum of being a place like Google.

792
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:32.730
So say if you think about like,
I dunno,
self driving cars,
right?

793
00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:37.710
Like the reason why Google can make such awesome self driving cars as compared

794
00:52:37.711 --> 00:52:42.090
to say the ones that you see prototype and academia is because Google just has

795
00:52:42.091 --> 00:52:45.630
more data and they have more people and they have more resources.

796
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.060
They have more of everything.
Right.
And infrastructure.

797
00:52:48.061 --> 00:52:52.440
And so like if I wanted to,
if I have like it's awesome idea.

798
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:57.360
Did you see anything about whether it makes more sense for me to try to like

799
00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.490
build up a startup on my own and own the idea to give it credibility so then I

800
00:53:02.491 --> 00:53:07.491
can you make it something just something huge or sell it or is it more practical

801
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.790
to try to pitch it to a company earlier,
but then how,

802
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.530
how do you build credibility around the idea instead of having somebody just

803
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:19.920
toss it on the back burner?
So I guess like going,

804
00:53:19.921 --> 00:53:22.110
you're on your own versus working with a big company.

805
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:26.700
<v 1>Yeah,
really important.
So there's actually a couple of questions at play.</v>

806
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.720
One is the personal branding question,
you know,

807
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:34.730
how do you get known and get credibility as being the driving force behind a

808
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:35.790
certain idea.

809
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:41.060
And then the other is the question of where is the best home for that idea in

810
00:53:42.961 --> 00:53:47.640
terms of operationalizing it and actually making sure that it has the resources

811
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:52.400
necessary to be successful.
Um,
you know,
it's in,
uh,
in,

812
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:57.690
you know,
the silicon valley ecosystem.
Aqua hires are a big thing now where,

813
00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:01.350
uh,
they,
you know,
companies as you guys well know,
um,
you know,

814
00:54:01.351 --> 00:54:05.850
large companies will snap up a smaller company because they want the development

815
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:09.750
talent and they will shut her the projects with impunity and say,
okay,

816
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.440
now you're okay.
Fella's now you're working on this.
And uh,

817
00:54:13.441 --> 00:54:18.390
and that's a real thing.
Um,
so I think that in a technical sense about,

818
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:21.390
you know,
what is necessary for the success of an idea.

819
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.260
I think that it's important to keep in mind a few things.
Number one,

820
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:29.280
is it feasible to do the idea on your own?
Sometimes,

821
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:34.281
literally it's not because you need to have a data or access to other resources

822
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.810
that only a big company could provide.

823
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:41.040
If you realize that in three months or six months or a year,

824
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:44.940
you are going to be hitting a wall that you can't surmount because you literally

825
00:54:44.941 --> 00:54:47.670
don't have access to the tools you need,

826
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.930
then it probably does fundamentally need to be done within the confines of a

827
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:55.650
larger system.
Um,
if you,
uh,

828
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.290
if you do decide to partner with a company a,

829
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:02.160
then it's a question of making sure that you have a contracts and legal

830
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:06.900
protections as much as you possibly can that validate that this idea is not

831
00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:11.310
going to be shuttered and that you have a ways of protecting it and keeping it

832
00:55:11.311 --> 00:55:14.700
as an ongoing concern perhaps with a,
you know,

833
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:18.150
a sort of special mandate when it comes to your personal brand.

834
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:21.190
One of the things that I'll advise and I'll just wrap up because we're,

835
00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:26.010
we're getting the,
uh,
the,
the curtain warning care a momentarily.
But,

836
00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:26.844
uh,

837
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:31.880
one of the things that I think is important for all of us to be aware of is the

838
00:55:32.971 --> 00:55:37.520
amazing resource that is content creation.
Um,
sometimes I,

839
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.120
people come to me and they said,
well,
you know,

840
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:43.230
I have these great ideas but I don't want to talk about him because someone

841
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.560
might steal them.
And you know,

842
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:50.820
you hear this a lot from people and you know,
so my asterisk on this,
okay,
sure,

843
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:55.680
if you have this amazing patentable engineering innovation,
great,

844
00:55:55.681 --> 00:55:58.500
go patent it.
Go do that.
Go protect that first.

845
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.240
But if you have an idea and it's an idea about the nature of leadership or

846
00:56:03.241 --> 00:56:07.200
something like that,
you can't patent it and the,

847
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.270
but it doesn't go anywhere.

848
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.810
If you don't talk about it is they're going to be a risk that someone might

849
00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:13.920
steal it.
Maybe.

850
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:19.070
But I will tell you the very best insurance against it is for you to be

851
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:23.710
everywhere talking about it.
Because if I came to you and hey,

852
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.460
I have a really great idea for a book about women's empowerment,

853
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:32.020
it's called lean in,
you would laugh in my face and you'd say,
Oh,

854
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.990
I think that had been done by Sheryl Sandberg,
Dory.

855
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.820
And it doesn't go any further.
Everyone knows that's her idea.

856
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:45.060
And so the antidote to anyone stealing your ideas or your idea dying for that

857
00:56:46.001 --> 00:56:48.670
matter is to get the word out.

858
00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:51.520
And so I would say if you want to be known and associated for something,

859
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.540
go nuts with blogging,
with content creation,
being out there,

860
00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:59.470
touting it so that your name is almost inextricably entwined with it.

861
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:03.370
And in that way,
whether you get acquired partner with somebody or not,

862
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.390
you're going to be known as the goto person behind that idea.

863
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.820
So thank you so much for your question.

864
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:13.090
Thank you everybody for having me and have a great day.
Thanks.
