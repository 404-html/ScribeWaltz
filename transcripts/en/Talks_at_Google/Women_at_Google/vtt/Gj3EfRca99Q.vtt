1
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.350
Please give a warm welcome to today's speaker,
a designer and Gardner,

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.970
the Ionic Cornelius.

3
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.130
<v 0>You're very welcome to my talk on dream gardens.</v>

4
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:24.410
I'm absolutely delighted to be here.
Um,
it's a really a real honor.
Um,

5
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.831
I have to admit,

6
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:29.370
I've never actually given this talk to a group of people that may or may not

7
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:30.390
have an interest in gardens.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.540
So it's always been like garden festivals and you know,

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.470
kind of garden design courses and things like that.
So,
um,

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.630
over the past week or so I've been kind of going,
oh my God,

11
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.510
how am I going to make these guys not fall asleep?
Um,
and how,

12
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.290
how do we make it relevant to what you guys actually do?
Um,

13
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.230
and it actually got me thinking about the overlap,
um,

14
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.240
and the core of what we do as designers,
as people that offer a service.

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.120
Um,
and um,
really what kind of I could of,

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
what kind of boil down to for me was that we offer an experience and we provide

17
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:03.504
an experience.

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
And that's something that's really important to me because I'm really interested

19
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:12.300
in,
in people and in how people experience a space,
a garden,
um,

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.530
how they walk into it and feel like from an emotional point of view.

21
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.240
Um,
and I think that's,

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.870
that has a lot of kind of overlap with what you guys do because what you're

23
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:25.610
providing is an online,
a virtual experience.
And um,

24
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610
the overlap there is that if it doesn't feel good and if it doesn't feel right,

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.840
the user has gone immediately.
So same thing in a garden.

26
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.070
If it's a badly designed space,
um,

27
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.610
and it's not natural to move through and feels good,

28
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.280
these are just never going to actually go out into their space.
You know,

29
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:44.590
you can't move around a space if it doesn't circulate well,
et Cetera.

30
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.880
So there's a lot of kinds of similarities and core principles that overlap.

31
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
So within the virtual experience and the tangible,
the garden,

32
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.230
we have a lot of overlaps,
like making a space or an experience,

33
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.460
the experience more usable,
a more inspiring,
more accessible,

34
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.720
more forward thinking.

35
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:07.410
Probably more so for you guys then in my role as a garden designer.

36
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:11.460
But having said that,
there's so much you can do to think ahead.
Um,

37
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.500
even in garden design,
sustainability,
et Cetera,
um,
more beautiful and,
um,

38
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.000
obviously more joyful.
And by that I mean that you either go,

39
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.890
you go onto webpage and it feels good or you go into a garden and it feels good.

40
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.560
And there's a huge amount of that in the book,
um,

41
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.710
in how you experience a space and how it makes you feel.

42
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.800
And that's always something I've been interested in because my mom is a

43
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.090
psychotherapist.
Um,
so we've always kind of talk things to absolute death,

44
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.500
um,
and it kind of bled into my work as well.
Um,

45
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:45.450
so the talk in a way,
I mean,

46
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:48.060
there's plenty of garden stuff there and most of it is gardens,

47
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.450
but it's not just about gardens,
it's about,
um,

48
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:56.100
it's about people and about experiences and about emotional reactions to spaces.

49
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.310
Um,
so for today's garden design talk,

50
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.110
the talk is about you because you guys are actually the clients in this

51
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.840
situation.
So I want you to think,
right,

52
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.930
I want to design something in this and come away with something that can

53
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.820
actually be used in your own spaces.

54
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:17.821
So whether you have a balcony or a little patio or a huge field or some,

55
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.400
uh,
friends,
um,
space that you want to think about,

56
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.850
it's worth kind of thinking about us as we go along.

57
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.760
And maybe just having something to take away from it that really inspires you.

58
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.460
So,
um,

59
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.080
the most important thing I think is when I go into somebody's space is who is

60
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:35.914
that person?

61
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.700
So I kind of try and leave my ego at the door when I go into somebody's space

62
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.830
and it's all about that person.

63
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:45.730
So in this instance is about you and you need to think about who am I?
Um,

64
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.710
you know,
if you're thinking about designing a garden,

65
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.600
outdoor space for yourselves,
how do I live?
How do I spend my day in the garden?

66
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.240
And that's often it's thought about,
but it's not given enough attention.
Um,

67
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.290
so what you're thinking about is what do you like,
what's your lifestyle?

68
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:07.120
How do you spend time in the garden?
Um,
you know,
who,
who are you on a,

69
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.770
on a personal level?
Do you have kids,
pets?
Um,
do you read write sports?

70
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.280
So they're all incredibly important elements to consider when you go about

71
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.640
designing any kind of a space because that's kind of who you are from a

72
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:22.960
lifestyle perspective.
But when I started writing my book,
um,

73
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.350
I kind of realized that a lot of garden design books go straight into that.

74
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.450
And yes,
that's really important,

75
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.440
but there's something else which is really important.
Um,

76
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.950
and which often does get completely forgotten about and that's your dreams for

77
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:40.120
the space.
And a few people were like,
oh,
you have dreams.
You know,
why,

78
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.270
why do you have to dream and all that?
You can just say,
I want that Nice Garden.

79
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.720
And again,
probably because my mom's a psychotherapist,

80
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.910
I like to take that step back and just think,
no,

81
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.910
it's good to dream and it's good to,
um,

82
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.790
open your mind before you start going into detail and into functions and clothes

83
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:58.210
lines and compost bins and all of that stuff,

84
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:01.180
which has nothing to do with dreams.
It's just practical and function.

85
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.600
So in this instance,
your dreams are your,

86
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.720
your vision of your perfect space.

87
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.610
So gardens are intensely personal.
Um,
just like interior design,

88
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:17.050
is there part of you,
part of your home in the,
in the best scenario,

89
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.760
they're extensions of your living space.

90
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.870
And that's why I think it's really important to kind of go into that in a little

91
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:27.340
bit of detail,
um,
before you start looking at practicalities and functions and,

92
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.560
um,
things like that.
So there are different from your functional requirements,

93
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.420
um,
because they're personal and they're made up of memories of,
you know,

94
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.080
times you spent in gardens where you felt amazing,
um,
or just,

95
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.471
you know,

96
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.380
say your grandmother's garden where you have a memory of personal connection to

97
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.440
the past or to,
to people.
Um,

98
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.470
so there's a lot more to it than just dreaming up a nice little space.

99
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.860
But one massive thing,
even if you have a balcony,
even if you have a very small,

100
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.970
one thing I always say is at this stage dream big.
Um,

101
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.860
and I know you're not going to have the Taj Mahal on your balcony or you know,

102
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.010
in a small patio space,
but you can take elements of your,

103
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.180
the biggest dream that you can possibly have and condense those elements down.

104
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.980
Um,
there is an exercise in my book which is called a dream,
uh,

105
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.090
gardens diagram,

106
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.080
which is just based around identifying what it is you love about that.

107
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.700
So if you were looking at that and you know,

108
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.040
that was the space that you choose for the exercise,

109
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.510
then you can zoom in on certain areas and say,
well,
I love the symmetry.

110
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:36.230
I love the detail of the filigree filigree work.
I love the planting,

111
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.830
I love the water,
the reflections,
the cam,
whatever it is.

112
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:44.750
You can pull all those together and they can become your concept.
Um,

113
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:48.920
so at this stage there are no limits.
And again,

114
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.710
like every time I go into somebody's space,
they start going,
okay,

115
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.050
and now I need the patty,
or now I need that and you know,

116
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:57.650
I need to circulation route to here and I always have to stop people and go,
no,

117
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.330
just go back to,
you know,

118
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.240
be completely mad for awhile before you start getting practical.
So there,

119
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.690
there is no,
there are no limits to this stage.
Just Dreaming Up,
you know,

120
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.250
your perfect space.
Um,
I never know why I include this one,

121
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:16.370
but for some reason it always makes me zoom out of base in my own head.

122
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.640
So I've left it in just for the sake of kind of underlining that idea of zooming

123
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:26.930
out and not getting into the nitty gritty of,
um,
of detail at this point.

124
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.740
So the exercise that I have in the book,
um,

125
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.630
is really based on just a memory of a place where you were really,
really happy.

126
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.380
So thinking of,

127
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.790
of a garden that you visited or a memory that you have of having been in a

128
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:44.270
garden and it doesn't even need to be,
you know,
perfectly designed,

129
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:48.890
it can be completely wild meadows scape or anything like that.
Um,

130
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.120
and,
um,

131
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.050
you basically what you're doing is you're thinking about what made that space

132
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:58.010
feel so good to you.
Why was it,
why did you have a personal connection to it?

133
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.150
Um,
you know,
was it the phone was at the cemetery,
the wildness of drama.

134
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:03.500
So each space,

135
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.770
and that's something you guys can do later on if you want or take the books home

136
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:10.760
and it's,
it's all kind of outlined in that too.
And it's a really good,

137
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:12.770
it sounds like a very simple exercise,

138
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:17.720
but it's a really good way of allowing yourself to not design before you design.

139
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.500
So just going,
oh,
I love that space.
I,
I really enjoyed that space.

140
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.120
So this is my one.
Um,
unless somebody else wants to give me one.

141
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.970
It's,
um,
I love the Alhambra in the south of Spain,
which is an amazing,

142
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.680
absolutely amazing garden.
Um,
and palace.
And there morrish gardens,

143
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:40.160
they're really symmetrical but yet the planting is really wild and free.

144
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:41.630
So I love that combination of that,

145
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.050
those kind of the perfect architecture and then the wild planting.

146
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.190
So for me it was,
you know,
the timeless feel of at the balance,
the water,

147
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:51.920
the wild planting,
the harmony.
And this is the exercise.

148
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:55.250
What you're doing is a simple sketch,
a spider diagram,

149
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.920
and you're putting the characteristics of the space above and the moods below.

150
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.350
So the moods of this space actually become your concept of your garden design.

151
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.400
So you need to think,
right,
that's what I want to bring to my own space.

152
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.940
And even if it is a balcony,
you know,
there's balance,
there's calm,

153
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.080
you want to feel at ease,
you want to feel happier,
you want to feel freer.
If,

154
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.280
say you went for a meadow that you felt incredibly happy in an a memory that you

155
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.340
have,
there's so many ways of bringing elements of a meadow,

156
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.390
the movement of the grasses,
uh,
looking at the wide open sky,

157
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.480
why not try and create something that kind of emulates that feel?

158
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:34.080
Even if it is a tiny balcony year,
um,
a small patio.

159
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.830
So really that's just about taking those and bringing them into your concept.

160
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.920
So for me it was the Alhambra,
um,

161
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.060
creating a calm space inspired by,
um,

162
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.940
by a morrish palace.
Yet the planting is wild,

163
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.750
so there's not too much perfection going on,
which you know,

164
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.360
can become boring and you're never going to actually be able to achieve and

165
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:01.800
maintain.
Anyway.
Um,
so that's your new found concept.

166
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.870
So that was my scenario there.

167
00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:08.760
Cam Space inspired by the Alhambra Gardens in Spain with wild natural planting,

168
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.070
plenty of water at a timeless feel.
So really simple,

169
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.380
but there's so many elements than that you can choose,

170
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.000
pick out and build into your design.
So that informs your materials,

171
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:19.980
your colors,
your water features.

172
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.120
It's easy then because I think a lot of people don't know where to start.

173
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.740
So this is a great way of kind of identifying a concept and then going right,

174
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.490
the paving I need to get needs to match that feel and the water needs to match

175
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:35.850
that and everything needs to follow that field and underlying that.

176
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.660
And then a concept and a garden works naturally and it's not disjointed.

177
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.900
So the next part is,
um,
form follows function,
which was,
uh,

178
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.680
which Louis Sullivan said.
And um,

179
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.840
as you guys know,
if you know,
within the,
the,
uh,
the Internet,

180
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.540
you go into a page,
it doesn't work.
You're gone immediately.

181
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.190
So the same thing applies to a badly designed garden.
If it's badly designed,

182
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:06.240
if it doesn't work,
nevermind the look or the,
you know,
the beauty or of whatever,

183
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.300
it can be beautiful.
But if it doesn't work,
it's annoying and you're,

184
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.800
you just don't want to be in this space.

185
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.640
So basically our gardens from a tangible perspective are,

186
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.670
are there spaces for living and they need to work.
It's really simple.

187
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.060
And a,
the first thing I get my clients to do is do out list.
And I'm sorry,

188
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.410
the second thing,
after dreaming,

189
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.420
get them to do a list of how they spend their day in the garden.

190
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.040
So basically how they,
the most boring stuff,
I hang my washing out,
you know,

191
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:41.580
the dog goes around,
the kids,
go to the trampoline,
all of those kinds of things.

192
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.750
Um,
but also to,
to say I like to entertain,

193
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.720
so it'd be nice to have a pool to dangle our legs and et cetera.

194
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.130
That's also the bloom garden this year dangling our leg.

195
00:11:51.131 --> 00:11:53.410
So I had to include that.
Um,

196
00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.060
so that's just really an idea of what your day looks like in the garden and all

197
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:04.360
the things the garden needs to,
to um,
function for you.
Like,

198
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.510
so the functions of the garden and then the list of functional requirements.

199
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.330
That's it.
Basically,
really simple,
really easy.

200
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.890
List out everything you need in the actual garden.

201
00:12:15.891 --> 00:12:18.790
And it doesn't need to be super detailed,

202
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.760
but you need this because the next step is putting it onto paper.

203
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.290
And when you put it onto paper,

204
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.390
you need to tick off each and every single one of those.

205
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:28.450
And if one of them is missing,
then the garden's not going to work 100%.

206
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.050
So that was a client of mine and Strand and sluggo.
Um,

207
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.080
the job was kind of half done.
The builders still onsite,
the dog,

208
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.880
which they weren't supposed to have a dog.

209
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:42.820
The whole garden was based around them not having kids or a dog.

210
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.200
They now have a child underdog.
Um,
and he destroyed the garden.

211
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.970
But this was before we did the garden.
Um,
and you can see it's,

212
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.150
there's nothing there and it's,
it looks horrendous.
The house is getting there.

213
00:12:55.151 --> 00:13:00.070
Everything is brilliant,
but a lot of spaces that you see,
um,

214
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.360
you have to assess really,
really well in order to get the design right.

215
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.410
So you're looking at everything from soil samples aspect,

216
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:13.210
garden climbers probably pretty boring at this stage,
but it's so important.

217
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:15.800
So even if you have like a small balcony,
um,

218
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.770
you need to make sure that you address things like wind privacy views,
um,

219
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:25.000
you know,
to,
to make sure you don't make any mistakes and then end up with,

220
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.301
you know,

221
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:28.740
the neighbor right there looking in at you even though you wanted this enclosed

222
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.280
private haven.
So they're all things you need to list out at the very start.

223
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.930
Obviously for bigger sites that gets a lot more complicated and you need to put

224
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:38.541
in more detail.

225
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:42.400
Sometimes we get surveyors in because it's too detailed to do with slopes and

226
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:44.890
all that kind of stuff.
But for small spaces,
it's,

227
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.240
it's relatively easy to do the Ma,
the main thing,
common sense,
you know,

228
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:51.960
you're looking at views.
Um,
does it have lights?

229
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:56.440
So you're looking at the strengths of the space,
um,
and how can you enhance them.

230
00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.580
That's really important.
And then you're also looking at the challenges.

231
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:05.410
So you can see the two there.
Um,
all the guard,

232
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:10.300
we do a show called Archie Super Garden and pretty much all the garden we go

233
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:15.120
into,
um,
look like that,
you know,
absolute disasters and you know,

234
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.210
after the show leaves then their pet,
yeah,
right.

235
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:24.190
Five weeks later,
blood,
sweat and tears.
But,
um,
yeah,
I,
you know,

236
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:25.420
that's actually the joy of it.
Anyway,

237
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:29.700
it's television and transformation and we all love that.
Um,
but as I said,

238
00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:31.240
nothing is unsolvable.
Um,

239
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.290
and the main thing is having that vision and the dream for what is to come.

240
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.860
And I think some people find that easier than others.
Um,

241
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.210
to imagine like my mom cannot imagine what a garden will look like.

242
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:47.800
She's like,
how can you even visualize how,
you know,
how,
how it will be.

243
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.700
Um,
probably,
yeah,
probably cause I studied boss,
you know,
it's,

244
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:57.320
um,
so yeah,
it's all about building on strengths and overcoming challenges,
um,

245
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.670
in guiding in guidance and garden design.
Um,
side measurements.

246
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.260
I touched on that briefly,
just there.

247
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.570
It can be incredibly complicated and it can be very,

248
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:09.230
very simple to just doing a scaled sketch,
putting in your sizes,

249
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:12.490
your heights and where the entrance exit,
uh,

250
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.090
where the pathways are and in the first thing is getting the site right,

251
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.900
doing a very simple scale sketch and exploring what,

252
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.280
what's happening on the site.

253
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.550
So I'm not going to go into big detail because that is actually boring.
Um,

254
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.910
but it's good to know and it's detailed in the book as well.

255
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.370
Just to know that that's how you have to start.

256
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.900
If you want to take on a plot of any considerable size,
um,
which actually it's,

257
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.350
you know,
that's kind of a realistic large city garden,

258
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.233
um,

259
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.870
that you could kind of measure out yourself as opposed to getting somebody in to

260
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:49.400
do it for you.
Um,
so after that comes the functional layer plan,

261
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.640
which is basically taking the functions.

262
00:15:51.641 --> 00:15:55.320
So what the garden has to do for you on plonking them on the plan.
Um,

263
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.490
and they're bubbles,
they're not designed,
they're not beautiful,

264
00:15:58.491 --> 00:15:59.450
they're not details.

265
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.810
They're basically sketched bubbles telling you exactly what happens on site.

266
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:09.110
So where you need privacy,
where you want a patio,
where you want,

267
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.450
um,
screening where you need to wind screen.

268
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.830
So all the things that you looked at that were challenges need to be addressed

269
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:18.560
on this in a bubble.
So it doesn't need to represent the shape or anything.

270
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.830
So it's actually really easy to do.
Um,
and it,

271
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.760
but it's so informative to when you start going to sketch detail and you start

272
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:28.190
putting in,
um,
details in the,
in it.

273
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.670
So that brings me to the bigger picture.
Great design quite far away from the,

274
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:39.050
the bubbles.
Um,
this is one of my favorite pictures.
Um,
it's Tom Stewart Smith.

275
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:41.570
He's a UK based designer and um,

276
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.980
it's just such a beautiful picture because it shows how a garden can blend into

277
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:50.870
the landscape beyond without,
it just feels like it's a part of the landscape.
Um,

278
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.300
and I'll go back to that in a minute.
So what makes good design?

279
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.620
Um,
and are we born designers?
It's an,

280
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.080
it's an interesting question because I don't think we're necessarily born

281
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:05.630
designers.
Some people are better at it than others,

282
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.010
but it's definitely something you can learn.
Um,
what does help,

283
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.970
and I'm sure a lot of you guys are designed based or from design backgrounds,

284
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.610
um,
so you'd be aware of a lot of these principles,
um,

285
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.300
and the fact that they do kind of influence everything from car designed to
Penn,

286
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:27.140
designed to,
you know,
everything has those principles.
And again,

287
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:30.440
it goes back to what,
what works and functions.

288
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:33.560
It goes back to the principles of,
um,
these four.

289
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.880
And then another one I'll talk about after the first one would look at briefly

290
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:42.160
is the unity and harmony.
And we'll talk about it just in the garden setting,
um,

291
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.650
and how it works with the house,
the garden and the setting.

292
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:46.970
And that's the picture I showed you before.

293
00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:50.310
This is the same one in winter at the bottom.
Um,
again,

294
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:54.750
Tom Stewart Smith and the top one too.
Um,
and it just shows how,

295
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.690
um,
how the house,
first of all is linked with the garden.

296
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.450
You can see the colors the has picked up on the red brick,

297
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:03.240
the grasses and the water in the sizes.

298
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:07.050
So you've got a connection between the house and the garden,
the design space.

299
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.520
And then beyond that you have a connection of the design garden with the

300
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:14.850
landscape beyond.
So in the landscape beyond,
for example,

301
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:18.780
you've got darker spots of the big trees and Tom's brought that into the

302
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:23.310
foreground of,
um,
of the garden by having darker shapes,

303
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.760
the topiary shapes in the front,
and then the lighter pawns,

304
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:28.740
which are kind of echo what's going on behind.

305
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.150
So that creates unity and harmony because you're blending all of that together.

306
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.170
Um,
simplicity.

307
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.670
I mean the pros and gardens are a huge influence for me and I think are a great

308
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:46.200
example of simplicity.
Less is more.
And I think that really applies to,

309
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.910
um,
you know,
online as well.
There's so much being chucked at you all the time.

310
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.770
Um,
that it's really nice to have a calm,
simple design sometimes.

311
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.311
You know,

312
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:59.730
there's nothing more I like more than looking at a website that's just like,
ah,

313
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.210
Cam,
not too many ads,
not too many things being thrown at you,
you know.

314
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.450
But of course there has to be a balance,

315
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.200
which brings me to know it's a sweet,
it should bring me to balance.
Really,

316
00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:14.430
we use scale and proportion.
Um,

317
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.590
so really same thing as the links between the house and the setting and the

318
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:23.130
views beyond,
uh,
the garden.
It's the relationship between the house.

319
00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:26.640
So you don't want the house to be absolutely gigantic and person to feel really

320
00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:28.170
small.
Same thing.
The planting.

321
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.550
So the trees can't be tiny and the house really big or vice versa.

322
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.890
So there's gotta be a relationship between everything that's happening in the

323
00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:37.410
space,
the landscape beyond,

324
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.450
and then also obviously the house and the person because we can't forget that

325
00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:45.360
it's you that's experiencing that space.

326
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

327
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.030
<v 0>On the best way of doing that is to start sketching or,</v>

328
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:54.860
or thinking in three d as opposed to two d flat way.
There's Alice,

329
00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.260
um,
there's balance.
Um,

330
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.550
so balance is really all about everything coming together in a pleasing

331
00:20:03.551 --> 00:20:07.340
composition.
Um,
and there's so much that,
that work that,

332
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.830
that comes into that from all the other things we looked at scale and
proportion.

333
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.910
Um,
it's,

334
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.720
it's actually really easy to get balance right when you have a symmetrical

335
00:20:16.721 --> 00:20:20.440
garden.
So the likes of the law Hambro if you take that as inspiration,

336
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.550
it's quite easy to get it right because you've got that in here at symmetry was

337
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.180
if you kind of push it to being asymmetrical,
the,
the design,

338
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.240
it does get a little bit harder because you need to make sure you get the

339
00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:34.360
balance of the forms,
the shapes,
the sizes and all of that.
Right?

340
00:20:34.361 --> 00:20:38.590
So it does get a little bit trickier.
You'd also have mystery,

341
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:43.030
excitement,
light and darkness,
uh,
balance and color.
Um,

342
00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.760
and structures also need to be balanced.

343
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.780
So there are great ways I think to start.
Um,
looking at design,
I don't know how,

344
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.160
how,
what percentage of you guys are designed based,
um,

345
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.540
or have a background in design.
So I should've probably asked that at the start.

346
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.120
I'm sure you're aware of,
of some of these are most of these.
Um,
but they're,

347
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:06.550
they're a great thing to even,
even if you do know on,

348
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:10.000
you're aware of them to make sure your mind yourself off on our kind of regular

349
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:13.210
basis.
The other thing that,
um,

350
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.960
that I always find fascinating to look at is the golden ratio.
And again,

351
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.180
you're probably all aware of it.
Um,

352
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.980
but I find it quite interesting in garden design because you're looking at

353
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:27.490
nature to inform nature.
So,
you know,
from,

354
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.960
from ferns on the way they grow to,
um,
you know,

355
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:34.090
succulents.
There was actually a garden at Chelsea,

356
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:37.930
which is based all around the mathematics of geometry.
Um,

357
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.620
which had the meant on the right there had a lot of those kinds of shapes.

358
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:46.510
And forms on the mathematics behind it are just like,
I,
I don't do maths.

359
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.750
To me it's absolutely baffling,
but it's incredible.

360
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.600
It's really inspiring to look at and to apply to projects,

361
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.290
um,
on the fact that,
um,
it's also founded our bodies and the fact that,
you know,

362
00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:03.070
repeats and it's just,
it's incredible.
It's,
it's,
I find it really,

363
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:06.790
really interesting that when you clench your fist,
it forms into a perfect,
uh,

364
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.470
golden ratio curl,
but that can inform,
that does and can inform,

365
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.130
um,
a huge amount of design.

366
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.470
And I very cheekily stuck it on top of Google.

367
00:22:17.471 --> 00:22:19.780
So I don't know if that actually does,
but it kind of works.

368
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.130
But it works in garden design,
the apple logo.
So that's,

369
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:27.160
I'm car design and everything.
It kind of influences everything.

370
00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:30.580
And the reason for that is really because we're using,

371
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.200
one is inherently found in nature and that's informing design.
So it's kind of,

372
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.490
it's an interesting cycle.

373
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.760
So the next thing is I'm choosing shapes for the garden.

374
00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:45.700
So we've gone and looked at the functions of the garden and putting that in in

375
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:47.220
bubbles.
Um,

376
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.400
and how it works in how we make sure everything is included that you want and

377
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:55.010
need in a garden.
And the next bit is,
um,

378
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.820
how to actually put that into a plan that you can work from.
And um,

379
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.300
personally I,

380
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.740
I go through the same thing and I recognize this couple of years ago and I went,

381
00:23:05.741 --> 00:23:08.500
oh,
okay,
that's what's happening.
I go through the same kind of

382
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.970
problem every time I have a design job,
I started off going,

383
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.970
this is going to be amazing.
It's going to be such a good project.

384
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.670
And then I started sketching and I start doing stuff and I'm like,
oh my God,

385
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:20.710
it's going to be a disaster.
It's going to be horrendous.

386
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.820
The client's going to hate us.

387
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.720
And then I start doing more on it and force myself through that and I come at

388
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:28.540
the other end to go,
okay,
it's going to be fine.
It'll be great,
it'll be good.

389
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.360
So I think a huge amount of people go through that.

390
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:35.380
I think designers in general always go through that kind of stage of self doubt.

391
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.630
And the hardest part is actually this,

392
00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:42.400
which is for me personally is putting the shapes and making decisions as opposed

393
00:23:42.401 --> 00:23:46.330
to just messing and playing.
So,
um,

394
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.240
I was happy when I learned that it is actually very easy to do that.

395
00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:51.380
Basically you take the,

396
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.760
the functional layer plan with the bubbles and you sketch over that with um,

397
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.540
with uh,

398
00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:01.540
either a layout paper or tracing paper and you just explore the shapes based on

399
00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:04.040
what you have from those bubbles because you know,

400
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:07.550
you want the patio at the back door because that's where you want to go from the

401
00:24:07.551 --> 00:24:10.670
kitchen where the door is.
So,
you know,
you want it there,

402
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:12.050
you just need to decide on shapes.

403
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.880
You need to decide how they link to each other.

404
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.270
So you've already made a lot of decisions without knowing it.

405
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.560
You've placed the patio where it wants to go.
You've put the,
um,
the,

406
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:24.710
the trampoline where you can see the kids from the kitchen.
You know,

407
00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:27.680
you've done all of that background work without realizing.

408
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.360
So you just explore and you start looking at shapes and what works.

409
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:37.280
Um,
you can have,
I can see the square,
it's free form circles,

410
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:42.260
combination.
Um,
you can,
you can have completely free form shapes.

411
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.620
It's really what appeals to you and mostly actually what your concept once.

412
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.200
So if you have a very loose meadow style garden and you want it to be,

413
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.050
feel really wild,
then unless you're doing it on purpose,

414
00:24:57.051 --> 00:24:59.960
you're not gonna introduce,
you know,
large concrete slabs,

415
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.140
which I actually love the idea of.
But you know,

416
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.380
then you'd be breaking those rules for a reason,
if that's what you wanted to do.

417
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.880
Um,
so it depends on,
on what the concept is to make it work for you.

418
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.490
And then after that,
if you've chosen your shapes,

419
00:25:14.491 --> 00:25:16.940
you've decided where everything goes comes the really,

420
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.520
really exciting part because you've got your concept,

421
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.960
you know how it's supposed to feel.
Um,
and you get to play around basically with,

422
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.920
um,
materials,
colors,
planting,
um,

423
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.930
and it just all follows your concept.
So in my case,
if it's the Alhambra,
um,
God,

424
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:35.180
I'd love and now hamper guard.
And actually now that I think about it,

425
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.930
don't Google my garden.
Whatever you do,

426
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.410
I don't know if technology is not advanced yet to zoom in,

427
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.330
write down is this [inaudible] it's an a mess.

428
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.830
Um,

429
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.400
but basically it all comes down to your concept and how to um,

430
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.290
make,
bring that concept to life through materials,
colors and planting.

431
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.450
Is it really like,
like can you actually see different plants?

432
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.490
No,
no,
no.
It's okay.
Not much to see.

433
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:14.330
I've had a very busy year.
That's crazy.
I digress.
Um,

434
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.520
so the concept,
um,

435
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.480
again that goes back to the idea of kind of fleshing out the whole design to

436
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:25.430
suit your field and to suit what you've,
what your dream is,
you know.

437
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.260
So,
um,
if it was a sea side garden,

438
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.250
um,
you know,
what do you bring into to your bring,

439
00:26:33.251 --> 00:26:36.680
bringing pebbles and then also think,
and I go into this in the book,

440
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.580
don't be afraid to go for all the materials that are expected and then take some

441
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:43.560
out and break the rules.
And if it was a seaside gardens,

442
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:45.750
pebbles and ropes and all that,
you know,

443
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.820
get rid of the ropes and replace it with rusted metal or get rid of,
you know,

444
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:51.031
the,

445
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:54.960
the expected pebble and replace it with concrete or do something that makes it

446
00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:59.310
new and fresh and not the,
you know,
the expected.
Um,

447
00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:00.600
I don't think I say it there,
but that's,

448
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.820
that's outlined in the book and it's actually a big part of,

449
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.590
I think what makes really good garden design is breaking the rules once you know

450
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:12.300
them,
once you know what you want to achieve.
Um,
so being selective,

451
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.030
if you're going to go for colors and materials,

452
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:19.230
choose two colors too strong colors and two strong materials.

453
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:23.910
Don't go mad.
Um,
because you want the concept to be really,

454
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:26.430
really strong and you can always add a little bits here and there.

455
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:28.710
You can always create a little rooms that have separate fields,

456
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:30.460
but you can see it in this,
you know,
the,

457
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.030
the strength of that rostered corten steel.

458
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.560
And then picking up on that tiny little planting bits in that same color,
um,

459
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.850
just balances so well.
Um,
this one again,

460
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:43.350
you can see the designer,

461
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:48.180
Luciano Google has chosen loads and kind of neutral muted tones.

462
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:52.830
They're different colors,
but loads of,
um,
different materials,

463
00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:56.070
but they all work because they're all neutrals.
So again,

464
00:27:56.071 --> 00:28:00.780
the pilot is really simple,
really clean,
same designer.
Um,

465
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.540
again,
he loves neutrals.
Um,

466
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.130
but it really allows structure and form to jump out at you while it's,

467
00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:10.620
if there was too many colors there,
you wouldn't see those bulls shapes.

468
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:13.680
You wouldn't see the,
the,
the multi-stemmed trees.

469
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.860
And then this one loose bargain.
He's,
um,
a Mexican architect.
Um,
so he,

470
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.150
he chose loads of different colors for the space,
but he used one material.

471
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.370
So the colors are,
there's plenty of color,

472
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.660
the color of the sky and the water and loads of colors,

473
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:32.610
but the same material pretty much throughout.

474
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.110
And then the last slide is really to show that,
you know,

475
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.150
vegetable growing can actually be pretty too.

476
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.810
It doesn't have to be a kind of ugly,
um,
you know,

477
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.250
plus you can't actually use cool materials like the wicker and the timber and

478
00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:51.880
the terracotta and make it really colorful and pretty.
Um,

479
00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.080
so the last bit I'll go into is the planting perfection,
uh,

480
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.550
the choosing planting.
So again,

481
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.230
the planting that you choose needs to follow your concept.
So,
um,

482
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.640
if your concept is,
you know,
you want to jungle haven in,

483
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.590
in [inaudible],
um,

484
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.920
you need to make sure all the plants you choose or not only work for Ireland

485
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:18.240
worked for the space,
but then they also work for,
um,
for the,
the concept.

486
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.680
And,
uh,
so you study what works,
what have the jungle looks,
you know,

487
00:29:22.681 --> 00:29:26.520
big leaves,
the foliage,
the bamboo,
um,

488
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:29.610
and how to make that work in.
And it's totally workable.

489
00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:32.760
I just wrote an article about that actually.
Um,
and it can work really,

490
00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:37.290
really well and look really lush and jungle like,
um,
and again,

491
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:40.230
for the planting,
we're also considering the,
the principles of design,

492
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.680
which are really,
so one more thing is right plant right place.

493
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.933
Um,

494
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.680
and it's really about a huge amount of interest these days has been put into

495
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:55.710
creating sustainable gardens that grow themselves as opposed to having to

496
00:29:56.171 --> 00:30:01.140
maintain all the time.
And it's really,
it's really opened up a lot of new,
um,

497
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.070
kind of avenues for,

498
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.590
for young designers in like Chelsea and bloom and all those places,
um,

499
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:12.320
where you're not stuck in kind of old traditions,
which don't work really,
um,

500
00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.430
unless you have huge amounts of time.
So that's what we're talking about here is,

501
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.330
um,

502
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.950
the idea of having organic ecosystems not just grow on that you can let die down

503
00:30:20.951 --> 00:30:24.850
in winter and then come back up and there's that,
that cycle,
that natural cycle

504
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.540
and yet feel like they've been there forever.
I mean,
that bottom one is a,

505
00:30:29.541 --> 00:30:31.730
is a Chelsea Garden,
you know,

506
00:30:31.731 --> 00:30:34.790
you never think it looks like it's in the middle of the province.

507
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.510
So there's a few different planting styles and I just go through them really

508
00:30:38.511 --> 00:30:40.610
quickly because they're all in the book.
Um,

509
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.050
and there's so many of them in the book.

510
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.210
I've pulled out like four or five of them.
Um,

511
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.220
and basically the cottage style planting,
which is that real old English,
um,

512
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.430
formal style and looks like it's kind of being scattered there,

513
00:30:52.431 --> 00:30:55.430
but it's actually pretty high maintenance because you've got kind of the box

514
00:30:55.431 --> 00:30:56.990
balls and you know,

515
00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.260
all of the perennials dying down and the bulbs that have to be taken up and all

516
00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:05.480
of that kind of stuff.
Um,
modernist started planting,

517
00:31:05.481 --> 00:31:07.190
which is very clean,
very modern.

518
00:31:07.191 --> 00:31:11.150
A lot of that gets combined with kind of naturalistic kind of wild meadow

519
00:31:11.151 --> 00:31:12.530
planting,
which works really well.

520
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.380
You can see the top one there is a Chelsea Garden and they've kind of done that.

521
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.830
Um,
that's the naturalistic planting,

522
00:31:19.831 --> 00:31:21.780
which really echoes what's happening in nature.

523
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:27.140
And the idea of naturalistic planting is that it does just scatter and grow and

524
00:31:27.421 --> 00:31:29.190
evolve into something fresh and new.

525
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:34.580
And that has really been focused on planting styles in the past 10 years or so

526
00:31:34.651 --> 00:31:37.840
that it's gone away from that Uber,
um,

527
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:43.110
planned and maintained idea to a more kind of letting nature do what it wants to

528
00:31:43.111 --> 00:31:44.970
do and embracing that.

529
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

530
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:52.590
<v 0>So that brings me back to the core of what we do and just if there's anything</v>

531
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:56.960
that I'd love you guys to go away with today after the talk is,
um,

532
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.880
that connection between,
first of all,
everything that we do as people,
um,

533
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:06.630
whether it's a garden design or an online platform or,
um,

534
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.330
or any other creative or design based,
um,
uh,

535
00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:13.960
endeavor that there is always that connection on the connection is the person

536
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:18.790
and the experience on,
um,
much like garden design,

537
00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.200
everything is personal.
Um,
and to keep that connection in mind.

538
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.283
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

539
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.660
I was dreading that I'm doing now.
That was crazy.
So was that was really,

540
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.040
I let them keep going here,
middle.
That was

541
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.900
<v 0>really entertaining and really informative.
Um,</v>

542
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.870
so we're going to open up to audience questions in minutes.

543
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:47.210
I'm just going to ask maybe the first question.

544
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:52.540
So the reality for some people me is that I love the idea of having a beautiful

545
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:58.100
garden or like we talked about my,
my little patio,

546
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.170
but I do struggle to keep the od potted plant alive.
Okay.

547
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:09.060
Beyond me.
So is it a baby step pre prebook oh God no I do.

548
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.280
Well that goes back to the right plant,
right place.
You know,

549
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.060
finding out what plants really need I guess.

550
00:33:14.061 --> 00:33:18.620
So I'm identifying what the plant that you choose,
what that,

551
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.390
what the needs are,
what the soil needs are,

552
00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:23.720
was the moisture levels are making sure there's enough drainage,

553
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.270
making sure there's not,
you know,
that it doesn't dry out.

554
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:31.520
So if you do have say a pot,
you can control that.
So that's easy.

555
00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:32.840
You just need to inform yourself.

556
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.880
So use Google and find out exactly what the plant needs.
Um,

557
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.970
I actually use it on a daily basis for all sorts of stuff from cooking to God

558
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:43.840
knows what.
So,
um,
but yeah,
to,

559
00:33:43.841 --> 00:33:47.840
to inform yourself of what that plant needs or to go,
right.
I have,

560
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:50.960
don't have huge amounts of rainfall in that particular area in the garden where

561
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:52.640
I have the pots and to go,
right,

562
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:56.480
I'm going to use dry drought friendly plants and then find out what you could

563
00:33:56.481 --> 00:34:00.140
plant there and then create a scheme around that.
So dry,
you know,

564
00:34:00.141 --> 00:34:04.490
kind of desert feel,
space of grasses or something like that.

565
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:09.340
So it goes back to what you said a while ago about just the knowledge for me,

566
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.560
baby steps,
little dainty stuff.

567
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.700
Am I going to ask one more question then I go to the audience?
Um,

568
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.600
if if a community,

569
00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:22.130
and I just say a group of people who live in a housing estate decided to have a,

570
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:27.130
to create a small community garden or allotment.
Um,

571
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.360
would you have any advice on what they could do to make that a success?

572
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.910
Ooh,
um,
planning,
planning,
definitely huge thing.

573
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:40.910
Make sure that you know exactly what you're doing.
Um,

574
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.780
look at who's going to be using it.
So going back to the user is going to be,
um,

575
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.710
you know,
the younger people in the community,
will they be involved?
Um,

576
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:52.410
is it going to be older people so you might raise beds?
Um,
so finding it,

577
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.030
finding out the user is probably the main thing.
Um,

578
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.210
identifying who'll be using it,
um,
and then making it fun.

579
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.210
Making sure that like the kids get involved and you know,

580
00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:03.440
everybody wants to be there.

581
00:35:03.441 --> 00:35:07.370
So maybe have some sort of a social space or something in it,

582
00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:11.070
like a small gazebo or a little poly tunnel where everyone gets a hangout and,

583
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.020
because then you want to be there and you'll want to put work in.
Okay.

584
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:20.020
That's great.
We've got any questions from the audience but one here,
um,

585
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:28.550
probably get asked this one all the times that on
I can hear you.
Yep.

586
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.870
Great.
Eh,
what's your take on a synthetic grass?
Cause it's sort of,

587
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:37.230
when you're doing a lot of other stuff,
it seems like it's an easy option,

588
00:35:37.231 --> 00:35:41.250
but is it the right option?
Um,
it's funny because a lot of garden designers,

589
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:41.481
we have,

590
00:35:41.481 --> 00:35:45.420
we had a big discussion about this during Super Garden and 90% of the people

591
00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:48.270
that we were talking to at the time were like,
oh,
it's horrible,
it's horrible,

592
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.550
but there's an absolute place for it.
Um,

593
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:55.080
like today I FM have it on their roof garden and they were ashamed of it and I

594
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:57.800
was like,
no,
but why would you put real grass?
There will be,
you know,

595
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.680
head wrecking.
So I think it depends on your needs,
on your needs,

596
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:06.150
on what you need it for.
And if you think it will make your life easier,
um,

597
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.320
on better and you can work it into the design in such a way that it looks good,

598
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.220
then absolutely.
Why not?
You know,
I wouldn't be a snob about it.

599
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:19.380
I think a lot of people do and they almost do it to pretend,
you know.
Thank you.

600
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.130
<v 2>Great.
Cool.
Got 'em one of the second road here.</v>

601
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.780
Great.
We just have to check with the microphone's working before we got us.

602
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.840
Get a teacher.
That's fine.

603
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:38.820
Just want to make sure that we hear you on the recording.
Thank you.

604
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.420
Totally natural.
Yeah.
Oh,
it's working.
Okay.

605
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.060
Thank you so much for the talk.

606
00:36:47.061 --> 00:36:51.710
I've looks absolutely amazing and makes me wish to just drop my job and start

607
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:56.420
gardening all week.
You come up for me?
Yes.
Um,

608
00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.420
what can we do?
Like most of us,
we can't probably afford at this stage,

609
00:37:00.421 --> 00:37:05.170
the garden in Dublin.
Um,
let,
let alone like anything in Dublin.
Um,
what,

610
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.660
what can we do to create a nice space and our balconies or if we don't even have

611
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:13.690
like the knee maybe inside like a small oasis to relax and enjoy what we saw on

612
00:37:14.331 --> 00:37:15.164
the slides.

613
00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.340
<v 0>Um,
well first thing is I'm,</v>

614
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:21.830
I'm concerned with are quite a lot because I hate the idea of design being

615
00:37:21.831 --> 00:37:26.831
exclusive and the idea that only those that have like 100,000 euro to spend

616
00:37:26.991 --> 00:37:29.840
under design can afford it.
And the first garden I did actually,

617
00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:32.540
because I don't think there's any pictures of it in this,
um,
uh,

618
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:35.180
bloom was made with scaffold old scaffolding planks.

619
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:40.570
And so if you want to create something really special without putting huge

620
00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:45.380
amounts of money into it,
you have to kind of rethink the materials you're using.

621
00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.620
Um,
you have to rethink the amount of time you want to put into it.

622
00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:49.940
So those scaffolding planks,

623
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.400
they looked absolutely stunning when we were done with them,

624
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.550
but we sanded and sanded and sanded,
didn't sound it.

625
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.190
And to get them to look really well and then,
you know,

626
00:37:58.191 --> 00:38:02.210
stay in them again and again and again.
So re-imagining old materials is great,

627
00:38:02.211 --> 00:38:05.810
but then everybody's Kinda started catching on to that too.
So like scaffolding,

628
00:38:05.811 --> 00:38:10.100
planks are hard to get,
you know,
what'd you call them?
Pilots and you know,

629
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:14.210
um,
but be creative,
you know,
get,

630
00:38:14.211 --> 00:38:18.860
get hands on yourself and it doesn't need to cost a huge amount of money.
Um,

631
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.070
it's hard to be specific because I don't know exactly what you're talking about,

632
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:26.030
but,
um,
say if you were,
you know,
instead of if you wanted something on a,

633
00:38:26.031 --> 00:38:30.530
on a window sill insight,
instead of just getting a plastic window box,

634
00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.790
create something,
you know,

635
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:35.260
even if it's made with driftwood or made with timber that you,

636
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.160
you staying up to suit the color scheme inside,
um,
or,
uh,

637
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.860
go to Pinterest and you know,
research certain things and,
you know,

638
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:48.310
there's so many ideas you can kind of bring in to the home by just getting

639
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:50.740
creative yourself.
I know that's a really bad answer,
but,

640
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.990
so it's about making it,
it's creativity.
Yes.
Yes.

641
00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.080
Not just a quick fix,
which is what I kind of tend to do.

642
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.010
But that in that way you can work design principles into it and then you'll

643
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.120
create something beautiful as opposed to just,
you know,

644
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.190
placing something that somebody else mightn't have put a huge amount of thought

645
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:13.270
into.
So it's the thought process and then making it personal to you.
You know,

646
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.310
cause if you make it yourself or have it made,
um,

647
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.530
even if it is like say a gate,
a rostered steel gate,

648
00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:21.850
it might be old materials,

649
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.060
but you filled it up so you know it's going to be perfect for you

650
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.470
<v 1>anywhere.
Audience questions.</v>

651
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.030
<v 3>Um,
so I'm moving into a new house.
We'd spoke new house,
um,
in,
uh,</v>

652
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.000
just off the road.
Um,
and we've got to red food,
basic square garden,

653
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.130
nothing spectacular.
Right now it's Robel.
Um,

654
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.960
myself and my wife were talking about what we do from the star.
Right.

655
00:39:48.961 --> 00:39:51.090
So for example,
obviously we be busy inside the house,

656
00:39:51.091 --> 00:39:56.070
but do you have any advice in terms of if we wanted to put down that's a trees

657
00:39:56.071 --> 00:39:59.430
first we start from begun work with down or do we start with like,
you know,

658
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:03.210
to potted plants and work our way up?
Have you kind of come across that before?

659
00:40:03.211 --> 00:40:03.950
Where would you start?

660
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:07.970
<v 0>Oh,
loads.
Um,
and the,
the main thing I think is before you start planting,</v>

661
00:40:07.971 --> 00:40:10.820
before we start doing anything is dreaming that,

662
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.240
that kind of figuring out what you want from the garden before you start placing

663
00:40:14.241 --> 00:40:17.390
things.
And,
um,
even before you start going into the,
you know,

664
00:40:17.391 --> 00:40:19.730
the privacy and all of those kinds of things.

665
00:40:19.731 --> 00:40:22.100
So making sure that your dream for the house,

666
00:40:22.101 --> 00:40:24.710
which you probably already have and you have,
you know,

667
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.430
materials and features in there that you want to pick up on and the style of the

668
00:40:28.431 --> 00:40:32.990
house,
try and bleed that out.
So pick up on colors,
materials on the floor,

669
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.830
like if you have,
say concrete floors,
bleed it out or if there's tiles or timber,

670
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.431
you know,

671
00:40:37.431 --> 00:40:40.520
try and continue that because then it will become an extension of your living

672
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:44.750
space.
But making sure you identify what kind of feel you want,

673
00:40:44.751 --> 00:40:47.210
what kind of style you want,
um,

674
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.240
and then bleeding that in through the whole space.
You know,

675
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.920
I'm connecting them and then you can,

676
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:56.360
you can always start by planting a few trees if you wanted to now and then work

677
00:40:56.361 --> 00:40:57.380
with the rest around that.

678
00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.920
But just make sure that you don't end up putting them somewhere where you don't

679
00:41:00.921 --> 00:41:01.730
want them.

680
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.150
So making sure you follow the process in your head a little bit of where do I

681
00:41:05.151 --> 00:41:07.400
need privacy,
um,

682
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.610
where do I need a windscreen?

683
00:41:10.611 --> 00:41:14.840
So do analyze the side of it before you look at trees or that sort of thing.

684
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.960
If I have time for one more question.
Any final audience questions?

685
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.900
No.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Two more actually will fit the whole thing.

686
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.510
It's a very practical question.
Yeah.
Um,

687
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:35.990
I was wondering like is there any place that you would recommend us to go to?

688
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:40.190
If we want to design,
for example,
our little balcony or so,
um,

689
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.580
like a garden center we can go through that you could really recommend.

690
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:48.590
Because as far I looked for plants and I finally went to Ikea and they were all

691
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:51.830
sold out.
So that wasn't really a success.

692
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:55.010
So maybe there is a better place to go to that's also affordable.

693
00:41:55.011 --> 00:41:59.780
And you're talking about outdoor plants or just as in indoor?
I Dunno,

694
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.380
maybe.
I mean there's loads of places in and around Dublin.

695
00:42:03.381 --> 00:42:05.300
There's a place called garden world.

696
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.930
I don't know if you've come across garden world and kill Quaid and Oak Hill.

697
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:12.980
Cool.
Good.
Quite can't remember.
I think it's,
yeah,
in Wicklow.

698
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:19.670
Um,
they're fantastic.
They have incredible plants.
Uh,
a good quality plants too.

699
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:24.050
I generally deal more with the wholesale.
Um,
and uh,
things are larger plants,

700
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:26.830
you know,
um,
but they're,
they're fantastic.
Um,

701
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.360
and they have a huge selection and they're very knowledgeable so they'll

702
00:42:29.361 --> 00:42:33.590
actually help talk you through whatever you need or,
um,
materials wise,

703
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.300
I glove salvage yards.
So if you have,
you know,

704
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.190
ideas for a balcony or something like that to go to old architectural salvage

705
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:42.860
and just choose out.
Interesting.
Cool.
You know,

706
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:46.850
even one thing and then build around if you don't have a specific idea in mind.

707
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

708
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:59.370
<v 2>A place more in the city center ish would be plant life on cork storage.</v>

709
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:04.660
Yup.
Closer by.
Yeah.
If you don't have a car.
Yeah.
Uh,

710
00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.210
my question kind of comes back to what we discussed earlier.

711
00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.850
It's like a round style though about style.

712
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:15.280
Is there like an Irish style that you've seen over the years or how has that

713
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.960
developed or is there something that makes Irish gardens stand out from auto,

714
00:43:19.961 --> 00:43:21.160
let's say,
European Gardens?

715
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.263
<v 0>Um,</v>

716
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:27.930
it's interesting because for a long time Irish design would have been influenced

717
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:32.130
hugely by the likes of Chelsea,
the t,
the rhs shows,
Tatton Park,

718
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.510
um,
and all of the big shows,
garden shows,

719
00:43:36.511 --> 00:43:40.920
show garden shows in the UK.
Um,
I think since the,
um,

720
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:46.240
since since bloon was launched,
which is what,
11 years ago now,
I think,
um,

721
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:50.460
that kind of gave Irish design is a platform here,
um,
to showcase.

722
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.550
So I think there's been a huge shift in that.
Um,

723
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:58.080
and I think an Irish planting style and field has developed,
um,

724
00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:03.110
which is a little bit more relaxed and natural than say its English counterpart.

725
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.100
Having said that,
I mean you know,

726
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:10.310
trends kind of cross over and back and you've got trends coming from the south

727
00:44:10.441 --> 00:44:14.850
of France and there's like an overall trend of naturalistic planting and

728
00:44:14.851 --> 00:44:19.230
sustainability.
And I'm allowing gardens to just be the way they want to be.

729
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:20.340
Um,

730
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.390
which actually in last year it came back a little bit to being more structured

731
00:44:24.391 --> 00:44:27.480
again.
Um,
so there are trends that go across all of them,

732
00:44:27.481 --> 00:44:31.430
but I do think Irish designers have developed their own styles.
Um,

733
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.960
and I think this year at bloom,
it was interesting to see,

734
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.500
there was a lot of interest at Chelsea and the Chelsea designers were tweeting a

735
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:40.950
lot about designers here and about what gardens they liked and stuff,

736
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:45.300
which was amazing,
you know,
to,
to have that coming back to Ireland.

737
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.430
That's great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
