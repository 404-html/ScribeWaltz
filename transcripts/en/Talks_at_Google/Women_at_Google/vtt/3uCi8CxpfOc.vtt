00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.050
I want to start by telling you what it's like to be at boarding school and get a

2
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:18.180
parcel in the post.
Now,
this is not something that happened to me very often.

3
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.850
So when at the age of 15,

4
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.290
a small package arrived with my name on it,

5
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.280
it was literally the most exciting thing of the year.

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.860
I remember it so clearly.
The box,
the brown box with my name on it,

7
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.060
half a dozen authors,
my best friends,
all really excited.

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.880
We're still in our pajamas cause the post arrived after breakfast.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.670
Everyone jumping on the bed,
open it,

10
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.320
open it cause they were sure that the Swedes that'd be chocolates for everybody

11
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:53.100
to share.
So there I was,
uh,
turned over the box,

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.670
ready to break the seal,
but something stopped me.

13
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
The writing on the back code unfamiliar,

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.680
I read it with this bear,

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.730
Her Majesty's Prison Service,
Holloway London,

16
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.700
anxiety choking me.

17
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.980
I tentatively opens the box and a pile of letters cascaded to the floor,

18
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.760
all with the same for mania,
handwriting on it,

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
my handwriting or dressed and one person.

20
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.333
<v 1>Mom.</v>

21
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.950
<v 0>Is there anything more devastating when the moments when something you've been</v>

22
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:49.720
trying to hide and hide from reveals itself?

23
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.710
So all to see

24
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.640
there was an actor inside.
Did Caroline your mothers?
No,

25
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.140
no.
They're in our custody.
So we're turning your letters.
T you Yocelyn sailing.

26
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.303
<v 1>Devastating.</v>

27
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.380
<v 0>According to the Children's charity,
Bernardo,
the UK charity,</v>

28
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.760
children of offending pens,

29
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.040
he spent time in prison are twice as likely to have mental and ms conduct

30
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:28.604
problems.

31
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.970
They consistently underperform at school and there's three times as likely to

32
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:35.900
end up being offenders themselves

33
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.030
growing up as a black kid,
as mother,

34
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.130
as a daughter to her mother who was barely there to parents who never lived

35
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:46.790
together,

36
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.790
let alone were married as the sister to siblings who themselves were constantly

37
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:58.490
arrested to assist that whom had pregnancy,
teenage pregnancy,

38
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.610
all her taken into foster care
being cousin,

39
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.923
a niece,

40
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.020
two relatives who value teenage pregnancy and states dependency more than they

41
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.770
valued achievements,
education,

42
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.390
aspiring to succeed,
to do well,
to be secure,
to be free.

43
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:26.391
And that environment was a battle of extraordinarily difficult odds.

44
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.670
My name is Carolina Flanagan.
As you've heard.
I'm a coach.

45
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.470
I'm a speaker and I'm an author,

46
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.150
but I am extremely passionate about empowering people to fight and win battles

47
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.940
they think,
but have no where in achieving.
That day.

48
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.290
I opened the box,
I discovered a secret,

49
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.980
the secret to toppling giants to winning battles that you think you have no

50
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.090
chance of winning

51
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.150
and it's the single most important factor in my journey to date and every

52
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:08.350
success I've achieved,

53
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.830
we used to scrolling down here is the clicker isn't work.

54
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.850
It's also the single most important factor in helping me to succeed as a mother

55
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.070
of four fantastic voice.
This picture is amazing,

56
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.380
not just because it shows my lovely boys,

57
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.390
but because they have all four of them in the same picture still for long enough

58
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:46.550
to take the picture and actually looking at the camera and smiling and nothing

59
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.440
short of America,
Dylan,
Noah,
Luca,
and Maxwell.

60
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.900
So today I want to share,

61
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.020
share with you the secret to fighting difficult battles and winning

62
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.460
that secret is this.

63
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.850
No matter how hard the challenge,

64
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.240
how strong or opponent or how daunting the circumstances,

65
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.740
you can win that battle if you do.
One thing.

66
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.650
If you focus only on what you can control,

67
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.100
focus your attention on what you can control.

68
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.620
Balance is definitely a battle.
It's hard.

69
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.330
It's so hard.
In fact,
we almost don't even talk about it anymore.

70
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.850
I find when I go into meetings and I talk to my clients about balance and

71
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.820
corporate clients and say no,
no,
it's what like integration that uh,

72
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.870
we want to have a working agility.

73
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.530
The ones that was talking about balance anymore,

74
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.240
I feel like I killed it off cause it's something that's so hard to achieve.

75
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.320
You decided to just kind of brush it under the carpet.
Just for fun.

76
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:20.321
I did a Google search on work life balance in bed 5.6 million results.

77
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.490
I didn't look at them all,
but certainly the first page,

78
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.280
it was all about the end of what?
Life balance.

79
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.320
It's a battle of extraordinary yachts.

80
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.060
Why is that the way I said three reasons.

81
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.880
The first one is that work life balance is,

82
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.090
it's quite difficult to define and they won't give me a quick definition of

83
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.930
balance.
Work life balance.

84
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.010
You didn't have to print the right.
You've got the perfect definition,

85
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.110
then please come forth with that.
Anyone,

86
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.180
anything come to mind immediately to find in between to define an equilibrium

87
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:06.160
between two forces.
Brilliant balance in other words,

88
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.870
but what does that mean in real life

89
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.040
to spend as much time for those of you who didn't hear on your personal life as

90
00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:21.990
you do on your work life.
Thank you for that.
What's her name?
Oh thanks for that.

91
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.580
That's pretty good.
Pretty clear.
Yes.

92
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.220
And you see your work and your home goals meeting a work and your home having

93
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:34.070
goals.
Excellent.
Thank you.
What's your name?
[inaudible] Nero.
Thank you.

94
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.650
[inaudible]
this is a snapshot,

95
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:41.320
but the conversation I had with the client early on this thing,

96
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.570
so you want better balance but work life balance.
What does that mean to you?

97
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.760
What does it look like?
My client.
Well,

98
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.250
um,
I want,
you know,
I want my life to be balanced so you know,

99
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.540
I'll feel much more balanced.
Me.

100
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.670
Okay.
So can we,
let's dig a little bit deeper.

101
00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:08.350
What does it actually look like on a day to day basis?
What are you doing

102
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.813
<v 1>client</v>

103
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.000
<v 0>well at home?</v>

104
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.350
And doing all the stuff that kind of makes me feel balanced and at work.
Yeah,

105
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.240
that works.
Balanced.
Yeah.

106
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.400
I know I've got work life balance because I'll feel balanced.

107
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.590
That conversation is surprisingly typical with my clients.

108
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.480
It's quite hard to define and I think [inaudible] did a very good job of coming

109
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:39.314
close.

110
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.510
Now this is a problem because as research shows and you would have almost

111
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.240
certainly have heard if you want to achieve goals,

112
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.980
it really helps if that smart goals,
yes.
Are there specific,
they're measurable.

113
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.600
They are achievable.

114
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.530
There'd be enlisting had timebound research shows it that increases your chances

115
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.590
of succeeding in achieving a goal and it also shows that if you can write down

116
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.770
what your goal is,
you can articulate it.

117
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.700
That increases your chances of succeeding in even more.

118
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.450
What was the last time you sat down?

119
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.950
You wrote down we'll specific goals or having work life balance

120
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.640
lady in the pink.
Lots of the question first ever.

121
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.250
Anybody ever do that?

122
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.280
It's hard to define and that makes it even harder to achieve.

123
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.683
<v 1>Gotcha.</v>

124
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.620
<v 0>The Myth of what?
Life balance.</v>

125
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.240
The second reason why it's so hard to achieve.

126
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.510
No one size fits all.

127
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.720
What works for me just might not work for you.

128
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.620
You may prefer to work from home five days a week,

129
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.090
but perhaps your preference is actually to be in the office and there's five

130
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:10.540
days.
Get all the work done so that you're much freer when you're at home.

131
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.670
And just to complicate things more,
if you have children,
what works for you?

132
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:18.880
We're not sure.
Nobody young,
what necessarily work when they're older,

133
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.420
when they're teenagers.
So what does this mean?

134
00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:26.590
It means we have to create a kind of our own personal solution.

135
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.290
We can gather together all the different components there,
productivity apps,

136
00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:37.060
and the time management strategies and the wellbeing routines.

137
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.680
But the important bit is how we bring all of these together.

138
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.870
And there's no universal blue pen for that.
You have to find our own way.

139
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.850
So the third reason why balance

140
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.403
<v 1>is this</v>

141
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.680
<v 0>and knowledge of the the biggest,</v>

142
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.360
it's just the nature of the world we live in and the way we work today.

143
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.660
All those wonderful technological advances that have brought us so much freedom

144
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:07.630
connected us,

145
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.400
wins we could never have dreamed off in 50 years ago.

146
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.160
A price,
having the bay.
We are always on,

147
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.330
always connected,
constantly working,

148
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:29.331
constantly moving and of course it's the demands of our working environment.

149
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.870
Positive,
the importance of performing,

150
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.060
approving or value competing against our peers and add to that what's going on

151
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:43.980
internally.
This is the battle second battle.

152
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.880
This is the two trucks.
What's going on on the outside with work environment,

153
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.120
but also internally our inability to restrict it,

154
00:11:52.121 --> 00:11:55.450
to control how much we use technology.

155
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.250
We become slaves to it and add to that even our feelings of I'm an imposter

156
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:09.541
imposter syndrome perhaps or just do a name need to change to the rest of your

157
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.370
night ambition.

158
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.500
All of this conspires to make it very hard to walk out of the office,

159
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.530
which off completely and enjoying the bits of your life that don't involve work.

160
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.420
I want to tell you three stories.

161
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.340
The underlying my message about how you can win this battle.

162
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.720
So balance a battle,
which cause I'm just explained it's a difficult one.

163
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.760
It's a battle against the odds.

164
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.660
It's the 28th of August,

165
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.330
1963 Martin Luther King leader of the civil rights movement in the 1950s 1960s

166
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.530
in America,
he's standing on the Lincoln Lincoln Memorial.

167
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.360
There are 250,000 civil rights supporters that in the crowds and he delivers.

168
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.020
I connects bench.
I have a dream.

169
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.350
Those of you who don't know or recall or that being was,

170
00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:27.260
it was in dream for a quality.

171
00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.830
It was a dream for a day when the children of black slaves and the children of

172
00:13:33.831 --> 00:13:38.630
black slave owners will be able to go to school together,
contributing equally.

173
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.850
It's hard to imagine a more challenging battle in the one bang faced at that

174
00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:46.910
time.

175
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:51.910
This was the period of of Jim Crow of state sponsored discrimination and

176
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:58.280
aggression.
It was the time of niching is of the Klu Klux Klan.

177
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.590
It was the time when segregation and hospitals on transport in schools was

178
00:14:03.591 --> 00:14:04.610
completely wrong

179
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.570
and yet 1964 civil rights act is passed.

180
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:18.090
In 1965 the voting rights act is passed and although discrimination continues

181
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:24.550
today,
the battle for equality goes on,
particularly in America.

182
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.210
There is no doubt that those two bits of legislation which made it illegal for

183
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:33.820
people to be treated differently because of the color of their skin,

184
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.150
they were iconic victories,

185
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.760
defining moments in an incredibly important battle.

186
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.300
How do they do it?
How did they win?
Three things.

187
00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:53.090
Four things stand out for me.
First of all,

188
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.620
they had a vision.
That's what's so powerful about this.
This speech,

189
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.570
the I have a dream speech.
It was rousing,
it was motivating.

190
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.590
It didn't focus on how difficult and impossible that vision was.

191
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:13.350
Will that dream was focused on what that dream would look like.

192
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.540
And I allowed you to go back and watch the footage of that stage and I challenge

193
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:24.140
you not to be completely inspired by it.

194
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.880
So the vision was there.

195
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.100
The second thing that stands out for me is they look head.

196
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.960
So they had a strategy how they would do this and this involved non violent

197
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.340
protest in the form of marches.
Citizens on public transport,

198
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.020
non violent protest.

199
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.810
Was that only ever been to the map walnuts and that's the key to that strategy

200
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:53.740
was actually saying not just this is what we want,

201
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.630
this is how we plan to get it,

202
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.740
but anticipating what the challenges would be,

203
00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:03.400
what obstacles they would face,
and those obstacles were winning.
Very real

204
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.360
violence being thrown in jail.

205
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.480
Martin Luther King was arrested in 29 times.

206
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.890
They were ready for that is that they actually trained in how to cope with

207
00:16:18.071 --> 00:16:21.010
violent aggression and how to stay peaceful.

208
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.660
In other words,

209
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.660
they were prepared and they practiced the skills that they would need to further

210
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.120
their cause and they checked on every time that were arrested and then released.

211
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.580
They would continue that flight.

212
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.630
The second story I want to share with you is a story

213
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.490
from childhood.
The story of David and Goliath.

214
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.710
Is everyone familiar with that story?
Hands up.

215
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.810
If you're not familiar with the story of David,
right?

216
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.850
You all remember the story of David and Goliath.

217
00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:02.851
It's one the book of Samuel and it's the story about this fierce giant Goliath

218
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.490
and how David,
a small,

219
00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:11.491
innocent shepherd boy with a single slingshot was able to talk or to kill this

220
00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:15.820
terrifying warrior.

221
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.430
And so when the battle for his people against the fittest slides,

222
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.740
now it's hard to imagine a more intimidating,

223
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.090
daunting prospect.

224
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.980
How in the world did David do that?

225
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:39.460
What was his secret?
Was he just lucky really with one slingshot?

226
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.420
This is the subject of a fantastic book called David and Goliath by Malcolm

227
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.760
Gladwell,

228
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.760
and it Gladwell's seeks to challenge or perception of what makes us strong,

229
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.690
what makes us weak,

230
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.090
people who people and things with it would give an advantage.

231
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.870
And those things that we think as disadvantages and what's wonderful about the

232
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:14.490
David and Goliath story,
if you read behind the headlight,
is David,

233
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.020
that small weak shepherd boy,

234
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.500
he knew exactly what he was doing when he went to face Goliath.

235
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.940
He knew the Goliath was this big warrior that he would be debt out from head to

236
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:36.240
toe in armor on the day in question.
He carried a spear,

237
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.720
but I've carried a spear.
He had a sword and shield.

238
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.410
It was there in all his glory.
They did meet us.

239
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.550
He knew the Goliath would be slow cause his arm's heavy.

240
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.250
He also knew that the life was shortsighted because Goliath had said,

241
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:56.340
where are you?
Where are you showing yourself to me?
Show yourself to me.

242
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.410
The other thing that David view was that he was an excellent slingshot.

243
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.750
He was very good at this skill.

244
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.360
This is a skill he used every day to protect a sheep against predators.

245
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.810
He knew that that's still perfected,

246
00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.010
was enough and one shot to topple the giants.

247
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.170
That's what happened.

248
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.250
The third and final story I want to share with you is the story of Viktor
Frankl.

249
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.920
Viktor Frankl is a holocaust survivor.
He died a few years ago,

250
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.330
but he wrote a book called Man's search for meaning,

251
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.580
which is one of the most extraordinary books I have ever read and I highly

252
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:48.660
recommend you read it.

253
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.610
It tells the story of his experience in concentration camps and his fight for

254
00:19:56.131 --> 00:19:56.964
survival.

255
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:04.110
It's hard to imagine the circumstances that weigh more heavily that could weigh

256
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:09.060
more heavily against you.
The torment,
the horror,

257
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.210
the misery of being in a concentration camp.

258
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.510
How did Victor Franco,

259
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.560
and there are very few that managed to survive when millions didn't.

260
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.900
How did he do that?

261
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.980
What made the difference between those fighting,

262
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.940
fighting to stay alive and those who didn't make it?

263
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.850
And this question answering this question is the subject of Frankel's book.

264
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.730
And he came up with one thing.

265
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.060
Despite everything that was taken away,
everything physical,

266
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.470
the emotional torment,

267
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.100
there was one thing he discovered that could not be taken.

268
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.060
And that was his attitude,
his mindset.

269
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.750
He realized the power of his thoughts,
thoughts that he could control,

270
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:04.030
no matter what happened on the outside,

271
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.270
he would always remain in control of those.

272
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:13.650
And that is what he attributes to his and many of the others survival in those

273
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:16.840
awful circumstances.
So those,

274
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:20.110
these stories have the following in common.

275
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.210
They are all examples of people who faced extraordinary odds.

276
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.660
People you wanted to fight a battle.

277
00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:34.410
There are stories of people who want against those us because they focus not on

278
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.280
the impossibility of the task.

279
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.640
How powerful and overwhelming where the odds are against them.

280
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.410
They focused on what they could intro,

281
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.600
focus your intention on what you can control.

282
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.220
I've already explained to you that that was an instrumental factor in my journey

283
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.000
from then to now.

284
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.510
It's just one small problems more bled in that journey.

285
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.500
If only I'd remembered that lesson,

286
00:22:21.501 --> 00:22:26.501
that lesson that I learned all those years ago when I was a working parent.

287
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.640
We're not attend to clear.
We got late,
which is the law firm.

288
00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.680
I was working when my first son was born.

289
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:42.260
Dylan was six months old and I returned full of enthusiasm,

290
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:42.831
positive,

291
00:22:42.831 --> 00:22:47.831
determined to make a success of balancing my career and my new family.

292
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.570
Wow.

293
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.570
That was the first year of being a working parent was the hardest year I've ever

294
00:22:55.731 --> 00:23:00.560
had.
I struggled the demanding hours,

295
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.710
the competition,
the air of competition,

296
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.530
the culture of presenteeism.

297
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.400
That awful feeling is the only non-partner law of male who was there,

298
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:18.350
who had a child who had to leave the office and run and be be there for her

299
00:23:18.351 --> 00:23:19.184
child.

300
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.010
That feeling when I got home despite being exhausted despite having to log on

301
00:23:25.011 --> 00:23:28.730
and keep going with my work and all the pressure I was on it,
I was,

302
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.620
I was under a work,
the feeling of home when I had to learn the ropes.

303
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.340
Coming to grips with being a mother for the first time and I was doing

304
00:23:37.341 --> 00:23:38.450
everything at home.

305
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.890
My husband who I'm happy to say as much better trained now at the his career,

306
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:52.210
his life remained surprisingly on impacted by the arrival of our new baby boy.

307
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.090
It was the hardest year of my life.
I fought very hard,

308
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.230
but I struggled.

309
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.320
What was my strategy in those circumstances and that really hard battle.

310
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.480
I had no strategy.

311
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:25.500
I was just too blind to be able to even spot the things I might be able to

312
00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:30.520
control.
That is I would focus my attention on those things.

313
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.620
I went from day to day.

314
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:38.230
My head in is spent putting out fires.
That's what I did.

315
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.190
I had a year of just putting out fires,
always exhausted,

316
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.580
always stressed,
always worried that I'd forgotten something,

317
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.660
that I was underperforming.
All these different areas.

318
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.440
Is it any wonder that that battle and it didn't [inaudible]

319
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.240
when my second son was born,

320
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.980
I walked away from a career I had been leading up to spend my whole life

321
00:25:05.981 --> 00:25:09.910
building through the reasons that I hinted that at the beginning of this,

322
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.700
it took a lot for me to walk away.
I thought I was powerless

323
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.143
as up.

324
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.040
She's a Pulitzer Prize winning author and poet and she said the most common way

325
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.710
that people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.

326
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.400
I know I felt completely powerless when I was trying to juggle my legal career

327
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.350
and getting used to being a parent,

328
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.240
but it turns out I wasn't powerless at all.

329
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.380
The book that many of you are holding in your hands,

330
00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:01.510
I wrote that because I wanted others to learn from my failure.

331
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.900
My failure was to become your success and the whole purpose was to show you that

332
00:26:10.511 --> 00:26:11.560
you are powerful,

333
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.940
that if you focus your attention on the things you can control,

334
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.120
<v 1>you can succeed.</v>

335
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.570
<v 0>Was it a lunch?</v>

336
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:35.580
I business awards lunch a few weeks ago and I found myself sitting next to a

337
00:26:35.581 --> 00:26:37.500
partnership,
the partner at Kpmg,

338
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.540
and it turns out she's been playing rugby for the England rugby team for about

339
00:26:42.541 --> 00:26:44.640
15 now.
I think she's recently retired.

340
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.830
And we got onto the subject of when you focus your attention,

341
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.150
how people exceed what holds people that succeed,
what holds people back.

342
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.060
And she said,
yeah,
of course.
She goes,

343
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.150
that's absolutely mind control controllables.

344
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.230
What she said,
control the controllables.

345
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.400
That was our mantra the whole time I was in the England team.

346
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.680
That's what we did.
We knew we could do nothing about the size,

347
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.540
the reputation of the opposition.
We couldn't do anything about the weather,

348
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.690
about the pitch,
even about the mood of the fans.

349
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.090
So we put our head down,
we focused on our training,

350
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.830
our attitude,

351
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:34.050
our mindset of preparation and that's how we went into our,

352
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.750
into our matches.
And that's how we would

353
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.170
control the controllables.
That you just love that.

354
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.180
I wish it hadn't been the mantra of the women's rugby team cause then I could

355
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:52.290
have had it as mine,
but it sums up just beautifully

356
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.130
and that's exactly what I'm doing now.

357
00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.260
What I've been doing for the last 10 years,

358
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:03.350
I am controlling the controllables in my life from the time I wake up in the

359
00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:09.240
morning of what I do,
when I wake up in the morning to how I get to work,

360
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.360
what I do on my way to what to what I say yesterday,

361
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:17.390
what I say no to who I say yes do do I say no to what I think about at the

362
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.880
beginning of the day,
what I think about the end of the day.

363
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:27.110
There are infinite number of controllables in your life and your job is to

364
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:29.754
control that

365
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.910
and that's how I

366
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.943
<v 1>yeah,</v>

367
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.950
<v 0>not winning very well.
It's scrolling down on my laptop so bear with me.</v>

368
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.190
What does this mean to you?
How is that useful?
How can this be practical?

369
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.510
I want to introduce you to the baby proof method.

370
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.620
Just that suspense disappeared.
Hopefully it will come back again.

371
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.910
The baby proof method is quite simply a framework.

372
00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:11.911
But I prayed there to help my clients doing sat in that know where to focus

373
00:29:12.371 --> 00:29:16.390
their attention.
No,
what the controllables are and what men can do,

374
00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.680
how they can control those in a way that helps them win the battle.

375
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.023
The balance.

376
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.070
There are four steps involved.

377
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.970
So that number one is all about the picture.

378
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.440
I remember I started talking about defining balance,
knowing what that was.

379
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:43.250
Have a really clear picture in your mind about what balance looks like.

380
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.790
It's not enough to call it balance,
not even enough to say it's an equilibrium.

381
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.830
It's not even enough to say it.

382
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:54.100
So it's the same amount of time at work or at home.

383
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.640
What is your ideal version of balance right now for you until you are able to,

384
00:30:02.841 --> 00:30:06.760
once that question,
the best tips in the world,

385
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.720
I'm not going to help you out there.

386
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.210
Remember Martin Luther King's vision,
his dream,

387
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.650
you need to dream and ambition of that intensity if you have any chance of

388
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:21.064
succeeding,

389
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.270
but it's not just about the the dream.

390
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:30.370
It's also about making that dream come alive.
Right,

391
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:33.250
so if you're living your ideal version of balance,

392
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:38.490
you are there for three out of four of your child's school activities.

393
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.610
You are leaving work at five o'clock at least two days of the week.

394
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:50.070
We down tools turn your phones or technology off all wave at age,

395
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.620
whatever your version of balance is right now.

396
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.010
You also have to have in your mind,

397
00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.850
in your mind's eye what might get in the way of that.

398
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:06.040
What are the obstacles you might face and crucially,

399
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.270
how can you prepare for those?
How can you prepare to meet them,

400
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:17.180
which is that number two in the baby proof method is to prepare.

401
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.440
Preparing is all about asking yourself,

402
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.740
what can I do now?

403
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.860
What can I build now that I will need when the time comes that I will need

404
00:31:31.201 --> 00:31:32.034
later?

405
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:37.290
The best way I describe this is I often use the metaphor of running a marathon.

406
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.570
Nobody wakes up one day and says,
I'm going to run a math in today.

407
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.040
Well they do is they say,
I'm going to run the London marathon in April,

408
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.070
and they probably say,
wow,
okay,

409
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.160
I'm going to have to do lot of stuff that's quite daunting.
Oh,

410
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.330
that's quite a big task.

411
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.740
But they know if they do the right training,

412
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.130
they get the right support and then practice

413
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.040
by the time that date comes.
They don't be prepared not just to succeed,

414
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.190
but actually to enjoy it if they've done the work.

415
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:16.440
And this is what the baby proof method is all about.
Having that picture,

416
00:32:16.441 --> 00:32:20.160
like I talked about,
having a,
seeing yourself running that race,

417
00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:22.520
if you are running around running that race and join yet,

418
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.390
so preparation is the but who support are you going to need and it's the same

419
00:32:27.391 --> 00:32:28.590
with the battle for ballot.

420
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.580
Whose support do you need to get better balance?

421
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.230
Is it your partner?
Is it the support of your boss or your manager?

422
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.730
Is it the support of your,
of your mother in law?

423
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.680
Who support when you need and how will you get it

424
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.340
with that step in the baby proof method

425
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.560
is to practice the skills.
Thinking of David,

426
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.170
he didn't show up to face Goliath,

427
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.470
ready to throw a slingshot for the first time.

428
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.980
It takes practice and become an expert.

429
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.060
And the good thing is if you do practice,
you will become an expert.

430
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.230
So the practice that is all about looking at,
well,

431
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:15.290
what skills am I going to lead?
Very simple.

432
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.350
I'm going to need to be extremely organized.

433
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.520
I'm going to need to be very good at knowing what to say yes to what to say no

434
00:33:22.521 --> 00:33:23.354
to.

435
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:27.620
I'm going to be mean to need to be very good at looking after myself.

436
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.120
What's my strategy for keeping myself healthy mentally,
physically,

437
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.560
already specific,
very tangible skills.

438
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:41.480
Things that you can be doing that make all the difference in the battle for

439
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:42.314
balance,

440
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.910
but that require perhaps they require you to get good at them.

441
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:53.650
And then the fourth and final step in the baby proof method is perseverance.

442
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.690
How did you persevere?

443
00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.870
How were you keep going when not if when you reach a point that you want to give

444
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:08.210
up,
when things seem like they're too hard,

445
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.560
that inevitable moment,
Martin Luther King,

446
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.780
the 29th time he was arrested,

447
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.250
how does he convince himself to keep going to keep trying?

448
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.010
Viktor Frankl,
how does he,

449
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:27.011
despite every day all the evidence to the contrary themselves that it's worth

450
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:32.930
fighting for to keep going.
Picture,

451
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:38.780
practice,
prepare,
picture,
prepare,
practice,
persevere.

452
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.620
This is something I do with my clients and I've created an online course to take

453
00:34:44.621 --> 00:34:49.621
that all over the world so people can access this process that is so empowering

454
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:54.490
in a way that fits in with their lifestyle is really easy and I'm really excited

455
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.600
that Google are going to be piloting this course sometime in the new year and I

456
00:34:58.601 --> 00:35:01.540
think Christie is going to talk a little bit about that at the end,

457
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:06.010
which is disappeared,
but she'll be back to do that.
But back to the present.

458
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.870
What can I give you?

459
00:35:07.871 --> 00:35:12.871
What can I leave you with that you can start doing right from the moment moment

460
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.410
you leave this office.

461
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:20.380
So I've got one suggestion for you.
It's just one controllable,

462
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.030
but I want you to experiment with

463
00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.720
getting up early.
What time do you all get up?

464
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.050
What time do you get up?
What time do you get up your headlines and chocolate?

465
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.713
What time do you get up?

466
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.530
Seven 15 what time do you get up at six six o'clock what time my daughter gets

467
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:46.380
off.
He shouldn't be
anyone else.

468
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:51.160
[inaudible]

469
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.970
eight o'clock,
eight o'clock.

470
00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.970
Whatever ties that you ordinarily start your day.

471
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.440
I want you to get up
one hour.

472
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.880
This is the goal.
We're going to start with a smaller challenge.

473
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.630
We'll start with a smaller challenge to explain that in a moment.

474
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.240
Getting up early.
I love it because everybody gets up,
right?

475
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.690
We all make a decision about what time you set our alarm for.

476
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.540
We all make a decision about how many times we pressed snooze.

477
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.610
How many smoothers raise your hand if for some reason.

478
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.470
Are you sure he being honest?
Hands up if you sneeze.
Sneezer

479
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.940
I read a blog about getting up early.

480
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:59.580
It has been undoubtedly the most successful blog I've ever written.

481
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.780
It has so many damn book which shows me it's touching a nerve and I called the

482
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:06.450
blog when I first posted it.

483
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.720
Never pressed snooze ever and it had such a brilliant,

484
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.120
in some cases quite stridor reaction to it,

485
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:20.360
but it got people thinking because right from the moment you start the day gives

486
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:22.680
you that sense of making a decision,

487
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.710
making a decision about what time you get up.

488
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.690
Getting up early is a controllable.
Everybody,

489
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:35.760
let me tell you just re of the many reasons why for me it's one of the most

490
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:37.380
important controllable from my life.

491
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.340
The first one is it gives me me time,

492
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:47.150
that essential time at a time in the day where,

493
00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.300
but the only time in the day over which I've attached to control it means even

494
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:56.400
if that me time is 10 minutes,
15 minutes,

495
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:02.210
I have time to think about myself in a way that prepares and allows me to be

496
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:06.450
available for everybody else for the rest of the day.

497
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.790
It is a me time.
That is so secret that on the odd occasion where I think,

498
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.690
Oh a lie tomorrow a voice in my head says,

499
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.400
how could you do that to me?

500
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.690
How could you take away the most important bit of my day?

501
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.920
I am in,
you can ask.
My husband drives him.

502
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.730
Had I have gotten to the point where it's so beneficial to me,

503
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.380
I'm almost incapable of lying and it is.

504
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:36.460
So how often important to me.

505
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.210
The second reason is it's a moment in a day,

506
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:45.130
every day where I can have perspective on that day,

507
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:49.750
on my week,
I can look,
there's some distance and say,

508
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.780
what's working?
What am I doing today?

509
00:38:52.781 --> 00:38:56.320
What have I been doing the last few weeks that's working well for me?

510
00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:01.150
That's making me feel good like I'm in control and what's not working?

511
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.210
What is it that I need to change?

512
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.470
And it gives me that moment of reflection to come up with solutions,

513
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.340
to come up with different things to try and trust me in.

514
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.930
Create the space for solutions and ideas.

515
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:17.561
Hey,

516
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:22.561
that's what you guys do here in create space for ideas for innovation.

517
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.950
You will come up with solutions,
different things to try

518
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.170
and the third and final reason is it helps to keep me connected with the big

519
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.770
picture so hard.

520
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.480
Remember the big picture when you're busy all the time,

521
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.200
completely working hard,
overwhelmed,

522
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.210
being stretched from one task to the next.
The big picture of this,
just the why,

523
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:50.770
why you doing this?
Why do you have a family?
Why do you care?

524
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.730
Why are you still working when you know that you would also like to be with your

525
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:59.170
family,
what does work give you and connecting to that on a regular basis.

526
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.310
It makes all the difference.
When I turn around my six year old and I say,

527
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:08.770
I can't come to this event today because Mommy's got to go and do this piece of

528
00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:13.000
work,
but don't worry when I see it in a weekend we'll do x,
y,

529
00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:18.001
and zed and I do not feel guilty about number of things that I say no to because

530
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:24.931
in my head always as a compass is the big picture is the life I want for my

531
00:40:26.651 --> 00:40:29.590
children,
to my family and for myself.

532
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:35.440
There are just three of many reasons why getting up early is such a powerful

533
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:40.270
controllable for me,
and I want you to experiment with it yourself.

534
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.560
So I want to set you a challenge.
I've called it

535
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.440
the 30 30 challenge,
super easy,

536
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.950
whatever time you get up,
even if it is four o'clock,

537
00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.680
set your alarm to get up 30 minutes earlier,
but there are rules,

538
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.533
no work.

539
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.220
This is not a license to extend your working day.

540
00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.060
That is worse than lying in bed to the Loveman and presence.

541
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.560
No work,
no devices,

542
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.950
no news
sounds so simple,

543
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.350
very hard to do.
But it's a skill practice.

544
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:31.780
30 minutes earlier for 30 days,
the next 30 days.

545
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.860
This is my to you.

546
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.880
What would you do with that time?
Look at the big picture.

547
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.310
Think about the week you've got coming up.
What's working?

548
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.600
What isn't working?
What could you change?
What could you do differently?

549
00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.100
Controllables ends with the step of the way.

550
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.820
Good luck and let me know how it goes.

551
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.880
