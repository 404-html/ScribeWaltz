Please join me in welcoming Patrice

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.040
<v 0>Hi,
Google Seattle.</v>

4
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.230
I live lively audiences,

5
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:26.270
so please feel free to and I amen.

6
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.840
Um,
this is the introduction to the book.

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.840
We are stardust days.

8
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:38.841
After the election of 2016 Asha sent me a link to talk by Afro Physicist Neil

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
Degrasse Tyson.
We have to have hope.
She says to me across 3000 miles,

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.640
she and Brooklyn,
me and Los Angeles,

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.480
we listened together as degrasse Tyson explains that the very atoms and

12
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.920
molecules and our bodies are traceable to the crucibles and the centers of stars

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.100
that once upon a time exploded into get gas clouds and those got gas clouds

14
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.660
formed other stars and those stars possessed the divine right mix of properties

15
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.290
needed to create not only planets,
including our own,

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.530
but also people including us,
me and her.

17
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.430
He is saying that not only are we in the universe,

18
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.050
but that the universe is in us.

19
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:23.220
He is saying that we human beings are literally made out of startups.

20
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.670
And I know what I hear degrasse Tyson say this,

21
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.870
that he is telling the truth because I've seen it since I was a child.
The magic,

22
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.160
the stardust,
the stardust,
we are on the lives of people I come from.

23
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.620
I watched it and the Labor of my mother,

24
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:41.190
a Jehovah's Witness and a woman who worked two and sometimes three jobs at a

25
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:45.900
time,
keeping other people's children,
working the reception desks at gyms,

26
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.530
telemarketing,
doing anything and everything for 16 hours a day.

27
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.970
The whole of my childhood and the Van Nuys Body or where we lived,
my mother,

28
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.570
Cocoa Brown and smooth.
This is owned by her family for the children she had.

29
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.600
She had as a very young and unmarried woman.

30
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.900
My mother never gave up despite never making a living wage.

31
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.400
I saw it and the thin brown face of my father,
a boy out of Cajun country,

32
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.720
a wounded healer who's addictions were born of a world that did not love him and

33
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:17.490
told him so.
Not once,
but constantly.
My father who always came back,

34
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.190
who never stopped trying to be a better version of himself.

35
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.720
There were no mirrors for,

36
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730
and I knew it because I am the 13th generation progeny of the people who survive

37
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:29.730
the holes of slave ships,
survived the chains,
the whips,

38
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:33.520
the months laying in their own shit and piss the human beings legislator.

39
00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:37.920
That's not human beings who watched their names,
their languages,
their goddesses,

40
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:40.980
and Gods,
the arc of their dances and beats of their songs,

41
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.490
The majesty of their dreams,
their families snatched up and stolen,

42
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.350
disassembled and discarded.

43
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.910
And despite this built language and honored God and create a movement and upheld

44
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.740
love,
what could they be?
But start us,
these people who refuse to die,

45
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.130
who refuse to accept the idea that their lives did not matter,

46
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.550
that their children's lives.

47
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.413
<v 1>This did not matter.</v>

48
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.460
<v 2>Well,
first I need to start my thinking you.
Um,
it's for me in particular.</v>

49
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.180
I will be,
I will start with a personal note of that.

50
00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:21.330
That's very meaningful as a queer woman of color,
as an immigrant,

51
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:24.030
as I mentioned to you,
this for me is,
it's a big honor,
so I appreciate that.

52
00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:28.120
Thank you.
Yeah.
Um,
I actually want to talk a little bit about,
um,

53
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.980
you start by the story by history,
talking about your family,
um,

54
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:34.770
in particular in your mom and your brother and your father,

55
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.780
and you focus a lot on this idea of collective responsibility versus personal

56
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:43.230
responsibility.
Um,
so I'd actually ask you to talk a little bit more about that.

57
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.160
Why do you believe that this focus that we have on personal responsibility,

58
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.040
it can be so detrimental,
particularly the black individuals?

59
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.000
And what is there to gain from moving to this idea of collectivity?

60
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.490
<v 0>That's a great question.
Um,
I,</v>

61
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.280
because I was literally just talking to a reporter about this,
um,

62
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.270
when I got off the plane,
which is,
um,

63
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.420
for many of us who grew up in poor neighborhoods who grew up in poverty,

64
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.320
um,
the experience we had,
what was it was our fault.

65
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.840
We were blamed for our family,
unable our families being unable to feed us.

66
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.100
We are blamed for our families addictions.
We are blamed for,
uh,

67
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.350
the states coming after our family.

68
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.970
We were blamed for so many things that had everything to do with a system that

69
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.180
is literally created to harm and decimate communities.

70
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.330
And so the question becomes who is accountable?
Um,

71
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.930
is it the people who are both of the margins,

72
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.670
the people who have experienced some of the most suffering?
Or is it a system?

73
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.520
Uh,
is it local government?
Is it state government?
Is it federal government?
Um,
uh,

74
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.820
and as we live in under this current administration,
um,

75
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.860
how do we hold it accountable?

76
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.980
How do we hold local government accountable to actually produce,
um,

77
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.550
laws that will support human beings,

78
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.290
produce policies that will support human beings?
Um,
and how do we,
um,

79
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:11.950
challenged the idea that a young mother who,
um,

80
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.910
had a child at 16 deserves to be kicked out of her home,

81
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:20.911
deserves to not receive the type of support and aid just because she had

82
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.760
children out of wedlock or just because she had a child at a young age?
I mean,

83
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.670
these are the kinds of questions that we need to ask ourselves.

84
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.650
And I think what happens,

85
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:34.651
because we live in a culture and an America in particular that really values

86
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:39.580
personal respondent's responsibility really values the idea of pulling yourself

87
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:44.140
up by your bootstraps.
Um,
well that only actually works for certain people.

88
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.360
Um,
and the pulling up by your bootstraps,
um,

89
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.010
is designed for certain people and not designed for others.

90
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.490
And when we can have an honest conversation about the design,

91
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.740
then we can have an honest conversation what it should look like,
um,

92
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.540
how it should look differently.
And so,
um,

93
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.590
not only am I challenging the idea of personal responsibility,
um,
which I,

94
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.590
which I think is different than asking people to be accountable.

95
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.860
I want to like differentiate,
differentiate those terms.
Um,

96
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.530
someone being responsible,
um,
for,
um,

97
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.220
their own poverty.
Um,
no,
but someone being accountable,

98
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.380
being accountable to their family,
right.

99
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:28.700
My mother was accountable to us cause she worked 16 hours a day.
Um,

100
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.310
but she wasn't responsible for her poverty.

101
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.480
And I think we have to be able to differentiate that.

102
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.650
And the last thing I'll say on this is,
um,
it,

103
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.110
well it will take all of us at has to be all of us to change the system,

104
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.900
to change this place to collectively come together and make a decision as many

105
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:52.910
of us say.
And black lives matter.
When black people get free,

106
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.800
everybody else gets a little bit more free.

107
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.590
<v 2>Um,
on the,
on the black lives matter movement in particular,
the,</v>

108
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.980
the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of if his shooter,

109
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.740
it's clearly a bit unimportant moment in that movement.
Um,

110
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.720
can you speak a little bit as to why that,
that moment,
uh,

111
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.060
resonated with you so powerfully when it did?

112
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.280
<v 0>Yes.
And the,</v>

113
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.450
and what you're going to notice is I'm always going to kind of take a few steps

114
00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:22.870
back because the moment is the moment,
but there's some,

115
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.320
there's things that lead up to the moment that actually makes that moment,

116
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:31.150
the moment.
So for me,
um,
it was,
uh,

117
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.860
uh,
I come from a generation,
I'm born in 83 and so I come from a generation that,

118
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.260
uh,
witnessed,
um,
Reagan,
um,

119
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.150
witnessed,
um,
the bushes,

120
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.370
witnessed the Clintons and,
and those presidencies,

121
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.520
what we got to see was a ratcheting up of the war on drugs are ratcheting up of

122
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:55.740
mass incarceration,
um,

123
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.730
and ratcheting up mass criminalization of very particular communities,

124
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:05.110
black communities in particular.
Uh,
and as I grew up,

125
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.033
um,

126
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.660
and as many of us grow up in this job and this particular era and age group,

127
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.530
um,

128
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.530
we're the word sort of the sacrificed ones where the children who are being

129
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:21.160
impacted by deindustrialization with children who are being impacted by the

130
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:24.310
militarized policing.
And so once we get to Trayvon Martin,

131
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:27.040
so many things have happened.
92,

132
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.810
Rodney King Oscar grant has happened.
And then Trayvon,

133
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.510
although not killed by law enforcement,
he's killed by vigilante,

134
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:38.950
who's empowered by state,
that empowers law enforcement.
And so,

135
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.143
um,

136
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:45.210
I didn't think that George Zimmerman was going to get off then.

137
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.800
I was like,
you killed Trayvon Martin.
We all knew that.

138
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.470
Jerry knew that I didn't think he was gonna get murdered,

139
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.230
but I definitely didn't think he was gonna get to go home.

140
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.960
And when he did on July 13th of 2013,

141
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.170
I was very clear that that wasn't going to be the period to the story,
um,

142
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.200
that we had to do more,
um,
that I had to do more personally.

143
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.500
And as I heard Sabrina Fulton Trayvon's Martin's mother specifically speak out,

144
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.600
um,
uh,
through tears,

145
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:20.100
through grief and call on the people of this country,
um,

146
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.940
to show up for her child to show up for her.
Um,

147
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.510
I just felt like it was incredibly important.
And so I,

148
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.120
I was on social media,
like many of us are,
um,

149
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.560
angry and upset and trying to figure out how to understand what was happening.

150
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.350
And I came across a good friends' Facebook posts,
Alicia Garza,

151
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.120
and she wrote black lives matter.

152
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.780
And then I put a Hashtag on it and Alicia was like,
what's the Hashtag?

153
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.180
And I was like,
it's this thing that can go viral.
Um,

154
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.180
but I'm also a trained organizer,
so I didn't just,

155
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.610
I wasn't just interested in an online campaign.
Um,

156
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.800
I was interested in how we translated black lives matter to the ground and how

157
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:06.570
it really could be a grassroots movement that can bubble up,
change the world,

158
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:08.970
change the country.
And on July 15th,

159
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:13.170
when we solidified black lives matter is a political project I wrote on social

160
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:14.490
media again,
I said,
hey,

161
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.460
Alicia and I have started this project called black lives matter.

162
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.280
And we hope that it will impact more than we can ever imagine.

163
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.350
One of the things that you talk about a lot in your book is taking that Hashtag

164
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.430
you say that I think Hashtag [inaudible] movement.

165
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.380
So essentially creating power under this umbrella of black lives matter.

166
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.170
What has that journey been like?
What are some of the lessons you've learned?

167
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:36.960
Challenges,
victories.
Well,

168
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:39.960
we have to remember that black lives matter really started organically.

169
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:44.450
It started online,
it's organic moment and it was very quickly,
um,

170
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.030
galvanized into a political project.
Really.
Those,

171
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:50.190
that first year was nurturing it.

172
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.310
Having people talk about black lives matter and the organization's at their

173
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:57.210
offices.
Um,
having,
um,
a lot of like conference calls,

174
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:01.090
that's how do we use this,
taking it onto the streets during protests.
Uh,

175
00:11:01.091 --> 00:11:05.640
but I would say that the heights of a BLM or where it becomes,

176
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.930
um,
worldwide is after the non indictment of Darrel Wilson.

177
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.930
And,
uh,

178
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.440
after Mike Brown's killer is not indicted,

179
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.800
that is the first time it goes viral on social media.

180
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.870
And I remember being like,
we have to do more.
Um,

181
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.730
we have to figure out what's the next step,
what's the next angle?
And,
um,

182
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.160
600 of us went and did a black lives matter freedom ride.

183
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.690
And we drove into Saint Louis.
And before we drove in,
we called folks,
you know,

184
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.650
uh,
folks let us know what we could come in and we're not just showing up to

185
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:44.830
people's neighborhoods.
And,
um,
and that,
um,
uh,

186
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.430
on that three day journey,
because it was only three days,
uh,

187
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.760
there was two commitments we made.

188
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:53.980
The first commitment was a show up for the people of Saint Louis.
Um,

189
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.300
to let them know that we're not going to allow for,
um,

190
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.200
Ferguson PD and every other municipality,
uh,

191
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.040
law enforcement is fatality to treat this community this way without us
watching,

192
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.710
witnessing and going back and telling our communities.

193
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.150
But the second thing that we said,
um,
that,
uh,

194
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.840
we wanted to make sure we did as go back home and organize and build what we

195
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:19.420
would then build,
which is the black lives matter global network,

196
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:24.421
which is an organization of 40 chapters around the globe here in the u s and

197
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:25.900
Canada and the United Kingdom.

198
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.550
One of the things that you discussed on the black lives matter in particular is

199
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:35.380
this idea of creating a Hashtag that people would be able would embrace.

200
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.060
And the word black ends up being sort of a big point of salient when it comes to

201
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:44.730
it.
And more.
I think more recently in the tech community we've had,
um,

202
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.370
one of diversity eat or say that if you have 12,
I think it's white,

203
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.180
blue eyed man in a room.
It's a diverse room because people have different ideas.

204
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.060
So I wanted you to speak a little bit about intersectionality,

205
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:56.530
which is such a big part of your book,

206
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:01.420
but also how do we have a genuine conversation about intersectionality,
um,

207
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.810
without it becoming an all lives matter conversation?

208
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.470
Like how do we actually bring that in a way that is genuine,
right?

209
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.880
How do you have a conversation and practice about intersectionality without

210
00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:15.550
white washing it?
Yes.
Yes.
Cause that can happen.

211
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.100
And um,
what,

212
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.160
what is important as we understand where words come from and that words,

213
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.890
what's been really interesting about this administration as they basically made

214
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:31.660
words,
um,
uh,
what's the word?
Meaningless.
Meaningless.

215
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.540
You could say,
I hate all Edwards.

216
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.570
And then the next breath you could say,
I'm not a racist.

217
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.150
That doesn't even make sense.
Right?

218
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:46.690
But becomes an argument not just in media,

219
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.320
but it also becomes the argument and people's relationships and friendships and

220
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.880
all that guy said,
I could say this,
it's still not be a racist.
Um,

221
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.200
and I think,
uh,

222
00:13:56.201 --> 00:14:00.940
with enter the word intersectionality really comes from a woman named Kimberly

223
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.140
Crenshaw.
And she created it because she was trying to challenge the conversation

224
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.000
specifically in the black community,
um,

225
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.430
that the only people who have the right to talk about,
um,

226
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.720
black folks freedom is cis black men.

227
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.490
And she was really trying to challenge the idea that,
um,
if we're,

228
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:21.550
if we are going to fight on behalf of black,
black people,

229
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.220
we have to fight on behalf of black girls and women as well.
Um,

230
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.250
and that there is a very specific type of experience that black women have and

231
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:32.110
relationship to race.

232
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:37.380
And that Patriarchy is a part of racism when it comes to black women.

233
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.080
And that if we don't have those conversations,
but more importantly,

234
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:42.790
if we don't practice differently,

235
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.720
we're going to just end up in the very same cycle that we've been in and not

236
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:50.950
gaining the things that we really want to gain.
So it's important I,

237
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.750
if you value,
uh,
the lives of people,
um,

238
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.780
this is a conversation about what we value.

239
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.770
If we value that certain people's lives need to be prioritized because we've

240
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:07.880
seen that be de prioritize.
If we value that human,

241
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.630
all human beings deserve to be treated well with dignity,
with care,
um,

242
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.970
then we're going to be able to have more nuanced conversations about not just

243
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:20.480
black lives matter,
but means to women's march time's up.

244
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:22.250
I mean all the immigrants rights movement,

245
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:24.620
all these movements are in relationship to one another.

246
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.710
And I think it's important,
um,

247
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.280
that we sometimes we get caught up and the rhetoric of politics.
Um,

248
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:34.940
and I like to,
to reel it back a bit and remind people of values,

249
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.610
what are our values and,
and that,
um,

250
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.950
is often the place where it opens up something new for people to have a

251
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:47.060
different type of conversation about these things that often can feel very

252
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:48.350
challenging to talk about

253
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.830
<v 2>on the,
on the issue of black women in particular,
um,
the,</v>

254
00:15:53.831 --> 00:15:56.440
with the election of Trump and is one of the things you mentioned your book is

255
00:15:56.441 --> 00:16:00.310
that you felt particularly powerless because 95 96% of black women didn't vote

256
00:16:00.311 --> 00:16:03.640
for Trump.
Um,
and with the Jones' election,

257
00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:08.140
this idea that black women essentially like saved,
um,
the state of Alabama,

258
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.800
um,
means

259
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.560
do you think that this is a pivotal moment of,

260
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.880
of looking at black women as a part of electoral power?

261
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.720
Or do you think that they sort of just as a passing concern now since we had

262
00:16:22.721 --> 00:16:25.810
these consecutive elections or the numbers were so stark?

263
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.990
<v 0>I think,
you know,</v>

264
00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:32.280
in a lot of ways black women historically have always been at the helm of

265
00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:33.114
movements.

266
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:38.300
We've always been at the sort of intersection of both trying to save our

267
00:16:39.451 --> 00:16:42.400
families and save the world.
And um,

268
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.510
what we're seeing and what we saw with the election of 45 and with the election

269
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.470
of,
um,
the,

270
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:54.471
the getting Roy Moore not into office is black women galvanizing power and being

271
00:16:55.621 --> 00:16:56.940
strategic about it.
You know,

272
00:16:56.941 --> 00:17:00.450
I think there was a big fight because people were like,
well,

273
00:17:00.451 --> 00:17:01.590
why did you go for Jones?

274
00:17:01.591 --> 00:17:04.530
And people were [inaudible] and folks had to counter that and say,
actually,

275
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.390
this was strategic.
You know,

276
00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:09.870
this is the other person that was running and we need to make sure we didn't

277
00:17:09.871 --> 00:17:14.260
have this other person and charge.
So this idea,
um,

278
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:18.060
I think after that happens that black people just sort of like naturally do

279
00:17:18.061 --> 00:17:21.390
these things are we don't have a plan and there's no strategy or it's all

280
00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:24.450
organic.
Um,
sometimes those things are true,

281
00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:28.740
but oftentimes people have a strategy like Rosa parks.

282
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:34.190
It's very upsetting that people think that Rosa parks just sat down on a chair

283
00:17:34.741 --> 00:17:36.420
and then some white guy came over and she was like,

284
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.650
I'm not going to get up today.
It's not how it happened.
Y'All,

285
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.630
there was a strategy behind the,
and she was a strategist.

286
00:17:42.631 --> 00:17:46.620
I mean she was one of our most brilliant strategists and we don't hear that very

287
00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:49.200
often.
We don't,
we don't get that story,

288
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.930
get this very ageist,

289
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:57.110
weird like feminizing story of how she just happened to be too old and tired to

290
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:02.220
get up.
Um,

291
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.240
rather than they sat and rooms trying to figure out how are they going to

292
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:09.060
boycott this system that literally got most,

293
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.600
almost all the black populations to work.
And to school,

294
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:17.580
how do you convince black people to not get on a bus that can jeopardize their

295
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:19.620
jobs and their,
and their schooling.

296
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.890
And that moment with Rosa parks,

297
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.830
not getting up is just the moment.

298
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.810
But there was all these other moments before that got us there.
And so I just,

299
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.990
I think that's important because,
um,
I,

300
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.220
part of what the book is trying to do is also really let people know that

301
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:42.720
there's a strategy.
And so much of the time that we,

302
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:47.100
that black lives matter has been developing.
There has been all this criticism,

303
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:50.970
well what,
what's the,
what are you all really what,
what are your goals?

304
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.110
Um,
and this book is trying to lay the record straight.

305
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.970
So I,
um,

306
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.700
I want to make sure that we have a lot of time for questions from the floor.

307
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.920
So I have one last question I wanted make sure I ask you.
Um,

308
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.960
and then we'll open up.

309
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:07.600
So she want to start lining on the microphone and we'll do that.
Um,

310
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.060
question.
One of the things that I,
uh,
that is,
uh,

311
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.600
a theme that you draw for the entirety of the book is this idea of your

312
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:18.660
community and you're always pulling people.

313
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:20.880
And I think one of the things that you said that I thought it was very powerful

314
00:19:20.881 --> 00:19:24.900
is that they wouldn't let me be erased.
That will never let them be race.
Um,

315
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.230
can you speak a little bit as to why black community in particular is so

316
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:32.340
important to you?
Like what is it about your community that you feel is,

317
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.540
is necessary?
Um,
and,
and sort of the world we're living in today?

318
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.140
Yeah,
I mean,
I think this is a simple answer,

319
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:45.141
which is I grew up around some of the most brilliant and talented and powerful

320
00:19:47.131 --> 00:19:51.960
people,
my siblings,
my parents.
And yet,
um,
they receive a very,

321
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:54.390
very little support for their gifts,
their talents.

322
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.220
And that is solely based off of race and racism and classism.
And so,

323
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:04.050
um,
to witness that,
um,
I also ended up,

324
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.640
and I talk about this in the book is I ended up being sort of plucked from my

325
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.690
elementary school and labeled as gifted.
And so I go to a separate,

326
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:17.310
totally separate system than my siblings do,
which what,

327
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.100
which happens to make me see how other people live.
Um,

328
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.540
cause you don't know how other people live unless you go see it.
Um,

329
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.900
and in that experience,
you know,
going from my own neighborhood,

330
00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:31.890
which was a small suburb outside of the inner city of Los Angeles,

331
00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:33.960
that was mostly poor working class.

332
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.700
I'm surrounded by white suburb and that's where I ended up going to school.

333
00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:43.701
I got to see firsthand just how classes in plays out,

334
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:48.850
just how racism plays out and that just based off of your,

335
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.570
um,

336
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.570
socio economic background or your race that your entire life changes.

337
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.290
Um,
and what's predicted for you.
And so,
you know,

338
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.590
I always say my mother would be like the most amazing therapist.

339
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.520
She's like the person who I learned how to have important,

340
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.870
courageous conversations from.
Um,

341
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.550
and yet she was relegated to menial jobs,
um,

342
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.930
because she never got,
uh,
um,
uh,
middle school diploma,
high school diploma.

343
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.060
And so there's these things that,

344
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.390
these barriers that exist for poor folks that are solely because people don't

345
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:28.780
have money.
And I think for,

346
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.990
for the community I grew up in black communities in particular,
um,

347
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.040
there's this longing that I have for us to be fully seen and fully realized

348
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.330
because I know what gifts we have

349
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:51.090
black lives matter and do with the fact that people rightly or wrongly get very

350
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.273
antagonized

351
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.590
the opposite,
right?

352
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.720
And a lot of different ways it depends on the audience,
depends on the person.

353
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.980
Um,
you know,

354
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.690
some days I choose not to even answer those questions.
Um,

355
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.620
just for my own sanity because the reality is,

356
00:22:17.621 --> 00:22:21.310
and for folks who are in the room who are clear on the fence around all lives

357
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:24.890
matter,
black lives matter,
all lives do better.
Um,

358
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.070
that's actually not the argument right now.
Um,

359
00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:30.880
and black lives matter is really just black lives matter too.

360
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.470
And so black lives matter is not about exclusion.

361
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.410
It's about focusing and does it.

362
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:43.411
A community who has spent 500 years in this country get to decide how we focus

363
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:49.471
our energy and aren't we allowed to ask people allies to join us in this fight?

364
00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.290
Um,
and I think,
um,

365
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.180
what I try to do in those conversations is really challenged people.

366
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.590
Um,
sometimes gently,

367
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:03.610
sometimes not so gently about what kind of world do you want to live in?

368
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.010
Do you want to live in a world where,
where,

369
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.460
where the state is allowed to execute people and get away with it?

370
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.990
Do you want to live in a world where someone can get stopped for a broken tail

371
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:16.270
light ended up in jail and then not survive it?

372
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.980
Do you want to live in a world where people only because they don't have

373
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.690
physical papers are allowed to be ripped from their families and deported back

374
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:29.740
to their so called countries?
What kind of world do we want to live in?

375
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.230
That's what black lives matter is asking us.

376
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.010
It's asking us to think about the world we want to live in.
And,
okay,

377
00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:40.780
if you want to live in a world,
um,
where terrible things happen to human beings,

378
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.110
then maybe I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

379
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.410
So my question is,
aside from your work,

380
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.480
what's one piece of literature or art or entertainment that right now in this

381
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:56.570
moment that we're in really gives you hope for the future?

382
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.260
That's a good one.
Um,

383
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.930
well I really love Octavia Butler.

384
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.200
Other people in the audience.

385
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.950
<v 3>Thank you.
Appreciate it.</v>

386
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:16.640
<v 0>Um,
uh,
although it's kind of sinister,
sometimes morbid,</v>

387
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:17.670
um,

388
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:22.670
she opens up a portal around how to have really hard conversations about race

389
00:24:23.851 --> 00:24:25.580
and class and gender,
um,

390
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.940
and this most at some of the most beautiful and courageous and innovative ways,

391
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.850
um,
and,
and more pop culture.

392
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.740
I definitely think the work that Issa Rae's doing and Lena Awakens doing in

393
00:24:37.741 --> 00:24:39.660
particular,
um,

394
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.110
it's very exciting and powerful and fresh and innovative.

395
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.120
Um,
yeah,
that's what I got for you.

396
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.180
So thank you again for coming.

397
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.130
<v 3>Um,
I understand that you were awarded a peace prize.
Hello.</v>

398
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.820
Can you talk a little bit about that?
So

399
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.440
congratulations.
Can you talk a little bit about,
um,

400
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.800
what you've seen in,

401
00:25:07.801 --> 00:25:12.720
in how the movement has been received outside the u s versus inside the US?

402
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.730
<v 0>Yeah.
You always liked something better when it's outside.
Um,</v>

403
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:23.020
the black lives matter global network received the Sydney Peace Prize last year.

404
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.090
Um,
very amazing.
I had no idea what it was before I received it.

405
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.480
And when we received it,
I looked it up and I was like,
oh,

406
00:25:31.481 --> 00:25:36.220
this is a very big deal.
And,
um,

407
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.030
folks like Naomi Klein,
I've received it.
That's when two,

408
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:42.460
two has received it and I'm Chomsky's received it.
Uh,

409
00:25:42.461 --> 00:25:45.460
and I think we were that literally the youngest people who've ever received the

410
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:49.170
Sydney peace prize.
Um,
and we were,
um,

411
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.410
not only welcomed by the country of Australia,

412
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.170
we were welcomed by black folks in Australia,
aboriginal populations,

413
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:03.040
first nations people.
Um,
and also really welcomed by the media.

414
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.100
I mean it was very,
very different experience.
Um,

415
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.330
then the type of experience we've had here,
um,
starting black lives matter.

416
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.370
And I think it also challenged this idea of us being a terrorist group or

417
00:26:14.371 --> 00:26:18.970
organization.
Um,
because someone wrote about it,
they're like,

418
00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:20.260
black lives matter,
just want a peace prize.

419
00:26:20.261 --> 00:26:24.640
You could stop calling him a terrorist organization.
Um,
but it was,
uh,

420
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.430
it's been very powerful,
um,
to

421
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.890
the folks of Australia.
We're looking to us,
um,

422
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:38.410
around how they deal with race and racism in their country.
Um,
and um,

423
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.370
how to really have a new type of movements,
um,

424
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:47.520
that that's hopefully going to bubble up there.
Uh,
and that was,
um,
more,

425
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.290
more than inspiring,
more than I could ever have imagined.
Um,

426
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:55.870
and I'm very grateful that our network was honored with the,
um,

427
00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:00.130
the peace prize,
but actually want to follow up on the term terrorist.
Yeah.

428
00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.730
Cause it's a term that is very important in your book and the title when they

429
00:27:03.731 --> 00:27:05.950
call.
Exactly.
That's how you know it's important.

430
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:12.090
Can you speak a little bit as to why that word has so much power?
Well,
um,

431
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.170
raise your hand if you or people in your community I've ever been called a

432
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:19.460
terrorist or Shanghai.
Now look around.

433
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.510
Right?
Um,

434
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.630
so the first time black lives matter is called a terrorist organization.

435
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.980
There's two things that come up for me.
The first one is,

436
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.730
um,
devastation.
Um,

437
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.750
because simply I'm with these folks every single day.

438
00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:46.190
I know exactly what we're doing.
I know what type of sacrifice where giving.
Um,

439
00:27:46.191 --> 00:27:48.230
the other is,
um,

440
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.860
a sense of serious fear because the moment the government starts calling people

441
00:27:54.051 --> 00:27:59.030
terrorists,
that means there's going to be a war on the people.
And so,

442
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.540
um,

443
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.990
I think what's important in this book and the conversation I was trying to have

444
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.630
is what do we mean when we,

445
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.980
when we mean terrorist and who ends up being labeled as such?

446
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:14.570
And what we've seen for especially for black people in this country is whenever

447
00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:17.660
we decide that we're going to fight for our freedom,

448
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:22.350
that we're going to fight for our dignity,
for,
um,
um,
uh,

449
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.890
we're going to fight for our humanity.

450
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.930
That there's a label that's slapped on us or a community to undermine our

451
00:28:29.931 --> 00:28:34.040
efforts,
but also to criminalize our efforts.
And so,
um,

452
00:28:34.041 --> 00:28:37.760
what we've seen in,
and I'll just ask another question of the audience.

453
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.940
How many of you have heard of the black identity extremist label?

454
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.820
Yeah.
Who made that up?
What,

455
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.470
yeah,
FBI,
it was probably Jeff session,
I'll be with the FBI.

456
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.650
He's definitely defending that identity,

457
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.850
an identity that was literally crafted and created by the FBI and the UN and

458
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:10.980
many of us saw it and a leaked report,
um,
that,
uh,

459
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.260
that came out in August,

460
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:18.260
2017 and the report literally is claiming that black activists have a new

461
00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:25.491
identity in which we are more violent towards law enforcement.

462
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:27.540
Um,

463
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.540
and for many of us that have studied movements or have elders in the movement,

464
00:29:32.581 --> 00:29:36.460
like Angela Davis,
Ericka Huggins,
um,

465
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.510
in our conversations with them,
they're like,
yeah,

466
00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:43.060
this is the beginning of what it looks like to be criminalized by the state for

467
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:46.240
your activism.
Um,
similar to what cointelpro did.

468
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:48.790
And so the terrorist conversation is,

469
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.690
I'm interrogating this idea that black activists,

470
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:55.870
people who are literally trying to fight for American democracy are terrorists.

471
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.200
And yet the people who are trying to change and reform are terrorizing our

472
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:06.400
communities.
Um,
and,
and how much we have to be,

473
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.500
um,
challenging those terms,
um,
challenging that language,

474
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.560
um,
and showing up differently,
I think in this moment.

475
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.050
What is different from 30,

476
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:20.920
40 years ago is there were no elected officials trying to fight for the Panther

477
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:25.660
party.
Um,
now given the,
given what we know about cointelpro,

478
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.360
given that we know that they assassinated people rip families apart and ripped a

479
00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:33.100
really powerful movement apart.
Um,
there are,
um,
elected officials,

480
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.510
specifically the congressional black caucus that is standing up to the FBI

481
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:39.790
around this term and congressmen,
woman,

482
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:44.380
Karen Bass has been leading the crusade around that.
Or a couple of questions.

483
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.040
<v 4>You talked a little bit about the [inaudible] of the black lives matter Hashtag.</v>

484
00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:53.710
Yeah.
Um,
and so I guess I'm interested in,

485
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.980
so like in recent times Trump has kind of taken over news and like you hear a

486
00:31:00.551 --> 00:31:04.450
lot about white supremacy and you hear a lot about these other things that kind

487
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:08.050
of stuck up all of the media attention.
Yeah.
And I'm wondering like,

488
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:13.120
to what extent do you think it's important for black life matter to have that

489
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:17.620
viral aspect and like what,
what,
what do you think are like,

490
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:21.190
what's the future of the black lives matter movement,
um,
in a,

491
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:25.030
in an environment where it becomes more difficult to have a voice?
That's great.

492
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.000
<v 0>That's a great question.
Well,
what I will say is,
um,</v>

493
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.440
sometimes in movements you need to be a little bit more quiet.
Um,

494
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.900
being out there all the time makes you vulnerable and,

495
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.150
and it's made us vulnerable and sometimes that's not always for the best.

496
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:46.570
So I'm going viral is not the goal necessarily.

497
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.950
Um,
it has a great outcome.

498
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.520
I think the better question is how do you sustain us?

499
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.550
How do we sustain ourselves?
Um,

500
00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.650
and especially as we are building out a global network,

501
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.650
how do we create an infrastructure on institution power that can challenge and

502
00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:05.690
power a challenge?
The current Hauer structure.

503
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.940
That's what we're most interested in this moment.

504
00:32:07.941 --> 00:32:12.680
We're interested in the long haul.
Um,
and uh,
I I think,

505
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.230
I think we're onto something.
Um,

506
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.970
and I think we are developing a new type of experiment experiment,

507
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.120
um,
that is centering black folks in particular.

508
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:29.490
Hello.
Thank you for speaking to us today.
You are amazing.
I don't think,
um,

509
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:34.810
I want to ask you a question about how you think capitalism and um,

510
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.790
large capitalist in the CS,
uh,

511
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:42.810
such as Google may affect black lives matter either positively or negatively.

512
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:50.270
Um,
such a good question.
Well,

513
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:53.400
what I will say,
uh,
is,
um,

514
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.800
living in this current infrastructure that we live in that is a capitalist

515
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.890
infrastructure is not sustainable for anybody.
Um,

516
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.400
and as the rich literally get richer and the poor literally get poorer,
um,

517
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.840
we have to have a longterm solution or I'm not only how we're going to save

518
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:10.910
human beings,
but how we're going to save the planet.

519
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:16.510
And we unfortunately have an administration that doesn't believe in climate

520
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:20.210
change.
It like drives me nuts.

521
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:25.220
Y'All were literally burning up in some places and other places are drowning

522
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.890
because,
uh,
the earth's equilibrium is so off.

523
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.203
Um,

524
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.610
and so I think the long term conversation is,
um,

525
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.510
is capitalism as a sustainable model.
And many of us know it's not.
Um,

526
00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:48.380
so what does that mean?
And that I don't have the answer to,

527
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.380
but I have a lot of questions about,
uh,

528
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:54.650
and I think our movement often is trying to figure that out and have questions

529
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:59.420
about,
I think,
you know,
Google is such an interesting place,
right?

530
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.840
It's both.
Um,
it's worldwide.

531
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:04.550
It's a huge corporation.

532
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:08.030
Also will bring one of the co founders of black lives matter to talk to it's

533
00:34:08.031 --> 00:34:12.590
employees.
It's like such an interesting contradiction.
Uh,

534
00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.130
and um,
my hope is that I,

535
00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.570
I'm not going to be able to change Google necessarily,

536
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.310
but I think the hope and this certain moment is to change the hearts and minds

537
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:27.180
of people who work here.
Um,

538
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.890
and how we make decisions about how we relate to the planet and other human

539
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:34.300
beings.
That was beautiful.
Thank you.

540
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:39.920
Um,
let me,
Oh,
there's a question.
No,
please go ahead.

541
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:44.870
I have already spoken to way more men.
Anyone wants,

542
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.290
<v 5>they gone off.
So you mentioned about sort of the strategic goals.
So,</v>

543
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:55.220
um,
specifically what are some of the things that sparked the movement?

544
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:58.130
Right to shy and please do anything.
Some of this violence,

545
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:03.920
do you or does it have shorter doubles either through activism or let's see or

546
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:08.660
changes to do dry and bland on some of the more egregious policing tactics,

547
00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.930
that ridiculous use of force type of uh,
mandates.

548
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.910
Are there the specific goals around that?

549
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:14.591
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

550
00:35:14.591 --> 00:35:18.250
actually I was just on a phone call about it before I got here talking to our

551
00:35:18.251 --> 00:35:19.420
lawyers.
Um,

552
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.930
it's a great question because someone asked me there,

553
00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.890
the old Time magazine asked me the other day and said,
well,

554
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.970
it will ever be a me too of racism.
And I was like,
well,

555
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.230
it's called black lives matter.

556
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.310
But what I think is interesting,

557
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:42.690
I think what he was trying to ask actually what was me too has been successful

558
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:46.890
at literally knocking down some of the biggest power players in Hollywood.

559
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.780
I mean,
people that we never thought would be sort of take it out,
you know,

560
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.540
taken out of Hollywood have been,
um,

561
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:57.360
whether or not they have huge pensions and they could still live their lives.

562
00:35:57.361 --> 00:35:58.440
That's a whole nother question.

563
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:03.240
But symbolically what that has shown us is that sexual assault and violence is

564
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:06.060
not going to be taken lightly anymore.

565
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.100
And he was trying to ask her why,
how come law enforcement hasn't been,

566
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.030
we haven't had the same impact on law enforcement.
And what I did is I said,
well,

567
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:16.440
that's my black lives matter fault.

568
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.750
We've done everything we can to hold that person accountable.
But rather,

569
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:22.290
um,

570
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:27.290
we have to have a larger conversation about the people who keep law enforcement

571
00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:32.220
in power,
elected officials,
um,
county board of supervisors,
uh,

572
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.580
state governors,
the laws,
I mean they're literally,
um,
and the us,

573
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.450
I think there's over 22 a piece off the peace officer bill of rights,
right?

574
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:44.380
Which literally are,
um,

575
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:49.610
a document that gives rights to the peace officer's that pretty much excludes

576
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:52.080
them from being held accountable for their acts.

577
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:56.070
California and Seattle have some of the worst police officer's bill of rights.

578
00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.290
And so much of what we're trying to do is go state by state,
city,

579
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:05.690
by city,
county,
by county,
um,
changing those laws.
Uh,

580
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.660
the first experiment is going to be California because we have some of the most

581
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:14.370
egregious lots,
but also because you have some of those progressive legislators.

582
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:19.590
So can we get enough legislators to say we can't allow this to happen anymore?

583
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:21.630
Can we get enough to stick attorneys to say,

584
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.020
cause within a district attorney's right to prosecute an officer,

585
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.080
but they more often err on not.

586
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.890
So the work I think is that in the next phase specifically around law

587
00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:36.090
enforcement,
violence is trying to change lives.
I think that we've hit it,

588
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.080
we've hit a road,

589
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:42.290
we have to take things to the ballot box and galvanize our movement to push new

590
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:46.980
laws for it.
And it's just a quick follow.
Yeah,
it does it.
Do you have a specific,

591
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:50.950
do you want they use a body camera as I do.
I do.
Um,

592
00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.490
we have cell phones,
so that's one.
Um,

593
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.520
body cameras are millions and millions of dollars and oftentimes that

594
00:38:01.701 --> 00:38:03.930
accountability,
let me flip it.

595
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:08.190
The responsibility is on the officer to turn on the body camera.
Um,

596
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:12.360
so how many times have we seen law enforcement not turn on their body camera?

597
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.560
Almost all the time.
And so,
um,

598
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.110
I think it's an interesting demand,

599
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.580
but if we make body cameras as the solution to ending law enforcement violence

600
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:24.960
that we've lost a long time ago,

601
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:31.050
<v 6>the term terrorism has erupted because there has been some incidents,</v>

602
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:34.060
some times at some protest where there,
you know,

603
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.960
then maybe filings to has occurred.
Right.
Um,
does,

604
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.280
do you ever come to a point where your organization just comes out there and

605
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:45.660
flat out,
you know,
dino something and say,
you know,

606
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.700
this is not something that we can go and sometimes you cannot be,
you know,

607
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.880
responsible for everybody.
Yeah.
Their protest.
Um,

608
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:57.930
but he's there in the same way where you ally with some people for the same

609
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:00.560
cause and you know,
under the name of intersectionality,

610
00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:04.920
although I hate that word,
but do you,
you know,

611
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.870
do you do both?
Is there,
is there a time where you,
you know,

612
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:12.010
you throw the power of the network behind a cause and you followed through with

613
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:15.580
it?
I may not be necessarily under the broad umbrella of black lives matter.

614
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.560
And is there a time where you see some things,

615
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:19.960
I'd had a protest or even inside your own movement,

616
00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:22.000
where do you go out there and you just do announce exactly.

617
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:27.090
<v 0>I mean,
yes.
Um,
I think the Dallas shooting,
we'd announced immediately,
uh,</v>

618
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.730
Micah Johnson.
Um,
and I talked about that in the book,

619
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.130
but you know,

620
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:38.131
there's never been a shooting from someone who said that they did a on a half of

621
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:43.570
black lives matter.
It's always been attributed to black lives matter.

622
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.050
And our movement from,

623
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.820
from jump has been on violent.
I mean,
that's just been clear.
In fact,

624
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:56.420
we've been calling for law enforcement up killing us.
Right?
Uh,

625
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.720
and I think the conversation about,
um,
you know,

626
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.730
violence versus a non violence is a really important political conversation.

627
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:08.140
And frankly,
um,
we're in a different time period.
You know,

628
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.470
the panthers wet on Sacramento steps and had guns and we would never do that

629
00:40:15.431 --> 00:40:20.290
because we see the result.
Black person doesn't need a gun to get kilz.

630
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:25.650
So I think for us the most effective and safe strategy is a nonviolent strategy

631
00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:29.080
in this particular moment.

632
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.710
<v 6>Can I just ask a quick follow up to this?
So I'm mean social media,</v>

633
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.790
usually whatever the Hashtag is in the family,
do you have things,
you know,

634
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.650
have a power of the narrative?

635
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.070
So if tomorrow something was going on with the movement and I wanted to check,

636
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.040
okay,
what's the official word from your network?
What would I go?

637
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.080
<v 0>Oh,
that's a good question.
Um,</v>

638
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.720
you mean like where on what social media pages?

639
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.640
<v 6>Bj's or just online or,</v>

640
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.860
<v 0>so black lives matter.com is our website on Facebook were verified.</v>

641
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:01.220
Um,

642
00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.220
do not use any other Facebook profile because there's titans and then not

643
00:41:06.891 --> 00:41:10.010
verified and some of them will still your money.
Um,

644
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.410
and on Twitter we are black lives matter,

645
00:41:12.411 --> 00:41:17.411
but we're blk I'm same on Instagram and the most updated sort of like stand that

646
00:41:18.471 --> 00:41:21.350
we have on something is usually going to be at our Twitter account.

647
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:23.960
<v 6>I thank you for speaking.
Oh yeah,</v>

648
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.200
no question about intersectionality and the labor movement.
Yeah.

649
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.710
Like where do they lie?
Well,
yeah,
I mean,

650
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.100
I don't think police union should be able to

651
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 0>bargain about whether or not they respect people's human rights.
Uh,
Ken,</v>

652
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.290
the Labor movement still be an allied to black lives matter.

653
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.800
This is such a good question.
And these are,
you know,

654
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.700
I've sat with a lot of labor folks around this,

655
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.720
so much so that we've really challenged Labor to have law enforcement as part of

656
00:41:58.161 --> 00:42:02.150
their union.
I think,

657
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.530
honestly,
um,

658
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:07.730
and a lot of places law enforcement is the strongest union.

659
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.840
Um,
they have the,
um,
the most lawyers,

660
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:16.940
they have the most money and,
um,
they have a lot of power.

661
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.440
So when we've talked to presidents and we've talked to,
um,

662
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:22.790
union organizers,

663
00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:26.930
they're a pain in the butt and unions they are because they're the first ones to

664
00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:31.550
like stop any sort of democratic process or challenge any sort of progressive

665
00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:34.790
statement the union wants to put out.
Um,

666
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.280
but until unions,

667
00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.880
staff and still union leadership stands up to law enforcement unions,

668
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.570
we're going to continue in the same cycle.
Um,
and I think,

669
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.770
you know,
I spoke to one of 'em,

670
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.810
I don't remember which,
um,
Black Panther member said this to us,

671
00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:55.460
but they said that we are,

672
00:42:55.461 --> 00:43:00.440
we are the first effective movement to actually challenge law enforcement to

673
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:01.890
actually,
um,

674
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.240
curb the community and a culture that believes law enforcement first.

675
00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:08.690
Um,

676
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:13.690
and that to me is just the beginning of really trying to change the seats of

677
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:18.440
power.
Um,
but right now law enforcement is still has all the bargaining chips.

678
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.400
Really an earlier question you asked you what in or gives you hope,

679
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.160
what in politics and all three bl.

680
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.490
What else?
What else gives you hope in politics?
And I'm an engineer.

681
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:35.060
I'm not going to be political activists.
What can I do?
Great.

682
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:39.440
That's a great question.
Um,
okay.
Two things.
One,

683
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.570
I'm going to start with your last question.
What can you do?

684
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:45.410
Everybody has their lane.
Um,
I think,
um,

685
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:51.290
that,
uh,
you don't have to go out into the streets to be active,

686
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:56.270
um,
to be aware,
to challenge,
um,

687
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.250
awful things that happened to people.
Um,
you can,
um,

688
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:05.000
have conversations.
You can,
um,
be a part of book clubs.

689
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:06.560
You could be a part of dialogues.

690
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:11.170
I think even coming into this room is an act of solidarity and a,
uh,

691
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.960
a show of good faith.
Um,
we also come from families.

692
00:44:14.961 --> 00:44:19.730
How are we raising our children?
How we talking to are our wives,
our husbands,

693
00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:21.890
our sisters,
our brothers.
Um,

694
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.430
you know what I usually get the question around how can white people help?

695
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.830
The first thing I say is go talk to your family members.

696
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.730
Have those hard or challenging conversations that we often say,
oh,

697
00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.410
I'm just going to ignore that.
Right?
Um,

698
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:39.060
I think how we're living our lives is just as important as,
uh,

699
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.640
if you're out in the streets being politically active.

700
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:47.760
What was your first question?
What gives you what,
when,
when pope,
um,

701
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:52.380
political hope,
right?
I'm excited about,
um,

702
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.680
how many people that

703
00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:01.650
are running for office that are folks of color,
women of color.
Um,

704
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.450
I'm excited about,
um,

705
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:07.570
the conversations that are happening around political power.
Um,

706
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:11.100
I'm excited about how engaged,
you know,
my mother is,
I mean,

707
00:45:11.101 --> 00:45:14.220
I've been in this work for a long time and my mother never talked about politics

708
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:18.820
and she'll like call me and purse out Trump and I don't like,
oh,
you're like,

709
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:23.760
you're feeling engaged in this moment.
Even if it's against a person.

710
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:28.080
There's something about this moment that's making people want to do more than

711
00:45:28.081 --> 00:45:32.310
they've ever done before.
And uh,
and the one hand,

712
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:37.311
it's devastating to witness so many executive orders totally ripped through our

713
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:42.660
constitution.
And on the other hand,
it's brilliant to see so many people saying,

714
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:46.000
no,
I'm not going to stand for this.
Yeah.

715
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.840
I want to make sure,
wait,

716
00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:50.680
<v 2>no microphone.
No,</v>

717
00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:55.681
you go on to make sure we leave some time for a signing and for,

718
00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.030
and not just because people are like,
no,
I have more questions.

719
00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.810
I want to make sure we need sometimes for signing and for people to actually

720
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:08.330
kept the book.
Um,
so again,
thank you.
Thank you.

721
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.550
I really appreciate you taking the time.

722
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:15.030
<v 1>Thank you all for [inaudible].</v>
