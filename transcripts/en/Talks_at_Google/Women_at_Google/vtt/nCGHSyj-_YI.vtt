1
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.430
We have a confession and 20 eyewitnesses wounds all over the place.

2
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.400
And drug test is clear.
No history of mental illness,

3
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.740
everything except for why

4
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.570
did you hear her say anything?
It's like choose someone else.

5
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.670
He didn't try to stop or a mind plays,
tricks.
He see things aren't there.

6
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.190
Tell us anything.
Whatever he can

7
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.390
<v 2>please welcome to the stage Jessica Biel</v>

8
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.413
<v 1>have a seat</v>

9
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.360
<v 2>and we just watched episode one.
Everyone is here.
Uh,</v>

10
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.430
I want to quickly touch on the actual murder scene cause I saw the whole

11
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:01.551
audience squirm and again bite their nails and do all sorts of things.

12
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.220
Is that the normal reaction that you get from this?

13
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.560
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.560
I haven't seen actually haven't watched the show with like many big audiences

15
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.520
before,
you know,
really?
Well,

16
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:18.500
it's rare I think to have a television show that you get to screen like this.

17
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:22.430
It's new.
Like you know,
just went to the Tribeca film fest last year,

18
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.280
but that's a new thing.
You know,
usually they are bringing films there.

19
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:27.620
You're not usually bringing shows there.

20
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:32.150
So I haven't seen this more than a few times with a larger crowd.

21
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.141
But yes,

22
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:37.910
it's always a bit of a cringe moment because it comes out of nowhere,

23
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:42.500
which is the idea,
right?
Is the idea that this person is just kind of,

24
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.383
um,

25
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.590
kind of blacking out and having this sort of a attack almost.

26
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.460
And yeah,
everybody cringes and it's over really fast,

27
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:57.461
which is kind of another part of the whole idea that when violence occurs in

28
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:03.230
life,
it doesn't always,
it doesn't always have this long dramatic experience.

29
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:06.230
It's like boom,
and it's done and you'd,
no one even knows what's happened.

30
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
<v 2>So what was the,
what was the impetus to screen it at festivals?</v>

31
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:11.990
Because you said it's a new thing,
right?

32
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.250
<v 0>Well,
for the festivals,
a new thing,
I mean,
um,</v>

33
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.230
I think only last,
sorry,
the,
the year we were,
which was last year,

34
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.020
so the year before that,
I feel like it,

35
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.650
that's the first time that that Tribeca film festival started screening shows.

36
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.610
So for the film festivals,
I believe it's kind of a new thing.

37
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:32.460
So when you're doing a TV show and then you go to a,

38
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.180
you get to go to a film festival.
First of all,

39
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:37.810
it's kind of surprising and exciting and then you go and you,

40
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.730
you see the show that you've been making but you,

41
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.220
you've never expected to see it on a huge screen.

42
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:44.800
You'd expect it to just be on TV,
small.

43
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.930
<v 2>No,
these are just big TVS.
I know it's different.
It's,</v>

44
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.860
it's just seems different somehow.

45
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.050
Does that mean that you filmed the pilot a long time ago and then you just

46
00:02:56.051 --> 00:03:00.010
picked up two through eight recently?
Yeah,
not long ago.
We

47
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.160
<v 0>filmed it in the fall.</v>

48
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.050
I think it was the fall.

49
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.550
<v 2>You,
okay,
good.
I guess what I'm asking is,
is normally,
you know,
you film a pilot,</v>

50
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.940
it gets green lit,
you have to take a screen it and whatnot,

51
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.900
see if there's interest and then it may or may not ever air.

52
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.970
Did you go into it knowing you would make the full eight okay.

53
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.600
<v 0>No,
we did what you just said.
So we,</v>

54
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.600
we developed the material we got,
I'm a writer on board,

55
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:30.010
Derek Simons who then wrote the pilot and wrote the Bible for what the,
you know,

56
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.170
what the show would look like,

57
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.650
not necessarily how many episodes it would be because we didn't quite know it

58
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.630
can change when when you eventually sell it to the right place and they kind of

59
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:44.170
have a lot of opinions about,
you know,
is it,
is it eight,

60
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.060
is it 10 is it only,
is it like a two hour thing two nights in a row,
you know,

61
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.390
whatever.
So we pitched,
we,
we,
we,

62
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.570
we wrote the pilot and then we pitched it around and um,

63
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.930
USA was interested and so they,

64
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.760
they basically that's when they bought the,
sorry.

65
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.540
So then they gave us the money to film the pilot.
Wendy's important.

66
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.420
That's what we needed.
Right.
Money's important sometimes.

67
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.460
And then we showed them the pilot and then they picked up the rest of the

68
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.630
seasons.

69
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.630
So it's possible we would have just shot the pilot and no one ever saw it again.

70
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.140
<v 2>Huh?
Cause I was reading a two through eight.</v>

71
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.560
If this is an eight part mini series for those of you who don't figure out what

72
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:34.550
I was talking about already,
um,
you know what the end will be,
you know,

73
00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:37.850
you're not going to a season two,
right?
Or William?

74
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.850
<v 0>No,
not necessarily.
Well,
I mean,</v>

75
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.060
television is so cool.
Like this is what the idea was sort of like,

76
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.480
could be an anthology series.
So you could,

77
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.030
I mean,
what we want to do with season one is we will,

78
00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.150
we will close the case.
Okay.
So you're not going to be season two going,
oh,

79
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.040
I still have to wait for the,
get the answer.

80
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:05.620
We're going to close out this case and you're gonna understand what happened.

81
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.010
We're going to give you all the answers season too.
You know,

82
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:13.930
if bill is interested,
Bill Pullman,
I'm talking about obviously,
um,

83
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.940
he can take on a new case.
Um,
and you know,

84
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.650
I don't want to give away what the ending's going to be,

85
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:25.300
but there is a possibility that maybe my character could be involved in some
way.

86
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.890
Um,
but I don't think that's really giving away much necessarily.

87
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.620
Also know that you're involved in this case.
Yes,

88
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.140
I'm definitely involved in this case,
but,
or you know,
you could,

89
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.210
you could recast the whole thing like I'm a detectives,
right.

90
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:44.980
Or American horror story,
you know,
just or put characters in other positions.

91
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.910
<v 2>So you if you could do a lot of things.
Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:50.810
And you would be interested in that from the executive producer standpoint.
Well,

93
00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:54.470
yeah.
Not from the acting stand.
Well from both,
but I mean,
yeah,

94
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.220
<v 0>definitely from the producer standpoint,
I would love my actors to come back.</v>

95
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.080
<v 2>Okay.
So this is the first time.</v>

96
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.980
Is this the first time you've executive executive produced anything or,

97
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:05.340
or is this new and old hat for you?

98
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.840
<v 0>Well,
I,
I did,
uh,
I produced a film with my producing partner,</v>

99
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:14.700
Michelle purple in my small little tiny company called iron ocean just this past

100
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.440
year called,
um,
the book of love.
Did A,
we produce a small short film.

101
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.780
And so get my,
this and my first television producing.
And how was it,

102
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.930
<v 2>how is it different for you starring in it and producing it?</v>

103
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.810
<v 0>Well,
it's just kind of double duty.
You know,
I have to wear a couple of hats,</v>

104
00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:37.840
but definitely when I'm,
when I'm working on onset on,

105
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.130
on the days I'm working on set,
we have a really good team around us.
My,

106
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.300
like I mentioned before,

107
00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:46.470
my producing partner Michelle and Charlie [inaudible] is another one of our

108
00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:48.780
producers.
There's a lot of support there,

109
00:06:48.781 --> 00:06:53.100
so they're kind of managing the day to day produce oil stuff and I can kind of

110
00:06:53.101 --> 00:06:57.910
focus on the creative stuff produced Soria it's,
it's tough.

111
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.570
It's a hard job.
I'm not great at it.

112
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.510
I'm very good.
And I like the creative producing.
I want to,

113
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.150
I want to talk to writers,
I want to talk to actors.

114
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:13.470
I want to like character develop story,
our character arc.

115
00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:16.890
I want to do that kind of producing and then my partner has to do all the

116
00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:17.790
horrible stuff.

117
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.960
<v 2>Well,
it seems like the best fit for me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

118
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.730
I want to,
uh,
I want to quote you for a second.
Yes.
Yet you said,

119
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:30.310
I've never gotten to do a romantic comedy.
Like most of the girls,

120
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:32.500
maybe because I'm fit,
people assume I'm not funny.

121
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.363
<v 0>I said that</v>

122
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.690
<v 2>definitely,
like I said,
that's what the internet said.</v>

123
00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:41.130
I Google their net is always right.
I googled it.
Okay,
let's go with it.

124
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.510
Did you say,
okay,
so fit,

125
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.550
therefore I'm not funny.
Okay.

126
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

127
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.340
<v 2>Oh,
don't repeat it please.
God,
I beg you anyway.
Let's keep going.</v>

128
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:55.850
I know where you're going with this.
So this is,
yeah,

129
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.500
this is a very dramatic role.
Yeah.
I'm very serious.

130
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.290
And chainsaw massacre a seventh heaven.
You were in the,

131
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.260
the third blade with Wesley Snipes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.200
<v 0>Um,
all of these are not funny roles.
You're right.</v>

133
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.700
They're not even air quotes but funny roles.
Um,
they're actually not funny.

134
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.750
What do the role seek you out or do you seek out the roles?

135
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.940
Now this is a very good question because when you put it on paper like that,

136
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.700
I'm like,
what is wrong with me?

137
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.640
Why am I wanting to scare everybody and like be serious all the time?

138
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.640
Cause I'm really not that serious of a person actually.
So I don't know.
I'm,

139
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:31.060
I think,
I think it must be a little bit of both somehow.
I mean,

140
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.020
I really like,
you know what it is I like,

141
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.580
I like to be scared and I like to watch dramatic things.

142
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.960
I think maybe that's what it is.
So if there's a cool piece of material,

143
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.360
I'm just looking at it as if it's something that I would watch and then maybe I

144
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.240
would want to be in it or something.
Maybe not.
So you don't watch anything funny.

145
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.540
Well,
see that's not true either.
I mean,
I watch,
I watch more dramatic stuff,

146
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.790
but I of course I love to laugh.
Right.

147
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.390
<v 2>I'm getting really insecure about this,
about myself.</v>

148
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.730
I think I need to change something about my life.
All right.

149
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.210
Then I will co wrote a comedy and you will please.
Thank you.
Okay.

150
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.080
You'll be first on my list.
I hope so.
Huh.
Um,

151
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.110
so there's a tie and obviously with the book that is sitting here with your

152
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:21.830
picture on it.
Uh Oh yeah.
Have you seen this?
I have seen that,
yes.

153
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.890
<v 0>I think that looks pretty cool.</v>

154
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.260
I never thought I'd be in the cover of a book before.
Yeah.

155
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.480
Well I mean it's a little random.
No.

156
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.290
<v 2>Well,
if you're really cool something based on a book that,
yeah,
yeah,
I know.</v>

157
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:35.650
But do you see people on books very often?
I don't.

158
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.930
Are you on a book?
Don't mean no.
Well,
I'm on a book,
so yeah,

159
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:45.830
I'm on like six bucks.
Um,
books about how to interview badly.
Um,

160
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.960
this is going quite well.
Oh,
thank you.
I don't know.
All right.
Maybe I'm off.

161
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.700
We've got a few lols so we're okay.
Uh,
the,

162
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.750
the filming or the,
the series takes place in upstate New York,
right?

163
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.570
Did you film there or where did you film all the different things?

164
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.320
<v 0>Well,
we filmed,
oh,
okay.
We filmed our pilot in Charleston,</v>

165
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.230
South Carolina,
which was so cool.
What a great place to,
to spend some time.

166
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.360
But we did that because we could sort of fake upstate New York at that time.

167
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.000
I mean,
you know,
listen to fully,
just very different,
but we managed to,

168
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.091
to fake it a little bit.

169
00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:26.260
We were dealing with a time in the year issue and obviously you could see I was

170
00:10:26.261 --> 00:10:31.120
in the water a decent amount and we were really worried about being upstate New

171
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.680
York.
I think it was October,
it was October,
we were filming.
So we thought,
hmm,

172
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.300
that's a little tricky.
A little dicey.
You never know.

173
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.960
It could be like iced over and frozens possible.
Um,

174
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.680
so we filmed the pilot there and then everything else,
we're still filming.

175
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.700
I have to go back to work tomorrow.
I have a day off today.

176
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.370
Hang out with you guys.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
this is your day off.
This is my day.

177
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.050
Um,
but I am not like crying and sad and miserable,

178
00:10:56.051 --> 00:11:00.230
which is basically what I am a lot on this show,
so we're not doing,

179
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.890
I know it's true.
Yeah.
I'm getting ahead of myself.
Um,

180
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.500
so the rest of the episodes,
the rest of the seven will be shot here and we are,

181
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.450
we're working here in a lot of places,

182
00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:14.120
upstate kind of Nyack area and,

183
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.820
and other surrounding areas.

184
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.220
<v 2>So the,
the,
the city that the story is set in totally fictional.</v>

185
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.580
<v 0>No,
it's not totally fictional.
I think it's,
it's,</v>

186
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.600
it could be like new Paltz is that fictional place.
I didn't,

187
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:28.650
I thought that was an actual real,
yeah.

188
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.090
<v 2>Israel.
Okay.
You'll look at me like I'm crazy.
I've never heard of it.</v>

189
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.390
Okay.
Yeah.
So that I look at it like I've never heard

190
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.760
<v 0>it's,
it's,
it's supposed to be a place like new Paltz write up,
little upstate,</v>

191
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.800
um,
small,
smallish.
I've never actually spend much time in that particular place.

192
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:49.440
So I don't know how small,
I don't want to talk out of turn here,

193
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:54.100
but kind of like every,
every,
every kind of a place.

194
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.840
<v 2>Do you know what I mean?
Right,
right.
Like,
could,</v>

195
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:58.810
could find this sort of town across the country.

196
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.080
It's interesting you said every place kind of a place,
but there are,

197
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.350
I feel like there are specific characters,

198
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.590
types of people that we see in here that exists in all of these,

199
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:13.060
every places like the crazy religious family and then the,
the,

200
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.240
you know,
your small town shop owners and whatnot.
So,
yeah,
I think it,
uh,

201
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.640
was,

202
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.750
was it a conscious decision to kind of set that to set the story in a place like

203
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:27.751
this to enhance the character or enhance the story or does one kind of a big at

204
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:28.730
the other?

205
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.210
<v 0>That's a good question.
I believe,
I mean since this is a German book,</v>

206
00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:36.740
I a German writer,
uh,
initiative originally I fee,

207
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.530
I know it was set in Germany somewhere.

208
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.710
So I think we were trying to find a place that would serve as um,

209
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.460
uh,
the right town in the states for,
I dunno,

210
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.590
kind of like a place that could,
could have,

211
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.750
have a character of its own in a sense.

212
00:12:56.751 --> 00:13:00.920
I feel like upstate kind of has that feeling of,
I don't know it,

213
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.910
there could be a lot of bubbling simmering things going on underneath,

214
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:09.800
which is sort of what we're talking about in this show a little bit,
you know?

215
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.660
Yeah.
Kind of like from the outside,

216
00:13:11.661 --> 00:13:16.661
things are looking one way and then when you look a little deeper you seeing

217
00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:21.170
something else.
I'm not trying to like bag on upstate.

218
00:13:21.171 --> 00:13:24.560
Like there's some weird stuff going on there,
but that's true everywhere.

219
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:30.190
This idea of like presenting ourselves in a certain way and maybe that's not

220
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:33.140
necessarily a hundred percent true.

221
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.860
<v 2>I totally agree with you.
I grew up in a small town in North Carolina,</v>

222
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.630
so same mountain chain,
same culture,
just different,
different areas.

223
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.860
But yeah,
I totally agree with that.
Um,
so as executive producer,

224
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.350
did you help with any of the casting of the show or did you have any yes,
yes.

225
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.620
<v 0>All of it.
We have been,</v>

226
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.100
it's actually been an amazing experience and because I am usually on the other

227
00:13:57.831 --> 00:13:58.800
side of it and you know,

228
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.380
I'm the one putting myself on tape or going in for the audition and sending,

229
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:03.621
you know,

230
00:14:03.621 --> 00:14:06.710
having to send these tapes that you make at home that you like so embarrassed

231
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:09.260
about,
you're like,
oh this is horrible and the lighting's bad.

232
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.760
You're by yourself reading with,
you know,

233
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.680
somebody who can't read lines cause it's like your mom and the whole thing's
bad.

234
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.010
I have,
I've such like,

235
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.790
I have like such a love and respect for the people that,
you know,
have,

236
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.850
have audition for this show because of being on the other side.

237
00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:26.750
It's just so intense.

238
00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:30.560
I know what they're going through and I know how hard it is and that process has

239
00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:34.400
been super cool.
You know,
I have a,
I just have a different take on,

240
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.110
on,
on a reading,
on,
uh,
on the creative,
you know,

241
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.060
performance part of it than say some of my other producers or,
or even,
you know,

242
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.750
even our creator or our director at the time.
So it's,
it's been,

243
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.030
it's been amazing and I love being part of,
of that,
that part of it.

244
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.250
<v 2>Yeah.
I guess now that you've seen what it's like on the other side,</v>

245
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.470
has that changed how you're approaching new roles?

246
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.590
Are you even entertaining new roles yet or you're still working on finishing

247
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:04.424
this one?

248
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.910
<v 0>Um,
I've read a couple of things,</v>

249
00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:11.530
but now that we're sort of in the last stretch of,
of the filming it is,

250
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.860
I mean it's like a cluster some days,
you know,
it's just,

251
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.840
everything's kind of piling on top of itself.

252
00:15:16.841 --> 00:15:19.600
So I haven't really looked at anything seriously are,

253
00:15:19.601 --> 00:15:23.260
there hasn't really been anything that I'm really,
really excited about.

254
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:27.850
So I've been focused,
no comedies,
no,

255
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.290
not on purpose though.
Right.
But the whole,
you know,

256
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:36.600
I think it's changed my perspective.
It just made me mad,
you know,
I'm like,
Ugh,

257
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.180
I don't want to do another audition because they're going to do what I'm doing

258
00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:42.970
when I'm watching the audition tape is like,
oh,
this person is so good.

259
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.590
But you know,
cause we need like no buts.
Just hire me.

260
00:15:47.591 --> 00:15:50.610
I'm great.
Trust me,
I can for you.

261
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.010
<v 2>Okay.
Huh.
Huh,
Huh?
With that note,</v>

262
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.160
we have mics in the aisles.
If any of you have questions for Jessica,
um,

263
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:06.130
line up and we can get to those.
Um,
you are a mom now.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Yes,

264
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.260
he's Silas is two and a half,
almost two and a half.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's soon.

265
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.370
Some Janine,
great age isn't it?

266
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.200
<v 0>It isn't.
It isn't it?
Yeah,</v>

267
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.750
it could be really great and then it can be really terrible.

268
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.950
I got a two and a half year old.
I feel you.

269
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.080
<v 2>Has being a mother in real life,
uh,</v>

270
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.680
influenced how you've approached the character of Cora here in the center?

271
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.520
<v 0>I think,
I think just inherently,
yes,</v>

272
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.550
it has to because now I want to have an actual understanding of what that

273
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:42.160
relationship is,
you know,
if I was by if I didn't have a kid,

274
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.280
yeah,
of course you can,
you know,

275
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.060
evoke as many feelings as you can possibly,
you know,

276
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.960
build up in your body to understand what that feels like.

277
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.380
But it will never compare to the actual feeling of it and the actual doing of

278
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:03.130
it,
you know,
being a parent every day and um,
it's,

279
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.350
it's the,
it's like the best research ever just having to,
you know,

280
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.920
exist with your kid every day to,
to understand what it would be like,
you know,

281
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:16.921
like if a person does this kind of a thing that she does the trickle effect for

282
00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:18.730
her life specifically.
Like,

283
00:17:18.731 --> 00:17:22.180
what happens to her and her family and her kid and her relationship.

284
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.570
Does she ever see him again?
Who you,
you know,
like this,

285
00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:29.620
these are big questions when somebody does something like this.

286
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:33.490
So I have a lot of emotions that I,

287
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.300
that come up for me when we shoot stuff and when we,
um,
you know,

288
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.330
deal with the mom child relationship because like if I couldn't see my kid

289
00:17:42.491 --> 00:17:45.010
again,
I would like,
I would,
I would not make it,
you know,

290
00:17:45.011 --> 00:17:48.790
I would just die on the floor right here,
right?
Yeah.
Here you go.

291
00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.790
No question over here.

292
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.650
<v 3>I just go.
Um,
it looks great.
Congratulations.
It looks really awesome.</v>

293
00:17:56.651 --> 00:17:58.290
I'm really excited to watch it.
Um,

294
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:03.291
so you're here a how a youtube and obviously there's a lot of places where

295
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:07.620
people can get kind of amazing premium content like this.
Um,

296
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.740
how do you either as an actress or executive producer,

297
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:12.090
you've been in the business a long time.

298
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.480
How do you see marketing different nowadays than it's been in the past?

299
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:21.690
Because people have so many options.
Love your thoughts,

300
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:23.820
either as an actress or executive producer.

301
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.810
<v 0>I mean,
you're right,
it's changed so much.
It's,</v>

302
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.590
I think when I was younger and we,

303
00:18:29.591 --> 00:18:32.940
we really didn't have this kind of access or these kinds of platforms,

304
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.260
it just,
every,
everything was dependent on,
you know,
the,
the,

305
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.050
the studio or the network and they did everything.

306
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.260
And you didn't do anything as a,
as one of the creative people,

307
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:46.440
you just kind of did what they told you to do and you know,

308
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:49.110
you would go do like an interview or are you doing magazine cover?

309
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:51.870
And like that was kind of it,
it was very simple.

310
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.590
And now I feel so much more involved.
I'm,

311
00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:00.080
I'm talking to USA all the time.
We're like collaborating on,
well,

312
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.800
what am I going to post?
What are you guys posting?
Um,
how can we,

313
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.010
how can we push the marketing campaign?
You know,

314
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:12.930
with my personal help with my personal platforms,
with their platforms,
it's,
it's,

315
00:19:12.931 --> 00:19:15.360
so,
um,
it's,
it's,

316
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:18.870
it's very much more of like a community thing now.
And it's,

317
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.950
it's really nice because you feel like you have a hand in helping it get out

318
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:26.250
there.
And I guess that means you also have a hand and if it fails,

319
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.240
then nobody cared.
And all this stuff you did like it didn't matter,

320
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:32.380
but at least you're part of it.

321
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.400
I feel much more a part of it from the creative side.

322
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.980
And I guess from the pre predatorial standpoint,

323
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.190
as much help as you can get,
you know,

324
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:44.150
to get the word out for people to be talking about your material,

325
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.480
talking about your show is only helpful.
So it's just,

326
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.320
it's been nothing but positive I think when it comes to marketing in my

327
00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:56.530
experience.
Great.
Great.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
Yeah.

328
00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.790
<v 4>Hi there.
Hi.
This is something I've always wanted her about what exactly,</v>

329
00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:01.720
how does it,
when you're,

330
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.420
are you reading something at home and you're just shoot yourself,

331
00:20:04.421 --> 00:20:05.410
I really like this.

332
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.320
I'm gonna make this into a movie or what exactly is the process that you get in

333
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.760
a source material when it does come from a book or something like that to be

334
00:20:12.761 --> 00:20:15.220
turned into,
you know,
television show or a movie.

335
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.070
How did that work with this book and how does that work in general?

336
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.210
<v 0>Um,
bless you have for this book.</v>

337
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.330
I,
um,
I just started reading,
you know,

338
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.040
and like a couple couple chapters in,
I,

339
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.870
I just was really interested and really intrigued and then I,
you know,

340
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.820
continued on and kept calling my partner Michelle and saying,

341
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.150
have you made it to chapter whatever yet you got to get there.
It's really good.

342
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:44.720
Whoa.
This went in a direction.
I didn't think that it was going to go in.

343
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.420
And this is a different,
um,

344
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:52.750
a different experience because the material was already owned by UCP,

345
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.950
so it wasn't,

346
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.520
it wasn't a situation where I had to reach out and try to get the rights,

347
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.350
which we've done multiple times before.
Um,

348
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.380
honestly I will look at a cover of something and go,
this looks interesting.

349
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:07.120
Somebody called about the rights like right,

350
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.540
like that fast because the rights are just gone.

351
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.970
Especially if it has any sort of notoriety in the literary world or anything at

352
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:19.270
all.
If it's on anybody's list,
if it's on Oprah's list,
forget it.
It's gone.

353
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.280
Literally,
I want to be like talking to authors who haven't published yet.

354
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.080
When their books are,
you know,
on the,
on the way,
you know,
in their third,
fourth,

355
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:33.310
fifth,
whatever drafts.
That's when you want to be snatching up material.

356
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.970
So this was a little bit different because a UCP was bringing it to me.

357
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.920
I had the opportunity to jump on board,
you know right away,
which I did.
And yeah,

358
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:46.030
it's just about your interest.
Like do you like it?
Is it fun?
Is it,
is it,
is it,

359
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:49.630
is there a good character here?
Is it interesting?
Is it compelling?

360
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.170
It's kind of as simple as that,
at least in my experience.
Thank you.

361
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.880
GCP is universal cable productions,
is that what it is?
Yes.
Yep.
Right over here.

362
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.310
Sorry,
I should have said that.
Right.

363
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.160
<v 5>As a proud owner of blade trinity,</v>

364
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.950
I feel like that actually qualifies as a comedy at some points.

365
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.180
<v 6>Yeah.
Thank you very much.</v>

366
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.580
<v 5>As Jason was sort of alluding to before about this new era of marketing and</v>

367
00:22:14.581 --> 00:22:18.930
distribution and access points and TV ratings might not be the best way to

368
00:22:18.931 --> 00:22:22.410
qualify.
What is a good show and a bad show or success?
We'll show.
Not One.

369
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.310
I'm curious how as your first foray into TV,
um,

370
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.080
second I guess seventh heaven counts.

371
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.410
<v 6>Thank you.
Also,
sometimes the comedy</v>

372
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.893
don't look at me.

373
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.280
<v 5>How are you looking to gauge success for the sinner in this new world of,</v>

374
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.133
of content?

375
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.860
<v 0>This is a very good question.
Okay.</v>

376
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.150
I'm nervous about this because I'm a kind of a viewer that likes to um,

377
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.310
binge.
So I want my stuff when I want it as opposed to having to wait week,

378
00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.810
week by week.
So I don't know how to gauge it honestly.

379
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.800
Um,

380
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.800
I don't know what to expect for Wednesday night and if we have kind of not so

381
00:23:07.681 --> 00:23:09.300
good numbers,
like you said,

382
00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:13.440
it doesn't necessarily mean that the show would not have a good viewership or

383
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:17.880
following and may not necessarily mean that we won't have a second season,

384
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.560
but I still have a bit of an old school feeling about it,
you know,
like,

385
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.220
oh well if we don't get good numbers then I guess we'll probably get canceled or

386
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.100
we won't,
we won't get a second season.
I think we have to wait.

387
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.240
I think,
I think we're going to have to wait when,

388
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.690
when it can be streamed to really see what the legs of the show,

389
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.030
what's going to be.
Um,
because I don't know.
I don't,

390
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.860
I want it when I want it,
like most people do.

391
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.160
So it'll be really interesting to see what happens.
Um,

392
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.140
I think I have to remember to not just take the numbers on Wednesday,

393
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.700
you know,
as,
as truth.
And that's it.
Because you're right,
it's so different now.

394
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:03.720
You Watch yourself,
you know why from Nielsen numbers.
I don't know.

395
00:24:03.721 --> 00:24:08.220
I mean,
I'll turn my television on for sure.
I,

396
00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.330
I don't know.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I,
I,
I see my films,

397
00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.190
but I've watched this so many times.
I've seen these cuts a lot.
Um,

398
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.640
I don't think I'm going to have like a viewing party or anything.
I know.

399
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.300
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.
Interesting.
I don't,
yeah,
I don't,

400
00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.830
uh,
I don't know if that would be weird or not to watch yourself on TV.

401
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.110
Maybe the first time you've,
I'm sure you've binged all up seventh heaven,

402
00:24:31.111 --> 00:24:32.900
but you're probably all of it.
Oh yeah.

403
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.830
I just constantly would go back to the beginning.
And
one more question here.

404
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.230
I just got,
I was wondering who's like your favorite actor you've worked with?

405
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.210
Favorite actor?
Yeah.
Ah,
that's a good question.
I've,
I've husband,

406
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.870
have we worked together in that capacity?
Have we?
Oh,

407
00:24:53.871 --> 00:24:58.840
no,
I don't think so.
Yeah,
he's really good though.
Um,

408
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.650
I've had the pleasure of working with a lot of great people.
I think I've,

409
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.690
you know,
Bill,
Bill Pullman and Chris and everyone we're working with.

410
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:09.790
This has been amazing.
So much fun.

411
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.230
I also really loved working on the illusionist with Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti,

412
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.400
those two guys.
I mean,
they just blew me away.

413
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.510
They're so nice and so talented.
I mean,

414
00:25:22.511 --> 00:25:24.580
everyone I've worked with has been amazing in their own right.

415
00:25:24.581 --> 00:25:29.440
But I would say those,
maybe those two I really enjoyed.
Awesome.
Thank you.
Yeah.

416
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.150
Cool.
Yeah.
Hey.

417
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.220
<v 7>Um,
so you know how when you base something off a book like beat a movie or a TV</v>

418
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:41.510
show,
innovative leaders are going to be some changes.
Um,

419
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.290
like usually the plug is different or something's are being caught or somethings

420
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.620
are being added.
And so I guess two questions.
Firstly,

421
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:51.320
how loosely d to base it off of the book.

422
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:56.321
Like is it very accurate or did you like get a lot of like creative license with

423
00:25:56.391 --> 00:26:00.800
it?
And secondly,
um,
how do you make those decisions?

424
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.760
Like how do you decide what is it and what is not and want to add?

425
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.600
<v 0>Right.
Good questions.
Um,
so we,</v>

426
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:14.870
we stick pretty closely to kind of the main real threads of this book.

427
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.460
This book kind of lives in two worlds,

428
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.820
a present time and a past.

429
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.980
And so there's these threads that were kind of following and we take some

430
00:26:28.981 --> 00:26:33.000
creative liberties I think with mainly with the characters.

431
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.920
I don't even know if you'd call it creative liberties.

432
00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:37.710
And we just developed and developed them in a different way,

433
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.640
maybe a little bit more thoroughly in some ways a little bit broader.

434
00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:42.600
And other ways,
you know,

435
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.430
took some like really acute ideas of these characters and expanded it a little

436
00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:48.150
bit,

437
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.950
but we stick pretty closely to the main big plot points.

438
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.210
For example,
the Ambrose character bill Pullman's character,

439
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.370
he's much different in our show then he is in the book,

440
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.890
um,
Cora,

441
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.710
<v 2>right in that way or did bill choose to take it that we,
we wrote it.
Yeah.</v>

442
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.760
<v 0>That way there</v>

443
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.230
I think me and my producers and our creator,

444
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:19.890
Derek Simons,
who's an incredible writer and developer,

445
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.520
he really saw that that Ambrose character needed,

446
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.940
needed more behind it.
You know,
needed,

447
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.890
needed to like really flush out this person for television,

448
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:37.020
you know,
so he took that,
he took that liberty and change that character.

449
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.450
Um,
the second question was,
can you,

450
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.500
can you remind me,
how'd you go about making the decision making the decisions?

451
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.420
You know,

452
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.420
that's a tough one because you obviously want to keep the skeleton and the,

453
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.680
the real like the,
the flavor,

454
00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:02.640
the language of the book.
Because you know,
you're,

455
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.520
you're optioning this material for a reason,

456
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.550
but the form,
the formats are so different,
right?
You can sit and read,
you know,

457
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:14.640
you could read this book for days and days and days and just like slowly get

458
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:18.150
chunks.
It'd be very happy with it.
Whereas what we're trying to do is keep,

459
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.500
keep your attention,
keep an audience's interest for,
I think it's what,

460
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:27.480
42 minutes with commercials,
Short,
attentive,
attention spans.

461
00:28:27.481 --> 00:28:27.911
You know,
we,

462
00:28:27.911 --> 00:28:32.550
we have to kind of drop little nuggets along the way to keep you interested and

463
00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:33.390
keep you going.

464
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.490
So we really have to cut things and add things to keep that in mind,

465
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:41.040
to keep the suspense moving.
Whereas,
you know,

466
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:44.640
you could read a book and it's just like interesting and romantic and

467
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:45.720
atmospheric,

468
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:48.420
but like nothing really happens for a while and you're cool with it if that

469
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:51.480
doesn't work obviously and television.

470
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:56.460
But the main person who is making these decisions is,
is Derrick r r writer,

471
00:28:56.461 --> 00:28:57.030
creator.

472
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.980
And we are trusting him to know that this is the best way to handle,

473
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.230
you know,
all of these interweaving storylines,
arcs,

474
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:12.310
um,
themes past,
present time.
You know,
it was,

475
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.900
it's very complicated what we've been having to do and how he's been doing it as

476
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:19.710
a and quite,
uh,
quite an amazing feat.
So hopefully you will agree.

477
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.310
<v 2>Cool.
We are actually short on time.
I know you're going,</v>

478
00:29:24.311 --> 00:29:27.610
so I'm going to use your quick question over here.
Good time for one more,

479
00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:32.330
hopefully.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
so we already started to touch on this briefly.
Um,

480
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.350
are you ever sitting at your house looking at as source material and you and

481
00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:37.690
Justin just like look at each other and you're like,
hey,

482
00:29:37.691 --> 00:29:41.050
we should do this together or have you talked about kind of your lives like we

483
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.600
do this or hey,
I'd love for you to kill me in this.

484
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:50.000
<v 6>He would probably love that.
Yes,
all the time.
All the time.</v>

485
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.250
<v 0>We are looking,
you know,
I'm reading something going,
you know,</v>

486
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.061
you should read this.

487
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:59.380
There's a really interesting character in here for you or we should,

488
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.470
yes,
we should try to do something together.
What would it be?

489
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:07.810
I always say to him that it would be fun to do something where we're like not

490
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:11.980
playing lovers or not playing like married people,
you know,

491
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.570
do something completely.
I don't know.
Something,
not that.

492
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.020
I don't know what that would mean.
Comedian assassins.
Yeah,
there you go.

493
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.230
That would be fun.
That would be fun.
Yeah.
So yeah,

494
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:26.110
we're always looking for that right thing because you know,
why not?

495
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:30.430
Why not work with your best friend,
partner,
person.
Um,
if you can,

496
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.840
but I really didn't give to be careful because you know,

497
00:30:34.841 --> 00:30:36.610
we've all seen this go terribly wrong.

498
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.300
<v 6>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

499
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.880
There's a few of them that I'm talking about,
so it's like,
yeah,
it's a delicate

500
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.800
<v 0>balance of finding the right thing and it being at the right time of your lives.</v>

501
00:30:48.801 --> 00:30:53.480
And I don't know,
we haven't found it yet,
but I hope,

502
00:30:53.481 --> 00:30:56.480
I hope so.
I hope we can.
I'd love to work with him.
Actually.
You know what?

503
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.410
We talk a lot about him directing me in something.
Hmm.

504
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.190
Which I think would be really cool because he's,
he's directed a few things,

505
00:31:04.191 --> 00:31:07.670
like little things,
commercials and different things.
And he has a,

506
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.500
basically does a lot with his own videos and stuff like that.
But I think,

507
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:16.630
I really think he'd be an amazing film filmmaker.
So I,

508
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.260
I'd love for him to direct me in something.

509
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.680
<v 6>So now it's out there and you better do it because I'm the boss of him.</v>

510
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.420
<v 2>All right.
Uh,
so cool.</v>

511
00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:32.600
We have this little android for you is thank you for coming.
That's a toxic.

512
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.490
<v 1>I do want to go see a watch the sinner this Wednesday,</v>

513
00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:40.500
August 2nd on USA and help me.

514
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.070
<v 2>Thank you Jessica Biel for coming in.</v>

515
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.890
<v 1>Thank you guys.
You.</v>
