WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.150
Sorry,

2
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.400
<v 0>I am a Foley and I'm be coats,</v>

3
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.430
but we're also Liz and Beth and uh,
yeah,

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.930
we're here to talk about what would be to,

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:20.100
could do everyday problem solved by history's most remarkable women.
Um,

6
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:23.880
so it's been a really amazing year for the sort of application of women's
voices,

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.830
um,
particularly in the UK with this centenary year of women's suffrage.
And,
uh,

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.240
it's also as part of that,

9
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.420
there has been lots of raising awareness of the achievements of women from

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.980
history that have perhaps in the past been kind of let slide a little bit and

11
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.950
we're,
you know,
very much endorse the theory of you can,
if you can see it,

12
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.640
you can be it.
And so our book is designed to kind of,

13
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.300
to help women deal with the problems that might come up today,

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.480
even though the women themselves are actually from times far back in the past,

15
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.960
we have chapters on women from different cultures,
from different backgrounds,

16
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.340
covering lots of different disciplines.
So we have sports women,

17
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.050
women involved in science and literature in piracy.
Um,

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.990
we know it's a really noisy conversation.

19
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:06.120
There's conversation about women right now,

20
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.390
but we want to take the stories one step further and see if they could actually

21
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.800
help us in our daily lives.

22
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
So the way our books organized is it divided into 50 short chapters and each

23
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.570
chapter focuses one particular high achiever from the past.

24
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.900
And each of them answers a very specific problem and some of those problems are

25
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:24.090
serious and some of them were being slightly more lighthearted with.

26
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:26.700
So we have may west on body positivity,

27
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.370
we have Emily Dickinson on defining Fomo,

28
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
we have Grace Hopper on facing up to failure and granular.

29
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.760
Molly who's our pirate is on work life balance.
Um,

30
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.110
but we're obviously here in a,
in the middle of a working day.

31
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.020
So we wanted to look at,
I'm certain women who are,

32
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.220
who might help us in certain dilemmas that might come up in the er working

33
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.270
office life.

34
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.380
So we start with someone who is very famous for being very good at her job.

35
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.950
So Elizabeth,
the first is somebody that I channel daily.

36
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:58.860
And particularly at this exact moment in time cause we were talking about how in

37
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:03.240
relation to public speaking,
um,
okay.
So dry man.
Yup.

38
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.490
Sweating Palms.
Yep.
Voice all weird weekend.
Hi.
Really trying to counteract that.

39
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
What most of us approach public speaking with a rising sense of dread.
It's true.

40
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.200
But if we can learn to sort of fight the fear it,

41
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.610
the rewards are very rich and also it's worth just noting that pretty much all

42
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.670
of us are going to have to do it at some stage during our lives.
Um,

43
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.600
Elizabeth the first was,
uh,
had a very tricky start in life.

44
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.950
She was a toddler when she was banished from caught by her father Henry the

45
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:36.220
eighth,
who also accused her mother Anne Boleyn of,
uh,
uh,

46
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.860
adultery and had her beheaded,

47
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.250
which is kind of excellent dad skills to start you off with.
But nevertheless,

48
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:42.960
she became queen and 15,
58,

49
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.820
after her sister died and she inherited a country that was completely divided
by,

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.770
um,
religious conflict.
So her first job was to reinstate Protestantism,

51
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.700
um,
and she had to use all of her sort of persuasive interpersonal skills.

52
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.960
And does it end a very staged managed of authority to,
to,
uh,

53
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.450
to,
to achieve what she achieved.
So with,
within one year,

54
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.840
she had got rid of the pope as the head of the Church of England installing

55
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.720
herself naturally in that place.
Um,
she,

56
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.000
she'd reestablish the Church of England as well,

57
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:17.800
and she basically had taken a decision not to force her subjects to

58
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.650
interreligious conformity,
which was what her sister had done.

59
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.630
So Mary before her had done that with a lot of burning and murder involved and

60
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.970
Elizabeth was clearly hoping to end up with a better epithet than bloody Mary's,

61
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.670
what she was called.
And so Elizabeth was wildly clever.
We know this.

62
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.480
She was fluent in French,
Greek,
Italian,
Latin.

63
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.600
She enjoyed translating the classics in her spare time.

64
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.160
She composts on it's as well.

65
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.890
And our third time basically she was a massive overachiever.

66
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.450
But even for someone like her,

67
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.260
it must have been pretty tough to walk into parliament and express herself in a

68
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.660
room full of much more politically savvy men.
Um,

69
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.160
and I think what she was really good at was putting on a sort of imperial show.

70
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.610
And this is another thing that she sort of harnessed in her working life,

71
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:05.050
which we could,
which we can do.
One of her sort of big hobbies was um,
drama.

72
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.320
So under her there was this great flowering of sort of English literature and

73
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:11.500
drama of course Shakespeare,
um,
and Spencer,

74
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.560
but also people like Thomas Kids and Christopher Marlowe as well.

75
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.740
And that's actually something that comes up in lots of kind of modern guides to

76
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.800
public speaking,
is that watching actors,
performers,

77
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.450
a really good way of honing presentation skills.

78
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.290
So she was doing that all the way back.
Yeah.

79
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.420
So obviously her private life was a matter of great public interest and she had

80
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:31.600
many suitors and she obviously she was known as the Virgin Queen.

81
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.980
And at one point parliament got incredibly grow jumpy about the succession of

82
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.330
the throne and they threatened to take away her,
her allowance essentially.

83
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.620
So she made one of her,

84
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.470
she used her sort of rich rhetorical Moxie in that instance.

85
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.040
And she made one of her great speeches and her best cross voice and she said,

86
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.020
at present,
it is not convenient,

87
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.280
nor never shall be without some peril unto you and certain danger.
And to me,

88
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.270
so she was brilliant at holding off parliament and also suitors,

89
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.150
but she was also good at holding off her threats from abroad,
from abroad,

90
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.130
most famously against the Spanish armada.
In 50 88,

91
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.300
she appeared,

92
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.010
there's this brilliant moment where she appeared with the troops at Tilbury,
um,

93
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.800
in full regalia.
Um,

94
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.490
she had this real genius verse of grandstanding and swashbuckling.
Yeah.

95
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.281
And she actually,

96
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:22.630
she turned up in a long white velvet gown with Arma on a gray horse to make her

97
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:25.180
red hair look particularly good.
And um,
she,

98
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:28.150
what she was doing there was very visibly channeling Boudica from the past.

99
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.180
And we talked a bit about Boudica later.
Yeah.
Um,
so she was there,

100
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.940
this was like the ultimate ultimate kind of motivational speaker.

101
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:38.920
She placed herself with her troops to gee them up.
Um,
and the speech was amazing.

102
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.650
So she uses this great line where she says,
I know I have,

103
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:43.480
but the body of a weak and feeble woman,

104
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:47.200
but I have this heart and stomach of a king and a King of England too,

105
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.720
which is a sort of brilliant,
humble brag in some ways.

106
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.450
She's sort of acknowledging what the truth was,
might have been thinking like,

107
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:53.590
are we being led by a woman?

108
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:56.740
But at the same time and then the next sentence completely sobriety and saying,

109
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.100
I am your leader.

110
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.870
<v 2>Um,
she also knew when to deliver a bit sort of emotional sweet talk in a public</v>

111
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:04.340
way.
Um,
the,

112
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:08.630
her final farewells farewell to parliament is known as the golden speech and it

113
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:11.120
basically made them all cry,
which we think is a great send off.

114
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.920
We're not going to do that today.
Um,
but she said,
she said to them though,

115
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.240
you have had many princes more white mighty and wives sitting in this seat yet,

116
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.520
do you have never had any more careful and loving?

117
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.330
So we think maybe the next time we're trying to do a tricky presentation to our

118
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:31.330
line managers.
We can remember the tough crowd that Elizabeth was facing.
Um,

119
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.160
for her,
her reign was known as the Golden Age.
I mean,

120
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:37.100
that might be too much to pull off as your tenure in the accounts department,

121
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:38.950
but hey,
it's a good thing to aim at.

122
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.690
And finally we have some tips from Elizabeth.

123
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:45.590
So first thing is thinking about presentation.
Obviously wear white velvet,

124
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.550
all opportunities,
um,
alcohol in small doses does no harm.
Um,

125
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.050
and also remember that worst thing,
worst things do happen at sea,

126
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:57.350
particularly obviously if you're the Spanish armada and most of the time,

127
00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:01.130
99% of people watching a willing you to smash it.
So,

128
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.230
or they're just thinking about their dinner.
So either way,

129
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:06.600
it's not something we're fine either way.
Um,

130
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.220
so the next person we wanted to talk about as someone who was also very good at

131
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.150
putting on a good show,

132
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.800
and this is 1930 screen siren Hetty Lamar who was known in her day as the most

133
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:19.100
beautiful woman in the world and she was so beautiful that people found it quite

134
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.190
difficult to believe that there was anything much going on behind her gorgeous

135
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:26.950
green eyes.
Um,
we talk about her and knowing your worth because we love heady.
Um,

136
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.080
she pursued her work passions in the face of much nay saying and resistance and

137
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:33.591
she was an actress,

138
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:37.310
both an actress and an inventor and the inventor part of her life has had a lot

139
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:41.020
more coverage recently and she's been celebrated for that more.
Um,

140
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.630
although still with a lingering sense of surprise that someone who looks so good

141
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.730
could be so clever,
particularly if they're a woman,

142
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.090
because we all know women are rubbish at science as well as fighting,

143
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:51.380
parking and barbecues.

144
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.570
So Patty was born in 1913 in Austria and she grew up in a cultivated and

145
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:58.640
comfortable home and she went to drama school in Berlin.

146
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.600
And after that she got her first big break and how it was sort of like a high

147
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:06.560
brow version of the Kardashian sex tape because she was involved in a Czech film

148
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:07.520
called ecstasy,

149
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.300
which was the first widely released film to have an explicit sex scene in it,

150
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.470
which it was.
It was banned in the u s it was denounced by the pope.

151
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.560
Her parents went to the premiere and had a very uncomfortable time.

152
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.280
It's very sweet actually by modern standards,

153
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:24.080
although head he does run around stock,
isn't it?

154
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.980
And there is a famous scene where she's acting out the sexual ecstasy of the

155
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:28.371
title,

156
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:32.150
which apparently was achieved by the director poking her bum with a pin in order

157
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:33.560
to get the desired effect,

158
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:36.620
which is quite a disturbing way to deal with a teenage colleague.

159
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.650
But it did launch her on her celebrity career path.

160
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.380
She had something really interesting to say about that career path where she

161
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:43.520
defined it as she said,

162
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:48.080
the ladder of success in Hollywood is usually a press agent,
actor,

163
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.420
director,
producer,
leading man,

164
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:53.600
and you're a star if you sleep with each one of them.
In that order,

165
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.270
which is kind of extraordinary that she was saying that 50 years ago and feels

166
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.910
very depressingly familiar to us.
Yes.
Um,

167
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.390
how these new found style light was quite quickly snuffed out by her possessive

168
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.870
husband.
He was a wealthy fascist arms dealer and um,

169
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.130
he was not keen on people watching his wife in this film.

170
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:14.850
So he rounded up all of the prince to destroy them and heady soon tired of his

171
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:18.450
controlling ways and she liked it one night,
apparently according to her story,

172
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.810
dressed as a maid,
she snuck out of their castle and ran away to London.

173
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.610
And whatever the truth of that is a good feisty background story to give herself

174
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:29.430
to make ourselves stand out against the other kind of want to be stylets that

175
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:31.830
she was up against at that point.
She was really good.

176
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:36.030
I think like Elizabeth the first at using storytelling and building a narrative

177
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.900
to make you standout.
Exactly.
Um,
by 1938,

178
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:41.940
she was cast in her first English language film.

179
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.380
And from that point on she found herself mainly cast in so seductive exotic kind

180
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:47.160
of roles,

181
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.950
which she became a bit bored with to the point where she started her own company

182
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:52.590
so she could avoid it.
But in 1949,

183
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.940
she went back into the kind of low cut gowns for um,
sessile to meals,

184
00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:00.920
Samson and Delilah,
which was an enormous hit.
Yeah,
it was a films,

185
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:02.690
the Groucho Marx said,
it said debate,

186
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.390
I'm not interested in a film where the man's tits are bigger than the woman's,

187
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.580
which is a kind of,
again,

188
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.090
a bit depressing thing to say about the women's role on the silver screen in the

189
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:15.240
golden age of Hollywood.
And Heddy was certainly not just TNA.

190
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:19.140
She had a singular brain inside her head.
And when World War Two came,

191
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:24.141
she was very keen to be involved in the war effort and she had well living with

192
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:28.520
her ex husband should pick it up.
Quite a lot of knowledge about arm.

193
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.010
So essentially whenever the third rate came to dinner,
she was there.

194
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.200
Just having a good old listen to what they were talking about.

195
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.870
And she teamed up with a pianist called George and tile.

196
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.550
And together they developed a frequency hopping radio device to help missiles

197
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:44.820
get through German defenses,
which they donated to the navy for free,

198
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:47.160
the patent for free.
But it was not exploited at that time.

199
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.180
But I think as most people know now it has become that technology has become

200
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:55.320
part of Wifi and gps and things that we use all the time now.
Um,

201
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.950
and had he really loved inventing things.
It was like her proper top hobby.

202
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.070
She applied to the national inventors council,
but they rebuffed her.

203
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.130
But she used to,
when she was on film sets certain tinker away.

204
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.600
She invented new designs for traffic signals,
a fluorescent dog collar,
um,

205
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.200
a tissue box and also,
um,

206
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.770
an idea for a powdered fizzy drinks cube that you could drop into your water to

207
00:11:15.771 --> 00:11:16.620
make yourself coke.

208
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.370
But people were much more interested in her six marriages and her latest

209
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:24.540
scandalous behavior,
which included lawsuits and extreme plastic surgery.
Um,

210
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.170
and her kind of Accenture cabi didn't really fit with the marketing of her as a

211
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.640
kind of Hollywood sex symbol.

212
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.660
And so it was not until she was 84 that she was recognized as an inventor.

213
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:37.920
And that's when she and George were given pioneer awards from the Electronic

214
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.380
Frontier Foundation.
And she said brilliantly,
well,
it's about time.

215
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.700
So no one could rock a center parting,

216
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:48.240
a bold lipstick and an elegant understanding of spread spectrum broadcast like

217
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.320
Heddy thank you.

218
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.920
But the important thing we felt we learned from her story was to follow our own

219
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.010
interests,
even if others

220
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.880
<v 0>can't see the point.</v>

221
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.760
She was brilliantly clear on where she attributed to her own volume.

222
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.320
So she was very proud of being an inventor.

223
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.460
But she famously said of the glitzy bit of her career,
any girl can be glamorous.

224
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.440
All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.

225
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.100
The next step we have a debt.
So a head is,
uh,

226
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.490
involvement in the war was undoubtedly patriotic,

227
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:16.150
but it was kind of at a distance.
We have some women in our book who's,
um,

228
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:19.820
involvement in war was really visceral,
very close up and a depth.

229
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.010
One of the first ones we talk about her in terms of being open to experience and

230
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:27.520
not being afraid of our mistake.
So it's the,

231
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.260
the parallel we make in the book is,
you know,
that feeling when you press reply,

232
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.810
you think you've pressed reply and you've actually press reply all and you've

233
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:38.380
sent something about your colleague to the whole floor,
uh,
will debt.

234
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.730
She made a mistake like that and it bit,
it changed her life kind of completely.

235
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.610
And what we wanted to think about is instead of when you send that email,

236
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:47.950
locking herself in the loo and thinking,
oh my God,

237
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.550
if you could think of a way to keep your chin up and be brave and try and learn

238
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:55.780
to,
to learn from your mistakes rather than be completely cowed by them.
Yeah.

239
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:59.470
For her it had life changing amazing repercussions,

240
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.590
which is good news for all of us who make that mistake on a regular basis.

241
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.170
So she was born in 1912.

242
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:09.190
Her Dad in France and her father had been a decorated,
um,

243
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.520
had been a decorated hero in world war one.
He was killed in War World War One.

244
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.570
And every Sunday her grandfather took her to his grave and said,

245
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.430
if war comes again,
it's your duty to,
to do what your father did.
Um,

246
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.790
which I think today's child psychologists would have a field day with that,

247
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:26.800
but I don't,
it was made of stone.
She was.

248
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.940
So then she married a British guy and she moved to London.
Um,

249
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.270
and then when the second world war broke out,
she,
I'm her husband and lifted.

250
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.870
And then the battle of Britain and the blitz,

251
00:13:36.871 --> 00:13:39.520
this kind of reduced London to a real proper war zone.

252
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:44.320
So she moved to Somerset with her mother in law and by now three small children.

253
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.831
So again,

254
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:47.860
stern stuff to go and live with your mother in law and three small children.
Yes,

255
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.520
absolutely.
Um,
when she was in Somerset,

256
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.560
when she heard a BBC broadcasts asking for holiday photographs from northern

257
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:59.250
France,
and because the lift Pfeiffer controls,
um,

258
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.220
a French aerospace and the Brits were trying to figure out a way to map their

259
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:07.390
bombing raids.
So she sent this letter saying that she was,
she knew the area,

260
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:09.910
like the back of her hand,
but she misaddressed it.

261
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.670
She sent it to the ad,

262
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.010
not to the admiral admiral to which is where it should have gone,

263
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:18.760
but she sent it to the navy and they then passed it on to the army who then

264
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:21.430
passed it to the Soa,
the special operations executive.

265
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:25.520
And they immediately thought this woman would make an amazing spy.
Um,

266
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.450
but what they were worried about is,
you know,
she was a woman.

267
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.740
She had three small children.

268
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:33.190
How would she cope if she was captured and tortured again?
You know,

269
00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:36.810
they couldn't know that she would prove to be as hard as nails.
And in fact,

270
00:14:36.811 --> 00:14:39.790
that three small children can prepare you to resist torture.
Exactly

271
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.850
by Pumphrey.
Both had three small children.
Um,
so at that did agonize,

272
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.670
but eventually how sort of horror of what was going on in her beloved home

273
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:52.700
country one out.
So she,
she began and she learned all the good stuff,

274
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.860
Morse Code,
how to handle firearms selfdefence resisting interrogation.

275
00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.960
And her final report was glowing,

276
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:03.590
but it did note a complete unwillingness to admit that she could ever be wrong,

277
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.920
which is a strategy that is worth bearing in mind if you ever are dealing with

278
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:08.850
the fallout from emailing and error.
Yes.

279
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.310
So Dat was no agent asked 23 and she was dropped into northern France to work

280
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:15.890
for a man called Peter Churchill,
um,
in a,

281
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:18.410
in a resistance group very quickly.

282
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:21.350
They were betrayed by somebody inside the group and she was handed over to the

283
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:25.640
Germans and they got very confused by this Peter Churchill's situation.
They,

284
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.910
they thought he was a relative of Winston Churchill,
um,

285
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:31.670
and a debt was very happy to go along with that.
Um,

286
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.930
they've taught you to her horribly.

287
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.870
There are descriptions of what happened to shed and ripped out.
She had,

288
00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:37.550
she was burned on her back with hot irons,

289
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:40.250
but she stood completely farm and didn't squeal.

290
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.510
So eventually the Germans sent her to Ravensbruck concentration camp.

291
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.580
And the commandant there again had heard the story about Peter Churchill,

292
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.210
who she claimed she claimed they were in a relationship and the fact that he was

293
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:57.200
Winston's relative.
So he thought we had kind of hostage gold on his hands.

294
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.420
And when the allied forces were closing in,

295
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.910
he took a debt in his car with the plan to hand her over to as a bargaining chip

296
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:07.160
essentially to the Americans.
Um,

297
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.960
but that turned out to be a bad plan from the common done because a debt

298
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.170
immediately dobbed him in and she stole documents from his car and she then

299
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:18.020
later testified against him.
I'm so amazingly,

300
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:21.840
Peter Churchill also survived the war and when they came back to London,
a debt,

301
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.060
uh,
divorced her husband and married Peter.
So she did get her.
Mr Churchill.

302
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:26.894
In the end,

303
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:31.160
she was awarded an MB and she was the first person to be awarded the George

304
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.660
Cross for Gallantry.
She died in 1995.
At the ripe old age of 82,

305
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:39.500
and she's just this brilliant icon of bravery and resistance and all round

306
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.860
hiders nails,
womanhood and all because of a mistake.

307
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.490
So I think the lesson we took from her is that,
you know,
if you're wrong,

308
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.010
if something goes wrong for you,
think about your reaction.

309
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:51.940
It's also the ability to deal with the situation.
Um,

310
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.850
when there's a massive cockup which kind of makes us potentially better human

311
00:16:55.851 --> 00:17:00.800
beings.
Um,
and actually aiming for constant perfection probably leads to massive

312
00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:05.510
unhappiness.
So we moved from one Morea woman to another,

313
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.110
our title lady,
um,
many centuries before a debt.
Um,

314
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:12.100
so what happens if the pursuit of your passion like heady and your openness to

315
00:17:12.101 --> 00:17:14.990
opportunity,
like at that leads you into conflict with others.

316
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:19.280
So women in particular suffer cultural pressure to be agreeable at all times.

317
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:22.820
And we talk in our book about how lucky we are to have had women like Rosalind

318
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.000
Franklin,
like Cleopatra or Coco Chanel,
difficult women as they were called,

319
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.830
forging an alternative path.

320
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.550
But this pressure does still remain and our next subject is Boudica on sticking

321
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:35.150
up for yourself.
So she's nor fix best known queen.

322
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.320
She's a woman from history who totally stepped outside of the lane of what was

323
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:41.300
expected of a lady.
Um,

324
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.190
her reputation sort of rests on her unusual levels of assertiveness or what you

325
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.950
might call blood blood thirsty,
revenge,
revenge fueled aggression.

326
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.540
<v 2>Anyway,
so Boudica stories full of hold holes and legendary embellishments,</v>

327
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:58.380
but it's generally agreed that she was the chief of the IC and I tribe in East

328
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.940
Dang Day or about 2000 years ago after the Romans invaded Britain.
Um,

329
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.280
they made an agreement with her husband that he would be able to continue to

330
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:08.490
govern his own people very generously.
Uh,
but when he died,

331
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:11.700
that gentleman's agreement did not extend to the ladies and they immediately

332
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:14.340
took Buddha because land and not content with just that,

333
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.180
they also publicly flogged her and raped her children.
Um,

334
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.000
so this is all according to their historian Tacitus.
Um,

335
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.980
and he's the best source that we have for what Buddha could then did.

336
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.210
So instead of being cowed by this or accepting the inevitable sexual violence

337
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:34.620
that comes to women in situations of conflict,
Boudica set the world on fire.

338
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.980
She led a full on revolt and she burned the cities of cultures,

339
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:42.210
doesn't Orbens and London to the ground,
uh,
killing almost all the inhabitants,

340
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:46.410
both Roman and Britain.
And she almost managed to wipe the ninth legion,

341
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:49.230
I think off the face of the earth as well.
And there's that brilliant fact,

342
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:52.700
isn't it?
Apparently she literally left her mark.
So if you dig down,

343
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.700
there's a layer of red sediment,
which,
which is from her burning.
Yeah.
Yeah.

344
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.360
So she's the first of,
in a line of,
um,

345
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.780
female rules that we talk about in the book in which include Cleopatra,

346
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.760
Elizabeth the first and Catherine the great.

347
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.360
And they were celebrated as anomalies because it was so unusual for women to be

348
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:11.580
in positions of power.
And Tacitus,
as I say,

349
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:14.610
the most reliable source about her was really obsessed with how weird it was

350
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:16.080
that there was a woman leading an army.

351
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.190
He elsewhere talks about all the shrieking that there was,

352
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:22.290
because women were allowed on the battlefields in Britain.

353
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:23.460
And this is like horrified him.

354
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.880
But the Romans were particularly sensitive to this because they didn't think

355
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:30.360
that women were logical enough to handle a high stress leadership roles.

356
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.120
And they were very sensitized to this by Cleopatra.

357
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.940
Everything that happened with her kind of sex and death thing had really freaked

358
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:37.080
them out.
Um,

359
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.490
but Tacitus was himself grudgingly impressed with how Boudica dealt with what he

360
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:45.710
acknowledged was extreme dishonor.
I mean,
so obviously the DFA,

361
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.110
the offenses against Buteyko much more serious than anything we might come up

362
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:53.500
against in our normal working lives and,
and,
uh,
murder,
murder,

363
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.550
mutilation or definitely not the response to any everyday problem.

364
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.720
But we saw something in her emphatic response that we thought was inspiring,

365
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:03.650
albeit with less disempowering mutilation.
Um,

366
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.250
sometimes extreme disrespect does warrant a noisy counter attack and Buddha can

367
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:11.010
nurture the very literal no prisoners take no prisoners attitude.

368
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.310
But I think she can act as a source of encouragement for those of us who

369
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:17.700
struggle with expressing dissent.
She wasn't worried about making enemies.

370
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:19.140
She wasn't worried about causing a scene.

371
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.410
She was confident in her own authority and that meant that other tribes rallied

372
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:24.540
around her.
When she,
when she started her rebellion,

373
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.910
we can't claim she had a happy ending.

374
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.170
The Romans turned out to be pretty good at fighting as well as construction,

375
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.110
aqueducts the legal system and deploy heating.
That's right.
Um,

376
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.330
but the Roman emperor did actually rethink his policy for colonizing Britain and

377
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:39.720
go with them.

378
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.930
A less aggressive kind of starts on it after her a bolt because it was so

379
00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:44.370
significant to them.
Uh,

380
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:48.430
she died by suicide boot occur to avoid capture and to add insult to injury,

381
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:51.970
her name has been misspelled for quite a long time as Boadicea and that is

382
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.650
apparently due to a kind of miss.

383
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.570
A typo essentially in one of Tostitos is manuscripts being copied when they were

384
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:01.510
copied from by one person to another.
And legend has it,

385
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:04.270
she's buried between two platforms,
nine and 10 at kings cross station.

386
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.650
So she's apparently very near here.
Um,

387
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.210
the ambiguities in her story mean that she's been repurposed as a symbol for

388
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:13.720
many different causes.
Um,
we don't know whether she was pro or anti empire.

389
00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:16.810
We don't know whether her concerns were primarily political or domestic.

390
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.010
Was she a war hero?
Was she a war criminal?
What would you think about Brexit?
Uh,

391
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.680
her reputation lives on because UK loves an underdog.
Um,

392
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.360
and also because she categorically refused to be swept aside by the more

393
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:30.700
powerful forces that were in play at her time.

394
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.850
So sometimes it's the nice thing to do to be nice and back down,

395
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.720
but sometimes it's important to fight for what you believe.

396
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.640
<v 0>Absolutely.
So next up is suffer.</v>

397
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:43.270
Who's another figure who sort of,
whose reputation,
uh,

398
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.950
sustains despite the sort of best,
uh,
best efforts of history to raise it.

399
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.130
Um,
suffer is someone else who went her own way.

400
00:21:51.131 --> 00:21:54.280
And in our book we talk about how in backing yourself,
um,

401
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:57.850
so when it comes to criticism,
we believe there's no one nastier than ourselves.

402
00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:58.810
Um,

403
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.470
it's very easy to beat yourself up when the meeting doesn't go to plan or a deal

404
00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:03.161
doesn't come off.

405
00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:07.450
But instead of sort of throwing ourselves donor well of self hate,

406
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.920
what if there was another way?

407
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.700
And how do we go about shushing that belittling in,
in,
in a voice?
Uh,

408
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.520
we think Sephora has something to tell us about accepting ourselves,

409
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:19.930
warts and all.
She was a literary sort of smash in her own time.
Uh,

410
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.640
the ancient Greek poet who's,

411
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.150
who had nine volumes of her work at the very famous library of Alexandria,

412
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.260
and the librarians there named her as the only woman in their night.

413
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.120
Boster of nine prime poets.

414
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.400
And even Plato who was not a big fan of poetry quarter,
the 10th Muse.
And,

415
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.460
but by the Middle Ages,

416
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:41.050
almost everything of hers had disappeared as partly to do with like the ravages

417
00:22:41.051 --> 00:22:42.070
of time.
So the library,

418
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:45.460
that library Alexandria suffered a huge fire in which all sort of original

419
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:47.310
documentation was lost.
Um,

420
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.010
it's partly to do with the fact that she wrote in a very particular dialect,

421
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:52.770
which by the Middle Ages or didactic,

422
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.270
but blame also has to lie at the feet of some of the clergy,

423
00:22:56.271 --> 00:23:01.030
men of the Middle Ages who were totally freaked by the sort of joyous sexuality

424
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:02.170
that's right there in her poem.

425
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.460
<v 2>One of them called her a sex crazed whore who sings with her own wantonness,</v>

426
00:23:06.461 --> 00:23:08.970
which is not what you see on the back of the penguin classics edition.

427
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.670
<v 0>But,
um,
in the last two decades,</v>

428
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.030
so fragments of her poems have been rediscovered and they revealed whole

429
00:23:17.031 --> 00:23:19.610
sections of suffers,
um,
rhymes.

430
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.310
And it's really interesting that people immediately knew that this was the

431
00:23:22.311 --> 00:23:23.620
Suffolk,
uh,
that the,

432
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:28.220
that it was Sappho because she had invented the suffix stanza.
Yeah.

433
00:23:28.221 --> 00:23:31.070
And you have to be pretty confident in yourself to feel that you need to invent

434
00:23:31.071 --> 00:23:33.470
a new poetic form to express your genius.
Yeah.

435
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.760
So all aspects of her life had been the subject of sort of feverish speculation

436
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.130
over,
over the years.
W,
you know,
we,

437
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.140
the truth is we don't know very much about her.

438
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.770
We don't know what her sexuality was.
We don't know if her,
who family were,

439
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.490
but we do know is that she's associated with the liberal island of Lesbos.

440
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.120
But because,
um,

441
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.940
attitudes to homosexuality in ancient times are so different to how we might

442
00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.710
consider them now,
it's very difficult to see if she was a lesbian or not of it.

443
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.500
He's a Roman poet about 500 years later,

444
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.600
came up with a theory that she ran kind of romantic finishing schools for girls

445
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.750
that she was teaching them the art of love through her,
through her programs.
Um,

446
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.380
but what's amazing is even though we know nothing,

447
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:19.100
what we do have at these problems and what sort of sings out to test across the

448
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:22.690
millennia is this incredible voice and her host of feelings about,

449
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.480
about love and romance.
Um,
there's a very famous,

450
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:29.870
slightly uninspiring Lee titled Poem Called Fragment 31.

451
00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:35.490
And the setup as she's watching on jealously is some man floats with this

452
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:38.440
beautiful girl and she talks about it.

453
00:24:38.441 --> 00:24:41.060
It's just an incredible articulation of desire in jealousy.

454
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:44.270
She talks about her sweating palms and her ears are thrumming,

455
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.540
her bloods kind of pulsing in her veins.
And what's amazing is that she's,

456
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.570
she's really in touch with her feelings about love.

457
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.570
There's no fear of that emotional vulnerability.

458
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.870
She owns her weaknesses and her fallibilities

459
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.940
<v 2>and she does the same.</v>

460
00:24:57.941 --> 00:25:00.700
And another poem where she talks about aging and she talks about how kind of

461
00:25:00.701 --> 00:25:02.460
knackered knees and her sagging skin.

462
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.110
And that's not something that she feels she needs to hide or

463
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.720
<v 0>exactly.
So we've got some rules about backing yourself.
Um,
first of all,</v>

464
00:25:09.721 --> 00:25:12.390
it's good to remember that nobody's perfect.
In fact,

465
00:25:12.391 --> 00:25:15.660
imperfection as sort of traits shared by all the very best people through

466
00:25:15.661 --> 00:25:16.470
history.

467
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.950
We're bound to come up against other people's judgment just to suffer his work

468
00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:24.120
did.
Um,
but you should try to stand strong on that.
And remember,

469
00:25:24.121 --> 00:25:27.330
it doesn't matter what you look like as long as your soul is in really good

470
00:25:27.331 --> 00:25:31.760
shape.
So Satta Safra had a great line that says a handsome man,
God says,

471
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:34.980
image a while a good man will one day take on beauty.

472
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.500
<v 2>So we're pitching our book as it kind of inspiring and hoping that it fills</v>

473
00:25:40.501 --> 00:25:43.920
readers with kind of vim and vigor to take on the issues of the modern world

474
00:25:43.921 --> 00:25:45.120
with these great role models.

475
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.960
But it did also strike us the a book of 50 really high achieving women who

476
00:25:48.961 --> 00:25:51.270
changed the world might actually make us feel a bit inadequate.

477
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.990
And our next heroin is actually someone who makes me feel quite an adequate.

478
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.450
So she is the 18th century interpreter and explorer,

479
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.320
psychic aware and there's no way that I could do what she did,

480
00:26:01.321 --> 00:26:05.550
which is travel thousands of miles through uncharted territory with a new baby

481
00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:08.340
strapped to her back the whole time.
And I really hate camping.

482
00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:10.860
So that is clearly out of my comfort zone.

483
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.190
But we do think there's also a broader message to be taken from her life.

484
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.570
So [inaudible] was born,
um,

485
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:21.000
she's a native American from the Shoshone tribe and she was born around 1788 and

486
00:26:21.001 --> 00:26:22.650
she lived,
she was the daughter of a chief,

487
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.130
but she was kidnapped when she was very young by an enemy tribe called the

488
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:26.820
[inaudible].

489
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.230
And they sold her to be essentially the extra wife of a French Canadian trapper

490
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.000
who was the melodiously names to song Charbonneau who had the income odious

491
00:26:36.001 --> 00:26:37.860
reputation of being a rights thinker.

492
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.820
He was described in reports of the time as a man of no particular merit and

493
00:26:41.821 --> 00:26:43.080
apparently and attempted rapist.

494
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.260
But of course we have no records of what second could we have thought of being

495
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:50.760
married to this guy.
Um,
in 1804,

496
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.560
the US president decided that he wanted a military expedition to explore the and

497
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:59.840
colonized west of the continent and the leaders of that expedition arrived in

498
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.200
[inaudible] village.
Um,
and they had the grandiose named the core of discovery.

499
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.140
And I was thinking it was funny,

500
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.820
the core of discovery that basically missing the fact that it was not an

501
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:12.520
undiscovered land for all of the native people who already live there.
Um,

502
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.070
the core was led by Captain Lewis and Lieutenant Clark and they were keen to

503
00:27:17.071 --> 00:27:19.350
find interpreters to help them on their journey,

504
00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.740
particularly they were going up the Missouri River into potentially deadly

505
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:27.510
territory and Charbonneau and a second ago we're between them could speak French

506
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.343
Hidatsa and Shoshone.

507
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.440
And so they were employed by Lewis and Clark even though at that point a sacral

508
00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:35.340
area was heavily pregnant with her first child.
And in fact,

509
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:39.840
the expedition set off,
um,
just two months after she had had her baby.

510
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.690
So she had a little boy,
John Baptist,
and then she strapped into her back.

511
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:43.860
She was 17 years old.

512
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.810
She set off on an all male expedition about 60 men and just her carrying him on

513
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:51.630
a back,
traveling all the way to the Pacific,
mainly by boat.

514
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.930
And it was her survival skills and her geographical knowledge,

515
00:27:54.931 --> 00:27:58.650
which contributed a lot to that expedition.
And there's that famous story,

516
00:27:58.651 --> 00:27:58.981
isn't there,

517
00:27:58.981 --> 00:28:02.290
where she had to jump in and have husband capsized the canoe at one point,

518
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.550
she had to jump in and rescue their supplies down.

519
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.270
So it was a really tough journey.
Uh,
they were kind of a set by illness.

520
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.690
There was the threat of attack from hostile locals.
There were grizzly bears.

521
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.830
One man did actually die.
Um,

522
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.420
but Sacagawea made it all the way to the Pacific and then all the way back
again.

523
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.230
Um,

524
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.920
and this expedition helped the mapping of the west and the eventual expansion of

525
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:26.050
the United States,
and she was a key player in that.
Um,

526
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.690
so sometimes the constant recalibration of work life balance can feel
impossible.

527
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:33.330
But I think Zachary where's story puts this into perspective.

528
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.930
Most of us these days don't get kidnapped.
Get to choose who we marry,

529
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.960
get to choose whether or not we want to try and have kids as a starting point.

530
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:45.120
Um,
and traveling thousands of miles with a two month old on your back certainly

531
00:28:45.121 --> 00:28:47.830
puts the school run into perspective for us.
Um,

532
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.660
it's hard to find a better example of an unstoppable heroin to kind of pep up

533
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:55.460
your spirits and make you feel like anything is possible.
Absolutely.
Okay,

534
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.910
so our next,
uh,
heroin is in head.
You,
Anna.
And we talk about how and creativity.

535
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.620
So obviously we're here in Google.

536
00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:04.020
We don't need to tell you anything about creativity,

537
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.100
but what if meetings and whatsapp groups in the kind of constant daily use of

538
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.170
millions of emails is crushing it and you can't fight,

539
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.520
you can't find the time for your creativity to juices to flow.
Well,

540
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:18.180
we know that feeding your inner imagineer leads to huge rewards.

541
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:21.120
Your jobs are better.
You can ease your relationship,
tensions,

542
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.880
it can make you genuinely feel more alive and fulfilled.
And,
and had you,

543
00:29:24.881 --> 00:29:29.670
ana is an ancient Mesopotamian princess priestess who took it a step further.

544
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.500
She didn't just revel in her creativity.
She owned it and she's our,

545
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.430
she lived around four and a half millennia ago.

546
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:39.480
So she is the most ancient lady in our book.
So this is a bit difficult to say,

547
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:42.040
but she was basically the daughter of this King Sargon

548
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.040
<v 0>of [inaudible] who appointed her a high priestess of the Moon,</v>

549
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:49.810
God Nana and the goddess Inanna in the holy city of or which is a bit of a

550
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.770
mouthful,
but anyway,
that is in southern Iraq.
So her father,

551
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:58.090
the king was trying to unite a warring kind of empire states by putting his

552
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:01.450
daughter at this,
at the head,
at the center of the,
in the earliest role.

553
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.600
She obviously took her responsibilities seriously,
um,

554
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:09.310
and was good at it because we know she remained in the job for over 40 years.
Um,

555
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.850
and she backed herself the claim in that 40 years of being histories,

556
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.540
first recorded writer.
So the first recorded writer,

557
00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:19.230
either man or woman in the planet's history.
Yeah.
Which I,

558
00:30:19.231 --> 00:30:21.360
I'm still staggered by as a fact.
Uh,

559
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.580
we know a lot about her because of her creative legacy legacy.

560
00:30:24.581 --> 00:30:28.060
There's a body of work that she left behind in the hymns and poems that she

561
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:28.894
constructed.

562
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.770
And there's also some fabulous stone engraving called the disc of and had you

563
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:35.020
honor,
which depicts her,
uh,

564
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.920
taking part in a ritual and she has a kind of bald crouching priest at her feet.

565
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.130
She has amazing braids and a turban and she's clearly a woman at the top of our

566
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:43.570
game.
And that,
yeah,

567
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.250
so the poems and him show us her character and her poems are kind of amazing

568
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:50.560
because they have a proper narrative arc.

569
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.550
And this is four and a half thousand years ago,
but there's one in particular,

570
00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:56.440
it talks about a political threat.
She suffers then she,

571
00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.080
she begs her goddess for the power to,
uh,
to,

572
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:04.300
to Ricoh revenge by the end of the poem.
She's,
she's back in her,
um,

573
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.060
proper position as the holiest priestess.

574
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:09.520
So there are loads of amazing things in this poem.

575
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.300
And we particularly like the line mistress of heaven with the great pectoral

576
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:18.400
jewels,
but most astonishing is I sort of sense of authorship and ownership.

577
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:23.780
Um,
again,
she's the first recorded person to use the first person.
Um,

578
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.040
and she does it in the designs which says I am and,
and had you honor.

579
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.680
And she says,
I've given birth to this song for you.

580
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.580
And I love that line because it set,

581
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:35.890
it gives us a feminine kind of slant to this idea of the process of creativity.

582
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.620
Um,
and it's worth remembering.

583
00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:41.500
She was doing all of this about a millennium and a half before homer was

584
00:31:41.501 --> 00:31:44.590
tackling the Iliad and the Odyssey.
And so she has,

585
00:31:44.591 --> 00:31:47.440
I think all the traits that we associate with really creative people.

586
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:52.430
She was original,
inventive,
passionate,
committed,
fiery,
um,

587
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.680
and all of that is doable.

588
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:56.500
I suppose the thing to remember is we don't have to all be in the business of

589
00:31:56.501 --> 00:31:59.250
laying down art that will remain for centuries,
um,

590
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.370
to feel that we're being creative.
Um,
I rethink.

591
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.240
It's to do with everyday creativity.

592
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.750
And for me that that means just generally asking more questions about
everything,

593
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:11.800
but it could also be about trying to be just more spontaneous in your daily
life,

594
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.190
disrupting your,
uh,
your everyday patterns in different ways.

595
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.330
<v 2>So the next lesson we have,
uh,</v>

596
00:32:18.331 --> 00:32:21.650
it comes from what seems like a slightly unlikely place,
um,

597
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.690
but covers an issue that I think haunts a lot of people for far less significant

598
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:28.150
reasons than it might have haunted famous concubine.

599
00:32:28.151 --> 00:32:30.760
Nell Gwynne had she been that way inclined.

600
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.080
And what we learned from Nell was how to ride out shame and embarrassment and

601
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:37.950
stop apologizing for ourselves all the time.
So,
uh,

602
00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:40.850
Elena Gwen's origins and not 100% clear,
but,
uh,

603
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.300
she was thought to have been born in 1650.
She grew up in coven garden.

604
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:47.150
Her mother ran a brothel,
a as a teenager.

605
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:51.230
She got a job selling oranges at what's now the theater royal in Drury Lane.

606
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:56.520
Um,
and those were very exciting times and kind of theatrical circles because,
um,

607
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.000
the theater has been closed down for 11 years by Olivia Cornwell.

608
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.670
And the king had just recently been restored to the throne.

609
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.250
And as part of reopening the theaters,

610
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:06.980
you also allowed women to act on the stage for the first time because obviously

611
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:09.920
in Shakespeare's time and around that only men could act on the stage.

612
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.660
And this opened the stage door for Nell who became the best known and most

613
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:17.180
celebrated comic actress of her day.

614
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:20.450
And she was reviewed by Samuel peeps as pretty witty Nell.
But,

615
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:22.220
and then there was a slightly rude amendment,

616
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:25.520
wasn't there when he called her a bone?
Mary slut.
Yes,
she played,

617
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:29.450
she starred in plays by the likes of Dryden and she was admired by people like

618
00:33:29.451 --> 00:33:33.650
Aphra ban and the Earl of Rochester.
And she had three boyfriends called Charles.

619
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.470
And the most significant of these was the King Charles.
The second,
um,

620
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.560
who ensured her lasting fame.
Uh,

621
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:44.480
she met him in 1669 and by the next year she had given birth to his child and

622
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:48.860
Charles set her up in a house in pal Mel.
And one day she,
he,

623
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:52.610
he was there at the house visiting her and the children and she,

624
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:56.990
he heard Nell call their oldest son,
um,
by saying,
come here,
you little bastard.

625
00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.920
And that moved him to formally acknowledged the boy as his son and set him up as

626
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:03.710
an Earl.
So now it was quite shrewd in the way that she handled the king.

627
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.520
She became one of his most popular mistresses because she certainly wasn't the

628
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:08.354
only one.

629
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.320
Charles had about 14 illegitimate children with a pretty much about the same

630
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:16.850
number of women and nearly became his kind of bit of rough at this time.

631
00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:20.630
But he also had a posher mistress called Louise to carry while got the same time

632
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:25.460
and she was now probably to have been a French spy and Nell really loved winding

633
00:34:25.461 --> 00:34:25.911
her up.

634
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:28.730
So she used to call her the weeping willow because she was quite an emotional

635
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:29.564
person.

636
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.930
But I think there's evidence that they liked hanging out together as well.

637
00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:35.840
They played cards and eat macaroons together.
They did.
Yeah.

638
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:39.530
So it wasn't all handbags.
So now,

639
00:34:39.531 --> 00:34:42.600
and Charles kept their romance alive until the King's death.
Uh,

640
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.080
and on his deathbed,

641
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.810
his famous last words were to ask his brother the soon to be King James the

642
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:51.880
second not to let Paul Nellie staff.
So James,
you know,

643
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:55.730
went along with this and he sat nearly up very comfortably and she lived very

644
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.150
happily until she died quite young of a stroke when she was just 38.

645
00:34:59.151 --> 00:35:03.860
And she's buried in this of Martin in the fields church.
Um,
so she,

646
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.880
what made her such an excellent companion?
She,
it was her shamelessness.
Uh,

647
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:12.590
she didn't care about going along with respectable feminine ideals and she

648
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:15.740
wasn't ashamed of the kind of odd role that she had in society.

649
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.330
She seems to have been a loyal friend.

650
00:35:17.331 --> 00:35:19.070
She certainly seems to have had a lot of fun.

651
00:35:19.071 --> 00:35:22.940
She used to zoom around in a sedan chair eating oysters and macaroons.

652
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:26.570
She bought herself a silver bed with the king's face carved in it.

653
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.690
So she's certainly made the most of her position.
Um,

654
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.980
there was one time where she was caught in an angry crowd in her carriage and

655
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:37.100
the kind of mob around who are protesting because they thought that Louise,

656
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.220
who was very unpopular

657
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.550
<v 0>was in,
was in the carriage.
And so she lent out the window and shouted,</v>

658
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.880
I'm the Protestant Hall.
Because Louise would have been the Catholic one.

659
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:49.140
And the proud then dispersed in in quite a cheery way because they were

660
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.540
entertained by now.
She was very entertaining.

661
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.820
So the best lesson we learned from her was not to be so easily ashamed of

662
00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:00.900
setbacks and to put ourselves out there despite the risk of embarrassment and to

663
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:03.480
make sure that we take time to enjoy the good things in life.
Like macaroons.

664
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.860
Yeah,
absolutely.
So next we move on to imposter syndrome,

665
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.850
which we think is the punishes undermine or of talented people everywhere.

666
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.400
So this is the idea that no matter how brilliant you are,

667
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:18.270
no matter how professional you are,
you believe the compliments are lies.

668
00:36:18.271 --> 00:36:22.620
And you'll probably only one step away from being handed your p 45 and so how to

669
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:25.840
deal with it.
It's difficult,
but there's one historical homemaker,

670
00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.000
Isabella beaten,

671
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.830
who'd maybe ought to have felt imposter syndrome but seems to have laughed in

672
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.760
the face of it and got on with achieving stuff.

673
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.870
So when I think of as Isabelle beaten before we came to research for this book,

674
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:38.490
I thought of this,
um,

675
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.410
matronly ladies talking the halls of some country house in her criminal ends

676
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:47.840
with the dish shouting at the servants.
But in fact,
and,

677
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.770
and actually sorry,
it is true that her book,

678
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:53.100
her is her famous book of household management does have some really deadly
tips.

679
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:56.190
There's one where she says,
when a mistress is an early riser,

680
00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.340
it's almost certain they're house will be orderly and well managed.

681
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.400
On the contrary,
if she remained in bed till the late hour,

682
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:04.410
then the servants are likely to become sluggish.

683
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.030
And we particularly object to that one.
Yeah.

684
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.020
But actually she was this really young forward thinking entrepreneur.

685
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.020
She was a translator,
she was a journalist,
she was an editor.

686
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.530
And the brilliant thing about her is that she was really rubbish it cooking,

687
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.210
which was a surprise to me.
Um,
she was married to a publisher,
um,
who,

688
00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:23.490
and she wrote articles for his magazine,
um,

689
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:27.330
and her first contributions were columns on cookery and pickling and preserving,

690
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.870
and they proved to be a massive hit despite the fact that she couldn't cook.

691
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.201
Yeah.

692
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:34.590
And she actually even missed out the flour and her first cake recipe and she had

693
00:37:34.591 --> 00:37:37.260
to print an apology the next week because she had missed out the flower.

694
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.320
The other thing,

695
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.580
the other thing about her is that she actually stole most of her recipes.

696
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:46.590
So she'd been told by somebody that culinary expertise took decades to kind of

697
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.950
gather and she decided she didn't have time to time to waste doing that.

698
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.760
So it's just nick them basically and made very good use of the lacks copyright

699
00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:56.040
laws at the time.
Um,
but what she did,

700
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:59.640
she did bring one really original thing to sort of recipe making,
which was,

701
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.650
she sort of invented recipes actually.
So she,

702
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.650
she was the person who invented writing them in a list.

703
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.280
So that you knew which ingredients he needs just to have to hand before you,
um,

704
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.660
before you got on with it.
You know,

705
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:12.930
she doesn't specify measuring them out into aspirational ceramics,

706
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:16.200
like on bake on.
What do you think she would have probably would have done?
Um,

707
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.760
so her husband ever,

708
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:20.820
the opportunistic publisher realized he had hot property and he cooked up the

709
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:23.040
idea of Mrs Beaton's book of household management.

710
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.580
It was a massive bestseller and actually it's still in print today,

711
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.970
nearly 150 years later.
It's what was the genius of it was,

712
00:38:29.971 --> 00:38:33.090
it wasn't just the sort of 2000 recipes that it contains.

713
00:38:33.091 --> 00:38:36.190
It also had tips on child rearing,
on

714
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.690
<v 2>boundary property law,
on a menu planning.
Um,</v>

715
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:44.710
so she was teaching this of the January had the generation of women around her

716
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:48.940
how to manage a household.
Um,
so after her death,

717
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:51.640
she died again.
This is the thing I hadn't really,
she died very young.

718
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:52.930
She was 28 when she died.

719
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.790
She died in after [inaudible] an infection after the birth of her fourth child.

720
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.970
And basically it was one of those moments where after her death,

721
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:02.990
her fame grew even more.
Um,

722
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.070
and you still find it on people's cookery shelves today.
But I,

723
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.870
what I love about her is she's this kind of dynamic woman who built this brand,

724
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:15.100
uh,
for domestic goddess newness,
but she was anything but really anything.

725
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:19.540
But so if you're suffering from imposter syndrome,
as I quite often do,

726
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:22.470
I look to Isabella and I think about,
um,

727
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.760
the way that she styled as she sort of understood that the path to success lies

728
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:30.730
in taking risks and not being afraid of your mistakes.

729
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:35.500
And in fact realizing that our floors are no barrier to being completely
amazing.

730
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.830
So this is our last woman and with Josephine Bake,

731
00:39:39.831 --> 00:39:43.150
we've looked at the issue of having it all.
Now in the media,

732
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:46.930
having it all is usually used as a coded phrase to say that women can't or

733
00:39:46.931 --> 00:39:50.930
shouldn't have what men have.
And as a female,
you're usually expected.

734
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.560
If you're having it all,
then that means you are ethically knee.

735
00:39:53.561 --> 00:39:56.050
Combining an instagrammable home,
a loving,

736
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:57.760
passionate relationship with your partner,
uh,

737
00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.700
stimulating and high powered career.
And also you look amazing.

738
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:05.850
And actually the life of celebrated dancer and singer,
uh,

739
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.240
Josephine Baker actually does tick all those boxes.
Uh,

740
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.230
she sets a very high bar,

741
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.280
but she certainly didn't achieve everything that she achieved,
um,
easily.

742
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.270
It wasn't given to her on a plate.
She was born in poverty in St Louis in 1906.

743
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.810
And as a child,
she had to Miss School in order to,
uh,

744
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.550
go out to work so that the family could pay the bills.

745
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.120
And she started dancing on the street and in clubs when she was a young
teenager.

746
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.300
And despite people telling her that she was too dark and too skinny,

747
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:35.830
she got really good.
She joined a dance troupe and natural charm and abilities,

748
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:37.060
led her to Broadway.

749
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.600
And it was from there that she got her really amazing big break,

750
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:43.180
which is that the company that she worked with when she was 19,

751
00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:45.970
decided to go on tour in Paris in 1920s.

752
00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:48.580
Paris was fascinated with the Harlem renaissance,

753
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:52.480
with American jazz and Primitivism.
And,
uh,
Josephine's dance number there,

754
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:54.940
which was called the dance.
Sovos required her to dance,

755
00:40:54.941 --> 00:40:58.090
essentially only wearing a feather skirt and audiences loved it.

756
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.720
Obviously this fetishization of African culture feels wrong today,

757
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:04.630
but she grabbed that opportunity that she had,
um,

758
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.580
and she used to drive around in a,

759
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.350
in a Rolls Royce with her pet Cheetah Chiquita wearing lots of diamonds.

760
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.750
And then she went on to take on the act that made her really truly famous,
um,

761
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.000
which is a sort of spirited twerking number where she just wears a belt made of

762
00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:23.680
sparkling bananas.
Um,
and from this point she became a complete sensation.

763
00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:25.720
She was the most highly paid entertainer in Europe,

764
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:28.630
which is no mean feat for a black American woman.

765
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.260
She had hundreds of marriage proposal.
She was admired by Hemingway,

766
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:34.310
Picasso Free Carlo,
Collette.

767
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.520
And then she went on to train really hard to also become an accomplished singer.

768
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:40.460
And she became the first woman of color and kind of major motion pictures as

769
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:41.720
well.
Sadly,

770
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:46.460
when she returned on a tour to the u s her home country was not ready to accept

771
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.830
a beautiful,
rich,
talented black woman in this way.

772
00:41:48.831 --> 00:41:50.390
And she met with quite racist reviews.

773
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.810
And so when she came back to France the next year in 1937,

774
00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:57.890
she became a French citizen and her devotion to her new country was really

775
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.800
passionate.
When World War II started,

776
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.740
she worked with the resistance and she actually used to smuggle secrets around

777
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:06.530
in her sheet music and our underwear because she was able to travel as an

778
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:09.380
entertainer in a particular way that was helpful to the resistance.

779
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.220
And after the war she was presented with many honors for her service.

780
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.020
I love,

781
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.840
one of the things I loved when I was researching her is that if you find clips

782
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:20.420
of her speaking voices,
completely heavenly,
an extraordinary.

783
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:24.050
But there are also amazing photos of her receiving her medals from the French

784
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:27.920
government with her children and her children were another kind of key part of

785
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:32.320
her story.
So after distressing experiences trying to have a baby,
um,

786
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.810
she ended up adopting 12 different children from different countries,

787
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.110
different races and religions and the sides.
I wished to be a mother.

788
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.060
She also had a political purpose and this and that.

789
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.930
She wanted to build a rainbow tribe in order to prove that people from diverse

790
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:46.760
backgrounds could get along.
And she,
yeah,

791
00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:51.410
she made her chateau into sort of theme park where people could come and see her

792
00:42:51.411 --> 00:42:54.980
children and seeing the rainbow tribe together,
which,
which is,
uh,
you know,

793
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.380
a good intention.
But it must've been a very weird,
very strange,

794
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.060
but linked to this lends to this project of hers.

795
00:43:02.061 --> 00:43:05.600
She also in the 50s became active in the civil rights movement in the u s she

796
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.420
refused to play to segregated audiences and Las Vegas.

797
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.350
And there was a famous incident in the Stork Club in Manhattan where they refuse

798
00:43:12.351 --> 00:43:16.640
to serve her.
And she kicked up a huge fuss and this got her in a lot of trouble.

799
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:18.260
She was labeled as a commie troublemaker.

800
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:21.320
She was investigated by the FBI because of it.
Yeah.

801
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:23.210
And I suppose it's that thing that link to today,

802
00:43:23.211 --> 00:43:27.230
it's sort of depressing that a woman kicking up first speaking her mind about a

803
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:30.890
perceived injustice is still something that even now we see as met with

804
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.600
disproportionate criticism,

805
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.660
but there was a happy outcome to the stork club incident,

806
00:43:35.661 --> 00:43:39.080
which is that she formed a lasting friendship with Grace Kelly who happened to

807
00:43:39.081 --> 00:43:40.970
be there and walked out at the same time.

808
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.780
And that's something we've found again and again through our book.

809
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.320
There's these incidences where women support other women and good stuff comes

810
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:51.500
out of that.
Yeah.
Because even later when Josephine actually,

811
00:43:51.501 --> 00:43:54.540
the cost of running the kind of amazing chateau theme park,
uh,

812
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:58.420
sent her bankrupt and Princess Grace gave her a house in Monaco,
uh,

813
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.090
so that she could look after her.
Um,

814
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.720
and then it was only in 1973 that she,

815
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:07.040
Joe's been finally got the applause she wanted from the United States when she,

816
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:10.910
um,
did a performance at Carnegie Hall,
which was kind of rapturously received.

817
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.510
And not long after that she,
um,
she did another performance,

818
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.830
big grand performance in Paris,
uh,

819
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.280
to celebrate the first anniversary of her dancing there.

820
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.760
And it was only a few days later that she died and she was found dead in her bed

821
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:27.200
with her amazing reviews all scattered around her 20,000 people lined the

822
00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:30.770
streets for her funeral and she was buried with full military honors.
So,

823
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:34.020
so she have older.
Yeah.
The question,
I mean,

824
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:38.000
when you look at her rags to riches tale and her professional excellence and the

825
00:44:38.001 --> 00:44:41.190
lovely pictures of our cute kids in the castle,
uh,
it looks like it,

826
00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:44.340
but she took a lot of fire from people who saw her as an upstart.

827
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:47.820
People who saw her four failed marriages,
thought she was a bizarre mother,

828
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.000
a political loose.
Callan cannon.
Obviously she went bankrupt.

829
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.510
Now she's recognized as the unique and powerful performer that she is.

830
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.080
And as a brave war hero,
civil rights activist and a style icon.
Yeah.

831
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:01.320
There are these great pictures of her and her huge sunglasses in late life.

832
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:05.070
She's wonderful.
And her influence in jurors.
She's inspired lots of people,

833
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:06.720
including Beyonce.
Um,

834
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.690
most of us would be immensely proud to have anything near the kind of life that

835
00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:13.110
Josephine had.
Uh,
but she did work unbelievably hard to get it,

836
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:15.660
and she suffered a lot of setbacks.
I'm sure various points.

837
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:19.130
She didn't know that the end result would be this incredible career.
Uh,

838
00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.950
so it was very liberating for us to realize that having it all means only going

839
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:26.610
for what you want on your own terms to the rest of your particular abilities and

840
00:45:26.611 --> 00:45:28.260
expecting that things will always keep changing.

841
00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:30.240
And that is certainly something that Josephine did.

842
00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.121
<v 0>So that's it.</v>

843
00:45:32.121 --> 00:45:36.140
That's our 10 are 10 women from the past who we believe can help our present in

844
00:45:36.141 --> 00:45:40.790
really tangible,
concrete ways.
We have there a queen and inventor,
a spy,

845
00:45:40.791 --> 00:45:45.380
a warrior,
a poet and explorer,
a priestess,
a concubine,
a cook,

846
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:49.370
and a dancer.
I'm all much more exciting jobs than most of us can have.

847
00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.700
But all these women excelled at what they put their energies into.

848
00:45:52.701 --> 00:45:54.080
And all of them left their mark.

849
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.810
And they certainly raised our sense of what's possible.

850
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.310
And they raised our spirits as well.

851
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.800
<v 2>We had a really joyful time writing the book and working with the illustrator</v>

852
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:02.520
bees,
you Carmen,

853
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.730
whose work you've seen behind us today and we hope that you and perhaps auntie

854
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:07.573
sisters,

855
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:12.540
daughters enjoy it and it gives you an amusing few hours and solves all of your

856
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.720
problems.
Thank you so much for having me.

857
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.200
<v 1>[inaudible] so</v>

858
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.890
<v 0>we have time for some questions,
if anyone has any,</v>

859
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:30.980
how did you go about your research and deciding who would be in the buck?

860
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.740
Yeah,
so the decision making was one of the hardest,

861
00:46:33.741 --> 00:46:35.480
but also one of the most fun bits of it.

862
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:40.750
We actually have a list of about 290 other women and it's called spare ladies.

863
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.480
It's a document that we have.
One of the things to turns out,

864
00:46:44.481 --> 00:46:47.660
women have been doing really great things for a really long time,
so we,

865
00:46:47.661 --> 00:46:48.620
so we came up with it,

866
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.260
we came up with a list of modern dilemmas that we thought was,

867
00:46:51.261 --> 00:46:52.520
we're worth answering.

868
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:55.700
And then we came up with a list of women and we were really clear that we wanted

869
00:46:55.701 --> 00:46:58.940
the women to be representative of all different countries,

870
00:46:58.941 --> 00:47:01.280
but also different disciplines.
So we're not,
you know,

871
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.980
we both work in a publishing industry.

872
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.790
So our natural instinct was to go with lots of writers and artists,
but in fact,

873
00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:11.570
we wanted scientists in there and explorers and all those sports where men and

874
00:47:11.571 --> 00:47:15.100
all those other fasteners.
And then just,
uh,
you know,

875
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:18.550
a quick look at a woman's life and you'd immediately see the little point there,

876
00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:19.423
um,

877
00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.970
answered the modern dilemma and that was the springboard for us to then go off

878
00:47:22.971 --> 00:47:26.730
and research some more freely.
So there's definitely people who regret leaving.

879
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.270
Yeah.
Not In there.
There,
yeah.
Maya Angelou.
Yeah.

880
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.600
Feel bad about her.
You feel bad about Mary Queen of Scots.

881
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:37.590
You feel bad about Mary Queen of Scots,
but um,
but yeah,
maybe for volume two.

882
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.560
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
what inspired you on this subject?

883
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:44.500
Like now we know I was going to ask like,
what do you,
what do you do?

884
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:48.820
You work in publishing,
but what did you pick this subject?
So,

885
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:50.023
um,

886
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:55.510
genuinely came from watching the women's marches post the election in America.

887
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.890
Um,
we were really inspired by all those placards about nasty women,
um,

888
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:04.420
and the way that women were kind of a reclaiming it as a,
as a,
as a,

889
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.240
as from an insult into a positive term.

890
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:11.590
So we originally thought of it as a book celebrating the kind of nasty women of

891
00:48:11.591 --> 00:48:14.800
the past and a lot of the women in our broker sort of difficult and complex.

892
00:48:14.801 --> 00:48:17.830
And that was something else we wanted to,
to highlight.

893
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:19.750
They're not perfect any of these women,

894
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:23.920
they're sort of bad mothers or alcoholics.
Yeah.
Girlfriends.
Exactly.
Yeah.

895
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.220
And we really wanted to,
we wanted to show that,

896
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:31.210
that these aren't kind of bastions of,
of perfection,
but then we also,
as we said,

897
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:34.660
one to take it a step further and see is there a way that these amazing,

898
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:38.050
nasty women from the past can help us with modern dilemma.
So that was,

899
00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.490
that was where it came from.
Do you have a favorite?

900
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.710
Oh yeah.
Uh,
Josephine's one of my favorites and I think,
um,
Isabella beaten.

901
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:51.460
There's one of my bios.
I do love Sappho as well.
Yeah.
No you can't.

902
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.910
It was a very joyful experience to write this book.
And Yeah,
they all,

903
00:48:54.911 --> 00:48:57.310
Virginia West is really good too,
right?
Yeah,
she's great.

904
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.950
<v 3>I'm free to say the [inaudible].</v>

905
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.570
It's very difficult to get quoted on that.

906
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:06.980
<v 0>Nice</v>

907
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:09.800
<v 3>that there's a children's book.
You went,
okay.
Good night stories for rebel girls,</v>

908
00:49:09.801 --> 00:49:11.420
which is doing a at a fairly similar thing.

909
00:49:11.421 --> 00:49:14.180
What do you do you think is different about what you're going for?

910
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.040
<v 0>So I think,
yeah,</v>

911
00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.220
I think the main thing is that ours is for a kind of older audience.

912
00:49:19.221 --> 00:49:22.610
So we have swearing in our book and I love good night stories is a brilliant

913
00:49:22.611 --> 00:49:26.130
book and my children read it and your children read it that night.
But that,

914
00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.330
the premise of that is to present these women's stories as fairy tales.

915
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.780
And in a way what we wanted to do was quite different to that and that we are

916
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:37.640
depicting them warts and all and we are looking at adult problems in relation to

917
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:38.300
their lives.

918
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.750
So I mean that book is a gorgeous and wonderful book and we sort of hope this is

919
00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:45.020
a kind of slightly older sister to it.
Yeah.
Yes.
That's a good way of thing.
Yeah.

920
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.800
But here we have some really difficult women and it's a Coco Chanel who I think

921
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:49.551
is also in,

922
00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:53.420
I'm good night stories and what they don't talk about is her sort of Nazi

923
00:49:53.421 --> 00:49:57.230
sympathizing past as well because obviously it's for children.
Yes,
do that.

924
00:49:57.231 --> 00:49:59.360
But we do confront that in the book and kind of,

925
00:49:59.361 --> 00:50:03.680
and then another figure who we really am denied over putting in now is Marie

926
00:50:03.681 --> 00:50:05.760
stopes because she was,
she had,

927
00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:09.320
she had some really dodgy kind of world views at the time.
But again,

928
00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:11.990
that was really intentional.
We thought long and hard about that.

929
00:50:11.991 --> 00:50:15.650
We wanted difficult women in there as well.
Yeah.
We didn't want to sugar coat it.

930
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.471
I'm just curious,

931
00:50:18.471 --> 00:50:22.910
what is the most poignant lesson that you each have taken away from,
you know,

932
00:50:22.911 --> 00:50:26.920
all the various chapter problems?
I,

933
00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.210
I think for me

934
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.770
<v 2>it really is this idea of women helping other women.</v>

935
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:33.170
Cause that's something that we had.
And actually to be fair,
also,

936
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:36.650
there are lots of great dads and brothers and husbands in this book who are

937
00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.770
really instrumental in allowing these women are helping these women achieve what

938
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:40.461
they achieved.
Yeah.

939
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:44.270
There's a lot of fathers who refuse to accept that their daughters couldn't have

940
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:46.710
a decent education.
Yeah.
So they would,
um,

941
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.260
educate them privately or find other ways to kind of instill,
um,

942
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.730
education in them.
And that was that,
that was very moving,
wasn't,
it was,
yeah.

943
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.490
That they had to step outside of what was supposed to be allowed for girls and

944
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.740
the father supported them in that.
But we have,

945
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.350
so the princess grace and Josephine ones something that we love,

946
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:06.590
but also when we talk about the,
a tennis player,
Althea Gibson,

947
00:51:06.591 --> 00:51:09.240
and she has an amazing kind of mentor relationship.

948
00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.750
And so she was like health test,

949
00:51:10.751 --> 00:51:14.090
the first black woman to win Wimbledon in the 50s.
And just there,

950
00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:16.910
it's really moving that there are certain moments during her life where it just,

951
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:20.420
women sort of swooped in and really helped her.
So one,
uh,

952
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:24.050
one of the white champions at the time wrote this open letter to a magazine to

953
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:25.310
see it.
Come on guys,

954
00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:29.390
why don't we let her into the lawn to lawn tennis association?
And that was a,

955
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.201
that was a great moment.

956
00:51:30.201 --> 00:51:33.920
And then later in her life when she had sort of fallen foul of the American

957
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:37.930
healthcare system again and other women's swooped in and raised a load of moneys

958
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:40.660
pay for her health care.
So that,
that was really moving,
that,

959
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.200
that sense of women helping each other.

960
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.850
<v 4>Um,
you say that you're very intentional in this tributing uh,</v>

961
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.400
through different regions,
Tamsen history.

962
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.920
But you also say that you have a 290 style women,

963
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:58.150
if at any particular time in history or region that stands out for having a lot

964
00:51:58.731 --> 00:52:00.140
of women in that period.

965
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:05.240
<v 2>Hmm.
I mean,
I think what we tried not to do,</v>

966
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:09.260
because ultimately what you do end up with when you look at these lists as quite

967
00:52:09.261 --> 00:52:12.690
a lot of Victorian white women,
because that's where the records are there.

968
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:15.080
That's where the records documentation to be aware,

969
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.950
women suddenly did start to change the rich Victoria Victoria very well.

970
00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.870
So that's why there are queens and all of these books.
Yes.

971
00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.690
Cause there's loads of documentation about them.

972
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:26.060
So obviously it makes the research is richer.

973
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:31.610
And we were clear that we didn't want to do that to go to Saudi unusual places

974
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:32.480
in,
uh,

975
00:52:32.481 --> 00:52:36.580
in the world and also in history and see what lessons in control there were

976
00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:38.810
women we discovered for the first time and writing the book.

977
00:52:38.811 --> 00:52:41.210
And that's something that we wanted to do was find out about people that we'd

978
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:43.400
never heard.
Uh,
yeah.

979
00:52:43.401 --> 00:52:46.310
And so we have quite a few of them as well as having the big famous ones.
Yeah.
