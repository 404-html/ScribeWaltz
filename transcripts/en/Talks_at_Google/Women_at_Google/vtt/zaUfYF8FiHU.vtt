00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.420
[inaudible].

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.820
<v 0>Okay,
so the rough patch,</v>

3
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.970
why do they call it the rough patches there?
A rough patch in every marriage.

4
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.300
Simple answer.
Yes.
More than one.

5
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:25.930
Usually I named the book the Rough Patches,

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.880
which is obviously a very common term.

7
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:32.390
It's not only applied to what I'm writing about,
but um,

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.130
because what I was noticing in my practice as I see couples and individuals was

9
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:41.900
people having this sense that they had
created their life.

10
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:46.010
They had partners,
they had houses,
they had children,
they had a structure.

11
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.690
But that sometime in the middle period they were finding themselves feeling kind

12
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:55.691
of lost or confused or stuck or feeling that something about their emotional

13
00:00:55.851 --> 00:01:00.680
life wasn't working.
So that's what I use.
Uh,
the term four.

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.040
But the book is structured so that each chapter is about a different kind of

15
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:08.390
rough patch or crisis or struggle.

16
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.190
So there's a chapter on money issues,
there's a chapter on an affairs,

17
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:14.900
there's a chapter on alcohol use,

18
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.760
different things that people confront over the course of a long relationship.

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.130
And so are these the types of topics that are covered in the book?

20
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.520
Are they,
are they changing over time?

21
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.700
Are they the same problems that our parents have dealt with and our grandparents

22
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.900
dealt with?
Or is there something different now?
Well,

23
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.360
I think people now live longer than our parents.
Our grandparents did.

24
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.420
So people are trying to have close relationships over longer lives.

25
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.050
And our model of marriage has also changed.
In other words,

26
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:50.870
that used to be more of an economic arrangement and the 60s,

27
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:54.740
it was more kind of find yourself arrangement.
Now it's more of a,
you know,

28
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:59.030
how can we have a close intimate partnership that helps carry us through and

29
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.710
support each other in that process.

30
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
And so the model has changed and our lifespan has changed.

31
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.520
So that's a fact of living today.
Um,

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.660
there obviously the timeworn problems that people have in relationships in terms

33
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.810
of emotional communication and the other things I've mentioned,

34
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.010
I think a couple things that probably all of you can relate to that are new and

35
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:24.011
different or the way in which technology is completely seeped into every aspect

36
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:25.970
of our lives.
Um,

37
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.030
and all the possibilities for connecting that have been created by social media.

38
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.940
And my understanding of that is it's new and old.
I mean,

39
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:37.550
it's a new way in which we deploy our time,

40
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:41.150
but it's also often used in very,
um,

41
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.120
common ways,
namely to disconnect,
to avoid difficult emotional situations,

42
00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:49.040
to having a moment of escape and privacy.
I mean,

43
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.920
all the things that people are always trying to balance and marriage.
Anyway.

44
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.690
What about the trends in terms of when people are having children or,

45
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.590
um,

46
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.120
kind of some of the historical gender roles in relationships or those adding

47
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.950
complexities as well?
Right.

48
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:07.810
So a couple of things are really interesting about that.

49
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.710
One is that if you look at the statistics on longevity of marriage,

50
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.300
now the people who are staying married and not getting divorced are people who

51
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.820
have education and economic resources,

52
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.540
which makes a lot of sense because often they have fewer stresses in their
lives.

53
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.420
They have fewer economic stresses,
they have more opportunities.

54
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.560
It also usually means it's,
there's more egalitarian marriage.

55
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800
And whereas in the past,
and this,
even this,

56
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.780
as recently as the sixties and seventies,

57
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.660
women's education was actually a risk factor for divorce.

58
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.420
Now it is a protective factor for marriage.
So in other words,

59
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.710
you can say that an egalitarian marriage tends to offer certain opportunities

60
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.750
for collaboration and partnership.
Of course,

61
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.170
it also means we're all taking all roles all the time,
right?

62
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:55.090
So everybody is trying to be a full partner in every way.
Work,
child care,

63
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:59.560
money,
household chores,
et cetera.
So that means a lot of collaboration,

64
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.710
a lot of negotiation,
a lot of conversation,

65
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:06.400
and often conflict around division of labor,
of fairness,
who does what,

66
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.030
that sort of thing.
And so talking about children,

67
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.670
how our children hard on a marriage,
right?

68
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:17.140
So children are known to be one of the hardest stresses on a marriage.

69
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:19.270
Obviously it's one of the reasons people get married.

70
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:21.550
It's one of the reasons people want to stay married.

71
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.860
Having a family as a high aspiration for many,
many people.
But,

72
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.160
but the research does.

73
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.130
Unequivocably suggests that when you have your first child,

74
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.880
your marital satisfaction goes down.
And the way I think about that,

75
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:38.260
because I teach a class to,
um,
young parent,
well,
not so young in the bay.

76
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.140
I live in the bay area and I teach a class for people who are about to have

77
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:41.974
their first child.

78
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.640
And it's basically how to keep the couple relationships strong when you have a

79
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:48.430
child.
And if this demographic may be similar to that one,

80
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.790
but people's big worry is I've had this great life,
I've,
you know,

81
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.030
done all the school stuff.
I'm a fully formed individual.

82
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:58.150
We have this great partnership.
Is this kid going to kind of ruin everything?

83
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.900
Right?

84
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.260
I mean that's a whole different model from when people had their kids that,

85
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.410
you know,
21,
22,
25,
whatever.
Um,

86
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.170
and so there is this feeling that,
you know,

87
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:12.370
children are going to disrupt my life often with,
with people today.

88
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.270
Um,
but the way,
the way I think they do disrupt your life.

89
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.020
Cause I think when all the grandchildren are wonderful but the,

90
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.710
that it depletes resources.

91
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.520
I mean that there's basically more people that everything has to go around.

92
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:27.460
So if you think of that purely,
certainly economically,

93
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.010
but also emotionally and timewise.

94
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.660
And so I think what happens with children often is that the to do list and the

95
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:37.000
hierarchy of things that have to happen,
you know,

96
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.750
your emotional needs and your need to connect those lower,
lower,

97
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:41.740
lower on the list.

98
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.560
Because of course they're much more important things to take care of.

99
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:47.200
And as a mature functioning adult you have to take care of the kids first,

100
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.034
the job second.

101
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.600
And so it's this sort of a subtle demotion that starts happening about the

102
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:56.290
relationship.
And I think people try really hard to work on that.

103
00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:01.190
But what's so tricky about it is that the emotional relationship is something

104
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:06.020
that is complex,
is messy,
emotions are inconvenient.
You might feel things,

105
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.890
you might feel angry or sad or just connected and need to actually take time to

106
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.900
talk about that and sort it through.

107
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.810
And that's exactly what people are missing is the time to do it.

108
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.570
So that just takes,
takes its toll over time.

109
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.430
I imagine too that that things like sleep deprivation probably play into it,

110
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.730
at least in in my own personal experience.
Um,
and,

111
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.130
and things like wanting to have those conversations.

112
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.120
But maybe not in front of the children.
Yeah.
Right,
right,
right,
right.

113
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.300
Less time alone.

114
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:36.410
Obviously I sleep deprivation is murder for your moods,

115
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.320
for your sense of resilience,
right.
All your worst qualities.

116
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.030
Totally on display.
So yeah,
all of that.

117
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.310
So then like a once a week,
date night,
I'll fix it.
All right.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.

118
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.600
Now one thing I do tell couples,
which sounds incredibly pragmatic,

119
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:55.240
but I think it really can help.
Part of the problem with date night,

120
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.690
which I write about in the book,
um,
is that,
um,

121
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.520
what you want a date night is fun.
You Want Romance,
you want fun,

122
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:07.120
you want not to be worrying about the kids' problems all the time.

123
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:10.720
And that can be hard because if that's the hot top stress on your mind and your

124
00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:12.940
only time to talk,
it's like,
well,
now's the time.

125
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.480
But I recommend the people decide on a time of the week,

126
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:18.280
like eight o'clock Tuesday morning.

127
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.290
That's not when you're about to try to go to sleep.

128
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.230
That's not when you're going to try to have sex.
It's not on your date night.

129
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.610
And it's like,
let's just take a minute to check in.
How's the division of Labor?

130
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:29.200
How are you feeling about our relationship?

131
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:31.720
Just sort of like almost like a meeting.
Um,

132
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.500
because it's what I find is so pernicious and couples over time,

133
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.560
because in this book is really about this thing,

134
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.480
which is that our emotional life is who we are and our relational life is who we

135
00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:46.420
are.
And yet it sort of gets put on the sidelines,
right?

136
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:48.790
And so easily in terms of all our other roles.

137
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.050
And so I think that it's can be very hard to be the person who has to bring up

138
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:56.620
the conversation or has to be the person to say,
let's talk,
you know,

139
00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:59.650
some people are like,
ah,
no,
no,
I don't want to talk.
Right?

140
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:02.620
So if you know that it's Tuesday morning at eight that you're going to have this

141
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.900
back and forth,
it can take the pressure off of one person to be the initiator.

142
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.350
We're up discussion.
Or,
or when when your spouse hears,
hey,

143
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:15.160
we need to talk that they don't like to start having a panic attack.
It's bad.

144
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.980
Right.
Exactly.
They,
everybody knows eight o'clock,
Tuesday morning,
we're going to,

145
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.010
you know,
touch base.

146
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.870
So you talked about having more resources can actually contribute to better

147
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:30.310
outcomes.
Um,
so then how can money be such a,

148
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.770
such a problem if you have more money?
Isn't that better?
Okay.

149
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.860
It's certainly better than not having money,
right?
I mean,
um,
you know,
again,

150
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:43.480
on this sort of two Americas thing where people with education and economic

151
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.570
resources are doing better in terms of their marriage than people.
I mean,

152
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:48.580
that's sort of the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
I mean,

153
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:49.990
that's the America we live in,
right?

154
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:54.280
So people who are at the poorer and less educated,
um,

155
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.290
part of the demographic tend to not get married as much,
not stay married,

156
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.820
sent of more often,
et cetera.

157
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.980
And obviously economic stress is a huge difficult thing when you have it.

158
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.280
Um,
but you know,
just like everything else,
I mean,

159
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.880
it reminds me of the fact that people come in to couple therapy and they say,

160
00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:12.510
I can't believe we're fighting about,
you know,

161
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:15.420
the toothpaste tube or who takes out the trash.
This is so trivial.

162
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.520
It's so stupid.
Like why are we fighting about these things?

163
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.070
But of course life is those things,
right?

164
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:22.350
And it's this constant navigation of those things.

165
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:26.850
And money is a really charged issue,
even if you've have a lot of it.

166
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.320
Because I believe the reason it's a charged issue is because it's so close to

167
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.740
our sort of primal sense of survival and identity.
I mean,

168
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.880
especially in this country perhaps,
but how you spend money,
what money you have,

169
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.810
where you're allocating it is very close to people's sense of who they are.

170
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.180
And so in a marriage,
you know,

171
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.120
the ideal picture of a marriage in my mind is there's one individual,

172
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.390
another individual,
and together you create this thing,
this living,

173
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:55.380
breathing organism called the marriage.
And so it's not just what do you want?

174
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:58.110
What do you want?
Oh,
if you get what you want,
I don't get what I want.

175
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.630
It's what is the marriage need?
What does the family need?

176
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:03.840
What do we need to gather to make this thing that we're creating together?

177
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.170
And I think money lends itself to a sort of zero sum mentality.

178
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.110
You know where people are kind of,
if you get yours I won't get mine.

179
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.390
And it breaks down very

180
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.500
<v 2>quickly.
So</v>

181
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.130
<v 0>are you of the opinion then that all marriages can work,</v>

182
00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:22.510
all marriages can be made to be good marriages or are there situations where you

183
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:24.970
kind of need to know when to say when?

184
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.460
So when I started writing this book,
I had the hope,

185
00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:32.530
I had the thought that um,

186
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.560
if people work enough on themselves,

187
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.370
they can work out their relationship because I felt in my,
in my work,

188
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.310
one of the things you run up against a lot of times when a couple's having

189
00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:46.930
problems is they come in and each one wants you to fix their partner and make

190
00:10:46.931 --> 00:10:49.120
them a better partner.
But it's very,

191
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:52.330
very hard for people to really take stock of themselves and think,

192
00:10:52.331 --> 00:10:55.090
what am I contributing to this?
So part of the work of couple therapies,

193
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.940
you're both creating this,
you're both taking a role,
right?

194
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.470
So I sort of had this somewhat hopeful,
I guess,
idea that,
you know,

195
00:11:02.471 --> 00:11:06.250
if people really grappled with their own stuff,

196
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.520
that they can come to the relationship.
I'm on a better footing and they can,
um,

197
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.740
we'll be in far better position to work it out,
all of which I still agree with.

198
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.960
But I do believe also that some marriages are in some sense fatally flawed.

199
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.030
And I think part of what the rough patch is about the book is about the thinking

200
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:25.630
is about is how do you figure that out.

201
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

202
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.570
<v 0>And so that,
that taking stock of yourself and,
and,</v>

203
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:32.300
and personal accountability for improvement,

204
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:36.620
is that what you referred to in the book?
His guts?
That's an aspect of it.

205
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:36.861
You know,

206
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:41.861
I think people have the illusion that if the relationship's working well,

207
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.650
it's peaceful and serene.
And I don't think that,

208
00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:50.030
I mean I've been married for 26 years and I would say every day we have some

209
00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:53.920
kind of difficult conversation.
Not necessarily about a relationship each other,

210
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.510
but what about the one about the kids or what about some thing we have to solve?

211
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.770
And I think I talk about guts because they say it's always going to take courage

212
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:04.450
to have the difficult conversations.
I mean,

213
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:06.460
the fascinating thing about being a human,

214
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.910
and this is really come through with the attachment research and the last 30

215
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:14.860
years is we never get over being dependent and attached.
And so like,

216
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.700
you know,
I,

217
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.980
it's not okay that my husband and said I love you yesterday or last week or said

218
00:12:19.981 --> 00:12:23.080
goodbye.
Then he has to keep doing it.
In other words,

219
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.530
you keep have to feeling that feeling that the person keeps turning toward you

220
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.130
and giving you appreciation and gratitude and affection and warmth,
right?

221
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.900
That's never done.
Right.

222
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:35.620
And so I sorta feel like similarly the hard conversations are never done if

223
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:36.610
you're trying to get through life,

224
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:39.010
if you're trying to figure out are we going to retire?
You know,

225
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:43.450
what's our budget like,
you know,
you know,
are we drinking too much?
Uh,
you know,

226
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:47.440
how's our sex?
Like all these things are not going to be easy to talk about.

227
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.770
They're actually,
uh,
vulnerable to talk about.

228
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.370
And I sort of want to help people shift their paradigm.
It's a good day for you.

229
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:56.200
So you have the guts to talk about the hard things.

230
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.120
And so you have a part in the book that you talk about where you say that that

231
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.800
you need to,
you get a life.
Can you explain?
Yeah.
So,
um,
the,

232
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.690
the,
this book is,
is about,
you know,

233
00:13:08.691 --> 00:13:12.080
how do you have a close relationship over a long life?

234
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.940
And I think sometimes people have that notion that,
um,
you know,

235
00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:19.100
in order to get along with another person over a long time,

236
00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:23.210
you sort of have such suppress yourself or somehow just adapt yourself.

237
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.390
And I really believe that it's only gonna work if you feel you can keep,

238
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.460
keep developing and growing as an individual that you bring more and more into

239
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.740
the partnership.
And I think sometimes people feel,

240
00:13:36.741 --> 00:13:39.080
I was just talking to a friend yesterday was,
you know,

241
00:13:39.081 --> 00:13:42.320
husband and does a doctor and he had all this training and the whole family life

242
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:46.400
was really geared around his,
his life and his profession.
And she said,

243
00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:51.110
it's been so hard for me to sort of step out of that and realize I need to start

244
00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:54.830
having,
you know,
a voice and assert what I want.

245
00:13:54.831 --> 00:13:56.630
And we're always trying to balance that,
you know,

246
00:13:56.631 --> 00:13:57.800
how much should we have to compromise?

247
00:13:57.801 --> 00:14:00.110
How much do we have to suppress in order to get along?

248
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.510
But I really think over the long haul,

249
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.300
suppressing yourself isn't going to do the trick.

250
00:14:05.301 --> 00:14:08.810
You have to be developing yourself and involving yourself in,

251
00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:10.160
maybe that's going to mean saying,
look,

252
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.910
I'm changing and the way it was 10 or 20 years ago or five years ago isn't gonna

253
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.130
work for me.
I mean,

254
00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:19.400
sometimes people get upset that they feel their spouses changed the contract on

255
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:22.700
them and we agreed under these circumstances and now how come you suddenly want

256
00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:26.600
this?
And in mind you,
it's like,
of course that happens.
Time's passing,

257
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:30.330
you're growing,
you're changing.
And so,
you know,
my idea of get a license,

258
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.980
you have to sort of bring a lot of yourself to this and you have to keep

259
00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:37.070
developing yourself.
And that can always be a kind of messy balancing APP.

260
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.280
And so the,
the,
the old adage about how marriages work,
um,
and it,

261
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.520
and it takes work to make a marriage.
Um,
you're,

262
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:49.080
you kind of challenge the idea of what work me in that,

263
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.300
in that describe distress.
So,
you know,

264
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:56.250
there is this idea of marriage is work and everybody rolls their eyes and it's

265
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.830
like,
ah,
and um,

266
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.570
I mean what I see is the work of marriage is being open and emotionally

267
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:04.040
vulnerable.
That's the work.

268
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.160
It's hard to show up every day and be honest and be say where you're at and

269
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.960
express your feelings and communicate about them.

270
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.920
And I happened to believe that it's not a tenable stance and a marriage to say,

271
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:18.950
I don't like to talk about feelings.
Basically.
Um,

272
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.630
you may not like to talk about feelings.

273
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:22.730
You may be a person finds it hard to talk about feelings.

274
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:26.330
It may be that you feel you're a person who's not an expert yet at talking about

275
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:29.210
your feelings.
But the,
the,
the job,

276
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:32.780
the work is to cultivate the ability to,

277
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.530
to know how you feel and to express it.
And that's not easy.

278
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.440
And every day you wake up and slapped you.

279
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.770
The easy thing to do would be to watch my shows and get on my phone and go and

280
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:46.340
work out and not really deal with this other complicated person who's like wants

281
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:47.090
things from Nan.

282
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.080
I want things rom and I can't really figure out how to get along with.
Right.

283
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.200
Your job is to go like,
no,
my job is to keep trying to turn toward this person.

284
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.470
Keep trying to figure out the relationship,
keep trying to be close.

285
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.360
That's not easy.
How do things like,
um,

286
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.060
communication differences and style and things?
Um,
you know,
uh,

287
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.420
one example being that,
um,
you know,

288
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.450
somebody may simply be wanting to talk about what they're thinking or feeling

289
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:17.510
and the other person thinks they're being asked to solve the problem.
Right?

290
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:20.450
And so when you,
when you are,
you know,

291
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:22.940
how do you overcome those kinds of things in that,

292
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:27.620
in that work to stay open?
Well.
So it's a complicated question,

293
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:29.120
but I'll just say one thing about it,

294
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.790
which is in I think chapter three or four of the book I,

295
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.450
I use this phrase called feeling with and thinking about,

296
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.740
and it comes out of a whole tradition of psychological research that you can

297
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:41.240
read more about if you're interested.

298
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.350
But basically we've all had that experience of being in a couple situation and

299
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:46.580
one person coming home,

300
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:49.610
it's just trying to pour out their feelings and talk about what happened and

301
00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:51.960
sort of process that emotion.
The other one's saying,
well,
let me,
you know,

302
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.740
roll up my sleeves and help you solve the problem.
And then the first person,

303
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:56.350
I was like,
I don't want you to sell them my problem.

304
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.010
They just want you to listen to me.
Right?

305
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.890
So I believe that in a loving relationship,

306
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.340
if you look at emotional communication,
it has two parts.

307
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.180
It has you feel with the person and you think about the person.

308
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.100
And so you both have the experience of saying,
Oh,
I'm listening to you.

309
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.200
I'm trying to understand how you feel.

310
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.750
I'm trying to sort of empathize with you or you know,

311
00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:23.360
you had a horrible day and I'm trying to like listen and support you and then

312
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:26.240
there's,
you know,
let me think about you.
Let me think about the problem.

313
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:28.190
Let me help you solve it.
Do you want to help solve it?

314
00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:32.210
And sometimes couples breakdown,
you know,
sometimes it's a long gender lines,

315
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.410
sometimes the roles are reversed.

316
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:38.240
But basically it's like one person's fixing and the other person's just wanting

317
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.081
empathy,
right?

318
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:43.520
So I think everyone should be cultivating the ability to both feel with and

319
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:46.700
think about.
And love is expressed through that combination.

320
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.500
So if you could give everyone like one thing to either go back and think about

321
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:59.610
or practice at home tonight,
what would that first step?
Okay.

322
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.444
So

323
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.460
I think there's two things that are kind of in my mind,

324
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:07.350
like the wonder drug of marriage.

325
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.370
Like basically you can take two relationships that are identical in all their

326
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:13.380
different problems and assumptions.

327
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.120
But if in one situation the partners are able to say,

328
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.050
I'm aware of my part in this and I'm,

329
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.290
I'm trying to change.
So in other words,
what I call it,

330
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.450
and the book has self awareness and self responsibility.

331
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:32.451
So what I mean by that is if you can look at what you're doing together and

332
00:18:34.021 --> 00:18:36.750
really say,
I know I have a part in this,

333
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.050
I'm trying to understand what I'm doing and I don't,
you know,

334
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.080
and I'm sorry if it bothers you or whatever and I'm trying to change that is the

335
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:49.440
key element.
Everything else can be equal.
But if people can do that,

336
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.550
if they can look at themselves and take account of their behavior and they'd be

337
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:57.030
responsible about it,
no matter what they're doing,
you know,

338
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.290
that is just the critical difference that gives people hope or hopelessness.

339
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.620
If you're married to a person where the story always is,

340
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.070
it's your fault that I'm doing this.
If you would just change,

341
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.950
I would be different.
That creates a very corrosive,
toxic,

342
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.620
hopeless atmosphere.
So that's the one thing I would say.
Okay,

343
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.910
you have your marching orders.

344
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.580
We are going to take questions because we are recording this.

345
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.370
Please make sure that you make your way to the microphone.

346
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:29.930
If you would like to ask questions today,
um,
I'll,
I'll,

347
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.950
I'll talk about one more thing here and then we'll,

348
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:33.360
we'll go ahead and take questions from the mic.

349
00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:38.361
So I keep waiting for the age of my children to arrive where it gets easier and,

350
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.010
uh,
yeah.
Okay.

351
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.940
And,
and what I get is this kind of reaction,

352
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.300
especially from people whose kids are older,
they're like,
no,
it's not easier.

353
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:52.230
It's just different.

354
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:57.231
And so navigating those changes over the years,

355
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.790
I have,
the communication's got to evolve too.

356
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.070
It reminds me of when you have really little kids who are like,

357
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.340
someday this will be over,
they'll be in school.
Right?
And then like,

358
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.680
you know what,
I thought my kids are 25,
21 and 19 and,

359
00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.340
and every day we're worrying about something.
Right.
And,
and,

360
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.950
and every day we're having the hard conversations about what should we do about

361
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:19.050
x,
Y or z.
So it doesn't ever go away,

362
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.880
but there's a bread suffocation in actually being able to talk in a productive

363
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:27.870
and collaborative way.
That's kind of the hope.
Right?
So,
um,
yeah,

364
00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:30.210
the physical exhaustion,
I would say changes,

365
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:32.820
but there's always something the state suddenly get higher.

366
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:36.630
Now we're worrying about can they support themselves and will they find

367
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.800
happiness and love and,

368
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.210
or we're worrying about our parents and the decline that happens there,
right?

369
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:46.470
So you kind of get out of one situation and you start to take on another and

370
00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:50.260
that shift.
And one thing I say,
because I have a chapter on the empty nest,

371
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:54.790
which I've just become one of,
and um,
I say,
you know,

372
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.790
it's okay to be a beginner.
You know,
when you have first have a child,

373
00:20:57.791 --> 00:21:00.460
you're a beginner.
When you first have no kids at home,
you're a beginner.
Like,

374
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:02.890
what do we want know?
Who are we?
What are we doing?
You know,

375
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.430
I think sometimes we feel by that age we should know what's going on.

376
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.970
And I think life's not like that.
You're always,
you're always learning.

377
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.530
Are there any additional considerations or,
or um,

378
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.810
tips for when you go through really big life changes,

379
00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:23.811
whether it's a change in career or you're moving to a completely different place

380
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.530
or you've lost a parent,
like the big,
big life changes,
um,

381
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.360
where uh,

382
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:35.020
one of one or the other partner may not be kind of on their best.
Yeah.
Right.

383
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.570
Yeah.
So what other things can,

384
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:40.270
can people throw in to kind of help through those patches?

385
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.860
I think there's a couple things.

386
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.500
I think one is to keep reaching out toward each other,

387
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:46.570
but to respect what the other person needs.

388
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:49.950
And that can be hard sometimes because sometimes if you've got your partner's

389
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.681
gone through something,

390
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:53.920
they're very absorbed and they're not that available to you and you feel kind of

391
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:58.270
deprived.
Right?
But part of the thing is to keep offering support.

392
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.280
Um,
the other is to,
to sort of accept that.
I mean,
the point is,

393
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.960
I talk about the west with a metaphor,
the golden ring,

394
00:22:05.961 --> 00:22:09.850
but the point is that you're standing next to each other looking at life and

395
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:13.090
trying to help each other through.
Right.
And they're going to be these things.

396
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.530
And so how,
you know,

397
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:17.560
to be able to just accept that they're going to be times when you're not

398
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:21.290
available to each other when one of you who's terribly sad when,
you know,
and,

399
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.390
and to sort of understand that that's kind of part of part of the deal.

400
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.300
Um,
but I do want to say,

401
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:32.080
and I talk about this and I have a chapter called love sickness and longing

402
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.680
about people who sort of have these very absorbing crushes,
you know,

403
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:37.360
even if they're happily married,
but they become,

404
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.290
and one of the things I've noticed about that in my own clinical work,

405
00:22:41.291 --> 00:22:43.900
it's anecdotal,
but I'm really interested in studying it further,

406
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.130
is I think when people go through a big loss of some kind,
maybe lost a parent,

407
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:51.370
maybe lost a job,
maybe their child has it been problem,

408
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.620
it depletes them and sort of hollows them out.
And sometimes then they look,

409
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.680
they try to grab something in the world that will get them,

410
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:00.880
that will distract them.

411
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.260
And so I think also just to know your own vulnerability and the vulnerability of

412
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.200
your partner when you're going through something very devastating.

413
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.790
<v 3>Hi.
Hi.</v>

414
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.410
Do you have any advice or thoughts on being in a relationship with someone who

415
00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:20.090
has either a significantly less or orders of magnitude more income and wealth?

416
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.680
And I'm asking for a friend.

417
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.950
<v 0>I suspect there'll be a lot of that.
Wow.</v>

418
00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:33.930
That is so interesting.
I mean,
in my own experience,
you know,

419
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.220
you realize that an adult life you often end up around people about your level

420
00:23:38.221 --> 00:23:42.180
of wealth because it's not uncomfortable.
You sort of know what everybody can do.

421
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.553
Um,

422
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.840
but my best friend high school is extremely wealthy and so that's sort of my

423
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:51.230
only real,
it's,
it's fascinating.
I haven't given much thought to that.
I mean,

424
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.400
can you say anything?

425
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.880
Anything else specific about the struggle or the difficulty there?

426
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.680
Do you want me to make it up?
I'm gonna go sit down there.
Okay.

427
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.740
So one thing I could imagine coming up,
which comes up with my friend is,

428
00:24:07.741 --> 00:24:10.020
you know,
she's like,
Hey,
let's have a spa weekend.
Well,

429
00:24:10.021 --> 00:24:11.670
why can't afford the spa weekend?
Right?

430
00:24:11.671 --> 00:24:15.540
So it's like you paying and you know then in a couple,

431
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:20.541
I would imagine there's sort of like what are the feelings around one person

432
00:24:21.031 --> 00:24:25.460
having all this money that they can sort of funds thing.

433
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.640
They can't the equitable right now what I do with my friend is she gets this

434
00:24:29.641 --> 00:24:33.300
huge,
you know,
spa weekend,
then I'd buy the like pizza on the way to the spa.

435
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.940
So I guess there's gotta be some discussion.
I mean money is,

436
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:41.310
is is obviously a huge hot button issue and there's a whole 50 big chapter on
it,

437
00:24:41.311 --> 00:24:43.290
but,
but you know,

438
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.040
there's starting to be some discussion of what the understanding is there.

439
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:50.850
I think because I think this stuff's so complicated to talk about.

440
00:24:50.851 --> 00:24:55.410
We're all so bad at talking about money that I think the main advice I would

441
00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:58.470
have is like make it an explicit conversation.

442
00:24:58.471 --> 00:25:02.160
Now that doesn't mean everybody's going to know what their feelings are because

443
00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:06.350
it's an incredibly confused area for people and very conflicted and they're

444
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.250
complicated.
But at least to be having these sort of conscious,

445
00:25:11.251 --> 00:25:14.430
explicit conversations of like,
you have this,
I have that.

446
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.740
How are we going to do this?
So everyone feels fair.

447
00:25:16.741 --> 00:25:17.790
I'll just say one other thing.

448
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.320
I think one of the very most important things in a longterm relationship is a

449
00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:27.210
sense of fairness and justice.
And if people start feeling that's not working,

450
00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.310
it's very corrosive to the bond.

451
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.970
So I think you have to try to understand what does the money mean to each
person?

452
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.780
What to what extent do they feel you're kind of freeloading like even if they

453
00:25:36.781 --> 00:25:40.140
don't want to feel that they kind of do like try to really get all of this stuff

454
00:25:40.141 --> 00:25:43.240
out on the table so you can be kind of,
um,

455
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.380
conscious about the agreements that you're making.

456
00:25:46.381 --> 00:25:47.970
I think that would be really useful.

457
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:53.590
<v 2>Would you happen to have any advice for choosing a partner in the first place?</v>

458
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.890
So death when it prompts you appear,
they're easier to work through?

459
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.480
<v 0>Great question.
I mean,</v>

460
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:03.320
I feel like my next book because my kids are kind of getting to that age is
like,

461
00:26:03.321 --> 00:26:05.240
you know how to choose a good part,

462
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:11.090
where's my kids don't want to hear from me about it.
Right.
But um,
you know,

463
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:14.380
I would say the most important thing,

464
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.190
I don't think it's shared interests.
You know,

465
00:26:17.191 --> 00:26:20.230
cause I actually you can bring a lot of different interests and it's important

466
00:26:20.231 --> 00:26:22.120
to have your own interests anyway.
I think sometimes people think,

467
00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:25.390
well we've checked all the boxes on all these compatibility things and I think

468
00:26:25.391 --> 00:26:27.250
that's beside the point actually.

469
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.430
I think it's about emotional communication.

470
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.540
I mean obviously it's about the obvious thing is attraction and that you find

471
00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:38.140
them fun and like being around them whatever a good,

472
00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:40.090
if there's not a ton of mental illness in their family,

473
00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:44.090
just on a purely genetic level.
But I would say that,
um,

474
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.280
it's about whether this person is able to talk through problems and,

475
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.800
and I wouldn't get married till you've had some opportunities to talk through

476
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:56.040
problems.
Weddings are great opportunities to talk through problems.

477
00:26:56.041 --> 00:27:00.060
Just be willing to like bag if he can't get through the tolls.
But,
um,

478
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.580
but I think,
you know,
sometimes people got together with um,

479
00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.290
highly emotional dramatic,
uh,

480
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.360
people who sort of excite them and activate them only to find out later the

481
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:13.980
person is a total piece of work,

482
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.610
can't regulate their emotions to save their life and it's driving them

483
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:20.410
completely nuts.
So I would try to,
uh,

484
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.630
really look at can this person manage their emotions and talk to me in any sort

485
00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:28.830
of reasonable way about,
you know,
what they feel and can I do the same?

486
00:27:28.831 --> 00:27:33.000
So volatility I think is something to avoid addictions or something today I

487
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:35.100
could go on and on,
but that would be my main advice.

488
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.550
<v 3>So if you have a couple where both parties have a tremendous mountain common and</v>

489
00:27:40.551 --> 00:27:42.350
just do like everything together,

490
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.730
but then later on they realized that they do need to get a life and sort of like

491
00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:47.960
cultivate themselves.

492
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.720
What do you think a good framework for that discussion would be?
You know,
how,

493
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:56.540
how would the couple find the ways in which they can and should develop

494
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.130
themselves and individual ways.

495
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.660
<v 0>So That's interesting.
Um,
I mean I'm,</v>

496
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.120
I'm getting a feeling that that question might have within it something like one

497
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:13.920
of the people is feeling a little bit of a need for more of that because if both

498
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:17.250
people are feeling like we just love doing everything together and have only

499
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:21.510
shared interests,
I can't really say that's a problem.
Right?

500
00:28:21.511 --> 00:28:26.010
I mean life will introduce difference over time.

501
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:27.930
It just will,
you might have different parenting styles.

502
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:29.760
You might have different things you'd like to do with the kids.

503
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:32.790
You might have different families and different places that you're visiting.

504
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:36.240
I mean it will introduce it,
but say you're in the early courtship,

505
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:38.670
you've been together a while and you just love doing everything together.

506
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:39.504
That sounds great.

507
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.050
I think it's probably more though when one person is realizing it's a little

508
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:46.140
foster phobic here,
it's a little too much like this.

509
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.750
I need to have more outside.

510
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.220
And I think people in certain relationships feel very threatened by

511
00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:56.820
individuality.
And I think that's something to really take on.

512
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.790
I don't think it's a tenable position in a long term.
Couple of you,

513
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:04.020
like you can't go out with your friends or you know,
you can't go be,

514
00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:06.630
I mean that's a problem.
I think everybody,

515
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.670
it's important to hold a space for something like,
you know,

516
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:14.910
I love doing everything together.
We're incredibly compatible,

517
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.380
but sometimes I feel I just want to get out and do stuff with so and so or go do

518
00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:23.910
this.
And I want that to be okay with us.
I don't want it to feel unsafe.

519
00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:26.520
I don't want it to feel insecure.
I don't want you to be too anxious.

520
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.210
And anxiety is a huge thing in relationships and part of relationships is

521
00:29:30.211 --> 00:29:33.510
working through why you're anxious.
What can I do to make you less anxious?

522
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:37.950
But claustrophobia and having to always be together is usually,

523
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.580
um,
over the long haul of problems.
If I were the person who was feeling like,

524
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:46.000
I just want a little more elbow room here,
I would just try to introduce it as,

525
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:49.270
you know,
um,
I think it'd be really healthy for our relationship.
Hey,

526
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:50.200
let's read this book.

527
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:53.830
It says it would be healthy for a relationship to have a few things that we do

528
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:57.910
alone just to have more interest in more.
I mean,
because as life goes on,

529
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.400
I see couples who are in the middle of life and they're like,

530
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.120
our life's really boring and under stimulating cause I feel like my spouse

531
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.150
doesn't have any interests or they're always sort of watching TV or whatever.

532
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:10.660
So it's just sort of talk about it in terms of the benefit to the relationship

533
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.690
of bringing more stuff in I think might help.

534
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.920
<v 3>Hi.
I was wondering if you could speak to,
um,</v>

535
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.280
living together before marriage a little bit.
Uh,

536
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.810
I'm in this situation where a lot of my friends and people I know who are in

537
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:24.340
their mid twenties out in Seattle,

538
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.930
they see you living together before marriage as a good trial period to see what

539
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:32.530
it's going to be like to be with this person for the rest of your life.

540
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:37.270
But then on the other side,
I have my parents and people their age who say,

541
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.050
no,

542
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.160
you can't do that because living together without a bigger sense of commitment

543
00:30:42.161 --> 00:30:46.630
just makes it too easy to kind of run away at the earliest sign of trouble.

544
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.630
So I was wondering what your thoughts were on that.
That's

545
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.750
<v 0>yeah,
that's a great question.
And I think there were search on that.</v>

546
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:53.800
It's kind of all over the map,

547
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:58.720
so I'm just going to talk kind of from my own that kind of about this.

548
00:30:58.721 --> 00:31:02.290
I think that um,
you know,

549
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:06.220
living together will confront you with,
um,

550
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.240
the problems of living.
Like someone say like,
just,
you know,

551
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:13.870
you'll have to work stuff out and that can actually help you figure out can we

552
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:18.490
work stuff out?
Right.
So that's on the plus side.
I think that,
um,

553
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.720
on the negative side is I now at my age,

554
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:26.580
I'm looking back because you know,
some of my friends are divorced,
some are,

555
00:31:26.581 --> 00:31:31.000
it does seem to me that people kind of have backed into relationships who

556
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:32.950
weren't really wild about this person who made,
need,

557
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:35.410
sell persuaded by the other personnel.
Let's live together.

558
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:38.230
We're not really marrying,
it's just a step to work.
You know,

559
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.320
if in your heart you don't feel like I really want to be in this to live

560
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:46.840
together,
to see if you might then be more in love,

561
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:51.790
I think is a bad plan because once you're lives are merged and then we bought

562
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:53.350
furniture together and we have a dog,

563
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:57.160
it's so hard to ever really see things clearly and say,

564
00:31:57.161 --> 00:32:01.240
well I got into this in a sort of halfhearted way and now how am I kind of

565
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:05.740
possibly get out?
So I think it takes a real reckoning with yourself.
Like,
I,

566
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:08.500
you know,
am I in love with this person?
Like,

567
00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:10.420
do I really want to be with this person?

568
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.790
They may want to be with me more than I want to be with them.

569
00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:15.640
I got to be truthful about that now because it's going to be way harder to get

570
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:19.390
out of it and five years.
So I think the parents are thinking that way.

571
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:22.930
They're sort of,
I mean,
you know,
whether you have a marriage contract,

572
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:25.450
I'm a licensed like in my mind kind of who cares?

573
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:29.710
But if your emotional feeling is not that this is really like the one,

574
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:30.731
I think it's very,

575
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:35.350
it can be very costly and more costly to women just in terms of biological clock

576
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:38.680
frankly.
So I mean I would be more my daughter.

577
00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:41.630
I would be more worried about moving in with someone that my son probably.

578
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.440
<v 2>Um,
couples strive for</v>

579
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.020
happiness or contentment as individuals.

580
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:52.820
I was kind of vague,

581
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.760
so I don't know if that's really a distinction or is just semantics.

582
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.660
What do you think?

583
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.880
<v 0>Well,
so wait,
when you say as individuals,</v>

584
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:05.100
<v 2>I'm,
I'm happy,
I'm content,
he's happy.
She's content.
We're good.
Yeah.</v>

585
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.720
Is there,
is there a distinction there?
Is there like,
no,

586
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.780
<v 0>you mean like if we're,
if we're content with each other,
is that enough?</v>

587
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.410
<v 2>Yeah.
Or like,
yeah.</v>

588
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:20.370
Contend with our relationship or family or just a happy thought there.

589
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.383
Yeah.

590
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.940
<v 0>Well,
right.
So this is so fascinating,
right?</v>

591
00:33:23.941 --> 00:33:27.600
Because we live in this culture where there's so much written about being happy,

592
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.290
right?
And they're sort of the standard,
like,
you know,

593
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.870
are you happy and then you feel like you're falling short if you just actually

594
00:33:33.871 --> 00:33:38.280
have a like,
calm,
happy,
you know,
look pleasant,
sane life.
Um,

595
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.931
you know,
again,

596
00:33:39.931 --> 00:33:43.620
I don't want to say it's similar to my answer to the other person.
Uh,

597
00:33:43.621 --> 00:33:47.700
in terms of do you feel something's missing?
Right.
I mean,

598
00:33:47.701 --> 00:33:52.140
in some subjective sense.
I mean,
I think some people are just much calmer,

599
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.630
much happier in a domestic or you know,

600
00:33:54.631 --> 00:33:58.470
much more contented and a domestic arrangement where they get along and they

601
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.090
appreciate that and they,

602
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.500
they feel satisfied with that.

603
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:07.470
And other people need a lot of like,
excitement.
Right.

604
00:34:07.471 --> 00:34:11.400
And it's sort of knowing yourself seems to be the important thing in terms of,

605
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.620
you know,
what do I need?
In my life.
I have a friend,

606
00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:18.000
his son just got married very young and basically they both just love nesting.

607
00:34:18.001 --> 00:34:20.040
Like that's who they are.
They like a home,

608
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:22.500
they liked being home together and they like,
you know,

609
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.070
buying little rugs and coaches and that's who they are.

610
00:34:26.071 --> 00:34:28.470
Other people it'd be like,
oh,
I couldn't stand that.
I need to,
you know,

611
00:34:28.471 --> 00:34:29.970
hike Mount Everest or whatever.
I mean,

612
00:34:29.971 --> 00:34:34.350
so it really kind of depends too on sort of how you're made and how you're made

613
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.753
together.

614
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.003
<v 2>Hi.</v>

615
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.720
<v 0>Hi.
So,
um,</v>

616
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:46.970
while people are dating like me and my friends like to say comments on,

617
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.120
you know,
hold their day and say,
oh,
they're totally for you all like,
no,

618
00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:52.250
that no guy like you should totally date somebody else.

619
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.710
But once they're Mary Swerve Joan have that cop conversation maybe because you

620
00:34:57.711 --> 00:34:57.950
know,

621
00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:01.190
as opposed to all four of her whole out silence because we didn't say anything

622
00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:05.570
then.
Um,
do you think that is okay?
Like,

623
00:35:05.571 --> 00:35:09.140
is that beneficial to just now that they're married,

624
00:35:09.141 --> 00:35:12.530
just let them be or if you do notice something that you know,

625
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.470
I'll be okay with them talking about that spells behind the lock.
Yeah.
Just wait.

626
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.301
So are you saying,

627
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:21.910
should you say something to the friend about her spouse or should the friends

628
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:23.820
say something to you about?
Yeah.

629
00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:27.890
Should we as friends have a conversation at all?
Yeah.

630
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.830
All the people's spots.
Right.
So this is really interesting.

631
00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:34.090
So I,

632
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:39.750
I'm at the view that if you have a close and you really have questions about who

633
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:43.860
they're with,
that you should talk to them about it.
Um,

634
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.740
so we're talking before the American,
right before they make that decision.

635
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:50.360
I believe that because I think,
mmm,

636
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.730
who else is necessarily going to say it?

637
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.750
And you know them and you may see something they don't see.
And in fact,

638
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:01.860
I just read a book that's sort of about people who've been married for a very

639
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:05.070
long time and sort of what advice they give for younger people.

640
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.210
And one of the things they say is if your friends or family or expressing doubts

641
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:10.890
about your partner,
listen to them.

642
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:15.450
And the idea there is that you may have,
you know,

643
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:18.740
because you're in law or whatever you have,
you don't have as clear pictures.

644
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.090
They do.
And so the people you trust,
you should listen to you.

645
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.500
And I thought that was really good advice.
Um,
but I do think,
I mean,

646
00:36:26.501 --> 00:36:29.520
and I talk about this in my class with,
um,
you know,

647
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:31.650
these couples who are having their first baby,
you know,

648
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:35.790
part of the issue when you make a family and the little unit of the,

649
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:39.780
the couple and the child is you have to create a certain boundary around that.

650
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.010
You know,
you have to be,

651
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:44.670
have a filter for the inlaws and everybody else weighing in.
Right.

652
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.010
And I do think it's probably

653
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.830
risky to a marriage to feel like you have a closer channel with your
girlfriends,

654
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:54.900
then your spouse.
Um,

655
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.320
just in terms of that family structure and building something,
you know,

656
00:36:58.321 --> 00:37:02.340
it can be a problem unto itself if every time you are having a fight with your

657
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:04.110
husband and you're telling your best girlfriend about it,

658
00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:06.780
like that doesn't create trust with your husband.

659
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.340
But I think it's a really tricky thing to navigate that shift.
Right?

660
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.700
I mean basically it seems to me when your friend says we've decided to get

661
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:19.050
married,
I would sorta think it's time to just stop weighing in.

662
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.680
But I would be inclined to also not to then,
uh,

663
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.220
continue to have the same kind of girlfriend relationship about every complaint

664
00:37:26.221 --> 00:37:29.450
she has about them.
I'd be Kinda like,
um,
I,

665
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.220
I just think that's a dividing line in my mind.

666
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.840
One of your earlier comments around,
you know,

667
00:37:35.841 --> 00:37:39.500
if there's that one thing we take away and it was basically like self awareness

668
00:37:39.501 --> 00:37:43.310
was the thing that kind of sets a relationships apart.

669
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.960
And I guess my question is,
um,

670
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.400
what happens when one partner brings something up and the other person doesn't

671
00:37:51.651 --> 00:37:54.790
acknowledge it as a problem?
So I have two specific examples.
So on,

672
00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.150
I don't know if you've ever heard there's like a New Yorker or Harper's article

673
00:37:59.151 --> 00:38:02.900
on like emotional labor about how like,
um,

674
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.340
not to stereotype,

675
00:38:04.341 --> 00:38:08.150
but like a lot of women take on a lot of like planning for the family or like

676
00:38:08.151 --> 00:38:11.480
doing certain little things or things that,
you know,
cleaning up a little bit.

677
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.350
And then a lot of times their spouses don't consider those important,

678
00:38:15.351 --> 00:38:18.830
so they don't consider it something they need to do.
Um,
and another example,

679
00:38:18.831 --> 00:38:22.880
I have some friends that are having issues with their inlaws,
right?

680
00:38:22.881 --> 00:38:27.500
So like they have different opinions and they look to their husbands for support

681
00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:31.040
and they don't get it because the husbands don't see it as a problem.
So I guess,

682
00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:33.890
you know,
self awareness is there,
but they have,
you know,

683
00:38:33.891 --> 00:38:38.590
how do you address if they don't even see something as an issue?
No,
it's huge.

684
00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:39.670
Those are both really,

685
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:44.671
really common things and really important things and not easy obviously.

686
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.463
<v 2>MMM.</v>

687
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.540
<v 0>So I think I want to try to answer it from two angles.</v>

688
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.463
<v 2>MMM.</v>

689
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.250
<v 0>These are deeply emotional issues that,
um,
you know,</v>

690
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:58.600
division of labor and in loss.

691
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.693
<v 2>MMM.</v>

692
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.660
<v 0>Sometimes when we don't see eye to eye on them,</v>

693
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:08.460
we try to just manage our own feelings,
maybe suppress them,
not voice them,

694
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.890
you know,
work around at whatever.

695
00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:15.750
But we come to a point where we feel so challenged by it that we might,

696
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.500
uh,
express it in a very strong,
maybe negative way,

697
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.400
at which point the partner is reacting purely to the negativity and just then

698
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:28.321
minimizes,

699
00:39:28.321 --> 00:39:32.100
basically I see the partner and like just trying to survive emotionally sort of

700
00:39:32.101 --> 00:39:35.520
like tries to shut you down because it's like,
oh,
that's not a problem.

701
00:39:35.521 --> 00:39:36.960
That's not a problem.
Which is basically like,

702
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:41.040
I don't want to feel all the awful feelings that talking about this is created

703
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:45.120
and then that person shuts down and then the other person starts getting more

704
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:48.930
reactive and more upset.
So I just want to differentiate the actual problem,

705
00:39:48.931 --> 00:39:53.130
which are real problems that need solutions from the process that gets going

706
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.270
when you can't find common ground and you just feel like you keep butting up

707
00:39:57.271 --> 00:39:59.670
against the wall.
And what I'd like to suggest is that,

708
00:39:59.671 --> 00:40:04.160
especially in these very emotionally loaded issues,
you,
um,

709
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.270
feel unapologetic for your stance and your emotions,
namely in these cases,

710
00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:13.740
like it actually isn't unfair division of emotional labor or,

711
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.700
uh,
we're a family unit now and we need to fail.

712
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.280
You're out of functional way for us to stand up to the inlaws,
the,
you know,

713
00:40:20.281 --> 00:40:25.281
those are legitimate issues that a person has every right to demand a solution

714
00:40:26.011 --> 00:40:29.910
to and to,
to keep that in mind enough to say,
this is like,

715
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.960
this is an issue that we need to have a as neutral as possible a discussion on.

716
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.930
In other words,
it's not all about my reactivity to you,

717
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.250
it's about this isn't fair or this isn't working.

718
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.320
And then to go from that because really what happens often is when we're highly

719
00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:52.560
emotional,
the other person shuts down because the reacting toward emotion.

720
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:57.420
So I feel like you have to keep advocating,
keep bringing it to the table,

721
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.930
not be willing to be shut down by,
Oh,

722
00:41:00.931 --> 00:41:05.460
this is just you being emotional or you have a special problem with my mother.

723
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:10.670
But just keep being that the rational fair minded person that you are at work to

724
00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.970
to solve this problem.

725
00:41:11.971 --> 00:41:15.270
And I think people don't always think of it that way because it seems so kind of

726
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.420
denuded of the emotion.
But I think that's actually,

727
00:41:18.421 --> 00:41:23.130
I mean Gottman again from Washington talks about new truck being as neutral as

728
00:41:23.131 --> 00:41:26.070
possible in talking about highly emotional issues is key.

729
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:30.240
And I think what happens sometimes in these situations is people are trying to

730
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.820
emotionally survived so they start blaming other person for how they feel and

731
00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.560
and minimizing,
right?

732
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.310
And what's so hard and challenging in that moment is to say,

733
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.640
I'm going to hold on,
I'm going to hold on to my point of view.

734
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.540
I'm can continue to assert it in a calm way and I'm not going to give up on this

735
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:51.680
until we come to a workable solution.
That takes fortitude,
it takes courage,

736
00:41:51.681 --> 00:41:53.450
it takes energy,
it takes all sorts of stuff.

737
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.140
But that's the basic stance I think is important.
And I also think I said this,

738
00:41:57.141 --> 00:42:00.500
but I'm just going to say it again.
I don't believe it's a tenable position.

739
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:02.930
In a longterm marriage to say,
I don't want to talk about it.

740
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.350
You have to learn how to talk about things and it's not okay for the person

741
00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:09.670
saying,
why are you always harping on this?
You know,
I do plenty around here,

742
00:42:09.671 --> 00:42:13.790
or whatever it is.
That's not going to be the end of that conversation.

743
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.870
It just,
you know,
you have to say no,
it's a problem from me.

744
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.470
One thing I talk about in my class with the parents of,
you know,

745
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.650
babies to be is your,
the grownups.

746
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:28.250
Now there's no parent out there deciding what's right and wrong and which

747
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:31.280
sibling is right.
You know when you're a kid it's like you started it.
No,

748
00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:35.330
you started,
oh,
I don't care who started it.
You go to your room,
you are not,

749
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.290
people can sometimes have these sort of sibling ass kind of ideas about their,

750
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.870
some right or wrong on hide.
It could be handed down.

751
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.240
All of the marriage is about,

752
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.750
is caring about each other and caring about each other's feelings.

753
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.660
So if someone's minimize your feeling saying,
well I didn't feel that way,

754
00:42:50.661 --> 00:42:54.830
so it's not real.
That's not a stance that you,
um,

755
00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.610
it's going to work for you in long haul.
His stance is,
oh,
well,

756
00:42:58.611 --> 00:43:02.510
I don't see it that way.
I don't see my mother as a problem,
but you do.

757
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:06.380
So let's try to figure this out so that you're not suffering because you're my

758
00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:11.240
wife and I care about you.
That's,
that's where you're trying to go here.
Um,

759
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:14.900
so thank you so,
so much.
Thank you very much.

760
00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.790
