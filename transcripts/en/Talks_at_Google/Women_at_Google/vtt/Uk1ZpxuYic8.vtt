1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.060
So,
hi guys,
my name is Nate ruling.
I sit across the street over in sales,
look,

2
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:07.450
got the Microsoft business.
So nice to meet you.
Um,

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.400
we're here today because of a good friend of mine.

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.430
Eric Faye was talking to me about this fantastic story and this incredible woman

5
00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:19.600
and a team behind her as well.
Uh,
so he asked,
you know,
hey,

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.450
would it be possible to have a chat at Google?
And I said,
absolutely.
Let's,

7
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:26.590
let's do this.
Um,
so I have the pleasure of introducing Barbara.

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.480
I Aerosmith young today and today's talk is going to be about a personal journey

9
00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:35.230
into the world of the brain,
shaping the mind.
Such a cool title,
right?

10
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:37.540
Very exciting.
Um,
I've got three kids,

11
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:41.530
so I'm watching my kids develop over the years since it's been incredible to me

12
00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:45.370
and I cannot wait to see what we're about to see.
So I'm going to be quick.
Uh,

13
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:47.320
but before I bring her up a bit more about her,

14
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.930
she holds a bachelor in Applied Science Child Studies,

15
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.680
a master's in school psychology from the University of Toronto.

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.120
Her work began in 1978,
uh,
as,
uh,

17
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.450
and it's been recognized as one of the first examples of practical application

18
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.450
of neural plasticity,
which simply means,
uh,
you know,

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.250
the ability of the brain to change and rewire itself over one's lifetime.

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.740
It's fantastic.
Uh,
the genesis of the program lays in Barbara Zone,

21
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.610
journey of discovery and innovation to overcome her learning disabilities.

22
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.260
Um,
a description of which appears in her book that you guys have.

23
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:26.590
So thank you for bringing those today.
And then there'll be a signing afterwards.

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.660
Uh,
and uh,
the name of that book is titled the Woman Who Changed Her brain.

25
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.740
Many reviewers have written about her book,
uh,
to share one of the quotes.

26
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.060
I really liked this one,
a,

27
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:40.610
it will open your mind to new possibilities and how to deal with traffic jams in

28
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:45.100
the brain.
So I know a lot of us,
especially Google,
we have a lot of traffic jams.

29
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.860
Um,
sounds,
sounds fitting.
Um,

30
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.460
her life has been a quest to help individuals address learning difficulties,

31
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.100
uh,
so they can experience the ease and joy of learning,
uh,

32
00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:59.510
as well as achieve their dreams.
There.

33
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.480
This program is in over 91 schools across several countries,

34
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.550
Canada,
US,
Australia,
New Zealand,
Malaysia,
Thailand and South Korea.

35
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.450
So really excited to have her here.
Let's give her a warm welcome.
Thank you.

36
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.830
<v 2>And I'm sorry guys,
one more thing before we start.
Please silence your phones.</v>

38
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.460
Thank you.
Well,

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.500
I want to thank Eric Faye for making the introduction and,
and uh,

40
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.981
thank you,

41
00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:34.030
Nate for providing me the opportunity to speak about what I'm most passionate

42
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:34.301
about,

43
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:39.301
which is our human brain is incredible complexity and the possibility for

44
00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:40.690
change.
Um,

45
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.280
it's sort of what I'm probably most passionate about in the world and my life

46
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:48.910
and my work is really been an exploration of the territory of the human brain.

47
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.660
How it makes us uniquely who we are.
Because when we think about our brain,

48
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:56.170
it filters our perceptions of ourselves and our understanding of ourselves,

49
00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:59.530
our understanding of other people are understanding the world and understanding

50
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.540
of our relationship to that.
So really,

51
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.680
really critical in terms of mediating our experience.
And to me,

52
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.330
what's really promising is not only does our brain shape who we are,

53
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.100
but now we know what this concept of neuroplasticity that we can actually shape

54
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.340
our brain if we can understand how we can harness those principles.

55
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.140
And also I think what's really interesting,

56
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:24.550
we often hear the comment about he or she is just not good at that.
Um,

57
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.830
and we also attribute often attribute,
you know,

58
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.820
not being good at something as coming out of maybe an emotional base.
You know,

59
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:34.810
that person is just rude or,
or um,
you know,
they're not good socially.

60
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.380
And I would like to encourage people to start to look at behavior through a

61
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:42.670
cognitive lens.
Behaviors multiply determined.
It's not just cognitive,

62
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.650
but I think we ignore the cognitive.

63
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.090
If there's any part of our brain that isn't fully operational or functioning,

64
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.150
it will have an impact in terms of our behavior.

65
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.300
And I'm going to take you a little bit into that world today.

66
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.830
So science has taught us that,
as I said,

67
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:03.550
our brain really does shape us.
And if we think about how complex it is,

68
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.470
we have something on the order of 86 billion neurons that we're carrying around

69
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.690
in our head.
And to put that into perspective,

70
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.510
the world's population is somewhere between seven and 8 billion.

71
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.370
So incredible complexity.

72
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.500
And we have several hundred trillion connections or super highways in the brain

73
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.910
connecting different regions for neurotransmission and communication.
And again,

74
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.410
to put that into perspective,

75
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.450
we have more connections in our brain than all the stars in the Milky Way
Galaxy.

76
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:36.010
So incredibly complex and we can't really escape our brain because we carry it

77
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.660
everywhere we go.
Um,

78
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.640
also what I find really fascinating is no two brains are exactly alike.

79
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.880
So if you think about somebody that you know well or you look at somebody

80
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:49.180
sitting next to you and you note that there are physical differences between the

81
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.720
two of you,
I may have different eye color,
different shape of your nose,

82
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:53.920
different shape of your ears.

83
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.050
They're actually more differences between your two brains than all of those

84
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:00.700
physical differences combined.

85
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.230
So our brain really does make us uniquely who we are.
And to me.

86
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.370
So I said what's really,
really promising is this concept of neuroplasticity.

87
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.660
We now know that we can actually grow new neurons in the brain,

88
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.480
in the hippocampus,
which is really important for memory and for learning.
Um,

89
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.470
we know that we can increase neurotransmitter's.

90
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.720
We know that we can increase the branches,

91
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:27.721
the dendrites on the neurons to enhance neurotransmission so we can actually

92
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:29.020
change our brain.

93
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.770
So my story begins with my brain and it's really a story of a quest and the hunt

94
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:40.150
for a solution to my very severe learning disabilities that were identified in

95
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:43.060
grade one.
So it's a very personal story,

96
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.870
but it's also universal in that each and every one of us has a brain that

97
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.370
impacts our functioning.

98
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.720
And if we think about having a brain that's capable and incapable at the same

99
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:56.230
time,
that's the experience of someone with a learning difficulty there.

100
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.920
Things that we can do very easily.

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.830
And then there are other things that with the best will in the world,

102
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.210
they're really incredibly challenging.
And that certainly was my experience.

103
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.280
So for me,
growing up,

104
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.240
I lived in a world that was about as intelligible as Lewis Carroll's poem,

105
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.830
the Jabberwocky.
Um,
I didn't understand it at the time that,
you know,

106
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:19.730
I couldn't process language.
It was almost like I heard the words.

107
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:21.920
I mean I knew what the words were,

108
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.600
but I struggled to interpret them to attach meaning to them.
So for me,

109
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:28.580
I could understand things very concretely.

110
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.320
I mean if somebody said it's raining outside,

111
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:33.170
which I understand that does quite a bit here in Seattle,
um,

112
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.550
I could understand that because I could conjure up a visual image of rain.

113
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.380
But as soon as it got abstract conceptual,
it was impossible to me.

114
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.330
Something as simple as,
you know,

115
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:47.750
I couldn't understand how my ENT could also be my mother's sister.

116
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.920
I could not understand how could somebody have to relationships in terms of

117
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:54.560
numbers.
I mean I can understand one,
cause I could,
you know,

118
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.650
put one object up here I can understand for,
cause I could line up,
you know,

119
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.820
four objects.
You put that one over top of a four,

120
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:06.170
which is a relationship of a part to a hole.
It meant nothing to me.

121
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.200
Bigger than,
greater than,
less than under,

122
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:14.201
over anything that we had a relational connotation was incredibly difficult or

123
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:19.850
impossible for me to understand.
My notebooks were filled with diagrams.

124
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:24.230
I used my right hemisphere to try to interpret language by making drawings to

125
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:28.250
try to connect the relationships.
Things as simple as jokes.

126
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.050
I didn't understand jokes because it depends on irony.
So,
you know,

127
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:34.880
not wanting to feel left out as a child.

128
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.930
What I would do is I would laugh as much as everybody else was laughing because

129
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:42.820
I didn't want to feel left out,
but I had no idea what they were laughing at.
Um,

130
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.460
I was really vulnerable to con artists because how do you understand that you're

131
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:50.630
being conned?
You hear logical inconsistencies in what person or somebody saying,

132
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.270
well,
for me there was no logic in my world.

133
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:57.830
So there were no logical inconsistencies so easily.
Um,

134
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.750
you know,
believed what people told me.
And something as simple as telling time.

135
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.820
I couldn't read an analog clock.
In fact,

136
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:08.690
I couldn't read an analog clock until I was 26 and created my first exercise for

137
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.750
myself because to interpret time you have to understand the relationship between

138
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:18.590
the hour hand in the minute hand.
And I couldn't understand that relationship.
Um,

139
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:22.700
so any kind of abstract ideas,
concepts were hard.

140
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.030
I got identified in grade one is being rigid and stubborn and I really was rigid

141
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:30.920
and stubborn.
But again,
not coming from an emotional place,

142
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:35.921
it was a cognitive difficulty because for me any kind of understanding was so

143
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:40.610
hard.
One.
So if I came to understand something,

144
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.790
I wanted to hold onto it for dear life.
And if somebody said,

145
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:47.360
well think about another way of doing something,
think about an alternative.

146
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.440
It felt like I had to let go of this.
That was so hard for me to grasp,

147
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.500
to integrate something else and I just felt my whole world would fall apart.

148
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.180
So maybe in your lives,
you know,

149
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.900
somebody that's really rigid and stubborn and it might be because they can't

150
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:01.920
compare and contrast,

151
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.640
they can't see alternatives or way decisions are differences.

152
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.300
And what ended up having to happening in my life,
um,

153
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.810
was that very fragmented and fractured view of my world because nothing

154
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:17.820
connected.
There was no cause and effect in my world.
In fact,

155
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.000
I thought there was some puppet master up there pulling strings because I

156
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.800
couldn't understand why things happened.

157
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.180
It led to an incredibly fractured and fragmented sense of myself.

158
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.130
And I've described my world is living in a fog where meaning was just a femoral

159
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:34.320
and it would disappear into a mist of,

160
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.400
of just uncertainty and kind of joke that I lived in Amygdala hell.

161
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:42.540
I was terrified all the time because I didn't understand the meaning of what was

162
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.510
happening around me.
So,
and if that wasn't enough,

163
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.550
I had another difficulty.

164
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.760
So I had multiple what would be considered multiple learning disabilities.

165
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.990
So I struggled to register the location of sensation on the left side of my
body.

166
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.890
So most people,
if you go to put your hand on a hot burner,

167
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.570
your brain is going to tell you pain is going to tell you pain in your left
hand,

168
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.600
pull it up.
And I mean,
it's going to be just an automatic process.
I mean,

169
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:08.970
you're not going to stop and think about it.
Well,
for me,

170
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.440
my brain would tell me pain,

171
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.810
but it wouldn't register where the pain was coming from.

172
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:17.670
So I'd leave my hand on the hot burner.
Um,
which really wasn't very good idea.

173
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.990
So I learned probably around age three or four that I had to watch the left side

174
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:25.380
of my body because it would do things.
There's almost like an alien being.

175
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:26.430
It would do things.

176
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.800
I slammed a car door on my head once with my left hand and you know,

177
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.580
shattered a tooth.
Um,

178
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.140
my mother was convinced by probably about age five that I would not live very

179
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:38.910
long because I was so accident prone,

180
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.800
but it was a cognitive area that just wouldn't register the location of

181
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:48.210
sensation.
And imagine me on a sports team,
right?
I mean,
I struggled academically.

182
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.560
Nobody wanted me on their sports team in school.
And I understood why.

183
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.510
Like I truly wasn't an asset because I was so clumsy.
Um,
and ended up,
you know,

184
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:01.770
being bruised and banged and kind of battered and then imagine me driving a car

185
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.740
if I didn't know where the left side of my body was.

186
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:07.800
Once I started to drive a car,
I didn't know where the left side of that car was.

187
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.310
So not only was my body bruised and banged my,

188
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.280
well it was actually my parents' car cause when I first started driving,

189
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:18.780
their car was bruised and banged and dented on the left side by extension.

190
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.370
And then there was another area that wasn't working,
um,

191
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.060
area that allows you to represent three dimensional space inside your head.

192
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.860
Um,
I couldn't do that so I couldn't create maps inside my head.
Geography,

193
00:11:31.861 --> 00:11:33.450
geometry,
any activity,

194
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:37.560
chess checkers that involve a spatial component was really,

195
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:41.100
really hard for me.
And again,
things that we take for granted,

196
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.960
like crossing the street,
um,

197
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.690
was really terrifying because when you cross the street,

198
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.940
what you actually do kind of automatically,

199
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:52.870
she create a mental map of where you are relative to that car coming at you.
Um,

200
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.110
I couldn't do that.
So I had no idea where I was relative to that car.

201
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.520
So my compensation was to walk blocks out of my way to find a stop sign or a

202
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:05.110
stop light where a new cars had to stop and then we'd be relatively safe

203
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:05.860
crossing.

204
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.880
Or my other strategy was to wait by the side of the road until somebody else

205
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:11.080
came along to cross.

206
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:13.510
And I would follow them and I would pray that they didn't have the same

207
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:16.840
difficulty that I did in that we get across safely.

208
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.080
And I used to joke that I would be a safe crossing the I or crossing the street

209
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:24.250
with my eyes closed is with my eyes open,

210
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:28.250
which was probably pretty accurate because I couldn't do that spacial repertoire

211
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.950
representation and I would always get lost because for me there were no maps.

212
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.220
Um,
like,
you know,
I didn't even understand the streets connected,

213
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.240
so I couldn't hold any kind of spatial representation in my head.

214
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.100
So anytime I went somewhere I had to calculate in what I called last time.

215
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:48.760
So I would always give myself extra time because I knew I would get lost,

216
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.130
you know,
several times before I finally found my way.

217
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.440
And so those were some of the areas of the main ones that I struggled with.

218
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.400
And so for me,
when I began my schooling in the 1950s,

219
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.520
it was in the time of what I call the Pre neuroplastic paradigm.

220
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.070
So when I started in grade one,

221
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.210
the traditional belief was if you have a learning problem or there's a problem

222
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:13.870
in your brain,
nothing you can do about it.
Basically the brain you're born with,

223
00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:17.680
it's a brain you die with.
There was no concept of neuroplasticity.
In fact,

224
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:21.760
people believed there was no such thing as neuroplasticity.
Most people.
Um,

225
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.470
so in grade one I overheard my teacher tell my mother that I had a mental block

226
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.920
because this was before the term learning disability hadn't even been invented.

227
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.970
Um,
and being very concrete,
I just actually imagined that I had a piece of wood,

228
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:38.530
like a nice wooden cube lodged in my head that made learning really difficult.

229
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.030
And later I learned I didn't have a wooden cube,
but in a sense I had blockages.

230
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.130
There were parts of my brain that weren't working properly.

231
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.250
But imagine like in grade one,
I was given a life sentence,

232
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.220
told that I would never learn like other children,

233
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:54.520
that all of my academic career would be an incredible struggle.

234
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.440
And that I was really condemned to living in that,

235
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.840
that world of disconnected elements and confusion and fog.

236
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.690
And that really was my experience going through school.

237
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.250
And when I did eventually learn how to read and to write and do kind of simple

238
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:14.080
numeracy,
I used my strengths.
I have a,
um,
verbatim auditory memory.

239
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.040
I can listen to things and just like a little tape recorder,
remember them.
Um,

240
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.360
and I have a photographic visual memory,
so,
you know,

241
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.990
I can look at print and remember and that's what got me through.

242
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.710
And I had incredible drive and determination.
Um,

243
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.600
so I never understood anything I could memorize it and then,
you know,

244
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.690
match it up on the exam and I would get anywhere from 10% on an exam to 100%

245
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.030
depending if I made the right match,
the 10%,
you know,

246
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.370
I made a really bad match cause I didn't really understand what was being asked.

247
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.400
The hundred percent I made a better match,

248
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.230
probably really didn't understand what was going on,

249
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:46.480
but I just was lucky to make a better match.

250
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.980
But what my teachers would conclude if I could get 100% at one point and I got

251
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.800
10%,

252
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.260
I must not have worked very hard for that 10% and I worked as hard for the 10%

253
00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.210
decided for the hundred percent.
So certainly,
you know,

254
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.240
it was a confusing picture for teachers.
So I was very,
very lucky.

255
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:07.910
My father was a scientist and an vendor,
um,

256
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.830
had something on the order of 40 patents.

257
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:14.480
He conditioned electricity and I kind of caught that creative passion from him.

258
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:18.110
I really didn't understand anything that he was doing,
but I felt that,
you know,

259
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.910
that desire to create.
And he told me as I was growing up,
he said,

260
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.960
if there's a problem in your life and there's no solution out there in the
world,

261
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:31.490
he said,
it's your responsibility to go out and find a solution to the problem.

262
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.970
Kind of probably like what all of you do here.
You find solutions to problems.

263
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.390
And he also said something really wise that I've taken with me through my life.

264
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.910
He said,
don't be limited by conventional wisdom.
He said,

265
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:47.210
the rest of the world tells you you can't do this.
He said,
ignore them.

266
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.070
Don't listen.
Go out and do it.

267
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.290
So I sat on a quest to try to find a solution to my difficulties.

268
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.680
And for me the solution came to brilliant researchers.

269
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.080
Uh,
the first one,
Alexander Luria,
Russian neuropsychologist,

270
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:06.320
doing a lot of work in Russia after World War II where there are a lot of

271
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:08.870
Russian soldiers with very localized headwinds.

272
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:14.170
And what he would do was investigate clinically by giving them tests to try to

273
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:17.360
understand if there's damage to this part of the brain,

274
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.270
what can the person no longer do?
Therefore,
by inference,

275
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.770
what does that part of the brain do?

276
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.970
And he's really one of the seminal thinkers in neuropsychology and neuroscience

277
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.780
that started to map the brain,
um,
many,
many years ago.

278
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.550
So he helped with identification of,

279
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.460
of the function of different parts of the brain.

280
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.870
And I came across a book that he had written called the man with the shattered

281
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:39.620
world.

282
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.640
And it was a story of a Russian soldier who in 1943 in the battle of Smolensk

283
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:47.210
had a shrapnel wound to her,
part of his brain and the left hemisphere,

284
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:50.930
very localized wound.
And as I read this man's story,

285
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.630
I thought this man is living my life,
you know,

286
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:56.960
several decades earlier and halfway around the world in Russia,

287
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.660
he was using the same language in his journal,

288
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:03.020
talking about living in a fog where meaning was a femoral and would disappear

289
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.190
that I was using in my journal,
you know,
decades later.
And,
and in Canada.

290
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.990
So I had an epiphany at that point cause I knew I had terrible problems,

291
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:16.070
but I had no idea what the source of the problems were.
And to solve a problem,

292
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:19.070
you kind of have to get an idea of what the nature of the problem is.

293
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.360
So now I knew the nature,

294
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:24.500
I knew it was part of my brain that wasn't working properly.
So that was great.

295
00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:25.760
But then what do I do about that?

296
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.050
The next piece of the puzzle came in the work of Mark Rosen Schwag and he was in

297
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:34.340
Berkeley working with rats cause they're a lot easier to work with them people.

298
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.650
Um,
and what he was doing was putting rats in a really enriched environment.

299
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:44.030
We were a lot of stimulation then he would compare them to rats in a normal or

300
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:45.140
an unenriched environment.

301
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.850
And he would put them in little rat intelligence tests,
which is running a,

302
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.800
and he found those rights that had had the enriched experience.

303
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.970
We're able to learn the maze much more efficiently and effectively.

304
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.660
And then because they were ratzy cut their heads open and looked at their
brains,

305
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.760
um,
and well,
um,

306
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.650
and what he found was the brains had changed physiologically for those rats that

307
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:11.190
had the enrichment.
There were more neurotransmitters,
there were more,

308
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:13.380
you can see the slide of the neuron more dendright.

309
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:17.940
So more synaptic connections if they're more dendritic branches,
um,

310
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.080
increase more glial cells,
enlarge cappelary so more blood flowing to the,

311
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:22.914
to the regions.

312
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.090
I think there was something like 12 physiological variables that it changed with

313
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:29.460
the enrichment that led to,

314
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:32.700
he inferred the improved performance on the mazes.

315
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.480
So I had to infer,
even though nobody was looking at it at that time,

316
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:40.260
or believe that if rats had neuroplasticity,
humans,

317
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:42.150
like we must have neuroplasticity.

318
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.660
And I kind of thought that we probably had more neuroplasticity than rats.

319
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.830
So I thought if I can take Laurie's work,
um,

320
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.810
and understand the nature of what that part of the brain is supposed to do,

321
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:56.730
like what's this job and what's its function?

322
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.620
Maybe I could find an activity or a task that would stimulate it to make it
work.

323
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.670
So I figured it might not work because the rest of the world was saying it

324
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:09.990
couldn't.
But what did I have to lose other than time?
And it was 25,

325
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:13.090
26 I couldn't tell time.
So I figured,
what does it really matter?
Well,

326
00:19:13.091 --> 00:19:15.840
let me try it.
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.550
And so the age of 26,
I said out with the first exercise and what did I use?

328
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:23.700
I use clocks.
Not that I wanted to get better telling time,

329
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.850
but the concept is you need to force the brain to do what it's designed to do.

330
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.990
But what is really difficult,
and I couldn't do the relational piece.

331
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:39.170
So I use the clocks to force processing relationships and I got really fast at

332
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:41.970
reading a two handed clock.
Um,
really accurate.

333
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.240
I mean it was pretty visible at the beginning.
Um,
and that was great.

334
00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:48.210
So now I can tell time,
but I didn't feel any cognitive change.

335
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.790
And to drive neuroplastic change,

336
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:53.520
you have to increase novelty and complex complexity.

337
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.510
So what I did is I kept adding more hands,
more relationships,

338
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:01.290
and now we have a 10 hand o'clock,
which anybody can benefit.

339
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:03.950
Like the only two people that have ever looked at it and interpreted.

340
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.590
One had discovered quasars radio meeting galaxies.

341
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:10.410
He was an astronomer and the other was a physicist from Harvard.

342
00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:14.460
So I knew I was onto something with this really advanced level.
Um,
and in fact,

343
00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:18.480
right now I'm talking to a university of Spain in Spain and they're looking at

344
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:22.200
putting that reasoning exercise into their university.

345
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:27.201
So every student will go into a cognitive lab and work on that exercise four

346
00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:32.760
hours a week and over a 10 month span will supercharge that cognitive function

347
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:34.200
in terms of being able to reason.

348
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.310
And it's that ability to process relationship simultaneously is insight.

349
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.230
You know,
where you like all this information,

350
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:43.380
disparate information comes together and you say,
Aha,
that's what that means.

351
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:46.350
That's what this,
this function,
excuse me is,

352
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.440
and also what I found interesting is,
um,

353
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.160
I've worked with a number of psychiatrists,
my,
my head schools in Toronto,

354
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:56.860
and then the snake mentioned their schools all around the world that implement

355
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:57.694
this program.

356
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.990
And if somebody has this problem and they can't benefit from insight therapy

357
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.500
because insight therapy means that you have to make cause and effect.

358
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:08.680
You have to see relationships between your behavior and emotions and other

359
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:12.610
people's actions.
And as students work on this exercise,

360
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.680
if they're in a therapeutic process,

361
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.980
what the psychiatrist or psychologist always report is at the level of it's

362
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:20.741
about,
you know,

363
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:24.340
the four relationship will live relationship level of the exercise.

364
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.870
They start to benefit from insight therapy.
So really very profound capacity.

365
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.870
Not that's just going to affect the person in school,

366
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.660
but in their whole life.

367
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.280
And I've had some students that have come to me that had been misdiagnosed as

368
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:42.670
having Asperger's,
which is a high functioning autism,
um,

369
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.510
because they have a severe difficulty in this function.

370
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.380
And as we address this function,
it's very clear that they don't have Asperger's.

371
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:54.480
It was just they couldn't connect,
um,
meaning to situations.

372
00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:58.900
So they walked around totally disengaged and not able to relate to the world.

373
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.960
So,
um,
pretty important area.

374
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.920
And as I worked on this and saw the change for me,

375
00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:10.900
what happened was I could now start to live in what I call real time,

376
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.150
whereas before I lived in,
when I called lag time,

377
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.200
because if I listen to the conversation,
um,
I would memorize it.

378
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.710
I wouldn't have that little tape recorder going and I would walk away and maybe

379
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.110
go over it and over and over for two,

380
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:26.050
three hours to try to understand what were those people saying.

381
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.920
And in some cases I could and in some cases I couldn't.
But even if I could,

382
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.050
it was three hours after the conversation.

383
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:36.250
So I couldn't be part of that human discourse.
Now I could listen to somebody,

384
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:39.790
I could understand this.
They were talking,
I could actually make a comment in,

385
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:42.070
interject,
understand what they said back to me.

386
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.060
I was actually part of human discourse and it was very,
very profound.

387
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.630
I could also now grasp math concepts.
I could understand fractions.

388
00:22:49.631 --> 00:22:51.460
I went back and taught myself all of elementary,

389
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:53.710
high school and college mathematics.

390
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.250
And now I can understand that from first principles rather than just memorizing

391
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:59.680
formulas and plugging in numbers.
Um,

392
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.110
I was no longer rigid because I could contrast and compare and weigh decisions

393
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.260
and see alternatives.
I can understand jokes.
Um,

394
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.350
I could tell time and I was no longer vulnerable to con artists.

395
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.030
So all of that changed as a result of one cognitive exercise.
So then I thought,

396
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.330
you know,

397
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.920
can I create an exercise to address the two other problems that I talked about?

398
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.290
Uh,
the first one,
the SMAD is sensory Cortex,

399
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:26.390
which there you have two strips in either side of your brain.
Um,

400
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.490
the somatic sensory cortex here controls registering and location of sensation

401
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:33.070
on your left side.
And then this one controls the right side.

402
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.770
So I knew there to create an exercise,

403
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:40.390
I had to do something with my eyes closed because my compensation was with my

404
00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:45.391
eyes watching what that side of my body was doing and really regulate movement

405
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:48.560
through vision,
not through sensory feedback.

406
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.480
So it created a whole complex exercise of doing movements.
Um,
you know,

407
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:55.130
with that side of my body,
I,

408
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:58.730
with my eyes closed and overcame that problem,

409
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:01.400
I can now register sensation on the left side of my body.

410
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:04.460
That location of sensation.
Um,
I don't bump into things.

411
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:05.630
I don't trip over my feet,

412
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.500
all of that because I didn't know if I went to walk out a door,

413
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.790
I just as likely hit the doorframe as go through the middle of the door because

414
00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:18.050
I didn't know where the side of my body was.
So address that.
Also,
you know,

415
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:20.330
if I picked up something in my left hand,
you know,

416
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.300
the first row in the audience might end up wearing it because I couldn't

417
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:26.900
regulate movements.
So I would over move or under move or drop things.

418
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.450
I can do all that now.
And to me,

419
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:33.170
what's powerful if we can understand this concept of neuroplasticity is we're

420
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:35.600
not teaching skills.
We're not teaching content.

421
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:39.920
We're not teaching the person how to do,
um,
um,
you know,

422
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.780
or learn an activity.

423
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:46.781
We're changing the brain's capacity to then learn to learn content,

424
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:49.250
to learn strategies,
to learn information.

425
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.180
And given that we carry our brain with us everywhere is incredibly powerful to

426
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:57.860
go under the content into the brain and stimulate that function.

427
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.090
And then the other area in the pridal,
this is a spatial area.

428
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.310
And again,
um,

429
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.260
I knew to create an exercise there that I had to do something with a spatial

430
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:12.930
component and do it over and over again.
So I created an exercise,
um,

431
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.060
and saw the change.

432
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:18.050
And now I think in the last three years I've gotten around the world a few times

433
00:25:18.051 --> 00:25:21.140
I'm talking about this work and I don't get lost.

434
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.620
I can actually read maps,
um,
and I can navigate,
um,

435
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.960
I can actually go to Ikea and buy one of those,
you know,

436
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.130
um,

437
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:36.130
bookcases or cupboards and go from a two dimensional representation and build

438
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:39.260
three dimensional representation,
which before I couldn't,

439
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.850
I would put the back of the bookcase on upside down and backwards.
Um,

440
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.550
because you can't translate,
you know,

441
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.070
two dimensional representation into three dimensional space.
I can do that now.

442
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.740
Um,
and for me,
those words,

443
00:25:51.741 --> 00:25:55.160
some assembly required before would strike terror into my heart.
I mean,

444
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:59.990
now I know I can assemble things.
And interestingly,
um,
my mother,

445
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:01.670
some of these are genetic inherited.

446
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.650
My mother and I both had severe difficulty and these things work on a continuum.

447
00:26:06.651 --> 00:26:10.850
You can be exceptionally strong in an area,
you can have average functioning,

448
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:13.070
you can have a mild problem,
moderate problem,
severe problem.

449
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.140
So anywhere on the continuum,

450
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.190
my mother and I were at the severe end of this and as a child getting into the

451
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:21.530
car with my mother,
I mean she had a good attitude.
She has,

452
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:25.910
it's going to be an adventure,
um,
because neither of us had any maps in our head.

453
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.620
So we kind of knew where we were starting.

454
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.360
We knew sort of where we wanted to end up,

455
00:26:29.361 --> 00:26:33.440
but it was like a black hole in between.
Um,
and she said,
we'll always get there,

456
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:38.130
which we always did and we never got there the same way twice.
Um,
but you know,

457
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:39.050
it was an adventure,

458
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.930
but it's like an older and kind of understood more about these,

459
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.890
these cognitive functions.
I asked her,

460
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:47.760
did this ever like have an impact on it took you longer to get anywhere.

461
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.570
And so she shared with me that when she gone to university,

462
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.010
she'd wanted to be a chemist,

463
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.320
but in her first year was encouraged to drop chemistry and she went into home

464
00:26:58.321 --> 00:26:59.610
economics.
Um,

465
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:04.050
she couldn't construct those molecules like that spatial representation inside

466
00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:05.760
your head.
It was just impossible for her.

467
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.840
And I really struggled also with organic chemistry because of this difficulty in

468
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:14.220
university.
Um,
interestingly again say,
well,
I work on a continuum.

469
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.940
I have four brothers and my oldest brother has this at a mild level,

470
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.910
not enough to interfere with him becoming a chemist,

471
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:22.980
which he did at the University of Toronto,

472
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:27.420
but he became a physical chemist because it still was hard for him to construct

473
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:28.350
those molecules.

474
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.530
So what I've learned in this work is that there's no free ride in a sense.

475
00:27:34.561 --> 00:27:38.280
Like if,
if there's a cognitive area of difficulty will have some impact.

476
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.650
It just kind of depends on what it is,

477
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:44.580
the degree that it's there and what you're doing in your life in terms of,

478
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.250
you know,
whether it has a limit shoe.

479
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.310
So in the work that I've created,

480
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.810
I currently can identify 19 cognitive functions and if people are interested on

481
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:59.100
our website down here at the bottom,
there's a cognitive profile questionnaire.

482
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:01.260
I think there's about 250 questions on it.

483
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.940
You can go in and answer these questions.
It's all confidential and at the end,

484
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.350
based on your responses,

485
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:11.730
it will give you a profile of where it's by your answers.

486
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.850
I'm suggesting that there might be some difficulties and then he'd go on the

487
00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:18.090
website and read more information if if somebody is interested.

488
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.410
So currently we have programs for 19 cognitive functions and I'm very clear that

489
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:24.420
this isn't everything that can go wrong with learning,

490
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:26.700
but it's really broad range from,
you know,

491
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:30.090
the person that struggles with nonverbal interpretation of situations,

492
00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:34.620
face blindness.
I have a program for person that can't reco recognize landmarks.

493
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:39.090
So cab navigate because they don't remember the look of a place spatial.

494
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:42.810
The person that gets lost because they can't hold maps or three dimensional

495
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:44.880
representation,
auditory memory.

496
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.970
The person just can't hold information and numeracy,

497
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:51.660
the person that doesn't understand number.
So a broad range of,

498
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:55.500
of different cognitive deficits.
And for me,
um,
you know,

499
00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:59.700
if you're working on an area,
you first need to identify where the problem is.

500
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.480
And if anybody hears somebody say,
um,
you know,

501
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:06.900
this one problem is going to fix or this one program is going to fix everything

502
00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:09.690
I would say,
you know,
run as quickly as she can.
And the other direction,

503
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.390
because in terms of the brain,
there's no one size fits all.

504
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.890
We have an incredibly complex Oregon here and I believe for something to work

505
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:21.420
effectively,
it has to be differentiated,
targeted stimulation to that.

506
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.930
Um,
they that function.
And for example,
if we think about reading,

507
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:28.410
this is a blood flow study looking at all the brain areas that come together

508
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:32.370
when somebody is reading.
So there is no reading area in the brain.

509
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.520
The brain works in what Larry called a functional system,

510
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:38.790
what we now call the neural network where multiple areas come together,

511
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.970
each one having its own task.
So there's eye tracking,
there's phonemic awareness,

512
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:45.820
there's sound symbol,
correspondence to hear the speech towns.

513
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.570
There's the visual memory to hold the speech pattern,
eye tracking to um,

514
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.460
learn kind of a motor plan for the eye,
for reading.
All these are critical.

515
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.980
So if a child or an individual struggling with reading,

516
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:01.780
it might be any combination of these.
The individuals we work with may have,

517
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:02.950
you know,
different components.

518
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.270
The individuals we see that really are probably never going to get past the

519
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:10.930
grade two or three levels of reading unless we do this cognitive work,

520
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.790
have all of these areas impacted.

521
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:17.230
So there's no piece that they can use to compensate for the difficulties because

522
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:19.960
every single one related to reading is problematic.

523
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.390
So if you want to see where you are and one of these cognitive functions and you

524
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:27.610
can keep it confidential,
um,

525
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.000
I think probably everybody in the room here has seen a cat at some time point in

526
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:32.580
their existence.
Um,

527
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.890
so this is an area in the right hemisphere that holds the look of things.

528
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:39.520
So if you want to just close your eyes and you don't have to do it,
um,
and see,

529
00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:44.521
can you actually see in your mind's eye or call up on the screen an image or a

530
00:30:45.071 --> 00:30:48.160
picture of a cat.
So whoever wants to to try it

531
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.940
and then if you want to open up your eyes and kind of see how you did.

532
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:58.180
So some people are going to see like a really vivid,
clear image of,
of,
you know,

533
00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.110
the,
the cat.

534
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.950
Some people it will be less clear and some individuals are just going to see the

535
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:05.020
back of their eyelids.
Um,

536
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.980
and I often call this the refrigerator dysfunction.
Um,

537
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:13.540
this is where the person just doesn't hold the visual details of,
of objects.

538
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.020
Um,
so they open the fridge door and they say,
you know,
where's the mustard?

539
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.900
Where's the ketchup?
So I think you're like ketchup better here.

540
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:22.930
We like mustard more in Canada.
Um,
um,

541
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.940
and they just,

542
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:27.460
because you don't hold the picture of what you're looking for or you don't like

543
00:31:27.461 --> 00:31:28.001
shopping.

544
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:31.330
If somebody has trouble here because you'll walk by what you're looking for

545
00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:34.150
multiple times before you just recognize,
okay,
yeah,

546
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:38.290
that's the cheerios or whatever it is.
Um,
you miss details.

547
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:41.840
This will be the person that um,
you know,
their wife maybe goes,
you know,

548
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.620
gets a make-over and they don't notice that,
you know,

549
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.640
something is different cause they not holding kind of the visual look of what

550
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:52.630
was there before and comparing it to what's there.
Now if someone's strong here,

551
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.700
they'll navigate by landmarks.
So go someplace once in the,

552
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.380
remember vividly what it looks like and you know,

553
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.680
where they have to to turn or they're really good with visual imagery.
Um,

554
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.600
I worked with a student that was studying to be an illustrator in Canada and she

555
00:32:07.601 --> 00:32:12.010
had this difficulty,
not massively,
but enough that when she would draw a cat,

556
00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:14.730
she'd leave off the whiskers.
Or when she'd draw a coat,

557
00:32:14.731 --> 00:32:15.850
she'd leave off the buttons.

558
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.830
And that was kind of a problem if you're going to be an illustrator,
um,

559
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.530
because you need to get the details down.

560
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.970
So actually she was one of the first people I created this exercise for and we

561
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:25.511
worked on that.

562
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:29.560
She improved this function and now she's won awards in Canada for her

563
00:32:29.561 --> 00:32:34.150
illustrations.
So,
um,
she doesn't miss details anymore.
Uh,

564
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:38.210
one person I worked with shared with me that she really hated to meditate.
Uh,

565
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.660
she had this,
and I mean she could do breathing meditation,

566
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:43.490
but she couldn't do visual imagery meditation.

567
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:46.130
So someone would tell her to close her eyes and go to her happy place.
Well,

568
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.300
she just saw a black screen.
Um,
so it's,

569
00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:53.840
it definitely doesn't necessarily impact,
um,

570
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.580
the person in school per se and academic learning.
But definitely in life.

571
00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:01.970
If people know Oliver Sacks his book,
the man who mistook his wife for a hat,

572
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.400
that's this cognitive function.
Um,

573
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.120
I have worked with some people that have had traumatic brain injury and one of

574
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:12.140
the students I worked with your head,
um,
massive right hemisphere damage.

575
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:13.790
He been hit by a truck when he was 12.

576
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.070
And I saw him when he was in his early thirties,

577
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.500
and the first day he came into my school,

578
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:22.340
he tried to exit through a filing cabinet because it was rectangular.

579
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:25.310
It had a handle to him.
It looked like a door.
Um,

580
00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:27.200
we worked on this and what was so amazing,

581
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:31.590
not only could he eventually recognize objects and landmarks,
um,

582
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.240
but he developed a visual sense of humor cause the whole visual world became

583
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.030
alive for him.
And he could see irony.
Um,

584
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:42.920
this area is also related to face blindness and face recognition.
Um,

585
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.470
so somebody that has a difficulty here,
um,

586
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.110
if they see somebody in context,

587
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:52.430
so they see some and their neighbor on the porch and the front house,

588
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:54.350
they'll know who that person is.

589
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.050
Five minutes later they'll see that person in the grocery store,

590
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.540
no idea who they are.
Um,

591
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.550
so I have a program that addresses that and these people often get labeled as

592
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:08.840
rude or standoffish and that isn't the case.

593
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:12.200
They just don't recognize the person.
I'm a good friend of mine,

594
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:15.440
had this difficult and we worked on it and she was a reporter at the Toronto

595
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.480
Star,
which is the second largest newspaper in Toronto.

596
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.850
And for 20 years she rode the elevator up and down,
up and down.
Um,

597
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.350
she had no idea every day that she wanted that elevator.

598
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.620
Did she know anybody on that elevator?
So she said she had two options.

599
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:32.330
One to just assume she knew nobody and if she offended somebody,

600
00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:35.960
so be it or potentially new everybody.
And if she got labeled as,
you know,

601
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:39.470
being over friend,
overly friendly.
So that was the option she chose.

602
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.850
But at one point she got accused of being,
um,
prejudicial.

603
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.640
A friend said to her,
you know,
oh,
Linda,
you think all Brown people look alike?

604
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.200
And Linda said to her,
actually,
it's much worse than that.
All people look alike.

605
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.150
But,
but because she didn't recognize people and make that discrimination,

606
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.980
somebody interpreted her behavior as,
as being prejudiced,
which was not accurate.

607
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.350
Um,
so that's this,
this function.
Um,
if you want to try,

608
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.520
this is the same part of the brain,
but now in the left hemisphere.
Um,

609
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.670
so one is holding the look of the thing which is in your right hemisphere.

610
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.520
This is holding the symbol pattern.
So again,

611
00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:20.990
if you want to just think of the word cat,

612
00:35:20.991 --> 00:35:24.740
so the three letters and you want to try and close your eyes and can you conjure

613
00:35:24.741 --> 00:35:28.280
up that,
um,
those three letters on a blackboard.
And again,

614
00:35:28.281 --> 00:35:32.300
some people will see it really crisply.
Some people it will be kind of fuzzy.

615
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:35.900
And a lot of the students that we work with don't see anything.

616
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.580
They can't hold the visual look of a word.

617
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.360
Some researchers call this the brain's letterbox or visual word,
form area.

618
00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:45.660
I call it symbol recognition.
But it's critical for spelling,

619
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:49.560
for word recognition,
even learning,
um,
visual symbol templates,

620
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:51.510
like math formulas,
chemical equations.

621
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:55.650
We know that you can just learn them visually if somebody has this difficulty.

622
00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.420
Um,
they don't,
and I'll just give you an example of the exercise that we use for,

623
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:04.890
um,
for this area.
So for every single one of the 19 functions,

624
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:07.860
we have very different exercises because we're targeting very different

625
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:08.694
functions.

626
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.940
And this language that the student is looking at is m heart from Ethiopia.

627
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.560
And often people say,
well,
you know,

628
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.930
nick is struggling with reading English.
Like why are you giving him Amharic?
Um,

629
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.380
the concept is that we don't want the child or the individual to compensate for

630
00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:31.260
the difficulty.
So if we use English letters,
they could put sound to it,

631
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.610
they could put meaning to it.

632
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.800
If we use m hark or Burmese or Sinhalese or Telegu,

633
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.200
um,
the camp put sound to it,

634
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.140
they can't put meaning to it because they don't know this language.

635
00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.430
So the idea of any of the exercises that we're trying to go in and target that

636
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:50.310
differentiated differentiated stimulation right to the area,

637
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.520
removing any possibility of compensation.

638
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.090
Now you can never fully remove compensation because the brain doesn't work that

639
00:36:57.091 --> 00:36:59.610
way.
So the student goes through a whole process.

640
00:36:59.611 --> 00:37:04.170
There's thousands of levels in each of the exercises.

641
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:08.580
And by the end of this exercise,
they're holding eight Chinese characters,

642
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.290
excuse me,
in their mind's eye.
And after that,
English actually looks pretty easy.

643
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.340
Um,
but again,
it's not that we're chain or not that we're teaching is skill.

644
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.780
We're changing the brain's capacity to hold symbol patterns.

645
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.950
So what you see changes with this word recognition,
spelling,
visual matching,

646
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:30.240
visual tracking,
anything related to visual symbol.

647
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.890
I'm learning visual symbol patterns.

648
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.160
And just really quickly if anybody's interested,

649
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:38.280
we have a number of outcomes studies on our website,

650
00:37:38.281 --> 00:37:42.660
which is Arrowsmith school.org.
Um,
so we've had studies done,
different schools,

651
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:45.790
different researchers,
different research designs,
all looking at outcomes.

652
00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:48.420
So looking at outcomes on academic measures,

653
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:50.790
looking at outcomes in schools with rate of learning,

654
00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:54.510
looking at outcomes on cognitive measures.
They're all summarized on the website.

655
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:57.960
So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those because you can look at it.

656
00:37:57.961 --> 00:38:02.560
But this was a study done at University of Calgary,
you know,
looking at um,
um,

657
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.930
academic changes.

658
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.380
The one I really like is this was done in the Toronto Catholic District School

659
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.190
Board,
obviously in Toronto.
Um,
and it,
this is a publicly funded board.

660
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.540
We know that students with learning difficulties aren't learning a year for a

661
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:15.690
year.

662
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.870
So these students were learning about two thirds of a year per year because they

663
00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:21.390
fall further and further behind because they're struggling with their

664
00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:26.250
difficulties.
We took this group of students,
I think they were 60,

665
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.230
60 students,
um,

666
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.740
and we put them half a day doing cognitive exercises.

667
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.980
So they're actually getting less curriculum than they were getting the previous

668
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.530
several years where they were learning two thirds of a year per year.

669
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:42.160
So now we're reducing their curriculum exposure by half.

670
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.730
And what we found a year after the intervention,

671
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.940
they were doubling and tripling the rate of learning,

672
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.190
having had less academics because we changed the brain's capacity to learn.

673
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.350
I mean,
again,
I keep saying this over and over again,

674
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:57.940
but this is the power of the brain.
I mean,

675
00:38:57.941 --> 00:39:02.920
you change the capacity of it to learn.
The learning just starts to go forward.

676
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.800
Um,
even when they'd had less exposure,

677
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:08.500
like these students could have sat in those English classes,

678
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:11.740
in those math classes,
um,
you know,
for year after year after year,

679
00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:14.650
and they were still going to be learning at two thirds of a year per year.

680
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.290
It needed the cognitive intervention to shift that.

681
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.650
And then we've looked at cognitive measures.
Again,

682
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:23.860
this was another study done at the University of Calgary and the brain gain lab.

683
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.840
I'm seeing changes on memory,
auditory processing,
fluid reasoning,
um,

684
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.900
as a result of the students working on these cognitive cognitive exercises.

685
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.430
And to me what's most exciting is the research studies that we started,
um,

686
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.580
the last year,
year and a half,
two years ago.
Um,

687
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.020
imaging research because my,

688
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.830
my hypothesis all the way through this work has been,

689
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.280
it's the brain that's changing.
Um,
it made sense.

690
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:53.260
That was the inference I made when I started this work,

691
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.610
but I didn't have access to this kind of research to do imaging.

692
00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.830
It's actually quite expensive.
Um,

693
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.140
so we have a researcher at the University of British Columbia,

694
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:05.830
just north of here in Vancouver,
Dr. Laura Boyd,

695
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.240
and at the University of Southern Illinois,
Dr Greg rose.
Um,

696
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.650
and we're doing similar studies looking at students with learning difficulties

697
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.070
and the intervention and we're seeing very similar results,

698
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:22.150
which hopefully within the next year will be published in peer review journals.

699
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.403
Um,

700
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.070
so he had to adapt the reasoning exercise for the scanner because if you've ever

701
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:31.510
been in an Fmr I like,
you know,
you can barely move,
you'd have to lie.
So,

702
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:32.763
um,

703
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:37.840
but what I wanted the researcher do is scan the students prior to intervention

704
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.210
and scan them three months in.

705
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.720
Because what we see with students all around the world in this program is at

706
00:40:43.721 --> 00:40:47.350
about the two to three month mark.
They start to experience cognitive change.

707
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.780
Like they start to be able to do things they couldn't do before.

708
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.950
And parents start to notice that teachers start to notice that people around

709
00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.030
them start to notice that.

710
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.090
So I wanted to see what something actually happening in the brain that the three

711
00:40:58.091 --> 00:41:02.110
month mark.
So we can see at time 0.0 with the reasoning exercise,

712
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.240
the brain is processing quite inefficiently,

713
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:07.270
is taking up a lot of real estate to do that activity.

714
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.700
And again this is very preliminary data.
Um,

715
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.610
and we've got more data.

716
00:41:12.611 --> 00:41:15.790
We've got I think 10 months data now that's being analyzed.

717
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.360
But what we were seeing at three months,
much more efficient processing,

718
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:20.980
less real estate,
taking up,

719
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.850
taking up to do that reasoning activity as a result of the intervention.

720
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.960
And another thing that we're finding in this preliminary data is,
you know,

721
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.090
if we look at the first,

722
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.420
you take the time activity at one time activity to subtract the two and see is

723
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:38.960
there something different between the two time points that's consistent.

724
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.420
And what we're seeing is the insula is changing.

725
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:45.190
It's that little area in the bottom slide that's kind of lit up,
um,

726
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.950
on the left hand side all the way across and all the students doing the

727
00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:49.970
reasoning exercise.

728
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.210
And to me it makes sense because one of the jobs of the insulins to attach

729
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:58.160
meaning to things,
it's to process information and make sense out of it,

730
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.200
which is what I had difficulty with.
And what that exercise,
um,
shifted for me.

731
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:09.100
And then what is also really positive is we're seeing change in the prefrontal

732
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:13.820
Cortex,
the front part of the brain.
I don't know whether this works,
but it's um,

733
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.830
so here you can see at time 0.0,

734
00:42:15.831 --> 00:42:19.190
there's very little prefrontal cortex activation.
And here at time,

735
00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.170
at three months,
significant,
this is the most important part of our brain.

736
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.230
This is the part that you probably use everyday in your job.

737
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:29.030
This is thinking problem solving.

738
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.780
Strategizing is analyzing a situation is,
you know,

739
00:42:32.781 --> 00:42:34.640
you've got a problem in front of you to solve.

740
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.900
And what happens is this is the part of the brain that activates first,
um,

741
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.900
to start to call in resources of how am I going to solve that problem?

742
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:44.810
What am I going to do?
And then as you're trying to solve the problem,

743
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:49.640
this is the area that allows you to reflect on the results.
So you know,

744
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:51.800
this isn't working over here,
what do I have to do?

745
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.300
Like how do I have to modify it?

746
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.290
It's that constant feedback loop as you're solving a problem.

747
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.550
We know students with learning difficulties struggle with that and that's what

748
00:43:01.551 --> 00:43:06.551
we're seeing at the zero time point is they're not using that part of the brain

749
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:09.590
very efficiently or effectively at time.
Point three,

750
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.710
they're starting to use that and that's what we see behaviorally.

751
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.770
And we see these students become better problem solvers,

752
00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:18.050
better executive functioning.
Um,

753
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:21.800
so to me it's really exciting that we're seeing the behavior and now we're

754
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:24.560
actually seeing the most important part of the brain shifting.

755
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.210
We're also doing another study at UBC.

756
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.200
I'm with this researcher and this is working with people with traumatic brain

757
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:35.210
injury and we just,
uh,

758
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.360
we're just finishing nine months of data collection.

759
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:42.350
These are individuals that were in car accidents.
Um,

760
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:47.000
a pretty significant trauma.
I mean,
a lot of them had been in comas.

761
00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:50.570
We got them several years after the traumatic event,

762
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:54.290
which means any spontaneous remission would happen over the years.
I mean,

763
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:56.840
my work is designed for people with learning difficulties,

764
00:43:56.841 --> 00:43:59.720
but over the years we had people come in because the brain is the brain with

765
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:04.280
traumatic injury and we saw our results.
Um,
so we thought,
let's study this.

766
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:07.880
And especially you can't open the newspaper now without reading about concussion

767
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:12.560
injuries,
even blast injuries if,
you know,
people coming back from the,
you know,

768
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:16.070
the various,
um,
uh,
war situations.

769
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.290
And what we're finding,
um,

770
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.680
the research actually was just published law or just presented last week in the

771
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:23.930
Netherlands.
Um,
the research are really excited.

772
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.110
They've got the three month data analyzed.
Um,

773
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.930
they're just starting to analyze a six month data at the end of March will be

774
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:34.440
the nine month data.
So by July,
um,
we should have publications.
It's just been,

775
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.740
the research has just been accepted in the journal for the frontiers of

776
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:42.150
neuroscience.
Um,
but we're seeing changes in conductivity,

777
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:44.760
the same similar kinds of changes that we're seeing in the students with

778
00:44:44.761 --> 00:44:48.060
learning difficulties.
So change in conductivity in the brain.
Um,

779
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:51.930
some change in Myelin,
which is again,
that that connectivity,
um,

780
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.990
and we're seeing change in what's called fluid cognition.

781
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:59.940
So the first kind of striped section or the people with a traumatic brain

782
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:02.700
injury,
um,
you know,
prior to intervention,

783
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:06.810
the blue or just normal students or individuals without traumatic brain injury

784
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.950
and the red in the middle is where they are three months after.

785
00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:13.980
So you can see they're starting and it's a significant change starting to move

786
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:16.800
up to normal.
And why is fluid cognition important?

787
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.700
This is that thinking problem solving.
Um,

788
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.050
being able to step into a situation and figure it out and,

789
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.480
and operate in that situation.
So critical for life.
Um,

790
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.340
and we're seeing changes on other measures.

791
00:45:29.341 --> 00:45:34.320
So really I'm very excited.
Um,
because you know,

792
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.450
the work can now be of benefit for people,

793
00:45:36.451 --> 00:45:39.990
not just with learning difficulties but with people with traumatic injury.

794
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.710
And again,
what are some of the areas like auditory memory?

795
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:47.840
This is the person that goes to the grocery store.
Like you said them out.

796
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.920
Can you buy me three things?
You don't write it down.

797
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:52.460
You just tell them they come back with only one thing.
Um,

798
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.260
because they can't hold the information or the child that comes home and knows

799
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:58.560
they have homework but kind of no idea exactly what that homework is because

800
00:45:58.561 --> 00:46:02.300
they can't hold the information and often they get labeled as um,

801
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.940
being irresponsible because they don't do what you ask them to do.

802
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.910
And truly if they have a difficulty here,
they're not irresponsible.

803
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:11.970
They just can't hold the information.
Um,

804
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.200
I know people that have post it notes all up around their house because they

805
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:18.060
have this problem.
If they don't have a,
you know,

806
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:19.560
their their notes or their to do list,

807
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:21.270
they aren't going to remember what they have to do.

808
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.440
Then number sense or quantity blindness.
I worked,

809
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.440
I've worked with a lot of people,

810
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:28.990
but one that Kinda stands out was a psychiatrist in Toronto.
Um,

811
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.490
and she would double book clients cause she kind of had no idea of like really

812
00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:34.260
what was 60 minutes.
Um,

813
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.040
it wasn't that she wanted it to make more money by having two clients in the

814
00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:40.620
same time period,
but she just struggled with that.

815
00:46:40.621 --> 00:46:43.470
She struggled with balancing her checkbook.
Um,

816
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.250
I worked with an opera singer that couldn't do time signature and music because

817
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:49.710
of,
of this area.
We address the cognitive function.

818
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:53.310
She was able to do her musical theory,
um,
exam.
You know,

819
00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:56.490
the individual that struggles with motor planning.
This was a student,
you know,

820
00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:58.470
they couldn't put their thoughts down on paper.

821
00:46:58.471 --> 00:47:02.370
So we've probably met people like this.
They tell you a story.

822
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.310
It can be really elaborate.
You put a pen in their hand,

823
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.270
nothing much goes down on paper is because they've got the thoughts in the

824
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:11.580
ideational content.
There's nothing wrong with their thoughts.

825
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:15.480
It's just the motor system that's translating the thoughts into a motor plan for

826
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:20.310
writing isn't working properly.
This was the same student 11 months later,

827
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:25.530
same 10 minutes went on for three pages.
We didn't teach him how to handwrite.

828
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:30.730
We changed his brain's ability to get his thoughts down on paper.

829
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.260
Um,
just really quickly,
uh,
another area,
um,

830
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.760
this is in the right hemisphere.

831
00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.060
This is what one researcher calls cognitive Goldie locks.

832
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:44.440
We've all met people with this difficulty.
It's where they look at a situation.

833
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.570
Uh,
nonverbal,
a social situation,

834
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.470
they kind of take one clue or cue from that situation.

835
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.890
They don't look at everything going on.
They make an interpretation,

836
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:56.890
which isn't the full interpretation and then they act on that.

837
00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.210
So they get into trouble.
Socially,

838
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.830
they're considered sort of a napped or awkward because they haven't read all the

839
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:05.350
information and interpreted it correctly.

840
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:09.160
A good negotiator has to be really strong here because they have to walk into a

841
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:13.150
negotiation and they have to do that minute by minute reading of what effect am

842
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:16.050
I getting?
Am I getting,
you know,

843
00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:20.290
the situation to move in the direction I wanted to move.
Um,

844
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.090
an example is if we look at this picture,

845
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:27.091
I gave it to a 12 year old girl who had really significant social problems.

846
00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:30.280
Nobody in her neighborhood would play with her.
In fact,

847
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:32.920
everybody said she lies all the time.
Um,

848
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.620
I asked her what was happening in this picture and she told me they were playing

849
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:39.160
badminton and I asked her why she thought that.

850
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:40.660
And it's sort of hard to see in this picture,

851
00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:45.280
but this woman has netting on her hat.
And this is severe premature closure.

852
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:48.820
She looked at the netting,
it triggers an association,
badminton,
that badminton,

853
00:48:48.821 --> 00:48:52.000
they're playing badminton.
She didn't look at all the rest of the information.

854
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:56.650
So in her nonverbal world,
her social world,
it wasn't that she was lying.

855
00:48:56.651 --> 00:48:59.830
She just misinterpreted things all the time.
And you know,

856
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.350
there are lots of examples.
Another girl looked at this,

857
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:06.430
she was 18 and she told me they were at City Hall in Toronto and I've been to

858
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:10.000
city hall many times and I didn't really think it looks quite like that.

859
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:14.680
And she pointed to the rope in the foreground and she'd been to city hall the

860
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.750
week before and there was an area cordoned off with a rope.
So again,

861
00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:18.790
that premature closure,
she looked at one element,

862
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.810
interpreted it and ran with that interpretation.
In both cases,

863
00:49:22.811 --> 00:49:27.700
we address this cognitive function.
Um,
you know,
the 12 year old is now 30.

864
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:32.030
She's,
you know,
successful in the world.
She can read nonverbal interpretation,
uh,

865
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.600
so as the,
the other individual.
So again,

866
00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:38.440
we're not teaching them skills or rules because there is no rule book for life.

867
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:43.150
You've got to go into all these situations and be able to handle the situations

868
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:47.650
in real time.
And that's what we're giving the brain's ability to do.

869
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:53.040
Um,
I'm just going to kind of cover this and then open for questions.
Um,

870
00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.800
I worked with a lot of adults in my school in Toronto and a number of the

871
00:49:56.801 --> 00:49:59.710
schools here,
there's a school in Redmond,

872
00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:03.400
a Eaton Arrowsmith academy that works with adults as well.

873
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.060
And I see a lot of adults that have what I call a cognitive mismatch.

874
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:12.900
This is where the demands of their job aren't quite aligned with their cognitive

875
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:17.380
profile.
So if we think about that auditory memory,

876
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.060
I worked with a pilot and airline pilot once and he couldn't hold all of the

877
00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:24.460
instructions for the air from the air traffic controller.

878
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.470
And I've found that a little worrisome,

879
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:30.260
his was to have their traffic controller repeat the instructions over and over.

880
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:30.921
But I thought like,

881
00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:34.520
what if you're flying into Chicago hair Atlanta that are really busy airports

882
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.670
and that air traffic control or really doesn't have time to repeat those

883
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:41.040
instructions and he can't remember them.
So my joke was,
you know,

884
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:41.900
if I was ever flying,

885
00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:45.080
I want to know what airspace he was flying in so I didn't fly in the same

886
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:49.070
airspace.
Um,
but the better strategy was addressed,
the problem,
which we did,

887
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.360
and now he can listen to the information once and hold it.
Um,

888
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:56.150
if we think about that object recognition,

889
00:50:56.151 --> 00:50:57.890
when I call the refrigerator dysfunction,

890
00:50:57.891 --> 00:51:01.910
I worked with the pathologists or he was in doing his residency in pathology at

891
00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:06.911
a teaching hospital in the u s he had that difficulty and he didn't really know

892
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:10.820
he had that difficulty.
Uh,
he was examining breast tissue.

893
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.150
It was somebody that had had cancer,
breast cancer,
and she'd gone through,
um,

894
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:16.040
traditional treatments.

895
00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.310
She come through chemotherapy and radiation and that was to see what she in

896
00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:23.210
remission.
And he knew how important this was.
So he was really careful.

897
00:51:23.211 --> 00:51:24.110
He was diligent.

898
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.550
He was looking at that slide and it was just about to sign off that the person

899
00:51:28.551 --> 00:51:30.950
was in remission when his supervisor came and said,

900
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.850
didn't you see these cells up here?
This is cancer.
And He,

901
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:36.200
it's not that he hadn't seen them,

902
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:38.660
he hadn't recognized them cause he hadn't hold,

903
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:42.410
held the look to match it up to that.

904
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:46.310
So he knew he was in serious trouble.
He exited out of his residency program.

905
00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:49.820
We worked on that cognitive function and he now will never make that mistake.

906
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.810
But I think there are a lot of,
um,

907
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.750
what we call human error and some of it can be explained by these cognitive

908
00:51:56.751 --> 00:52:01.580
mismatches,
that kinesthetic,
that problem I had where you don't interpret,

909
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:05.660
um,
you know,
sensation or register sensation on your left side of your body.

910
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:10.370
I've had some students that think it's a great idea to get a motorcycle,
um,

911
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.720
and they can't register sensation and don't kind of regulate their body movement

912
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.660
and have a number of accidents,
you know,
on that motorcycle.
Um,

913
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:23.630
because it plays into,
to that difficulty.
So,
I mean,

914
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.960
what have I learned?
There's every part of the brain is critical.
If anybody says,

915
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:31.460
you only use 10% of your brain,
tell them,
well,
I'm not going to swear.

916
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:34.970
Um,
tell them that they're not accurate.
Because over the course of the day,

917
00:52:34.971 --> 00:52:36.590
you use every part of your brain.

918
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.830
And if there's something that's not working in the way that it's designed to

919
00:52:39.831 --> 00:52:41.210
work,
it will have some impact.

920
00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:44.980
Most of us can compensate or we just avoid those things that,

921
00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:48.620
that are hard for us.
Obviously,
a lot of the students that I work with,

922
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:52.230
I mean from age six,
the oldest person I've worked with is 81.
Um,

923
00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:54.590
these are things where they pile up.

924
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:58.790
They have multiple areas that are coming together that caused difficulty and

925
00:52:58.791 --> 00:53:02.570
where they cannot really effectively compensate.
Um,

926
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.620
my vision is to get this work,
you know,
starting in grade one,

927
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:10.610
every child coming to school learns curriculum,
which is what we all do.

928
00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:12.440
But what do we learn with,
we learned with our brain.

929
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:17.060
So part of their day is devoted to cognitive exercises to stimulate function.

930
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.410
And what would that do?

931
00:53:18.411 --> 00:53:21.380
It would mean the students now that by grade three or four would get identified,

932
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:25.130
we'll never get identified because by grade three or four,
they'll,

933
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.500
these problems will be addressed.
It'll become a normal part of curriculum.

934
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:31.980
So there'll be no stigma because there's tremendous stigma still attached to

935
00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:36.030
having a learning difficulty.
Students with unevenness in their profile.

936
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.600
I worked with student,
it's mechanical reasoning was at the 50th percentile,

937
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:41.820
which is average.
He wanted it to be an architect.

938
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:43.620
You need to be at the 98th percentile.

939
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.380
I created my mechanical reasoning exercise.
Poor him,

940
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:50.340
got him to the 98th percentile.
He's now been an architect for 15 years.

941
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:54.120
That would get addressed,
you know,
in,
in those early grades.

942
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:59.070
Any child can benefit from cognitive stimulation.
And when I wrote my book,

943
00:53:59.071 --> 00:54:01.140
I put that as my vision at the end of the book.

944
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:04.530
And I was convinced I would never see that in my lifetime.
Well,

945
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:07.680
we're in a school in South Carolina,
I call it my whole cohort model,

946
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:10.650
the whole grade two classes doing two of my cognitive exercises.

947
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:13.950
This is their second year seeing really good results.

948
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.670
We're just starting in a public school in um,

949
00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:22.320
just north of Sydney in Australia.
They're taking their whole grade one class.

950
00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:26.490
These are just regular grade one.
Kids were doing that motor planning exercise.

951
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:31.450
Um,
if we go into the university in Spain,
we'll just,
you know,
um,

952
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.570
have all the students working on that reasoning exercise.
So,
um,

953
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:41.660
the vision is gradually happening and it just has huge applications for changing

954
00:54:43.711 --> 00:54:46.590
the face of education.
And that's what I'm passionate about.

955
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:51.650
Giving children and young adults and adults a different possibility in their

956
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:52.650
life.

957
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:57.600
Like having many more doors open to them and where they can make choice of what

958
00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:00.900
door do I want to walk through rather than having most stores closed and only

959
00:55:00.901 --> 00:55:02.430
one one possibility.

960
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.120
So I just want to thank you and I'm happy to take questions.

961
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:09.430
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

962
00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:14.290
<v 2>we have a microphone over here for anybody who wants to question or ask</v>

963
00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:15.370
questions,
just raise your hand.

964
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

965
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:23.990
<v 0>Thank you for the talk.
That was a really interesting,
um,</v>

966
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:28.430
so you emphasize that most of your work is done or focuses on,
uh,

967
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.870
people who have learning disabilities.
[inaudible] uh,
have you tested this,

968
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:35.990
these same kinds of techniques on,
uh,

969
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:41.080
patients with Alzheimer's or other sorts of degenerative diseases of the brain?

970
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.000
<v 2>Yeah,
there's a really good question and I think a lot about that.</v>

971
00:55:44.001 --> 00:55:45.920
The answer is really no,
I haven't.

972
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:48.590
My concern is if there's a neurodegenerative process,

973
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.450
I don't believe we know enough yet to be able to reverse that.
Um,

974
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.290
there's certainly research coming out that good cognitive stimulation maybe can

975
00:55:57.291 --> 00:56:01.820
stave off the onset by a number of years and there's a lot of good research

976
00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.900
looking at people that,
you know,
have to language which ads,
you know,

977
00:56:05.901 --> 00:56:09.470
cognitive load,
cognitive complexity,
um,
and the research testing.

978
00:56:09.471 --> 00:56:13.820
Maybe it's five years later that they show the signs if they're going to get

979
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:18.650
Alzheimer's.
Um,
so I think good cognitive stimulation is positive.

980
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.720
Whether it's going,

981
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.820
I don't just don't think we know enough at this point to say that it's going to

982
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.200
that.
Yeah.

983
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:27.050
<v 3>Have you,</v>

984
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:31.700
have you come across any examples where a learning disability has manifested

985
00:56:31.701 --> 00:56:35.720
itself as a learning super ability in some other context?

986
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.530
<v 2>I haven't.
I mean,</v>

987
00:56:37.531 --> 00:56:41.550
I've seen really unevenness in profiles where somebody can be exceptional in one

988
00:56:41.551 --> 00:56:46.380
area and have significant difficulty in another.
Um,

989
00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.740
but I,
I haven't seen,
you know,

990
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:52.910
I mean there's this concept that I've heard out there that,
um,

991
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:55.380
there's a gift of having a learning disability.
I,

992
00:56:55.381 --> 00:56:57.380
I've talked to a lot of people have learning disabilities.

993
00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:00.450
Nobody considers it a gift.
Um,
I mean,

994
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.160
it doesn't mean that maybe it teaches you if you can ways to compensate and work

995
00:57:05.161 --> 00:57:06.480
around,
but I just,

996
00:57:06.481 --> 00:57:10.110
I myself do not see the giftedness and having a learning disability.

997
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:15.060
It's a struggle.
It causes suffering.
Um,
it,
it,
you just have to work,

998
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:19.770
you know,
so much harder than everybody else to,
to function.

999
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:23.610
Now I have seen some students where because of,
you know,

1000
00:57:23.611 --> 00:57:24.530
they have a difficult here,

1001
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:29.100
they have a strength here and if they rely on that strength over and over and

1002
00:57:29.101 --> 00:57:29.760
over again,

1003
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.370
they're probably creating their own cognitive stimulation and they actually

1004
00:57:32.371 --> 00:57:35.340
improve that strength.
It doesn't change the learning difficulty.

1005
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.670
It improves the strength that they have.
I mean,
for me,

1006
00:57:38.671 --> 00:57:43.671
I think I always had a good auditory and visual memory,

1007
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.520
but I supercharge them.
I mean my way of studying,
I'd lay my book,
sat on my bed,

1008
00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:50.910
um,
as a child,
I would cry from the depths of my soul,

1009
00:57:50.911 --> 00:57:54.150
which I was putting my brain and kind of a zen state,

1010
00:57:54.151 --> 00:57:57.300
which I didn't know at the time.
Um,
and then I would,
you know,

1011
00:57:57.301 --> 00:58:00.060
read the first sentence,
close my eyes,
see it,
read the next sentence,

1012
00:58:00.061 --> 00:58:02.460
close my eyes,
see it by the end.
I can look at the first sentence,

1013
00:58:02.461 --> 00:58:06.620
I could close my eyes and I could see 50 pages of my notebook.
Um,
I,

1014
00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.730
I had a good a ability there.

1015
00:58:08.731 --> 00:58:13.320
I think I enhance that ability through using it all the time and,

1016
00:58:13.321 --> 00:58:17.790
and overusing it.
Hi.
Thanks for being here.
Um,
I was just wondering,
um,

1017
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.250
like even in your personal example,

1018
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.980
like you go through these training curriculum and then they,

1019
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.390
you try to identify the problem and find a solution after the person,

1020
00:58:27.391 --> 00:58:31.380
like kind of enhances that ability wherever they were weak.
Um,

1021
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:33.720
is something that you have to do to continue that or is it,

1022
00:58:33.721 --> 00:58:36.120
what kind of like if you,
if you don't use it you lose it kind of thing.

1023
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.950
Interestingly,
what we see,

1024
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.210
cause that's a really good question is there is no dropoff I've tracked myself

1025
00:58:42.211 --> 00:58:44.970
and other people have,
you know,
over 30 years out of the program.

1026
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.000
And I think why cause I mean we know if we stopped going to the gym,
you know,

1027
00:58:48.001 --> 00:58:49.080
our muscles atrophy.

1028
00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:52.410
But I think what happens is if we think about that functional system,

1029
00:58:52.411 --> 00:58:54.660
like all these areas coming together in a neural network,

1030
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.680
if there's some weak areas,
they're acting as a drag on that whole system.
Right?

1031
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:01.310
Once you s you improve them,
enhance them,

1032
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.260
they come up and then they get their own stimulation by being,

1033
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:09.030
by being engaged in that,
that neural network.
That's my theory.
I,

1034
00:59:09.031 --> 00:59:13.530
it makes sense to me practically what I see is once they've achieved the game,

1035
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.220
um,

1036
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:18.420
there's no drop off in function because I believe they're starting to use it in

1037
00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:21.980
everyday functioning.
Have you any difference

1038
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 0>between children and adults or how neuroplasticity</v>

1039
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.470
<v 2>changes with age?
When I first started this work,
you know,</v>

1040
00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.440
there was all this research,

1041
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:33.310
there's this beautiful window of neuroplasticity that starts to close at age 12

1042
00:59:33.311 --> 00:59:36.370
and you know,
it's kind of all over at age 12.
Um,

1043
00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.540
so I thought I would see a big difference in,
you know,

1044
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:45.220
the rate of progress in children versus you know,
adolescents,

1045
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.010
adults,
young adults.
I haven't seen that.

1046
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.670
Like it really was probably the biggest surprise that,
that I've found.

1047
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.390
I've seen variability in neuro plasticity,
which makes sense.

1048
00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:58.660
There's individual variability and everything and there's a lot of research now

1049
00:59:58.661 --> 01:00:03.220
looking at genetics,
looking at what goes into different rates of plasticity.

1050
01:00:03.221 --> 01:00:06.610
I mean,
I've got lots of examples in my work where,
you know,
two people come in,

1051
01:00:06.611 --> 01:00:10.120
they look very similar in the profile,
same gender,
same age,

1052
01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:12.610
do the same amount of work.
They both make progress.

1053
01:00:12.611 --> 01:00:15.250
But one goes four times faster than the other,

1054
01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:20.200
and then there's probably just more plasticity in that,
that individual.
But um,

1055
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:23.300
you know,
I think about the 74 year old,
you know,

1056
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.070
retired professor from the medical school at University of Toronto.
She came in,

1057
01:00:27.071 --> 01:00:29.680
she had face blind.
It always bothered her,
worked on it.

1058
01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:33.610
She made the same progress as a 15 year old.
So to me it's as I'm getting older,

1059
01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:38.520
it's really encouraging.
There's neuroplasticity over the lifespan.
Yeah.

1060
01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.470
<v 0>Big shout out to Google for the toolkit that you've developed.</v>

1061
01:00:43.471 --> 01:00:48.471
It's really enabled us to provide solutions for Barbara and her team that are

1062
01:00:49.861 --> 01:00:53.310
very effective.
Uh,
we use the APP engine.

1063
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.680
All of our software runs in the APP engine.

1064
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:59.940
Barbara's team is not technologists.
They're educators.

1065
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.590
They're scientists,
they're neuroscientists.
They don't run it shops.
Uh,

1066
01:01:04.591 --> 01:01:09.591
the cloud has enabled them to deliver seven 24 solutions around the world to

1067
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.380
many different countries.
Um,

1068
01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:18.020
what we've worked on with them is capturing all that data from those students

1069
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:22.350
that we talked about earlier and analyzing it and coming up with individual

1070
01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:26.880
programs for every kid,
every student,
be the adults,
whatever.

1071
01:01:26.881 --> 01:01:30.840
And then also tracking their progress through those,
those,
um,

1072
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.050
exercises as they're working on it and stimulating their brain,

1073
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:39.000
registering the data from year to year and keeping track of that and producing

1074
01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:42.950
reports and report cards.
Um,
and it's your platform that,

1075
01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:47.760
that enables that.
Uh,
as the next phase we're going to get into the classroom.

1076
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:49.350
And as we get into the classroom,

1077
01:01:49.351 --> 01:01:53.790
there's interactions with the students and interactions based with the teachers,

1078
01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:55.590
the teachers and student interactions.

1079
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.150
We're going to use the android tablet for that.
And uh,

1080
01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:04.220
the Google operating in the android operating system to connect between the

1081
01:02:04.411 --> 01:02:07.530
browser,
which we use,
quit the grit toolkit,

1082
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.930
a running on APP engine and the Android,
uh,

1083
01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:14.310
solutions that are running on the tablet to talk between the teacher and the

1084
01:02:14.311 --> 01:02:18.210
student in the same classroom.
So a big shout out,

1085
01:02:18.211 --> 01:02:23.160
we're using a lot of tools,
uh,
not to mention the chrome browser.

1086
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.990
Um,
and it's working out really well for Barbara and her team.
Thank you.

1087
01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:31.860
Uh,
if Americans are more into catch up then Canadians,

1088
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:35.760
then why do they only sell ketchup,
potato chips and Canada?

1089
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.260
Sorry,
just kidding.
Oh really?
You don't have ketchup dado chips?

1090
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.990
We do not have those here.
Well,
there's no loss.

1091
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.100
I do actually have a real question that I'm curious about.

1092
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:48.350
And you mentioned that,
um,

1093
01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.890
you didn't learn how to read an analog clock until you're 26 and similarly you

1094
01:02:52.891 --> 01:02:55.520
didn't,
you didn't understand different sorts of,
uh,

1095
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.340
abstract relationships until my plan.
Yup.
I'm wondering where,

1096
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.800
where were you in life at that point?
Had you,

1097
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.530
had you graduated from college at that point?
Had you already gone to school?

1098
01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.720
Did you go out and do it after,
after you kind of figured things out?

1099
01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:13.420
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
I,
I'd managed to get up.
I was in graduate school,
um,</v>

1100
01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:16.600
but incredible struggle.
Like I,

1101
01:03:16.601 --> 01:03:21.601
in my undergraduate I learned the routines of the security guards in the library

1102
01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.470
cause I would spend all night in the library.

1103
01:03:23.471 --> 01:03:27.130
So I would know when they were coming to do their little walkabout.

1104
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.270
I would hide out in the wash room.
I worked five days a week or no,

1105
01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:34.900
seven days a week,
20 hours,
um,
you know,

1106
01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.180
every single day just to tread water.
I mean,

1107
01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:39.940
that's what it took because I wasn't understanding conceptually,

1108
01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:44.180
I was having to rely on memory,
which is really brute force.
Um,

1109
01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:47.050
I compromise my immune system.
I have immune system disorder.

1110
01:03:47.051 --> 01:03:49.810
There's a lot of research now looking into the field of learning disabilities

1111
01:03:49.811 --> 01:03:53.920
and seeing a connection.
Probably it's all the stressors,
um,
that like,
you know,

1112
01:03:53.921 --> 01:03:57.400
that affect your endocrinal [inaudible] system.
Um,

1113
01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.420
so I mean it wasn't just a learning disability.

1114
01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.230
It affected all sorts of things in my life.
And just before I came across,
um,

1115
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:09.540
the book that was given to me when I was 13,
I attempted suicide,
um,

1116
01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.580
wasn't successful.
It was kind of that two edge sword,

1117
01:04:12.581 --> 01:04:16.060
the despair of having a learning difficulty thinking I've got to go to high

1118
01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:20.200
school.
I could barely get through elementary school.
How can I do this?
Um,

1119
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:22.810
so that despair led me to try to end my life.

1120
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.990
But my learning disability meant I didn't really understand the instructions of

1121
01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:30.850
how you did that.
And I can laugh at it now.
Um,
so I wasn't successful,

1122
01:04:30.851 --> 01:04:33.040
but when I woke up the next morning,
cause I thought you did something,

1123
01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:36.340
you went to bed,
you just didn't wake up.
When I woke up the next morning,

1124
01:04:36.341 --> 01:04:38.200
it was another opportunity to attack myself.

1125
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.820
Like I just couldn't even get that right.

1126
01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:43.430
But at just before I came across this work,
um,

1127
01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.540
this time I was planning again and this time I would have gotten it right

1128
01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:48.100
because I knew what I had to do.

1129
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:53.290
So that's why I feel like I owe a life debt to Lori is work.
Um,

1130
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:58.330
because that turned my life around.
Like I,
there was no future.
Yes.
I,
you know,

1131
01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.470
was in graduate school.
Um,
maybe I would've got through.

1132
01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:07.420
I'm not sure whether I would have or not.
Um,
but yeah,

1133
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.170
I mean there,
there was no,
no life.
I didn't have relationships.
I mean,
I couldn't,

1134
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.320
like if I got on an elevator and you know,

1135
01:05:14.321 --> 01:05:16.990
my university and one of my professors got on,

1136
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.650
I was terrified that they would ask me a question because I wouldn't be able to

1137
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:23.920
understand what they're asking and be able to have a conversation.

1138
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.210
Like I lived in terror all the time.
So

1139
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.021
just kind of,

1140
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:35.490
I guess in all your research and with working with so many different clients,
um,

1141
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:39.550
any like tips that you would provide just in general for overall cognitive,

1142
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:43.930
albeit a few.
Um,
I do have slides in here,
but I didn't get to them.
I mean,

1143
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.190
one of the best things you can do,
exercise,

1144
01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:52.360
aerobic exercise,
there's tons of research now.
Like I know you've got bikes here,

1145
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:57.250
you've got walking trails.
Like it doesn't have to be,
um,
more than,
you know,

1146
01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.730
go out and walk like 30 minutes a day.
A good,
nice brisk walk,

1147
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:04.420
like aerobic exercise.
And the rule is kind of,
it's good for your heart,

1148
01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:08.620
it's good for your brain.
Um,
it,
it stimulates,
it's called BDNF,

1149
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:13.030
brain derived neurotrophic factor.
And that generates,
um,

1150
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.210
well neurogenesis,
new creating new neurons.
Um,

1151
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.880
also it repairs cells,
you know,

1152
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:21.220
like sort of all that damage that happens over time.

1153
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:24.240
So if you can only do one thing,
get out there and you know,

1154
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:28.900
at least five days a week,
do some good aerobic exercise.
Um,
another thing,

1155
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.950
reduce stress.
I mean,
all the research is showing now,
um,

1156
01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:36.610
that that stress actually is almost like an acid bath for your brain.
I mean,

1157
01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:41.200
short term stress,
not a problem is that longterm chronic stress,
um,

1158
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:46.200
which,
um,
actually is,
creates negative neuroplasticity.
It,

1159
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.070
you know,
when those dendrites starting to branch,

1160
01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:52.690
it actually eats up the dendrites.
Um,
so anything,
whether it's meditation,

1161
01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.470
you know,
um,
again go sometimes going for a walk,

1162
01:06:56.471 --> 01:07:01.240
whatever you can do to reduce stress in your life,
um,
is good for brain health.

1163
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:05.530
Whatever you can do to increase aerobic activity is good for brain health.

1164
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.200
And then if you want to,
um,

1165
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.840
the other thing that's sort of novelty and cognitive complexity,

1166
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:14.320
which I talked a little bit about.
So let's say you want to learn something new,

1167
01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:18.360
what you should do is,
um,
it's,

1168
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:22.920
it's calibrate the level of the challenge,
right?
So let's say,
you know,

1169
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.790
I don't know,
you want to learn chess,

1170
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.060
but you're not going to start at the grand master level,
right?
Cause if you do,

1171
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:28.241
like,

1172
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:31.840
let's say you're functioning here and you start try to start the activity way up

1173
01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:33.880
here,
you aren't gonna be able to engage.

1174
01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:37.360
It's not going to drive neuroplastic change if you make it so easy,
the,

1175
01:07:37.361 --> 01:07:39.730
as soon as your brain goes on automatic pilot,
and it's not,

1176
01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:42.220
I mean the lots of times when you want to be on automatic pilot,

1177
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.150
but if you're trying to drive neuroplastic change,
automatic pilot doesn't do it.

1178
01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:49.600
So if you're making something too simple,
it's not engaging the brain.

1179
01:07:49.601 --> 01:07:53.400
So it's kind of finding that sweet spot,
just like an exercise.
Like,
you know,
if,

1180
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.190
if this is where it starts to hurt a little bit,

1181
01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:59.350
make it just a little bit more difficult,

1182
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.880
then do the activity and then we find it a little step up,
right?

1183
01:08:03.881 --> 01:08:05.290
And then make it a little more difficult.

1184
01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:08.650
It's calibrating the level of complexity.
Um,

1185
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.980
and you can do that in any activity you know,
that you're engaging in,

1186
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:16.640
and that will be the best thing to neuroplastic change.
So exercise,

1187
01:08:16.641 --> 01:08:20.930
reduce stress,
and calibrate the level of difficulty in your learning.

1188
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.850
Well,
thank you very much.
Okay.

1189
01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:31.180
