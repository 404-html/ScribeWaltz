1
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.030
So,
first of all,

2
00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:17.530
let me explain why I even have a right to a voice on Syria.

3
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.790
I've studied Arabic back in the 70s at Oxford and a hub,

4
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.010
basically devoted the rest of my life to the Middle East.

5
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.120
So I began with 10 years working for the British government.

6
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.790
So I saw the Middle East through the lens of the British government.

7
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.730
And then I switched to British industry.

8
00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:39.580
So I saw the Middle East through the lens of British Industry.

9
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.570
And then I became completely independent and started writing.

10
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.970
And so I've now written a lot about 16 books about Middle East,
um,

11
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.140
mainly travel guides,
very detailed cultural and social travel guides.

12
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.880
So that's been my focus.

13
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:59.460
So I would call myself a Middle East travel writer ultimately.
And,
um,

14
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.010
so the reason I wrote this book was because I was actually in Syria back in 2004

15
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.050
commissioned to write a very detailed guidebook to Syria.

16
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.491
And by chance,

17
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:17.140
I found it was possible for a foreigner like me to come in and buy a chunk of

18
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:22.000
UNESCO World Heritage site.
And I thought,
that's crazy.
How can that possibly be?

19
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.190
Um,
if that,
if that really is going to be possible and I'm going to do it.

20
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.130
So of course that was before the revolution.

21
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:33.550
So I embarked upon a scheme which I'm going to take you through now.

22
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:38.470
I want to journey basically into Syria to show you the Syria that I have learnt

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.280
to know.
Uh,
I've,
I've known Syria since the 1970s,

24
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:46.060
but obviously I only became deeply embedded in Syrian society,

25
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.790
whatnot after buying this house and everything that happened that,

26
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.210
so the book is the journey of the house and interwoven with that is the story of

27
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.460
the Syrian revolution.
How it grew up,

28
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.700
the complexities of Syrian society with a lot of background knowledge about,

29
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.620
um,
Islamic philosophy,
Islamic literature,

30
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.180
all of that is woven into the story to kind of give you a rich appreciation of

31
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:12.040
what Islamic culture is all about.

32
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.850
Because I do feel it's very deeply misunderstood in this country.

33
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.010
So to do that,
I'm going to,
uh,
first of all,
show you a map.

34
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.070
Geography is incredibly important in Syria is vital to understand where Syria is

35
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.680
on the eastern shore,
there of the Mediterranean,

36
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.800
which tells you really all you need to know.

37
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.210
Syria has always been on a crossroads in all directions.

38
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:38.860
It has been a trading nation.

39
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.050
It has been the criss crossing of so many different civilizations going right

40
00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:47.080
back to the earliest times of Man's history.

41
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.620
Every single civilization has criss crossed across this region.

42
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.500
And that is what has formed the Syrian identity.

43
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.420
It means that Syria over the centuries has become multicultural,

44
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.070
multi-religious and multiethnic.
And that's what's resulted in this very,

45
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.190
very complex Syrian society.
It's a kind of mosaic.

46
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.530
There are so many different elements to it.
And in this map,
um,

47
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.690
the darker areas that are the areas currently of conflict and displacement and

48
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.560
the reason for that.
So the areas that are not colored in are basically desert.

49
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.070
That's how Syria works,
that it has an eastern area with desert,

50
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.730
which is where serious oil and gas fields are.
Um,

51
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.590
but the rest of the area is actually surprisingly green with mountain chains,

52
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.630
um,
and forests,
um,
and the population,
needless to say,

53
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.750
as of course mainly concentrated,
therefore into those more agricultural and,

54
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.330
and livable areas.
Very,

55
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.350
very little of the population actually lives in those desert areas because Syria

56
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.260
is not a tribal society.
It's very important to understand.

57
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.110
That's a massive difference between Syria and Iraq.

58
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.260
Iraq is a very tribal society,

59
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.920
which is one of the reasons it disintegrated so badly after the American

60
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:03.790
invasion.
But Syria has never been like that.
It's a very cohesive society,

61
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.980
very blended on many levels.

62
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.630
So just to show a bit of the geography,
um,
Damascus,

63
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.970
the capital is right down here,
very,

64
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:17.830
very close to the Lebanese border and that tells you,
reminds you that of course,

65
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.400
this whole area was under the Ottoman Empire for 400 years.

66
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.410
And this whole area was,
um,
province.
The province of Syria,

67
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:31.360
which included Lebanon,
Israel,
Jordan and Palestine.

68
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.470
All of that area was,
was what's was called natural Syria,
greater Syria,

69
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.400
which of course then got carved up after the first world war with all these,

70
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.620
as you can see,
very unnatural looking borders.
So,
um,

71
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.650
historically Damascus therefore was always had very close links to Lebanon,

72
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.750
just like a Aleppo right up in the north there has always had very close links

73
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:57.010
to Turkey and Aleppo.
When it got caught up in the war,

74
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.770
it was natural for it to redevelop.

75
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:03.310
It's trading routes and relocate its factories into Turkey.

76
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.510
Just like so much of the industry in businesses around Damascus,

77
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.980
relocated to Lebanon,

78
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.740
then it's important to understand how the different communities,
um,

79
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.450
fit together here because they don't necessarily fall neatly into little

80
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:23.140
categories.
So when people talk about partitioning Syria and this kind of thing,

81
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.170
it's just not going to work because Syria is not like that.

82
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.150
It's much more blended.
So,
although loosely up in the north,

83
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.460
you have,
um,

84
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.340
what's generally referred to as a Kurdish belt because,
um,

85
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.510
about 15% of the Syrian population is Kurdish and they've been,

86
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.380
they've taken advantage of the,
um,
the lawlessness,
if you like,

87
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:52.300
of the last six years to carve out a territory at the top there for themselves

88
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:55.690
because the Syrian army President Assad's army simply withdrew,

89
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.830
just left the vacuum there.
Naturally,

90
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.250
the Kurds who'd always been aspiring to a kind of autonomy,

91
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:05.720
they are just filled the vacuum and started creating their own zones up there.

92
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.700
But of course,
um,
Turkey was absolutely not going to stand for that,

93
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.840
which is why Turkey has now entered the Syrian war and is carved out what it's

94
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:19.280
calling a safe zone right up in the north there,
um,

95
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.120
to make sure that the Kurds can't take over that territory.

96
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.540
And they're making very shortly as fits in well with president Trump's promise

97
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.050
to,
to build big,
beautiful,
safe zones in,
uh,
in Syria,

98
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:35.180
which you'll get the Gulf countries to pay for.

99
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:40.030
So that will be interesting to watch whether he succeeds in doing that.
Um,

100
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.880
and of course the other big players in the Syrian war at the moment are Russia

101
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.410
and Iran.
Now,

102
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:50.210
Russia's interest in Syria is economic and military.

103
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.530
It is always supplied the Syrian armed forces with their weaponry going right

104
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:59.450
back to the 50s,
but economic because it's,
um,

105
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.900
it is signed already a huge oil deal for,
um,

106
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.130
the as yet excavated oil offshore there an on as Mediterranean coast.

107
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.850
So it sounded 25 year deal to have the rights to drill for oil that,

108
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.580
um,
and of course,

109
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:20.480
Syria has also given it the opportunity to reenter the world stage.

110
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.250
And Iran,

111
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.460
Iran's huge interest in the Syrian war is to expand.

112
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.753
It's,
uh,
the,

113
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.770
the Shia crescent as it's known across into southern Lebanon into Hisbala.

114
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.220
It's,
uh,
it's armed,
it's,
it's financed and,
and trained armed militia,

115
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.280
which is a very,
very powerful player in,

116
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:45.740
in Lebanon and in Lebanese politics these days.

117
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.630
So you've got all these different complexities.
Um,

118
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.490
the overwhelming population of Syria is Sunni Arab,

119
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.090
which is the conventional mainstream Arab grouping,

120
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.070
largely very tolerant kind of Islam,
completely opposite to Isis,

121
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.150
which is what has of course taken hold of that.
And um,

122
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.280
Isis when it,

123
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.720
when isis appeared on the scene and took over [inaudible] their headquarters,

124
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.620
uh,
which you see the big lake up there and the,

125
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.010
and that river is the Euphrates river running off into Iraq.

126
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.660
Rucker is the first town after that lake.
And when Isis,

127
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.980
nearly three years ago now,
it's worth remembering just how long ago that was,

128
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.430
three years ago when Isis took over rocker,

129
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.300
everybody thought including asset himself.
Well,
what does that matter?

130
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.710
It's such a,
it's a provincial backwater.
Nobody cares at all.
But,
um,

131
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.750
they were very clever in doing that because by taking over Rucker,

132
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.830
they were very cleverly,
um,

133
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.970
taking control of the main water source for Syria.

134
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.760
The main hydroelectric dam,
which is on that lake,

135
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.050
and of course very quickly took over the oil and gas fields,

136
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:02.880
which as I mentioned,
are in that eastern area.

137
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So right from the start they were able to exert an unnatural degree of control

138
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.000
over serious infrastructure.
So,

139
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.060
and then the Christian population is about sort of between 10 and 15% is very

140
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.060
difficult to get accurate figures and they are scattered all over the country.

141
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.710
And then you have other strange,
um,
minorities like the Druze who,

142
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:29.580
who are scattered in these areas to the south,
but also across the cities,

143
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.140
just like the Kurds are also not just in the north but scattered all around.

144
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.390
So it's a very blended society.

145
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.720
So nowhere illustrates this blending more to my mind than the old city of

146
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:46.740
Damascus,
which is where I bought my house obviously.
And uh,
this,

147
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.540
this map is in the book and it shows the walls around the old city,

148
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.710
which are still intact,
six kilometers circumference,
um,
all the,

149
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.160
all the gateways,
the Roman gateways there,

150
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.750
eight of them all around the edges are still intact,

151
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.990
are still in use and everything.

152
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:07.590
You can get a sense as you walk through Damascus have layer upon layer of

153
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:08.580
civilization.

154
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.420
And so everywhere has built on top of the previous civilizations.

155
00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:17.100
So the military headquarters,
for example,

156
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:21.780
that calculated building up in the top left hand corner has always been the

157
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:26.100
military headquarters of the city.
So back in,
back in Roman times,

158
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:27.490
it was the Roman Castro.

159
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.650
Where were these troops were garrison then in the middle ages,

160
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:35.700
it was the place from which Saladin masterminded the Crusades.

161
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.980
And in more recent history,

162
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:40.830
it's been used by the Asad regime as a military prison.

163
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.690
And the s the street I'm running across the center,

164
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:48.240
there is the biblical street called straight,

165
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.620
which is the street that Paul was let along when he was blinded and fell from

166
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:56.850
his horse.
He was let along that street and up into the Christian quarter,

167
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.760
um,
where he was cured of his site.

168
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.780
And the spiritual heart of the center is that big mosque image there in this,

169
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.490
in the center number 11,
that has always been the spiritual heart of the city.

170
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.410
So it began as a,
as a temple to a,
whether God under the Aramaeans.

171
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.510
And then when the Greeks came,

172
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:23.310
they turned it into a temple of Zeus and then the Romans turned it into it

173
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.670
temple of Jupiter.
And then the Christians,
uh,

174
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.230
turned it into a cathedral of John the Baptist and John the Baptist's head is

175
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:32.730
still buried in that building.

176
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.550
And then when the Muslims came in the seventh century,

177
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.180
they too wanted to use that same space as their spiritual place of worship.

178
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.000
And so they came to an arrangement with the Christians to share the building.

179
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.980
And so they entered through the same but the same main entrance,

180
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:53.890
the old temple entrance and the Christians turned one way and the Muslims turned

181
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:58.240
the other.
And that arrangement any came to an end when they ran out of space.

182
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.030
And then the Muslims said to the Christians,
right,

183
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.800
we would like now to take over this whole area and make it into our main mosque

184
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:10.660
of the city.
And in exchange we'll give you land for four new churches.

185
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.120
So that's what happened.
And to this day,

186
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:18.330
those churches are amongst the 17 churches in the Christian quarter there in the

187
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:21.460
top section,
which are all still working,

188
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.860
all still functioning in Damascus now.

189
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.150
And so on a Sunday morning you hear church bells ringing out across the city,

190
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.950
mingling with the call to prayer.

191
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.460
That is how Damascus has always been incredibly blended.

192
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.240
And the house which I bought back in 2005 is down there at number one on the map

193
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.570
and that is in a a Sunni,
Shia mixed area.

194
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.300
So the building I've just been describing that,
that um,

195
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.600
that spiritual heart of Damascus looks like this.

196
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:56.230
Now this is the mosque that the Muslims built back in the seventh century.

197
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.990
And you can see straight away how blended that is.

198
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:03.980
Just looking at it with the Dome,
which is reminiscent of the Byzantine,
um,

199
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.700
uh,
style of architecture and the gable,

200
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:11.650
they're taken from the Hellenistic period.
And then the tall minaret there,

201
00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:16.651
which looks could be a bell tower or church spire is in fact called the Jesus

202
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.980
minaret because local tradition has it that on the final day of judgment,

203
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.210
Christ will descend from that minaret.
So this is very typical of the,

204
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:29.530
of the natural blending of lead traditions in Damascus.

205
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.740
And it's normal at Christmas and Easter for Muslims to go into the churches and

206
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.540
it's normal for Christians to go into the mosques.

207
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.200
The mosques in Syria are open to everybody.
You can go in there.

208
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:45.010
I spent hours in the courtyard of this mosque just sitting there.
You know,

209
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:48.790
you can have a picnic.
People just enjoy themselves.
Children run around,

210
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:52.460
treat it like a playground is very,
very relaxing.
Sort of like a,

211
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:53.860
a kind of a safe haven.

212
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.800
This is the same building in the depths of winter because it's easy to forget

213
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.180
that Damascus is actually very high.
It's at 800 meters.

214
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.090
And so in the winter,
um,

215
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.710
I took this picture actually just I'm in the winter of last year when in January

216
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.920
when the temperature dropped to minus 15.

217
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.890
So snow of this type is not unusual.

218
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.950
And the reason I'm showing it to you is that in,

219
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:27.040
in Damascus itself,
there is no actual fighting going on at the moment.

220
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:28.630
The fighting is all in the suburbs.

221
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.920
The center is safe because it said tightly under the grip of the Asad regime.

222
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.090
But the infrastructure problems,
which I explained a largely to do with,

223
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.380
with Isis,
um,
affect,

224
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.250
even the center of Damascus said,
even in the center where there's no fighting,

225
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.040
they still only have about three or four hours of electricity.

226
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:53.180
They have almost no gas,
almost no,
um,
no heating fuel.

227
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.690
And the water supply gets regularly blockaded by rebel groups up in the hills,

228
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:05.160
in the mountains where the main source comes from.
And so at this point,
um,

229
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.140
all these water tanks,
there's red tanks,
there are water tanks on the roof,

230
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.450
and all of them burst at that time,

231
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:15.380
which was an absolute catastrophe for people living in Damascus.
Um,

232
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.280
but the way surgeons deal with this,
and this is another very important thing,

233
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.520
is the laugh.
They're just,

234
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:26.300
they have this incredible uncomplaining aspect to them.
They,
they,

235
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.530
they just accept whatever's thrown at them and they don't let it get them down.

236
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.770
They actually laugh about it.
So,
uh,

237
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.690
a friend of mine rang recently and was laughing and saying,
oh,

238
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.453
um,

239
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.110
I was woken up at three in the morning by the sound of the water pump pumping

240
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.000
the water up onto the roof.

241
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.450
And so I leapt out of bed and rush to the shower because I knew that that was

242
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:53.960
going to be the only time that month when both the water and the electricity

243
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.130
we're both on together.

244
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.830
So it's going to be my only chance to wash my hair that month.

245
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.950
And they just laugh about this.
They,
they,
they just,
you know,

246
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.810
don't complain at all.

247
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.340
Now this is the facade of that same mosque.

248
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.140
And I'm showing you this because this is one of the earliest examples of Islamic

249
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.370
art.
And you can see straight away that the,

250
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.450
the imagery of it,

251
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:22.451
the iconography is also this very blended aspect they've taken in aspects of

252
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:26.150
Christianity and the earlier Hellenistic civilizations.
So,

253
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.950
but what it's aiming to do,

254
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.480
like most Islamic art is to project a vision of paradise.

255
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.660
And so the iconography tends to be trees and gardens and fantasize buildings and

256
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:43.160
rivers.
And,
uh,
but the,

257
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.240
the echo is a Christianity come in the,
the triple arched window,
you know,

258
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.400
the echoes of the trinity there and the columns here taken from the classical

259
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:55.280
side switch.
They'll have seen all over Syria as well.

260
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.420
And the damage there is from a random shell.
As I mentioned,

261
00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:01.520
the center of Damascus is basically safe,

262
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:05.270
but every now and again a random shell is fired in from the suburbs that just

263
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:09.740
happens to land somewhere and this one landed on that facade but it's been

264
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:11.070
repaired already.
Um,

265
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.800
the quality of Syrian craftsman is phenomenal and it's been repaired to a very,

266
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:16.810
very high standard.
I,

267
00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:20.360
I checked when I was last there and it has been all repaired.

268
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.380
So unfortunately the suburbs of Damascus,
completely different story.
Um,

269
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:30.050
they've just been pulverized by the acid government for having the temerity to

270
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:32.660
stand up against him and to ask for,

271
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.830
for freedoms and for reforms to his highly corrupt system,

272
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.220
which is completely gripped by a security state.

273
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:43.730
Basically for the last 45,
50 years,

274
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:47.900
Syria has been under the grip of the asset family and um,

275
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.210
there's been no such thing as free speech largely.

276
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.790
I mean if you dared to criticize the system in any way,

277
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.840
you'd be plucked off the streets and you disappear into prison.

278
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.560
And so people learn to be quiet basically they learned to,
to be silent.

279
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.000
And so I refer quite a lot in the book to the silent majority because at the

280
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:10.080
moment most Syrians fall into that category.
They are the silent majority.

281
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:12.930
They're not with acid and they're not with Isis.

282
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.840
Obviously they are stuck between these two extremes.

283
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.390
And that's what's so tragic about their situation.

284
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.310
So at this time when all the suburbs were being pulverized,
um,

285
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.250
this is when a lot of my friends started to lose their homes.

286
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.060
And so this is the point at which I offered them my house to come and stay as,

287
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.930
as a safe haven.
Um,

288
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:40.200
now of course this is the sort of image that the media is always showing us and

289
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.980
the media is,
is a topic I want to touch on.
Um,

290
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.360
cause it is important to understand because it was all our perceptions about

291
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.420
what's going on in Syria come from the media,
whether we like it or not.

292
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:55.590
And so it's all a question of what media we look at and what we allow to

293
00:18:55.591 --> 00:18:59.250
influence us.
And of course isis have a head of media.

294
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.460
He's a 33 year old Syrian American.

295
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.140
He's a genius and they pay him a fortune to produce very,

296
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:11.970
very clever images like this which project this massive sense of power,

297
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.650
of the power of Isis.

298
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.980
And of course here they are using the stage building of the Roman theater in Pal

299
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:24.210
Mirror to project this image onto the world stage of their power.

300
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.240
And so they've lined up a group of Syrian soldiers there and behind them are

301
00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:34.281
teenagers who were about to behead the soldiers and they've been sending out

302
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:40.131
90,000 tweets a day with something like 30,000 Twitter accounts.

303
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:44.550
Very,
very active.
And they've come,
they completely were way,

304
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:49.470
way ahead of any other,
any other,
um,
force involved in this war.

305
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:53.190
So they were able to project the amount of power that they had quite

306
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:55.740
disproportionately.
And of course,

307
00:19:55.741 --> 00:20:00.180
what they were seeking to destroy in mirror is precisely what I've been

308
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:03.600
explaining about this blended multicultural society.

309
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.320
Because Power Mirror a caravan city in the middle of the desert,

310
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:12.321
they're all all the trading routes because it's been roam on its eastern fringe

311
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:13.201
there.

312
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:17.490
It's where Rome blended with the Babylonian and Mesopotamian cultures and with

313
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:21.990
the Persian cultures in the ancient Egyptian cultures.
And that resulted in a,

314
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:26.520
in a special fusion of the cultures,
uh,

315
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.300
to create the power mirror and civilization,
which is unique.

316
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.410
It had its own language.
They had their own style of dress,

317
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.720
their own house styles,
their own jewelry,
um,

318
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.050
all of which shows in their statues.

319
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.150
And that's precisely of course what Isis wanted to destroy.

320
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.170
So of course that building that we just saw has,

321
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.150
was blown up like that in an image,

322
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:51.640
which they then tweeted all around the world to again,

323
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:55.120
show how powerful they were.
But of course,

324
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:59.290
it's not only isis who's been using the Syrian war as a propaganda tool,

325
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.690
Russia and Putin have,
it's been an absolute gift to him.

326
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.810
And if you watch Russian TV,
which I do quite a lot these days,

327
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.470
our tea on freeview,
you know,
Channel One,
three,
five,
anybody can get it.

328
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.620
It's such an eye opener to see how they miss it and how misinformation is,

329
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.050
is done.
It's very,
very clever.
So of course,

330
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:24.430
when Russia took retook power mirror from Isis,

331
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.080
they immediately saw what a propaganda coup this was because the world has

332
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:32.650
always been fascinated by,
by the mystique of Palmyra.

333
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.330
And so Russia bust in a,
um,

334
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.230
a special orchestra for this victory concert in the very same building,

335
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.500
the Roman theater that Isis was doing it stage beheading Russia is now doing it,

336
00:21:46.811 --> 00:21:48.520
staged victory concert.

337
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.810
It forced people to come into the audience along with some of it,
same soldiers.

338
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.730
And then Putin has himself putting on a video link to project himself to the

339
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:01.570
world as the savior of Syria,
the defender of terrorism.

340
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.090
And it's very clever stuff and it works.

341
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.320
But of course what we didn't hear about at all is what was going on in power

342
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:11.020
mirror before Russia and before isis,

343
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.320
because these pictures are from 2013 well before any of that happened,

344
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.400
when in fact this damage was caused by the Syrian government itself because it,

345
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:29.100
it was firing on a small group of rebels who had set up a small headquarters

346
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.570
inside the temple of Bell,
which has big high walls,
so it's quite fortified.

347
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.420
So it made a sort of natural defensive spot.

348
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.110
But the Syrian government thought nothing of going up onto the hill that

349
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:45.730
overlooks the site and shelling its own cultural heritage and causing this

350
00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.950
destruction.
And you can see here,

351
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.300
these are Syrian tanks moving around within the ruins heavy trucks.

352
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.470
They put a a multiple rocket launcher in the temple of Diocletian.

353
00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.940
They didn't think twice about it,

354
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.120
but these pictures were taken very secretly on the ground by a Syrian activists

355
00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:06.730
who recorded it because of course asset has been very,

356
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:11.320
very careful to make sure that journalists don't get in to Syria these days.

357
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:16.350
You have Russian journalists and Iranian journalists who cover the angles that

358
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:20.650
they want covered.
And it was very,
very clear or during the Aleppo campaign,

359
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.450
but that's precisely what was going on.

360
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.470
The Asad regime doesn't invite journalists in unless it's got something.

361
00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:27.430
It wants to show them,

362
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.730
which it did just before the fall of Aleppo because it wanted to show them

363
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.710
exactly at that moment how the city was falling and how,

364
00:23:36.711 --> 00:23:40.000
how they were providing all these humanitarian aid.
And then of course,

365
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:43.180
it makes them all go out again before the ugly end game,

366
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:47.270
when it then bombs the place completely into smithereens.
So it's very,

367
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:48.950
very tightly controlled.
I mean,

368
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.520
Syria has for the last five years in a row top to the bill of the most dangerous

369
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:59.300
place for journalists because there is no free journalism,
um,
from,

370
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.040
from international outlets.

371
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.400
It's so Syrian activists have trained themselves up.

372
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.610
They have people who are not at all,
um,
you know,

373
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.160
in that field have become,
um,

374
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.920
photo journalists and activists on the ground.

375
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.050
So this is another one of Syria as a UNESCO world heritage sites.

376
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:19.490
This is the crack dish,
a value.

377
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.010
It's the world's best preserved Crusader castle and it's got caught up in the

378
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:30.011
conflict for the same reason that pal Mira got caught up its strategic location

379
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:33.560
because the reason that it's there in the first place,

380
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.030
just like the reason pal mirrors there in the first place is because of the,
the,

381
00:24:37.031 --> 00:24:40.730
the trade roads trade routes converging here.
Um,

382
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.640
the castle is guarding what's called the humps gap,

383
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.430
which is a natural break in the mountain chain,

384
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.350
the only break from the interior desert to the coast.

385
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.770
And so strategically it's a very important place.

386
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.630
And so at the start of the revolution,

387
00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.580
a group of rebels with the full consent of the local villages took up a position

388
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:02.414
inside.

389
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:07.370
And of course the Syrian air force immediately came and bombarded it from above.

390
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.070
And it's one of those many ironies in the Syrian war that so much of its

391
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:15.470
cultural heritage has come through unscathed.
I mean,

392
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:19.430
this castle was never taken throughout.
It was built in the 12th century.

393
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:20.630
It was never taken,

394
00:25:20.631 --> 00:25:24.410
was never damaged until now when it got bombed by its own government,

395
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.700
other sites get caught up for their strategic location.

396
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:31.750
So this is a monastery right up on the top,
uh,

397
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.200
in the color moon mountains at 2000 feet,
2000 meters high,

398
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.190
um,
right on the border between Lebanon and Syria.

399
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.340
And so this monastery,

400
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.490
the Syrian government came in and kicked out the monks and took over and again,

401
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:52.670
you can see how the monastery,
there was originally a Greek temple.
All the style,

402
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:54.350
you know,
you can,
the size of the blocks,

403
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:57.050
all of this is Hellenistic masonry with the columns there.

404
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.610
So it's another example of a,

405
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.810
of an ancient site which has evolved with each new civilization.

406
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.260
So the monks have been kicked out and it's been turned into an army barracks

407
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.760
because strategically they want to come on the high,
the high points up there.

408
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.810
But you then get cases like this.

409
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.830
This is another church in Lula and some of you may have heard of Martin Lula,

410
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.870
it's always paraded in the press as the place where the language of Christ,

411
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:24.860
Aramaic is still spoken.

412
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.360
But now Lula is of no strategic interest to anybody.

413
00:26:29.361 --> 00:26:32.300
It's tucked into a little cleft down in the mountains.

414
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.880
It's doesn't command anything at all.

415
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:40.330
And this is a classic case of media manipulation because the timing of this was

416
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.180
just before,
if you remember,
there was that big chemical attack,

417
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.540
chemical weapons attack in the east of Damascus.

418
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.710
And that almost led Obama to intervene in the Syrian case.

419
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.800
And it really did look at one stage as if Obama was going to enter,
you know,

420
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.490
his red line had been crossed and he was going to actually intervene and bomb

421
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:04.860
isis,
uh,
acid.
And I said,

422
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:08.220
we're so worried at that point that this might really happen and that this would

423
00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:11.850
be the end of him,
that he engineered a crisis here in Mark Lula,

424
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.660
knowing that the world would pay attention to what happens in Mount Lula.

425
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.440
And so he engineered an attack like this,
um,

426
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.900
and then showed it to the media and showed his own army coming in to,

427
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.650
to save the inhabitants.
And,
uh,
the,

428
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:32.130
the nuns and the monks in the village,
this is a,
this is a monastery,

429
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.900
a famous monastery that's been burned out.
And he said,
uh,
look,

430
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.160
if,
if you,
if you,
if you get rid of me,
look what's going to happen.

431
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.380
Terrorism were run over the whole country.

432
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.420
I am the only defender of the minorities here.
And of course it worked.

433
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.580
It worked.
Obama backed off,
you know,

434
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:54.750
the parliament here didn't vote to go along with it.
And afterwards,

435
00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:58.860
the nuns in the village actually said,
we the army,

436
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:02.550
the Syrian army soldiers to the media.
It was a clear case.
And again,

437
00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:07.170
this is another example of where western journalists were invited in to be
shown,

438
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.360
look,
look,
look at this destroyed church.

439
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:13.710
Look what will happen if you get rid of me.
And it's very effective.
It works.

440
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.880
And this is in whomps.
This is another church in whomps,
again,

441
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:21.210
bombarded by aerial bombardment.
You may remember,
it's so long ago now,

442
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:25.800
this seems to have been going on so long that in 2012 when all this was going
on,

443
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.490
this is where Marie Colvin,
in the Sunday Times,
journalists,
you know,

444
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:31.800
where she was killed when the center,

445
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.570
the Old City of humps was being aerial bombarded and completely completely

446
00:28:36.571 --> 00:28:37.380
destroyed.

447
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.220
And that was the first of the many starve or surrender sieges basically where,

448
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.430
um,
the whole area was completely destroyed.

449
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.700
So to get down to the sort of personal level now with the house,
um,

450
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.310
I was just show you a few images of the house.
Um,
this as,

451
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:59.370
as the map showed is in the center of the Old City of Damascus.

452
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:03.660
So this is within the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It's a courtyard house.

453
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.260
Damascus has the world's largest collection of old residential architecture.

454
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:14.820
So this house dates back.
It's blended like everything in Syria.

455
00:29:14.821 --> 00:29:18.480
It's blended between the 17th,
18th and 19th centuries.

456
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:23.750
Different sides of the courtyard or from different centuries because it's been

457
00:29:24.391 --> 00:29:28.950
continuously inhabited so that it's already come through was invasions,

458
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.620
earthquakes,
fires,
all of that.

459
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.290
And so the city has been constantly being rebuilt.

460
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.440
And so you can see it looks in a pretty sorry state here.

461
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.600
It was actually inhabited when I bought it.
Um,

462
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:45.670
and it was sort of just about possible to,
uh,
to live there.

463
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.700
So this is now August of 2005 when the temperature is 40 degrees.

464
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.050
And uh,
so this is,
I was sort of semi camping in the house.

465
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.500
I'm waiting for the bureaucracy to kick in.

466
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.490
So this was my first real exposure to Syria and bureaucracy and how everything

467
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:06.940
works.
And that Syrian bureaucracy is like a labyrinth.

468
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:12.070
It combines the worst of the Ottoman and the worst of the French.
And so my,

469
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.220
um,
my task now was to find myself.

470
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.990
I'm a bank manager who turned out to be a Christian lady.

471
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.520
I had to find myself a lawyer who turned out to be a sunny curd.

472
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.910
I had to find myself an architect who was a,
um,

473
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:33.150
a Sunni Arab and the architect and I gathered together a team of about 15 Syrian

474
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.280
craftsman to embark on the restoration project,
which,

475
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.420
which took three years.

476
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.410
So this is what we had to do at the start.

477
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.400
We had to rip off all of those walls around the courtyard.

478
00:30:48.401 --> 00:30:51.100
We're covered with a white uniform,

479
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.400
cement masking,
everything underneath.

480
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.300
And that in the book becomes a kind of metaphor for the Asad regime,

481
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:03.301
which has been suffocating the true nature of Syria and its true identity for

482
00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:08.560
the last 50 years.
And so the first thing we had to do was pull that off.

483
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:13.390
And what we found underneath was this,
um,
these mud bricks,

484
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.230
um,
which I call the margin of Mesopotamia because these,

485
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:22.470
this mud and this style of house goes right back to the earliest Mesopotamian

486
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:23.260
Times.

487
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.260
It's evolved to be perfectly adapted to the climate and these mud bricks keep

488
00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:31.030
the heat in,
in the winter and the heat out in the summer.

489
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.800
And so this is like a perfect eco house.
In fact,

490
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:39.370
this arch here is the open,
you weren't as,
it's called,

491
00:31:39.371 --> 00:31:43.900
that faces onto the courtyard always north facing so that when you sit there in

492
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:46.390
the summer,
the sun never shines directly into it.

493
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:51.040
And that always catches the breezes.
So it is perfectly evolved for the climate.

494
00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:53.110
You don't need air conditioning in these houses.

495
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.980
So this is in the depths of the restoration and where this is absolute chaos.

496
00:31:59.170 --> 00:31:59.861
As you can see,

497
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:03.550
everything doesn't look as if anything is ever going to get any better.

498
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:09.130
But the extraordinary thing about this period was that all of us really enjoyed

499
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:13.030
ourselves.
We,
we,
we all knew what we were striving for.
So again,

500
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.110
this is the state that Syria is locked in at the moment.
It's completely chaotic.

501
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.990
It doesn't look as if it's ever going to get any better.

502
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:24.700
And yet the people inside Syria who have stayed behind are remarkably cohesive.

503
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.320
I've seen it firsthand.

504
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.250
And so here is the electrician who's coming across with the cattle to um,

505
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.980
to have one of our many tea breaks.

506
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:37.060
And you can see all the glasses that tea glosses lined up along the side of the

507
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:37.894
fountain.

508
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.280
And this is some of the detailing of the interior and the rooms.

509
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:47.540
So you can see this dates to 1700.
This is what I call the Azure me room.

510
00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:50.120
This is hand painted wooden lack of work.

511
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.710
And you can see again how they've taken in elements from earlier civilizations

512
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:59.150
that gold a cannabis leaf up in the corner there is straight off the sort of

513
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:03.740
Hellenistic blocks of,
of power mirror.
Um,
and the iconography again,

514
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:06.350
his gardens,
gardens,
flowers,

515
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.870
little little birds hidden in the trees.

516
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:14.150
And on those green panels that is not inscriptions from the Koran.

517
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.950
That is a Sufi poem,

518
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.210
a Sufi Islam being the mystic mystic Islam,

519
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.000
which Syrian Islam is very close to that.

520
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.450
It's a very kind of moderate tolerant version of Islam.

521
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.400
And this is a Sufi poem invoking blessings on the house and on the owner.

522
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.540
And this is another detail of the interior.

523
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.850
This is what I referred to as the secret ceiling,

524
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.560
which comes to represent a sort of tapestry of Syrian society.

525
00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:47.400
The way all the different elements are blended together.
And again,

526
00:33:47.401 --> 00:33:52.250
you can see hawk backs to the earliest civilizations.
So things like that.

527
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.210
That is the rows of power mirror taken straight off the carved blocks of pal

528
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.044
mirror.

529
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:01.160
And you can see how strangely familiar that looks in some ways because that top

530
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:02.590
and bottom,
um,

531
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:06.470
borders there could be taken straight from a William Morris Catalog.

532
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.000
It could be curtains,
you know,
curtain material or,
or,
or a wallpaper.

533
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.470
And that's no accident.

534
00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.530
That's because the British architects went out to power mirror and did

535
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.980
[inaudible] detailed drawings back in the 18th century of the patterns that they

536
00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:25.940
found in power mirror,
brought them back to this country,
published them.

537
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:31.020
And that stimulated the neoclassical revival in this country.
Um,

538
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:36.020
which is why we see this kind of thing all over our country houses all across

539
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:36.854
Britain.

540
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.670
And here again is this would have been covered with the white uniform cement

541
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.780
that I'm talking about.
Um,
but in removing that,

542
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:52.700
of course you cause some damage and if you can see that hole up there,
um,

543
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:56.510
just to the left,
there's a big hole in,
in the stonework that,

544
00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.830
and I took a very conscious decision with the restoration of the house,

545
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.300
not to over restore,
not to aim for some sort of unnatural perfection.

546
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.890
Um,
but to leave that kind of thing because it,
it,
it,
if you like it,

547
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:14.060
it's a kind of scar.
Just like Syria will have to take in many,

548
00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:19.010
many scars and absorb them and look them in the eye actually and say,

549
00:35:19.011 --> 00:35:21.560
right,
these,
this is damage which has been done,

550
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.940
but we have to now absorb that and make it part of our future identity.

551
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.550
And in,
in the blending again that I've mentioned right at the very top,

552
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.380
they're quite difficult to see,

553
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:38.381
but there is actually what we would think of as a Jewish star of David and two

554
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:43.500
interlocking triangles right at the top there.
But in,
in Damascus,

555
00:35:43.501 --> 00:35:47.070
that has nothing to do with a specifically Jewish symbol that is actually

556
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.740
locally known as the shield of Solomon.
And again,

557
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:52.500
it's just a symbol to protect the house.

558
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.780
So at the end of the three years,
this is what we ended up with,
um,

559
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.680
everything perfectly restored wherever there were things missing.

560
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:06.330
Like for example,
the,
um,
the little bronze heads,
they're in the fountain,

561
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:11.510
we would go to salvage yards around the outskirts of the city and source them

562
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:12.540
from there.

563
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.540
So the only new things that came into this house where the infrastructure just

564
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:22.530
as in Syria,
that's what has to happen.
The,
the faulty wiring,

565
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.530
if you like,
and the faulty drains and plumbing,

566
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:30.120
all of that has to be ripped out just like in,
in the Asad regime,

567
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.550
the corrupt,
um,

568
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.830
and malfunctioning bureaucracy of the security state of the torture systems.

569
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:38.760
Uh,
all of that.

570
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.030
And the people who've got their fingers in all the pies at the top,

571
00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.380
all of that has to be ripped out.
And then Syria can be what it should be.

572
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.090
This multilayered,
very,
very beautiful and complex society.

573
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.920
But moving on now to isis again,
um,

574
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.880
one of the things that's been happening all over Syria is looting of the

575
00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:04.710
cultural heritage.
And Isis has again seen in,
in the cultural heritage,

576
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:09.930
uh,
an opportunity to make money.
And of course it's making money from,

577
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.930
uh,
because the oil that it's been controlling,

578
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.620
it has tacit under the table deals with the Asad regime.

579
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:22.070
So asset continues to buy oil from his own oil wells through isis and they just

580
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:26.670
take a rake off just like with the,
um,
cultural heritage here.

581
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.950
They take a rake off of 20%,

582
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.070
and the stuff gets fed onto the international art market.

583
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:37.190
But every now and again when they dig up something so massive like this,
um,

584
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.180
seventh century BC Assyrian statue because that's far too huge to be passed off

585
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.320
on the art market.

586
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.550
So they use it instead for propaganda purposes and they publicly smash it to

587
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:50.790
bits and then tweet it all around the world to again,

588
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:55.800
make themselves seem so powerful and they force the local population to come and

589
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:56.634
watch this.

590
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.600
So if you can see the expression on that little boy's face who's being made to

591
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:04.080
watch his own cultural heritage being destroyed like that,

592
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.000
it's just pure agony because Syrians care very,

593
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:11.160
very deeply about their cultural heritage.

594
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.220
It's like having part of their soul is raised.

595
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.620
And Aleppo,
this is Aleppo before the,
um,
uh,

596
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.030
before the fall of it obviously.
Um,
so this is as it used to be,

597
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.610
um,
serious commercial hub.

598
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.730
One of the most famous souks in the whole of the Arab world.

599
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:32.100
And then afterwards when it caught fire,

600
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.920
and the reason it caught fire was because again,
the government,

601
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.240
the Syrian government,

602
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:42.450
Shell's a rebel headquarters in the old city and it hit an electricity

603
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:48.121
substation that caught fire spread through all the shops and overnight 40,000

604
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:49.930
people were made bankrupt.

605
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.680
But of course what we don't hear about is what surrounds on are doing on the

606
00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:57.910
ground about this.

607
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:03.420
And this is a picture of two archaeology students from Aleppo University and

608
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.440
nobody's paying them to do this.

609
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.290
They are volunteers and they are of their own accord,

610
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.700
building a protective wall in front of the shrine of Zechariah,

611
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:13.780
the tumors that arise,

612
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.780
who's the father of John the Baptist and his two lists inside the Aleppo amount

613
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.910
of mosque.
And this is happening all over Syria.

614
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:26.620
Syrians on the ground are trying to protect in whatever way they can,

615
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.340
their own cultural heritage.
And the same thing here.

616
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:33.300
This is right down in the south and other one of Syria,

617
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.190
UNESCO world heritage sites.
This is Basra,

618
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.590
one of the world's best preserved.

619
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.780
Raymond amphitheaters and you should never be misled by what people look like in

620
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:46.720
the Syrian war because you could look at that group of people that and think

621
00:39:46.721 --> 00:39:49.780
they were a bunch of jihadi extremists.
But in fact,

622
00:39:49.781 --> 00:39:54.070
the guy in the middle with the red beard is the local history teacher who set up

623
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:59.130
a revolutionary antiquities department and the people around him are in charge

624
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:04.141
of the local militias where they have gathered together the local population to

625
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:07.300
protect the city.
Because when they saw what happened in power mirror,

626
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.780
they all vowed that this was not going to happen to Basra.

627
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.110
And so to end with now,

628
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:18.310
just this is a picture of some of the families who were in my house,

629
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:23.550
as I mentioned,
when,
when they lost their own homes around the outside,
they,
um,

630
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.940
I invited them to move in.
And so I had five families,

631
00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:30.850
different families living in the house.
Obviously I wasn't there anymore.

632
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:35.120
I'd come back to this country.
And,
um,
of course it's very difficult.
Um,

633
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.050
five families who don't know each other,
um,

634
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.820
or having to share the same house somewhere,
virtually illiterate.

635
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:46.990
Um,
some were university educated,
so it's not a natural blend.

636
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.720
They've only got one kitchen,
two bathrooms.

637
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.600
And then there are lots of arguments about who was paying the electricity,

638
00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:54.280
who's paying the water because believe it or not,

639
00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.470
people are still expected to pay the bills even in the middle of the war.
Um,

640
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.960
so there was a lot of arguing and,
and,
and um,

641
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.460
aggravation in the first couple of months.

642
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.910
But then all that settled down when they gradually got used to each other.

643
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.810
And the wonderful thing was that they ended up the best of friends.

644
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:14.950
And so these four children are actually from four different families who haven't

645
00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:18.880
stayed very,
very close to each other.
And this is one of the things about war.

646
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.730
One has to realize that low oil we see on the,

647
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.820
on the screens the whole time is the awfulness of war.

648
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:29.850
The damage war pushes you out of your comfort zone in a way that can be actually

649
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:35.180
very productive.
And a lot of my friends in Syria,
um,

650
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.250
about half of whom are still inside the country,

651
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:41.270
the other half are scattered around Turkey,
Jordan,
Lebanon.

652
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.040
And some of them have made it to Germany.
They all,
um,

653
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:50.030
they all feel,
you know,
this has been,
uh,
an incredible experience for them.

654
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:52.880
They've all done things that they would never have dreamt of doing.

655
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.920
So they've gotten themselves new qualifications.
Um,

656
00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.610
they've entered fields they would never have done before.

657
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:02.380
A lot of the women for example,
I mean there are far fewer women,
um,

658
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.570
far too many women almost in,
in,
um,

659
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:10.520
in Damascus these days because so many of the men have left or been killed.

660
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.750
Um,

661
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:16.370
and so the women are finding themselves rather like with the world wars in this

662
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:17.270
country,
you know,

663
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:20.780
being forced to go out and do things that they would never have done ordinarily.

664
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.900
So there have been many,
many positives to the whole thing.

665
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.880
So I just want to end by saying that,
um,
uh,

666
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.640
the book actually supports a,

667
00:42:29.641 --> 00:42:34.460
a special charity for a special fund for Syria and higher education so that

668
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.660
Syrians who've had their,
um,
their university studies interrupted,

669
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.970
can continue them outside of Syria.

670
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.210
Because at the vital thing is that at the end of all of this,

671
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:49.260
that there must be an elite of highly trained Syrians to who can bring the

672
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:53.900
country back because Syria is such a gifted society.
I mean so many,

673
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.500
so many of our inventions come from that part of the world going right back to

674
00:42:57.501 --> 00:43:01.780
the alphabet.
The first musical notation was invented there.

675
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.590
So many scientific inventions.
Um,
um,

676
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.450
you know,
uh,
the list is almost endless.
You know,
the,
the,

677
00:43:10.451 --> 00:43:13.430
the division of minutes into 60,
you know,

678
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:16.100
60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds,

679
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:19.810
massive numbers of things actually come from this part of the world.

680
00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:24.680
It's a highly creative society.
And,
um,
you know,
Steve Jobs was,

681
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.250
um,
you know,
an obvious example of whose birth father was Syrian.

682
00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:33.650
There they have a kind of natural adaptability.
It's part of the culture,

683
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:36.680
part of the identity that because they've always had this blending.

684
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.440
It's a real argument for multiculturalism in my view.

685
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:41.720
It shows that because of all that blending,

686
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.780
you can become a much richer society.

687
00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:49.040
And that is how Syrian society always has been.
And remarkably still is.

688
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.800
Although you don't hear about it,
it's still very,

689
00:43:51.801 --> 00:43:55.990
very cohesive and so it deserves all our support.
So,

690
00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.680
so try to remember,
you know,

691
00:43:57.681 --> 00:44:02.681
when you hear the news that in the middle there is this silent majority of the

692
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:07.790
vast majority of the Syrian population who are currently stuck between asset and

693
00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:10.850
Isis,
who of course never afford each other.

694
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.630
That's the other massive irony in this.
They've never fought each other.

695
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.920
They've just been intent on wiping out the moderate Syrian opposition in the

696
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:22.850
middle.
And that's,
that's why we're in this tragic situation at the moment.

697
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.220
But as I said,
it's not,

698
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:29.240
it's not entirely without hope because I do think that there will be a massive

699
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:32.010
rebirth at the end of all of this.
Thanks for now.

700
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.933
<v 1>Thanks very much.</v>

701
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.470
<v 2>Oh,
that's fine.
So thank you very much,
Diana.</v>

702
00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.570
This is an incredible talk on a very,
very timely subject.

703
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.750
And we have a few minutes for questions.
If anyone would like to ask her.

704
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:49.483
<v 1>Cool.</v>

705
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.860
<v 2>Thank you for the tour.
Catchy had to maybe link questions.</v>

706
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.220
The first is after the death of someone like Asif shall carts the sanctions

707
00:44:58.221 --> 00:44:59.120
against Rami Makhlouf.

708
00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:03.800
What does the sort of in a circle around an aside look like now?

709
00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:08.300
Like how strong is he perhaps as the need to that after the gassing?

710
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:12.920
Um,
if the Americans and coalition forces had intervened at that point,

711
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.130
do you think we could have tackled I sat in with something better be in its

712
00:45:16.131 --> 00:45:16.964
place?

713
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:20.100
<v 0>Well,
just to start with that,
with the last one,
um,</v>

714
00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:24.700
I have been consistently of the view that we should have intervened actually

715
00:45:24.701 --> 00:45:28.200
even before that,
the chemical attack.
Um,

716
00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:30.580
I think we should have gone in right at the,

717
00:45:30.581 --> 00:45:35.581
in the summer of 2011 when the Syrians were begging us to come in and when we'd

718
00:45:35.981 --> 00:45:36.940
gone into Libya.

719
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.650
And so that's what gave them the courage to actually stand up and,
and to,

720
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.710
to go out on the lair peaceful demonstrations because it's,
again,

721
00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:47.920
it's worth remembering that for the first four to six months it was peaceful.

722
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:52.210
You know,
the demonstrations were peaceful,
but they just got shot.
You know,

723
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.070
they're just got gunned down.

724
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:57.340
Peaceful demonstrators got gone down and that's what turned the whole thing into

725
00:45:57.341 --> 00:45:59.350
an armed,
an armed uprising.

726
00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.170
But then when the free Syrian army rose up spontaneously,

727
00:46:02.171 --> 00:46:07.171
that first summer in 2011 mainly made up of defectors from our sides army.

728
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.610
They were begging us to come in,
come in,

729
00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:14.410
please help us make a safe zone along the Turkish border where we can go and

730
00:46:14.411 --> 00:46:16.750
where we can be protected.
If we had done that,
then

731
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.960
always just would never have existed because Isis didn't come along until 2013

732
00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.680
you know,
does that cue and was there for two years.
But we did nothing.

733
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:31.210
And so isis would not have been able to get it to toe hold there in Syria.

734
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.200
It meant that the whole refugee crisis would not have existed.

735
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.230
They would have been no need for all those people to come to Europe to

736
00:46:38.231 --> 00:46:41.680
destabilize Europe,
you know,
and all the terrorism and everything that's,

737
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.120
you know,
that we now associate with Sarah and none of that needed to happen.

738
00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.020
And I was for his inner circle.
This is a very,
very interesting question.
I mean,

739
00:46:50.021 --> 00:46:53.140
so many people have said,
you know,
surely,

740
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:57.550
surely somebody's going to assassinate him,
you know,
or,
um,
you know,

741
00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:01.030
it was after that bomb in which Asif shall cup was killed.

742
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:04.900
That was the moment at which a lot of my Syrian friends thought,
right,
that's it.

743
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.190
I've got to leave because we know now it's going to get really ugly because his,

744
00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.920
his retaliation for that is going to be massive.

745
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:16.120
And so that is actually where most of my friends left and went to Turkey or

746
00:47:16.121 --> 00:47:19.360
wherever where they have now carved out entirely new lives for themselves.

747
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:24.700
But the interesting thing is now as the was the war has wound on,
you know,

748
00:47:24.701 --> 00:47:28.090
and an acid has,
the only reason I said is still there of course,

749
00:47:28.091 --> 00:47:32.140
is because Iran has been supporting him to a massive degree.

750
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.940
They'd been lending him money.
They've been training up.
Um,
his,
uh,
this,

751
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:40.900
this massive power military force of the National Defense Forces a hundred

752
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.170
thousand people,
you know,
they're doing the fighting and Hezbollah.

753
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.940
The Syrian army itself has been so weakened.
It's really,
really weak.

754
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:52.060
It would have fallen.
And,
but even with all that help from Iran,

755
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.450
it would still a foreign and Russia could see that,

756
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.390
which is why it could then came into the war as well,
you know,

757
00:47:58.391 --> 00:48:02.800
just over a year ago.
Um,
to make sure that as I didn't fall,

758
00:48:02.801 --> 00:48:05.680
I mean the man would have been gone by now if it hadn't been.

759
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.270
And this is without our help,
you know,
we did nothing.
They got very little help.

760
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:11.950
The moderate rebels,
we did nothing.

761
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.840
And as I'd had all that help from Iran,
all that help from Russia,

762
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.570
you know,
it's a miracle frankly,

763
00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:23.620
that there's still anything left of the Syrian opposition,
but it is still,

764
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:28.390
and it's not going to go away.
So all this sort of stuff about,
um,
you know,

765
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.650
maybe acid is the lesser of two evils is just so short sighted.
You know,

766
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.470
there's no way people forget,
you know,
the,

767
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.290
the deaths in Syria close to half a million,

768
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.370
it's very difficult to document them.
And the UN stopped counting so long ago,

769
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:47.650
but you know,
the deaths,
95% of the deaths have been caused by the Asad regime.

770
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.360
You know,
people imagine it's all isis.

771
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.060
Isis has been responsible for a tiny number of deaths.

772
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.880
It's all got disproportionately,
you know,

773
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.420
w we see it through this lens of terrorism now,

774
00:48:58.421 --> 00:49:02.200
that word also frightened of the terrorism that we think that isis is the

775
00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:06.370
problem.
Isis isn't the problem.
Isis is the result of the problem.
You know?

776
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:11.290
But we didn't deal with right at the start.
Yeah.
But so tragically his,

777
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.790
his,
his group is being held in position,
you know,

778
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.890
by Iran and Russia and they're not going to go away.
So what,

779
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:23.170
what's next for Syrian people who have gone to Europe?
What,

780
00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.910
what would be required just to entice these people to return to Syria?

781
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.240
He built the country.
Every single Syrian,

782
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:34.330
I know we'd go back to Syria like a shot if it was safe for them to do so.

783
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.610
Every single one.
I mean,
it's remarkable how,

784
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.590
how they have such a deep connection to their homeland.
Huge.

785
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.091
You know,
I mean,

786
00:49:43.091 --> 00:49:45.970
I've got friends who've now been in Germany for two to three years.

787
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.010
They'd been taught German,
you know,
that they,

788
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:52.570
they've tried to integrate it very difficult to get work.
They would go back,

789
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.410
they want to go back there so closely in touch with everything that's going on.

790
00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.570
And um,
so that,
that this is what gives me hope to be honest.
But,
um,

791
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.580
it will rebuild.
It will rebuild.
And let's hope that Trump managers to build,

792
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:11.110
you know,
some big,
beautiful,
safe soons against the Saudis to pay for them,

793
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.820
because that would be terrific if he could achieve them.

794
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.650
Pigs might fly wheel in it,
and I'm not.

795
00:50:17.651 --> 00:50:21.280
No time please join me in thanking Dana Anadarko for her.
Fabulous talk.
