1
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.250
Good morning.
Welcome to authors at Google,

2
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.460
Cambridge and welcome to pride week.

3
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.880
It's my enormous pleasure to kickoff pride week here in Cambridge by introducing

4
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.810
um,
for exceptionally talented writers.

5
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.440
They happen to be trans women.
Uh,

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.600
they are part of the growing group of top side press writers who are giving

7
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.631
voice to people whose voices have one soon been denied and the publishing world

8
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.740
and who are changing lives.

9
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.250
Even as we stand here today,

10
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:57.900
we have four writers who are part of the top side press,

11
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.500
northeastern tour,
uh,
two writers.

12
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:06.501
We'll be back in Cambridge a week from tomorrow,

13
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.960
the 17th at the location whose name I forget,

14
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:14.961
but who read Dirk and I can probably remind us of this morning.

15
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:18.390
We will come image in Benny Red Durkin,

16
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.600
Casey Platt and Jean Thorton imaging.

17
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.650
Beeni writes a monthly column in maximum rock and roll magazine as well as the z

18
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:33.330
means.
The fact that it's funny doesn't make it a joke and stereotype threat.

19
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.510
She was contributor to the top side press,

20
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.260
the collection short fiction from the transgender Van Guard,

21
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:41.640
which I highly recommend.

22
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.600
She was recently named a recipient of the 2014 Betty Berzon emerging writer

23
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.630
award.
Also her novel in Nevada,

24
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:56.631
which is available in the back of the room after the talk has been the reason

25
00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:58.830
subject of,
not one,
not two,

26
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.020
but three video games produced at one of our more priesthood move,

27
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.450
most prestigious engineering universities,

28
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:11.451
Georgia Tech University alongside another classic of the genre.

29
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.390
James Baldwins Giovanni's room.
Um,

30
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.510
so there you have it.
If you ever,

31
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.610
never thought you would see a video game based on Giovanni's room.
Uh,

32
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:25.740
I never did.
We're both wrong.

33
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.670
Red Dworkin,
um,
is for obscure reasons,

34
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:37.620
sadly by default,
the prettiest and funniest standup comedian in New York City.

35
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:39.790
Now she,
um,

36
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.880
she's also a very talented writer and a dog.
Had activist.

37
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.570
She is the managing editor of pretty queer.com.

38
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.410
Just written nine scenes and it was featured in the final issue of Punk Planet

39
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.710
magazine and contributed to the collection

40
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.330
Casey Platte,
who's just published a collection of stories,

41
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.360
a safe girls love dedication of which was particularly near to my heart

42
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.621
previously.

43
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:19.480
She wrote a column on transitioning from McSweeney's Internet tendency and

44
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.980
contributed to the collection.

45
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.990
And Jean Thornton is the author of the Black Emerald,

46
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:30.520
which is forthcoming later this year.
And the dream of Doctor Bantam,

47
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.640
which was a lambda award finalist for 2012 as well as the web comics bad mother

48
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:38.530
and the man who hates fun.

49
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.700
Please join me in welcoming miss for very talented writers.

50
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.190
<v 2>Hi everybody.
I'm a gene Thornton,
so,
oh,</v>

51
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:05.040
that's creepy.
I don't want to look at that.
Okay,

52
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.240
so I'm going to read you from the beginning of my book,
the dream of Dr Blanton,

53
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.830
um,
which is in the back.
And let's just go,

54
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.720
let's just get this started.
Okay.

55
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.380
It's beginning of the book you need no context is trying to be night hop.

56
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.633
It's cool.

57
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.360
Tabitha thatch argued her little sister Julie always thought about cats.

58
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.710
It was rare that Tabitha argued much more common that she agreed to rules or

59
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.160
demands her mother or the world and posted on her and then did the opposite of

60
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:40.810
what she had agreed to.
But when she did argue for job relaxed,
open inner voice,

61
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.490
high pitched and ragged folded in on itself in a hundred tissue paper,

62
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:46.690
layers of connotation,

63
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.180
implication meaning all of her yelling protest in a way that you couldn't
ignore.

64
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.890
You can listen to Tabitha yelling or arguing like a cat for hours.
Julie,

65
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.940
her own voice like a dog she thought short and course and Barky had listened to

66
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:02.050
Tabitha for hours.

67
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.460
You could listen and you would be struck by how raw and vibrant that voice was

68
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.940
but then you would realize that Tabitha was just saying she was going to go to

69
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:13.210
the mall and buy Adderall to swallow with beer and then hanger on the food court

70
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:17.000
talking about the misfits with some college kid in a raw and vibrant and cat

71
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:21.820
like waste.
She would tell you that and you would believe in her.
Linda,

72
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.060
Tabitha and Julie's mother had never been vulnerable to Tabitha is voice and

73
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:26.920
Juliet always hated Linda A.
Little bit for that.

74
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.550
They were fighting now tabs and Linda,

75
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.820
their voices came through the walls of Julie's bedroom like foreign talk radio

76
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:34.720
on the am dial.

77
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.250
Julie set up the edge of her bed recently stripped of its Alpha but pattern case

78
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:42.820
and replaced with a more grownup deep green color that reminded her of rain

79
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:43.654
forests.

80
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.620
She felt her long hair sticking up in crazy roller coaster loops at the back of

81
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:51.670
her head.
The air of the room was somehow just wrong,

82
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.100
like Lucy and voyage of the dawn treader.

83
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.080
She had slipped into another dimension when in which she was not able to get any

84
00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:58.490
sleep before her Algebra test.

85
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.180
The next day when in which the red digital Clark was blinking midnight at in

86
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:06.590
some sick parody of good morning,
she went into the hallway,

87
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.420
cylinder white apple records,

88
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.420
tee shirt and boxers sat on the floor outside Linda's bedroom,

89
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.940
curled her legs up to her body and listened to them.

90
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.350
Everything has to have a reason.
That's your problem.
Tabitha was saying,

91
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.050
what if my reason is that I just want to spend all day lying in a field or

92
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:24.200
something and writing long letters,
sex,
boyfriends.
What if that's my reason?

93
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.220
I don't give a shit what your reason is.
Linda says,
Linda said,

94
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.550
I don't care how boring or irrelevant you think your classes are either.

95
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.910
You think I don't spend eight or nine hours a day doing boring and irrelevant

96
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:39.230
stuff.
I think you're spending right now doing boring and irrelevant stuff.

97
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:42.740
So Tabitha does right now count toward those eight or nine hours.

98
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.620
It's called survival.
Said Linda,
you do what you have to in order to survive.

99
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.600
It's not called fun or quit school.

100
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:54.770
So I could go out with boys and work at a fucking video arcade and smoke pot in

101
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:59.420
the house all day.
At least smoke pot in the garage.
I'm an adult,

102
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.123
said Tabitha.

103
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.030
I can possibly make decisions without subjecting them to some neurotic process

104
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:07.340
of analysis about what my possibly go wrong.

105
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.820
You're 17 and said Linda and the video or cage is a good job.

106
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.390
Said Tabitha mother.
Linda left.

107
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.600
Julie buried her cheeks deeper into a bear.
Bony Nice.

108
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.090
There are no good jobs.
Linda said there are only lucrative jobs that you hate.

109
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.460
Your job isn't either lucrative nor do you hate it.
I'll move out.
Said Tabitha,

110
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.900
that kind of left.
That's cool.
I like this place.
Okay,
I'll move out to Tabitha.

111
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:36.170
All move out and maybe Julie will come with me and you won't have is hanging

112
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:39.410
around all the time making your life miserable.
Your Stone said,
Linda,

113
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.550
I'm not going to argue with you while you're stoned.
You,
your stone said Tabitha,

114
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.800
get out of my room.
Said Linda,

115
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.840
go to bed and you're going back to school in the morning.

116
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.770
You're going to tell them you change your mind about leaving.
Ooh.

117
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.230
Get Out of my room.
Said Tabitha.
The TV came on immediately.

118
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.720
Some infomercial,
there was a snort and then a stomp and then Julie's size.

119
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:01.010
We're blinded by the lamp light.

120
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.640
Tabitha stormed into the hallway and slammed the door behind her.

121
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.270
She turned in her eyes,
fell into the ball of Juliet or feet.

122
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.440
She stopped before her sister.
What the fuck are you doing in the hallway?

123
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:15.200
She asked reuse.
Spying on us.
Yes.

124
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.440
Julie said Tabitha stared down at her.

125
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.790
Julie steered back up with Tabitha.
Got like this.
You could not be reasonable.

126
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:25.040
You only had to match her crazy for crazy

127
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.020
even in the dark hallway.
Julie thought her older sister was very beautiful.

128
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.071
Her hair.

129
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:34.730
Hey blonde like Julie's bleached and highlighted in pink like celery stalks and

130
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:38.000
red water.
Her skirt torn her stockings.

131
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.360
Striped her skirt or shirt full of rhinestones like the constellations that

132
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:44.890
Julie like to memorize from books and try to see through the fluorescent haze of

133
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.020
Boston street lights.
The rhinestones spelled out.

134
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:52.100
No Future Tabitha.
Put her hands on her hips and pursed her mouth.

135
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:54.980
Her lips were painted in red and outlined in black.

136
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.200
The epilepsy of her leather jacket rose and fell as she breathed.

137
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.760
C'Mon Tabitha said.
Let's get out of here.
Where are we going?

138
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:06.600
Julie asked anywhere,
but here is to Tabitha.
I don't know.
We'll get pancakes.

139
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:07.434
Come on.

140
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.760
Julie got up the shoulders of a t shirt nearly even with Tabitha is epaulets.

141
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.390
Somehow at 13 she had become as tall as her sister when she wasn't paying

142
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:19.950
attention.
Let me go get dressed.
She asked,
you'll take forever.

143
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.920
[inaudible] the come on.
Trust me.
Let's just go.
It's the millennium.

144
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.790
Julie's flip flops were stacked under the coat rack by the door.

145
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.090
She put them on and followed.
Tab without into the front yard,
cross the line.

146
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.901
Inner apple records,

147
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:34.800
tee shirt and boxers or like shivered in the spring night and every window and

148
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:36.360
every neighbor's house could have been an eyeball.

149
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.740
She got into the car next to her sister.
She lit a cigarette.

150
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:42.750
The Tulip of fire surrounded by the black pedals.

151
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:46.380
Ever painted nails against the light horizon were read at the edges.

152
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.670
She turned the key.

153
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.890
They didn't talk as they drove down 20 to 22 and merged under the highway during

154
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:56.700
south one of Tabitha smashing pumpkin cds was blaring quietly.

155
00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.610
10th of tossed your filter out the window,

156
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.110
licked her lips and then looked over at Julie Shit.
She said,

157
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.230
I can't take you to get pancakes in your boxers and must be losing my mind.

158
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.430
She giggled again and she veered off the highway throwing Julie shoulders

159
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:15.840
against the seatbelt.
Be careful Julie hist.
They fish tailed under the overpass.

160
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:19.440
The CD played on Tabitha.
Flicked her blinkers off and on in time with it.

161
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.600
While Julie stared at her,
dug her nails into her seat.

162
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.990
They pulled into the parking lot.
If it all night.
Walmart,
Tabitha,

163
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:29.100
open the door and swung her legs out.
What are we doing here?
Julie said what?

164
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:33.390
Dress size or you said Tabitha?
I have no idea.
So Julie can we just go home?
No.

165
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.560
Said Tabitha happily.
Come on.

166
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.360
Guess you have to do in your dress size for Julie guest for not a Tabitha.

167
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.590
She took the keys out of the ignition,
tossed him to Julie and shut the door.

168
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.350
You can listen to the CD if you want.

169
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.670
She said just if you do leave the window rolled down a little,

170
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.340
otherwise gases and stuff will come in from the engine and they'll kill you.

171
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.840
She gave a two finger cub scouts salute and then jogged off toward the store.

172
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.760
Julie's sat alone in the car for a minute listening to the engine,

173
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.560
a creek and settle and needing to pee and then she picked up the keys and turned

174
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:10.980
on the CD player.
There was a new song,
quiet and creepy.

175
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.820
A man was pushing a shopping cart filled with bulky trash bags under the curb by

176
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:16.110
the dark part at the edge of the store.

177
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.390
The gray hood bunched up around his skull.

178
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.560
She looked at the window half rolled down and wondered if you could smell the

179
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:25.560
gas from the engine killing you and if the sleepiness she felt in her temples,

180
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:29.520
men that it might already be too late.
She turned off the CD,

181
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:32.130
but that only made the dread worse and she couldn't figure out how to turn it

182
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:34.830
back on.
You took forever.

183
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.920
She said to Tabitha when her sister hustled back into the car and handed her a

184
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:42.060
white fat white shopping bag size forest's attempts to put them on.

185
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.460
There was a pair of jeans in the bag.

186
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.050
Where am I supposed to put them on as Julie,
Jesus said,
Tabitha the backseat.

187
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.030
Where else do you change clothes and a car.

188
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.360
Julie tapped her fingers the bag and then clambered between the seats,

189
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.351
the leather in the back,

190
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:59.800
reeked of Pot and incense and she stretched her legs out over the piles of

191
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:03.820
forgotten school papers that filled up it.
This car,
a skeleton key chain,

192
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:07.900
long abandoned dug into her behind the windows are up and she said,

193
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.400
right sit Tabitha.
People only notice park cars if the windows get all fucked up.

194
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:14.380
So even though it may seem like the exact wrong thing to do,

195
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.360
if you're getting physical with a boy,

196
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.780
you'll want to leave the windows up and remember that you're stupid in stone.

197
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.640
So Julie,
I'm never getting physical with the boy,
with the girl.

198
00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.790
Then it's habits for Shrek,
whatever.
It's the millennium.

199
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.310
Julie flushed in the dark.
You're stoned.
She repeated

200
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.160
it.
She closed her eyes.

201
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.060
She pretended that she was not sitting in a parked car with her sister and she

202
00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:37.900
shrugged off her box.

203
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:41.770
Here is she carried the new genes on archer back to struggle with the last two

204
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:45.700
inches of hip and the snaps.
They're too tight.

205
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:49.900
She breathed size for my ass at Tabitha.
Come on,
squeeze him in there.

206
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.880
She's still managed.
It snapped.
Zipped,
tried to breathe and succeeded.

207
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.100
She sat up still.
Okay.
She opened the door and began to circle the car.

208
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:04.630
Walking the pants on the jeans wear boot cut screen painted neon flames rising

209
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:05.464
from the cuffs.

210
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.130
She winced as her bare souls pushed against the crack glass asphalt.

211
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.680
She was walking commando through a parking lot at night and tight Jean.

212
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.420
She had just gone out and bought with her sister.
Why not snap like that?

213
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.870
Tabitha was behind the wheel stoned and fiddling with the CD player,

214
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.170
giving her a thumbs up and nodding in time with Cherub rock out of the speakers.

215
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:28.080
And she looked at her sister and she loved her.
You like a mess,
Tabitha.

216
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.370
They're not like cutting off circulation in your legs.

217
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.690
They're the best pants ever.
Julie said,
you make them work set tab of Tabitha,

218
00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:37.930
come on,
let's get pancakes.

219
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.070
And so they pulled out of the parking lot and under the highway like a jet

220
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.390
screaming and takeoff a jet that sounded like Billy Corgan and stank like an

221
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:47.830
ashtray at a renaissance fair.

222
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:51.850
And Julie decided that there would never be a better moment than this in her

223
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:55.090
entire life.
Thank you all very much.

224
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:03.820
<v 1>MMM.
My</v>

225
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.410
<v 3>name is Red Durkin.
Um,
I've got about an hour's sleep in me.
Um,</v>

226
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:13.410
so this will be fun.
That'd be great.
Um,
I'll say it.
Yeah,
I,
I,
I,

227
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:18.460
I was interested.
I'm a comedian,
but my writing is really not very funny.
So,
um,

228
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.000
I'm going to read my story from the collection,

229
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.000
which is titled a Roman incident.
Um,

230
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:28.840
and all you need to know about that is that it's the term for when somebody

231
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:33.480
throws up during an eating contest.
Um,

232
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.220
to Charlie's immediate left stood a man who had once eaten 21 pounds of grits

233
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:43.570
and 10 minutes all along the table in front of her clad in the same free tee

234
00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:46.090
shirt.
She wore adventurous amateurs,

235
00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:49.480
stood shoulder to shoulder with vetted professionals who made their living

236
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:54.050
rushing down enough food to kill civilians.
Charlie prayed,
oh,

237
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.960
Jeez.

238
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.410
<v 4>Oh,
it went away.
All right,
I'll try to not let that happen again.
Sorry.</v>

239
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.873
Um,

240
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.450
<v 3>Charlie prayed that intense short minutes.</v>

241
00:15:03.451 --> 00:15:05.670
She'd have earned a place in the fellowship of the ladder.

242
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.070
I see terror filled her empty stomach.

243
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.940
She could afford to lose some of her nerve,
but none of her appetite.

244
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.300
She closed her eyes and counted down from 10 at zero with the world completely

245
00:15:17.611 --> 00:15:20.010
exploded.
Lights flashed buzzers,

246
00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:23.910
blared and a crowd of thousands surging like a bore tide crashed into the

247
00:15:23.911 --> 00:15:25.380
security gate there.

248
00:15:25.381 --> 00:15:29.550
Cacophonous excitement splashed onto the stage along with waves of their beer.

249
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.970
Charlie was face down in her fourth mouthful of chicken when Pavlovian reflex

250
00:15:35.071 --> 00:15:38.490
gateway to human awareness and she realized what was happening.

251
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.970
The Hooters world wing eating championship had begun.

252
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.530
Her destiny was at the bar at the bottom of the pile of poultry parts in front

253
00:15:46.531 --> 00:15:49.230
of her.
She couldn't afford to be reckless.

254
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.750
Every wing had to be clean in order to count,

255
00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:55.620
so she quickly rendered each one to polish bone before moving onto the next

256
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.640
behind her,
a gorgeous girl and emphatically tight orange shirt.

257
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.310
Shorts held a scorecard above her head.

258
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.920
The woman bounced and smiled and cheered,

259
00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:09.540
faking her enthusiasm the way Charlie imagined her mother had taught her in part

260
00:16:09.541 --> 00:16:13.950
of her heart.
Charlie would always bear a hateful jealousy for women like this.

261
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.910
She begrudge them their big friendly breasts.
They're happily bulging hips.

262
00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:22.050
All the legible parts of their bodies that spoke woman in every language.

263
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.490
Charlie's inscrutable frame would never carry that confident kind of currency.

264
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:31.320
And she scored the pretty girls for their oblivious luck.
When she was nine,

265
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.860
she had posted a note on the fridge that said Charlie is a girl and she needs

266
00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:39.660
new clothes.
Um,
oh God.
Now what's this doing?
Well,

267
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.590
he even saved me.

268
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.790
<v 4>Yeah,
that's weird.
I don't know anything about like technology.</v>

269
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.550
Is this a tech savvy crowd?
Okay.
Should be.
Okay.
Great.

270
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.650
Thank you.
Um,
so,
uh,

271
00:16:55.651 --> 00:17:00.270
to recover a little bit,
uh,
Charlie hits pretty girls.
Um,

272
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.360
<v 3>when she was nine,</v>

273
00:17:03.361 --> 00:17:06.630
she had posted a note on the fridge that said Charlie is a girl and she needs

274
00:17:06.631 --> 00:17:11.400
new clothes.
End of discussion some years earlier to get out of an intervention.

275
00:17:11.401 --> 00:17:15.180
Charlie's father had declared that the words end of discussion meant exactly

276
00:17:15.181 --> 00:17:18.420
that in the Eagle Horn household it was family law.

277
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.290
The phrase had been employed when she was 12 and demanded to go on hormones.

278
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.860
And most recently at 17 when she declared her intention of becoming a

279
00:17:25.861 --> 00:17:30.480
professional speed eater,
one minute down,
one bowl of wings,
Eaton,

280
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.530
Charlie's heart kicked like a mule,
anxiety throbbed in her temple.

281
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.660
Her jaw stiffen too quickly.

282
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.230
She knew if she didn't calm down and steady her pace,

283
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.670
she'd be lucky to finish it all.

284
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:44.430
But she was operating on a level based or than prudence.

285
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.970
It was the reptile part of her brain that was grabbing and chewing and

286
00:17:47.971 --> 00:17:52.470
swallowing.
She couldn't hear the sloppy roar of the crowd or the glut grunting,

287
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:56.040
gluttony of the competition like the few other women on stage.

288
00:17:56.041 --> 00:18:00.240
She was pelted with the countless ugly words for girls that flies so easily from

289
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:03.390
the mouths of angry drunk and men.
She blocked it out.

290
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.590
She'd had practice tears and snot gushed down her face.

291
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.570
She was soaked in a marinade of sweat and buffalo sauce.
Grab,
chew,

292
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.490
swallow each spicy wing tasted more like sy Styrofoam and her cheeks.

293
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:22.491
Bulged with untutored meet every bedraggled second took a lifetime to pass.

294
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.990
It was beginning to feel like home.

295
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.070
She'd been raised by a pair of New England hippies who'd moved to Alabama

296
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.820
because they liked the leaves and autumns and in autumn and acquainted dirt

297
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.500
roads with rustic honesty.

298
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.880
The Eagle Horn settled in a truck stop town outside of Montgomery called hope

299
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:42.330
hole,
which was an appropriate name for a place so utterly gutted.

300
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.310
Have anything worth looking forward to?
Oh my God,
it just it again.
So I chose,

301
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.070
I chose to read this story because my other stories are really gross and

302
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.710
upsetting and now I'm like,
oh,
I should have just been gross and upsetting.

303
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.180
All right.

304
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.630
The little horn settled in a truck stop town outside of Montgomery called hope

305
00:18:57.631 --> 00:19:01.860
hole,
which was an appropriate name of for a place so utterly gutted.

306
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:03.660
Have anything worth looking forward to.

307
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.890
The Charlie is a girl campaign had been one of the most successful political

308
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:12.891
movements in its entire history as a homeschooled hippie welp growing out up on

309
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.660
the fringes of an outskirt town.

310
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:19.560
She was practically invisible to anyone who didn't share their meals with her.

311
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.610
Between her mother's home style,
lopsided haircuts,

312
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.210
and her father's surprisingly successful approach to homeopathic endocrinology.

313
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.280
Those lucky enough to lay eyes on her were neither certain of NORC curious about

314
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:33.420
what they were looking at.

315
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.500
Her parents claimed her as their daughter and so long as you didn't have the

316
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:42.501
audacity to dye your hair pink or the nerve to be dark skin hope holes residents

317
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:47.280
where a proudly credulous bunch Charlie suddenly realized she couldn't remember

318
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:49.800
the last time she'd taken oxygen into her lungs.

319
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.950
She wondered how long her animal mind had been screaming.

320
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.930
All the pain and confusion she'd foist it on it were immediately hers to deal

321
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:02.040
with again.
Four more minutes had passed,
four and a half more bowls,

322
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.300
55 wings and all the top half of her body was covered in Gore.

323
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.820
Her job load,
white hot with pain,

324
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.660
her esophagus burning with the sensation of being strangled from the inside out.

325
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.920
She tried to swallow,
but the blockage in her throat only shuffled in place.

326
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.000
She snatched a couple of water from the table and gulped it down the lump.

327
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.890
Lurched mercifully as it finally moved to take its rightful place in her

328
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.550
stomach.

329
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.990
She gassed a great mouth full of air and the agony all over her body began to

330
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:35.520
register on an all too conscious level.
Her fingers hurt.

331
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.430
She took another deep breath and close her eyes.

332
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.930
She forced herself to master the pain.
She refused to go back to hustling.

333
00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:47.280
Arrogant rednecks at the off ramp burger joints that composed hope holes economy

334
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.680
at once.
At one time,
those moments had been proud and meaningful victories.

335
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.720
Now they felt more like the glory day nails in her inevitably mediocre coffin.

336
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.710
She was willing to eat her way out of that Shit Splat town,

337
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.300
even if it killed her.

338
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.890
She picked up another wing just in time to catch a blur of green glass in her

339
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:09.724
periphery.

340
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.810
The bottle cracked her just above the eye and everything went white in an

341
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:18.720
instant.
Charlie had been hit before.
Of course,
by her mid teens.

342
00:21:18.721 --> 00:21:22.570
She traded her bean pole,
adolescent androgyny for a sexless Lee,

343
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:26.950
a morphous obesity to the idol and idiot youth of hope whole.

344
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:31.150
Charlie was a Mira of cardinal social sins.
She was fat,

345
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.970
opinionated and ineffably weird looking.

346
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.290
She had the disturbing habit of reading for pleasure and her free spirited

347
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:41.080
Yankee kin might as well have been Martians.

348
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.930
The girls spit in her hair and laughed at her back.

349
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.490
The boys called her a fagot because she confused them.
They punched her,

350
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.330
she punched back and slowly they all learned how to fight together.

351
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.900
Her soul companion was a pig nose girl named Lulu,

352
00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.400
who brazenly forced the friendship to garner disapproval from her pig faced

353
00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:04.600
family in fluttering flashes.
The world began to focus.

354
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.170
She'd staggered back from the table,
but was still in the competition.

355
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.460
Precious seconds had been lost to semi consciousness and she warded off wary

356
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.030
medics to keep from losing more.
The red in her,

357
00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:18.370
I might well have been buffalo sauce.

358
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.890
Her throbbing had reminded her of home.
She wanted to sleep.
She needed to eat.

359
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.720
She split the difference and looked around four more minutes to go and only

360
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:33.721
eight of the original 20 km com competitors still stood on the line for the

361
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:34.331
first time.

362
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:38.260
She could see that just passed the grist grits eater and a bloated man wearing

363
00:22:38.261 --> 00:22:42.100
novelty.
Sunglasses stood Sonia Thomas,
the black widow.

364
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.360
She was as felt Korean born woman who had managed a burger king before becoming

365
00:22:46.361 --> 00:22:48.640
the second highest rank or agitator on earth.

366
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.270
She held a dozen world records and according to the scoreboard,

367
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:55.240
a chicken wing that would put her 26 points out of reach.

368
00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.100
Charlie's stomach suddenly felt like a much smaller place somewhere outside of

369
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:02.410
her body.
She could see herself chewing again.

370
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.260
She had never planned on beating Sonia Thomas.
She'd only prayed she,

371
00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:09.790
she wouldn't show up.
Some people want to kill their idols,

372
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:14.380
but Charlie didn't want a fight.
She just wanted to get out of Alabama.

373
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.540
A mechanical Walt settled over her body,
grab,
chew,
swallow.

374
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.250
She struggled to distract herself from the replete pain and doubt welling up in

375
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:25.084
her guts.

376
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.740
She thought back to home and the perpetual motion of her life as a podunk pariah

377
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.610
in the dregs of her diffidence.
She knew that she'd fed the beast,

378
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.070
had let the hurt go deeper than skin and had grown fatter,
weirder,

379
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.640
even meaner.
As a result,

380
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.630
she'd craved the hard touch of a town that would never claim her as their own.

381
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.980
Never love her,
never brag about her.

382
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.570
Her hope had been shining through and ever clenching Pinhole,

383
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.360
but in that lens she'd seen the widow competing on television.

384
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.420
Charlie recognized her kindred in strife,

385
00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:01.450
another misfit among rubes she saw and Sonia Thomas a whisper of freedom,

386
00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.730
a liberty to dance on the edge of womanhood and thrive.

387
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.220
Charlie's training had started the spring.

388
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:12.080
She turns 17 her parents met her intentions of becoming a major league either

389
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:14.330
with a skepticism bordering hostility.

390
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.640
17 years of semi responsible parenting had severely moderated the Eagle Horn

391
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:22.610
idea of acceptable life goals.
Really,

392
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.060
they worried that they're chronically unpopular.
Daughters plan to actual living,

393
00:24:26.061 --> 00:24:29.270
shoving food down her throat was a proposition and suicide.

394
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.860
She'd had to declare the discussion ended more than once.
In fact,

395
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.600
she'd never been further from death.

396
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.340
Her regimen was modeled on what she could glean from our idol,

397
00:24:39.341 --> 00:24:41.870
sporadic television appearances and the Internet.

398
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.010
It was surprisingly in step with the recommendations of modern medicine,

399
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.860
eight hours of sleep at night,
daily jobs,

400
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:53.150
and a strict 1700 calorie diet filled with fruits and vegetables.

401
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.200
Of course,

402
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.340
eating all that food at once is an in many fitness manuals to say nothing of her

403
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:00.770
biweekly,
all you can eat workouts,

404
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.330
but the overall improvement in Charlie's health was undeniable.
By the fall,

405
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:10.100
she'd lost 78 pounds and game the beauty and confidence of a girl who truly

406
00:25:10.101 --> 00:25:12.410
believes she has control over food.

407
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.420
Her public enthusiasm of eating competitions did her few favors with her peers,

408
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.170
but her reclaimed featherweight kilter and the offbrand hormones her father

409
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:25.850
bought online had given her a peculiar prettiness that at least kept boys from

410
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:29.870
throwing rocks at her.
Her friendship remained a social pitfall.

411
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.220
Lulu alone was willing to risk with 30 seconds left,

412
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.950
something was very wrong and getting worse.

413
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.990
The 83 wings she'd somehow swallowed.
We're now an open revolt.

414
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.360
Terror tied a knot in her stomach,

415
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:49.361
making her nausea feel all the more urgent she'd eaten beyond her means Charlie

416
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.900
was going to throw up.
Her breath came and shallow gulps.

417
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.370
She wobbled drunkenly as her strength began to break and she closed her eyes.

418
00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.181
Clammy,

419
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:03.740
certainty enveloped her vomiting was intractable and inevitable,

420
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.020
but desperately needed to be stalled.

421
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.340
If a drop of her sick touch the table before the clock ran out,

422
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.600
she'd be disqualified.
A great wave of adrenaline washed up.

423
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:17.630
The last bit of resolve,
she'd so jealously buried.

424
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.740
It was immediately followed by the half digested ambitions at the back of her

425
00:26:21.741 --> 00:26:25.070
throat.
Charlie's hand shot to her mouth.

426
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:29.630
A gleeful explosion of pleasure roared out of the voyeuristic crowd.

427
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.190
Her shoulders heaved as though she'd been shoved by an invisible hand and she

428
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:35.750
teetered slightly forward.

429
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:41.090
The drool in her mouth tasted like batteries for mass in her guts came flooding

430
00:26:41.091 --> 00:26:43.890
out over her lips and into her waiting palms.

431
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.670
She shuttered violently as she buckled and began to fall.

432
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.710
The final buzzer screamed out over the chaos.
The championship was over.

433
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.630
Charlie's world strobed into blackness and she collapses unconscious into a pile

434
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:01.380
of puke and victory in her hallucinations.

435
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.700
Charlie watched the big bang spew forth and begin to eat itself.

436
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.430
She perceived a cycle of consumption.

437
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.550
The title glut of energy that crushes stars and digests the cosmos at the center

438
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:17.340
of each galaxy,
sat an endlessly hungry mouth,

439
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.720
a black hole that bolted down creation and waited for the final Buzzer of

440
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.940
doomsday serenely.

441
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:27.240
She recognized creation as an elaborate eating contest.

442
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.220
The thought made her happy.

443
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.420
She woke up to the bright white glow of tarp in the sunshine.

444
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.610
Her head lay on a starched sterile pillow and a clear tube of saline dripped

445
00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:40.500
into a vein in the crook of her elbow.

446
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.930
The Bullion Bustle of post-competition commotion outside told Her that she'd

447
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.130
been unconscious for only a few minutes,

448
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.410
though she felt like she'd witnessed Aternity.

449
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.460
Sitting up drew the relieved attention of a kind face young medic on the other

450
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:54.294
side of the tent.

451
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.920
Her heart fluttered her head throbs and he urged her to lie back down.

452
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:04.110
She'd almost died.
It was time to rest in a photo finish.

453
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:08.640
Charlie's vomit had stayed in her hands and off the table until after the
buzzer.

454
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.930
The rules were clear.
Sheet officially finished successfully.

455
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.750
Charlie was a wolf awarded third place,

456
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.730
just five wings shy of the grit sky on the plastic stool next to her cot

457
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.820
paperclip to a $500 check and a handful of Hooters coupons was a business card

458
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.570
with the International Federation of Competitive Eaters logo on it.
She grinned,

459
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.470
grinned,
deliriously belched and fell asleep.
Thank you.

460
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

461
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.260
<v 4>It's always awesome to watch the people who kind of lose their shit during that</v>

462
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:47.920
story.
I've seen him.
That'd be that a lot of times.
It's nice.
Um,

463
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.210
and it was edited many and this is a novel called Nevada that I wrote that just

464
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:55.470
lost at the lambda literary awards.
It's a story.

465
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.304
It's in two parts.

466
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.920
The first is about a trans woman living in New York City who was a mess,

467
00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:02.440
who was her girlfriend and her job.
And the second part,
um,

468
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.810
she sort of half borrows,

469
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:07.920
half steals her now ex girlfriend's car and points it west where she winds up at

470
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.420
a Walmart in a small town in Nevada where she sees a kid,

471
00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:15.450
she's in her late twenties.
She sees his kid and she's like,
ah,
you're 19.

472
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.600
And I know you,
you are trans and you don't know it yet.
I'm going to fucking,

473
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:23.460
I'm going to fix that for you.
Um,
and he's like,
oh,
I don't know about that.

474
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:28.860
Um,
as a story of nonconsensual mentorship,
um,
and so what I'm going to read,

475
00:29:28.861 --> 00:29:31.080
I'm gonna read apart from the first half of it and then apart from the second

476
00:29:31.081 --> 00:29:31.980
half of it,
when they meet,

477
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.260
<v 1>um,
or am I,</v>

478
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.650
<v 4>yeah.
Um,
so the part,</v>

479
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:43.900
the first part I'm going to read,
she has broken up with her girlfriend.

480
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:47.020
Her girlfriend broke up with her a little bit ago and she just was fired for her

481
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:49.540
job because she works at the strand.
Do you know the,

482
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.660
the strand in New York City tricks it to bookstore?

483
00:29:51.661 --> 00:29:56.660
She tends to kind of just leave and walk around lower Manhattan on the clock.
Um,

484
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.890
so she's just been fired for that.
And that's that.

485
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.200
You could be melodramatic and say,
just like that.

486
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:05.050
Maria Griffiths is homeless and unemployed in New York City.

487
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.440
The reality though is that she has had,
or she has a bunch of places to crash,

488
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:11.920
so it would be appropriative to call herself homeless.
Okay.
She says,
great.

489
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:14.260
I'm just going to grab my stuff from the back and then I'll be on my wife.

490
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:16.930
She is in the process of being fired.
Okay.
She says,
great.

491
00:30:16.931 --> 00:30:19.240
I'm just going to grab my stuff from the back and I'll be on my way.

492
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:22.630
I'll cheerful.
Someone will bring you your things.
Mcneely says,

493
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:26.050
mcneilly's an angry,
obviously supervisor who is in the process of firing her.

494
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.653
Mcneely says,

495
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.970
you're really not going to let me go back to the closet to get my bag.

496
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.970
You don't work here anymore.
He says,
looking off to one side,

497
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:37.720
already bored with this conversation.
Some new kid brings her bag up.

498
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.170
They must've watched her leave and prepared for this awkward,
but whatever.

499
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.290
Once again,
her response surprises her.
She's kind of excited.

500
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.370
She laughs in the old fuckers face,
takes her bag and walks back into the rain.

501
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.940
She practically knocks over the terrifying owner of the store who has just

502
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:55.630
arrived in a cab or a car service or whatever.
Right.
On time for work.

503
00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.420
I'm not going to read this section for Youtube.

504
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.540
Yeah.
Wow.
That's a lot of stuff I don't read on Youtube.
Um,

505
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.860
Maria starts immediately to regret that she didn't get a jab in,
but whatever.

506
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:17.920
She's outside in the rain and she's got the whole afternoon to herself the whole

507
00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:18.221
week.

508
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:21.700
Actually it hits her again that she's pretty excited not to have a job anymore,

509
00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:24.580
even though that means no more money until she can find another one and no more

510
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:27.700
health insurance.
Who Cares?
She never has to go back to that job.

511
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:31.330
She was so indifferent about for so long because she absolutely completely hates

512
00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:35.890
her life in New York.
Whoa.
Sometimes your internal monologue surprises you.

513
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.990
She thinks about going back to the apartment.

514
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:41.620
She is probably still stay still sharing with Steph,
but seeing all steps,

515
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:43.390
things would probably be kind of rough right now.

516
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.600
Then she thinks about going to hang out with Parana.
Uh,
her best friend,

517
00:31:46.601 --> 00:31:48.790
his name Purana.
She thinks about going to hang out with Parana,

518
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:52.120
but she is probably going to be asking Khurana if she can crash at her house a

519
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:54.790
lot pretty soon.
So she had better not just start taking up space.

520
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:57.040
They're immediately,
she could go see a movie,

521
00:31:57.041 --> 00:32:00.130
but suddenly being broke is a lot more real than it was a couple of hours ago

522
00:32:00.131 --> 00:32:04.840
and $10 for a two hour distractions seems irresponsible,
like bad,
irresponsible.

523
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.090
She decided to go to [inaudible] dot.
Coffee.

524
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.390
It is this biggest coffee shop on avenue a where they have computers and stuff,

525
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:13.090
but also couches and expensive coffee and atmosphere.

526
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.190
It's cooler than the coffee shop by the bookstore,

527
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.240
like in a gentrification sense.
Uh,

528
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.120
as the last APP act of epic,
brutal punk rock defiance,

529
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.630
she steps two feet back into the door of the bookstore and grabs an umbrella out

530
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:29.680
of the umbrella basket.
Ha.
She leaves her bike chained up outside the bookstore,

531
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.520
under the awning where they'll stay dry and walks the six long blocks to ave a,

532
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.620
it's so gray out it rules.

533
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.260
This has been her favorite kind of weather since she was a little kid.

534
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:41.870
She loves going after being in the rain when you're kind of wet and cold,

535
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:45.350
but you immediately start warming up and you finally start to feel just how wet

536
00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:45.801
you are.

537
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:49.190
As soon as you start to dry out and then you can look outside and see the rain,

538
00:32:49.191 --> 00:32:50.210
wash it,
run down the windows,

539
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:52.850
and nobody can realistically ask you to go outside and play.

540
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.500
New Yorkers walk by and ignore her cubs splash puddle water everywhere.

541
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.790
Nobody waits for the don't walk.

542
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:01.130
Sign to turn to walk before they crossed the street.

543
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.760
Rain looks like it's freezing to the frail branches of the city.
Trees.

544
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.190
Maybe the rain will start to freeze.
Turn the sidewalks.
IC It's fall,

545
00:33:08.191 --> 00:33:10.760
so it might happen,
but it's very early fall so it might not.

546
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:15.340
This umbrella is enormous and it's got a Nike logo on it.
Punk rock.
Indeed,

547
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.140
that man that she has been calling herself Batman in her internal monologue.

548
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.950
It's pretty wise.
Punk Rock,
indeed Batman,

549
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.920
she says to herself as she retracts the umbrella and it goes into the hip.

550
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:25.754
Coffee Shop.

551
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.550
They have an umbrella bucket and she worries for a second about whether someone

552
00:33:28.551 --> 00:33:31.610
will steal her umbrella.
Then laughs at herself.
Who Cares?

553
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.270
It probably do some good for somebody to steal her stolen umbrella so she would

554
00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:36.920
have to walk back to her bike in the rain.

555
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.370
She thinks about how good a hot shower fields when you're soaked in cold rain.

556
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.910
Here's the thing,
she's been thinking a lot about knuckle tattoos and half.

557
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:49.910
You have eight letters.
You can make a knuckle tattoo.
The next line is umbrella,

558
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:54.110
she thinks but it is spelled out in blocks of four letters so as to appear and

559
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:55.910
the shape of knuckle tattoos.

560
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.460
She's thinking about having the word umbrella tattooed on her knuckles.

561
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.260
She didn't bring a book and she doesn't really know what she's going to do at

562
00:34:02.261 --> 00:34:02.911
the coffee shop.

563
00:34:02.911 --> 00:34:06.140
Spend money on Internet access to look at help wanted ads on craigslist.

564
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.200
Her resume from years ago is probably somewhere in her email.

565
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.840
She can update it to include this most recent job.

566
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.790
Act like she left without being fired.

567
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.090
Lie and say a friend is a manager who thinks she was a great employee.

568
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.600
She can use her real name,
not her legal one and just not freak out about it.

569
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.150
If anybody asks,
just tell them she's transit the interview.

570
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.150
If she gets an interview,
that way it'll be out in the open,

571
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:28.010
at least with the management at her new job,

572
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.920
which will be as somebody who's assistant at a publishing company or something,

573
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.610
she gets a $3 drip coffee and gives the borrower star her license.

574
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:35.931
She doesn't look at it,

575
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:39.080
but she's got daycare so she probably wouldn't care if she saw the M.

576
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.410
Maria is assigned computer number 23 but after 15 minutes of looking at

577
00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:45.500
craigslist,
her eyes glaze over and she's falling asleep sitting up.

578
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.690
She doesn't have the energy to email that girl.

579
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.760
She does not feel like job searching.
She's like,

580
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:53.390
do I even want to stay in New York?
She doesn't actually have to.

581
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.880
She goes back up to it to the counter,

582
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.600
tells the girl that she has done on the computer and gets her license back $5

583
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:02.600
for 15 minutes.
She takes her coffee over to a couch,

584
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.550
sits down and takes out her notebook.

585
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:09.350
October 15th part three I hate New York,
but I love The New York rain and autumn,

586
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.880
like the November rain,

587
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.910
but it is October and I just got fired from the stupid bookstore.

588
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.590
I didn't even cuss out anybody.

589
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:17.870
Now I have to figure out what the fuck to do with myself.

590
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:20.690
Do I get a new job in Brooklyn near my apartment except I'm going to have to

591
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:22.060
find another apartment too.

592
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.670
I am exhausted from thinking about being trans all the time and I wish I could

593
00:35:25.671 --> 00:35:29.540
stop.
If you work for the city of San Francisco,
dear diary,

594
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.120
did you know that they will pay for bottom surgery for you?

595
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.640
It might be an urban legend.
Maybe.
I will look into it.

596
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.500
It didn't even occur to me to go out and get drunk after I got fired,

597
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:38.340
which is interesting.

598
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.400
It's almost like I got drunk all the time when I was dating stuff and working a

599
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:43.380
shitty job.
Not because I am a total addict,

600
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.200
but because it was a coping mechanism to deal with being unhappy.

601
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.910
Her hand hurts already.

602
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.330
It sucks that being from the computer generation means she cannot write longhand

603
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.440
like at all.
She texted her,
Ana,
can I stay with you again tonight?

604
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.740
Get fired a little.
She puts the phone back in her car.

605
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.340
She puts the phone back in their pocket,
but it rings immediately.
It's Perona.

606
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.280
She stands up and goes outside because who cares what everybody else does?

607
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:08.820
Who cares that they're only three other people in the coffee shop at 2:00 PM on

608
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:09.600
a Wednesday.

609
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.630
It is rude to talk on your phone when other people are trying to concentrate.

610
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.760
Dude,
Parana says hi.
Maria says maybe more cheerful than she actually is.

611
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.081
I'm working tonight,

612
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:21.630
but you can come get the key for me at work and stay at my house while I'm out

613
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:25.050
and like take a shower or whatever.
Thanks.
Maria says,
but listen,

614
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:28.770
you can't just stay at my house all the time,
you know?
Yeah,
I was parented.

615
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:30.990
Cuts her off.
I know,
you know,
but it's like,
dude,
Maria,

616
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.080
besides the occasional text I hear from you once every two or three months

617
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:37.800
because you're so occupied with your girlfriend all the time and now suddenly

618
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.650
you want to hang out all day every day because you don't have to worry about her

619
00:36:40.651 --> 00:36:45.330
anymore.
It feels Kinda fucked to me.
Shit.
Yeah,
I know.

620
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.000
Listen,
Parana says I'm not going to put you out on the street,

621
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.980
especially if you just got fired from work and I want,

622
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.920
I want you to tell me all about that.
I'm not super pissed at you or anything.

623
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:56.250
I just need you to understand that I feel kind of resentful about the fact that

624
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:58.980
you have ignored me pretty bad for so long and now that you've got a reason

625
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.840
besides that you're excited to hang out with me.

626
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.690
Suddenly we are besties or whatever.
Okay.

627
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.590
Maria says probably hurt the most deeply that she's been in these last couple of

628
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.530
days.
I miss you.
Parana says,
and I'm excited to see you again,

629
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.070
but I needed to put that out there.
I've got to go to work at nine.

630
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.310
Come see me then.
Okay.
Yeah.
Maria says,
okay,
the hang up now,

631
00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:19.170
her mood has come back to earth and she feels like shit.

632
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.640
Maybe she should get a beer.

633
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.930
It turns out they have two for one beers after four at high fi half a block
away,

634
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:26.520
but Maria doesn't wait until four.

635
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.540
Then when four o'clock hits she has her third and Fourth Beers and falls asleep

636
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:31.920
on the bar for a couple hours.

637
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.680
Who knows why the skinny pretty bartender lets her sleep.

638
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:36.300
That's kind of off limits in most bars.

639
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.320
Maybe having a transsexual pass out at your bar for a couple hours is the kind

640
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:43.260
of gritty authenticity that a bar on the lower east side needs.

641
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:45.030
Now that everybody has moved to Brooklyn,

642
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.670
that's the first part I'm going to read.
Uh,

643
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.980
this next is section is from the perspective of James Who's 19.

644
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.030
He was smoking a lot of weed so he doesn't have to think about gender or have

645
00:37:57.031 --> 00:38:02.010
any feelings about gender.
Um,
he smokes out before he gets to work,

646
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:04.080
but by hour four or so of a nine hour shift,

647
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:07.350
he is not really feeling stoned anymore.
Every day.
By this point,

648
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:09.240
he mostly feels tired and pissed off.

649
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.840
He's always wished he could be the kind of cool Badass who smokes out at work,

650
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.750
but there is no way you could do it with some without somebody finding out,

651
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:19.500
plus his mom rides in his car.
Sometimes you can't even hotbox it ever.

652
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.010
It's actually very possible that this is why he hates his job so much.
He's like,

653
00:38:23.011 --> 00:38:24.240
I should think about that.

654
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.900
Every single day I go through an unstowed dinning and fucking hate my life and

655
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:31.440
my job in my house and my girlfriend and everyone and everything that I can see.

656
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.140
It seems like that probably affects my job satisfaction.

657
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.450
I end each shift with a headache.

658
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:41.050
I need a fix because I am addicted to the sheet demon marijuana.

659
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.730
It is getting toward the end of the shift and James isn't stone anymore and it's

660
00:38:44.731 --> 00:38:45.400
sucks.

661
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.610
This old guy who comes in once or twice a week was looking for some stupid old

662
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:51.970
movies that he couldn't find because Walmart does not carry stupid old movies,

663
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.070
but this guy doesn't listen to James at all,

664
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:56.980
so they always wind up spending half an hour pretending to look for these DVDs

665
00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:00.820
that are not there.
That's probably a metaphor for life and star city actually,

666
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.830
whatever once or twice a week.
James,

667
00:39:02.831 --> 00:39:05.800
thanks very seriously about writing out a note to have a waiting for this guy

668
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:08.230
the next time he comes in that explains that these are very,

669
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:12.190
very old and Hokey movies starring actors that nobody cares about anymore and

670
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:15.730
that he would be better off going to the family dollar over an inlay where they

671
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:19.900
saw those mass produce DVDs of public domain stuff that feel all light in your

672
00:39:19.901 --> 00:39:23.740
hands,
like there's no DVD in them.
Walmart can't even order them.

673
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.980
Those DVD companies have their own distributors that Walmart doesn't use,

674
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.980
which is weird since it seems like the distributors that make those wholesome

675
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:33.700
DVDs would be Christian and Walmart doesn't shy away from Christian anything but

676
00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:35.410
whatever.
Who Cares?
James has a headache.

677
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:38.380
He needs to smoke out again in this old guy is starting to seem done with

678
00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:39.970
playing out this scenario yet again.

679
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.540
When Maria Griffiths come strutting up the aisle of the Walmart looking out of

680
00:39:43.541 --> 00:39:47.050
place as hell like she is made out of long red hair and layers of clothing.

681
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.370
James does what anybody would do and they see somebody they would like to know.

682
00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.910
He ignores the shit out of her probably he freaks out a little,

683
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.910
but she came right to the music and movies section,
so what else could he do?

684
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.330
He says hi to her when she first comes in because he can get in trouble if he

685
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:04.270
doesn't.
According to Walmart,
corporate policy greetings,

686
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.100
turn thieves into friends,

687
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.830
but then he just ignores her is how maybe on some level he notices that she

688
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:15.040
might've looked for or looked at him for a second longer than was appropriate,

689
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.890
but if you have things,
anything,
it's like suck it up dude.

690
00:40:17.891 --> 00:40:19.930
That girl is definitely not checking you out.

691
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.500
She's wearing more clothes than he has ever seen anyone wear it once.

692
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:25.810
Huge black boots,
a long black skirt,

693
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:29.380
or maybe address what looks like a shorter dark orange skirt on top of it.

694
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:33.550
Along maroonish sweater under a ratty denim jacket with a bunch of patches and

695
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:34.384
buttons on it.

696
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:38.410
A black scarf and wavy dried out looking hair just past her shoulders.

697
00:40:38.411 --> 00:40:40.960
Her hair is almost exactly the same color as her sweater,

698
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:45.220
but a little bit darker.
They probably clash or whatever her clothes look like.

699
00:40:45.221 --> 00:40:46.090
She slept in them.

700
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.690
They're permanent looking crinkles in the elbows of her jacket and her hair

701
00:40:49.691 --> 00:40:52.960
looks like it would leave a mark if she leaned her head against a wall.

702
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:57.490
She looks like she's probably a rock star or a murderer.
One time the band,

703
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.680
one time the band creed came to is Walmart on tour to buy batteries or something

704
00:41:02.681 --> 00:41:05.380
and everybody flipped out even though creed is a stupid band,

705
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.010
but James saw one of the guys from the band and he walked with this magnetism or

706
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:12.730
swagger or something like he knew he was a big deal and Maria carries herself

707
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:13.690
kind of the same way.

708
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.040
She walks over to the pop slash rock CD display and James thinks clearly,

709
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.370
who the fuck wears a scarf in the daytime and star city,

710
00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:25.120
especially during a heat wave.
While he's ignoring her,
he stares at her back.

711
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.490
This is good.
I bet Google people will get those ready.
Who the fuck?
Uh,

712
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.050
where's the scarf and the daytime and star city,
especially during a heat wave.

713
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:36.050
While he is ignoring hair.
He stares at her back.
Steven Tyler,
the fourth doctor.

714
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.870
Yeah.
Great.
There's always like one or two people who were like,

715
00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.330
did you didn't just cool the fourth doc.

716
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.780
It's a doctor who illusion James Watches a lot of TV.

717
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:52.010
He is seriously just being a creep and staring at her because people who look

718
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:53.270
like that do not live here.

719
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:55.580
They don't stop here while they're driving through either.

720
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:57.650
There are other Walmarts closer to the highway,

721
00:41:57.651 --> 00:41:59.690
like three exits away in either direction.

722
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.560
It was fucking dumb for Walmart to put a Walmart here.
Well,

723
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.480
nobody comes here except for creed.

724
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.900
Once she flips through the pop slash rock cds for a second and James Manages to

725
00:42:11.451 --> 00:42:15.230
look away from the poison patch safety pin across her back and the Msci wavy

726
00:42:15.231 --> 00:42:17.750
hair sprawling.
It's weighed down at like poison,

727
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.900
the Glam rock band with a singer who does reality TV shows.

728
00:42:20.901 --> 00:42:24.320
Now his headache fades or else James just forgets about it because when she

729
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:24.951
turns around,

730
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:28.760
he's very intently alphabetizing cds that have just come in and need to be

731
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:33.380
shelved.
Hey,
she says,
looking him up and down again.
James is like,
hi,

732
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.180
do you have the Miranda Lambert album?
Um,
he says,
probably,

733
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.060
but it's probably in the country's section.
She's like,
oh,

734
00:42:41.061 --> 00:42:42.740
there's a country section.
And he's like,
well,

735
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.480
yeah then because he was feeling totally weird.
James doesn't even stop himself.

736
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.360
He just blurts out,
you don't look like the folks who usually shop there though.

737
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.690
Because if he is being totally honest with himself on some level,

738
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:56.570
James has already figured out that this girl is trans and while he hasn't

739
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:58.430
processed what that means yet,

740
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:02.300
he is having this desperate magnetic attraction to her.
Like not even sexual,

741
00:43:02.301 --> 00:43:04.430
just like,
I want to be your Facebook friend.

742
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:07.820
I need to grab you to have you in my life.
Whatever.

743
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.610
You don't look like the folks who usually shop here.

744
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.310
That is a pretty dumb thing to say,
but she doesn't disagree.

745
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.840
She looks at his name tag,
smirks and says,
that's probably true James H,

746
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:21.170
but check this out.
I left New York City about a week ago and my dog,

747
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:24.290
my cat and I had been living out of my car since then driving out to the west

748
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:27.350
coast solely because we have never seen it in New York City.

749
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.480
They're Spanish music stations,
wrap stations,

750
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:32.960
dumb rock stations and little stations run by painfully self-aware college

751
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.200
students with no idea what to do with all their privilege besides collect

752
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:39.260
records and gentrify neighborhoods that have been fine for generations,

753
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.770
but I don't think there's a country station in New York.

754
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.870
I guess there are a lot of reggaeton stations,

755
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:47.900
which in a lot of ways people tend to not even notice has a lot of similarities

756
00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:50.870
to country music.
By the way.
People have asked me,
Oh yeah,
how's Vegas tone?

757
00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:55.760
Similar to country.
It's not,
this is Maria being an idiot.
Anyway.

758
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.850
It turns out though that once you leave New York,
which nobody should ever do,

759
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.320
j k the only things you can,

760
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.230
the only thing that you can consistently get on a 12 year old car stereo or NPR

761
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:10.310
and country stations and have you ever listened to NPR?
It's soothing for awhile,

762
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:13.310
but eventually it makes you want to call in and cuss somebody out until you cry.

763
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:17.600
It wouldn't get onto the radio because I guess they have enough lag time to dump

764
00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:19.400
out angry people who call up and lose their shit.

765
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.020
But it turned me off NPR for a while,

766
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:24.410
which means country station after country station for the last four days.

767
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.920
And look,

768
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.280
I am not some New York jerk who thinks country music is for Yoko's or something.

769
00:44:28.281 --> 00:44:29.510
I'm into it.
I get it.

770
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.460
I even think it's kind of nice that country singers are so fucking convinced of

771
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:35.160
their own sincerity that they don't do any of the tortured artist.

772
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.480
I don't care if you'd like me.

773
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:40.620
It's art man posturing that all the Indie rock kids do and they don't spend all

774
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.180
day telling me about how tough and rich they are.

775
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:44.850
Like the rappers on the radio do except James Age.

776
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.530
There's also a lot of dumb shit on country radio.
I'm so much cooler online.

777
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.920
She thinks my tractor's sexy.
I guess it's funny the first time but,

778
00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:57.510
but Maria has followed James over to the country music section and is jabbing

779
00:44:57.511 --> 00:44:59.310
her pointer finger toward his chest.

780
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:04.050
I guess she says Miranda Lambert isn't the biggest star in the country sky

781
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:07.230
because I've only heard the radio play her a couple of times but I think all her

782
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:09.420
songs are about like burning down,

783
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:13.110
cheating ex boyfriends houses and like shooting your abusive ex in the face.

784
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.320
The first time I heard that song I was like finally someone is just coming out

785
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:17.010
and threading,

786
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.980
threatening to kill her asshole boyfriend right there on the radio.

787
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.800
Not that I think anybody should kill anybody else or anything,

788
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:26.790
but after five days of country radio,
consider me brainwashed,
Miranda Lambert.

789
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.870
James H is the punk shit on the radio and I'm going to drive my car off a cliff.

790
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:34.020
If I hear the song about how the guy hopes he gets a chance to live like he was

791
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:35.490
dying ever again,

792
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.210
not because I don't like it because it is so sad and true that it makes me want

793
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:42.570
to live like I was dying and then die.
So James H.

794
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.300
Miranda Lambert is a contingency plan to save my life.

795
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.020
She actually said the Internet abbreviation for just kidding.
Out Loud.

796
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.560
There's a pause and then she smirked and she's like,
sorry,

797
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:58.620
I haven't really talked to anybody in awhile.
James is like,
it's cool.

798
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.830
He picks up Mirandas and then Miranda Lambert second album and hands it to her.

799
00:46:01.831 --> 00:46:04.680
This is the CD with that song about the gunpowder and led on it.
He says,

800
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.230
thank you James H.
She says,
you've been very helpful.

801
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.290
Then she starts to leave the movies and cds department.
Wait,

802
00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:13.140
James says you've got to buy it here.
I'll security will kick my ass.

803
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.940
This is kind of true.
Mostly true.

804
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.260
You're supposed to get people to buy their music and DVDs and the music and DVDs

805
00:46:18.261 --> 00:46:20.340
section.
Even though there isn't like a rule about it.

806
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.370
It's a firm's suggestion in the interest of loss prevention,

807
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.500
but it is a stupid thing to emphasize just then.

808
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.650
It's not like he's going to slip or his phone number on the receipt.
Well,

809
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.130
the receipt does have the phone number for Walmart number eight three zero four

810
00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:35.280
on it.
If she wants to call him,
I don't think they can take you.

811
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:38.850
She says you look like a total bruiser.
Yeah,
he says totally.

812
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:40.680
I'm a regular old Brad Paisley.

813
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:42.430
We were just talking about Brad Paisley in the car before him.

814
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:47.070
Brad Paisley is great.
I'm a regular old Brad Paisley,
which one is Brad Paisley.

815
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.250
You know,
he says,
I don't highlight my hair and I've still got a pair.

816
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.220
Rias eyes lit up and she quotes from this dumb country song,

817
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.210
my eyebrows plucked and there's a gun in my truck.
That's me.
He says,
honey,

818
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:58.044
I'm still a guy.

819
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:03.230
It's $10 and 90 cents the weirdness of that exchange is not lost on either of

820
00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:05.760
them.
Maria pays with a debit card.

821
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:10.140
James notices that her pin is six six six four then she leaves and he thinks,

822
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.100
well fuck.

823
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.950
Then his headache is back and he gets pretty bummed so he starts thinking about

824
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:16.680
how like soon he's going to go home and get high as fuck.

825
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.190
Smoking weed rules and the fact that this girl just showed up in his life and

826
00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:22.200
now she has gone forever.
Totally sucks.

827
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.050
He's thinking about this weird girl who was just here whose name he doesn't even

828
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:28.010
know because she paid with a pen instead of credit and then his thoughts

829
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.770
naturally and turned to his Goto nonsexual fantasy weed.

830
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.353
He isn't.

831
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.380
He's envisioning like laying down in the sprawling fields of the marijuana farms

832
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:42.550
of Northern California but she keeps stumping in even though it is goto fantasy

833
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.480
even though it is his goto fantasy,
James is aware that it is pretty boring.

834
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.810
More interesting things tend to intrude like fantasizing about laying down in a

835
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:53.290
field of wheat crops.
It's like licking the centerfold of an issue of high times.

836
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.930
He just keeps thinking like New York City,

837
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.780
her and a dog and a cat in a car for a week.

838
00:47:58.781 --> 00:48:03.781
What the fuck is Reggaeton Trans?

839
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.400
It's weird that he could tell that she was trans.

840
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:09.760
You could tell but not and like an obvious way.
Like if a drag queen came,

841
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:10.780
parading up the aisle,

842
00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:13.030
you couldn't really tell from the way she looked or the way she talked or

843
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:17.710
anything probably.
But then you have to ask yourself like,
well how could I tell?

844
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:21.590
It was probably some combination of things,
but could other people tell it?

845
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.610
Was he going to have that or was he going to have to have stupid conversations

846
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:28.480
for the next three months with idiot coworkers about the freaky queer that was

847
00:48:28.481 --> 00:48:32.050
in the store that one time.
Gross.
Weird.

848
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.773
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

849
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.350
[inaudible]

850
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.160
<v 5>hi everyone.
I'm Casey Plat and the last one,</v>

851
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:46.120
and I'm going to read a story out of this book that I just wrote called the safe

852
00:48:46.121 --> 00:48:46.631
girl to love,

853
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:49.060
which is a collection of short stories are all about young trans women.

854
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.450
And I'm going to read a story that part of the story,

855
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:57.090
couple of excerpts that I haven't read yet.
Um,

856
00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:02.530
uh,
what's a story called winning and it is set in Eugene,
Oregon,

857
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.000
um,
out in the northwest and it is about a girl and her mom.

858
00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:18.590
It's going to start at the beginning.
So
he's shivering.

859
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:23.030
Zoe thought as she came in Robin's bedroom and saw his tall Muslim pudge body

860
00:49:23.031 --> 00:49:25.340
vibrating on the bed,
blanket on the floor.

861
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.530
She made to Tuck the blanket back over him.

862
00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.280
When she saw his face was contorted and his lips were moving like waves.

863
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.151
She said,
hey,

864
00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:35.780
and softly rocky shoulder Robin gasps and his face turned it instantly blind.

865
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.800
Hey,
I'm sorry to wake you.
It's okay.
He said he stretched in his boxers,

866
00:49:39.801 --> 00:49:43.640
made a roughly noise in the sheets you leaving?
He said,
yeah.
She said,

867
00:49:43.641 --> 00:49:47.390
thanks for letting me crash.
Definitely.
Boy,
he on,
I feel fucked up.

868
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.670
Robin finished most of make them last night.

869
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:54.050
Zoe had two glasses and switch to milk.
She loves milk.
She giggled and said,
aw,

870
00:49:54.051 --> 00:49:56.150
and must is wavy brown hair.
It was silly.

871
00:49:56.151 --> 00:49:59.300
She realized walking outside and zipping her hoodie up over her dress,

872
00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.940
but she had forgotten that boys even had nightmares at all.

873
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.640
It was mid November when in the Pacific northwest,

874
00:50:04.641 --> 00:50:07.790
the Panorama of clouds stop flirting with the sky and moved in and set their

875
00:50:07.791 --> 00:50:11.270
parking brakes until Mary,
a soft Ms Patter of rain was coming down.

876
00:50:11.271 --> 00:50:14.150
A Zooey walked down the motel like stairs,
a province complex.

877
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.240
Then over to Eugene station,
take the 66 bucks north.

878
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.780
She got on and texted her best friend,
Giulia back in New York.
Hi.

879
00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:22.940
She said you're beautiful and I miss you to fucking pieces.

880
00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.940
When she got off the bus and walk up to Iris Road,
the rain had stopped,

881
00:50:25.941 --> 00:50:29.960
but the sky was still an pearl gray.
Zoe hated this humans,

882
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:32.000
I'm supposed to go months with all their sunlight broken.

883
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.670
She thought she had actually loved the winters in New York.

884
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.920
Everyone they're complaining about gray,
but to Zoe,

885
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.920
New York had been sunny and bright back at her mom's.

886
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:41.570
The boxes in the kitchen hadn't moved.

887
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.940
There was a note on the counter which said,

888
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.970
I've gone to the farmer's market when last time I need everything out of your

889
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:51.380
room tonight.
Well,
that was in New York class.
She still had a week to stay here,

890
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.800
but whatever.
She went into her room and resume clearing out her shit.

891
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.210
You can build up so much stuff.

892
00:50:56.211 --> 00:50:58.190
When you have a room in a house you don't actually live in.

893
00:50:58.191 --> 00:51:00.320
She thought and so he'd always been a pack rat.

894
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.230
Even as a teenager she would save a lot of the things that you thought.

895
00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:04.940
Regular families safe for their kids,

896
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.970
but you don't know so that stuff now though,
and there are only a few boxes left,

897
00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:11.360
orderly C's of social studies,
papers,
choir programs and stuff like that.

898
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:15.350
Sandy came home as though he was smashing a basketball sized paper Wad into the

899
00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:19.430
recycling.
I bought some fruit for you.
Her mother said,
I'm not hungry.
Said Zoe,

900
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.540
don't give me that.
Have you eaten?
I don't want any fruit.
Thanks Sandy.

901
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:26.420
Wash bag of Bartlett pears and plunked it tripping on the counter.

902
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:30.320
She put her elbows beside the big and massage your eyes better to tell me the

903
00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:33.530
truth.
Don't you think?
Ever since,
so he transitioned.

904
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.470
Sandy had become convinced that her daughter would develop an eating disorder.

905
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.620
Those Zoe was eating as little as ever,
you know.
Thanks mom.
So he said,

906
00:51:39.621 --> 00:51:41.630
I'm not hungry.
Zoe is,
Sandy said,

907
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:43.580
the last thing I want to do is have to make you eat.

908
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:47.600
It's not like I like having this conversation.
Sandy was trans too,

909
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:52.040
so we could come up to her exactly 18 months ago on the phone from her Brooklyn

910
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:55.370
apartment after she'd already been on hormones for awhile.
She meticulously,

911
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.610
she'd meticulously taken steps to avoid telling her and when she had,

912
00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:01.600
her mother had cried and cried and cried her phone pulsed.

913
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.430
And so each site and other texts from Juliette,
you're beautiful,
I miss you.

914
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.160
And so he picked up the biggest pair and took a Gargantuan bite.

915
00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.320
What do you need help with next?
She asked,

916
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.730
Sandy had done a lot to have Zoe with Sandy,
his wife at the time.
Taher.

917
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.600
This was back in the mid Eighties Sandy,

918
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.200
the center for chest certificates to the clinic where she banged her sperm,

919
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.200
who then sent the samples to a friend of Tay is a nurse practitioner who then

920
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:23.780
helped within seven eight and this is on the planes for Sandy.

921
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:24.740
And Tay had grown up.

922
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.250
They moved to Oregon to have Zoe who was born downtown in an apartment off

923
00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:29.084
eighth avenue.

924
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:32.540
So He loved this story as he never got tired of telling us her friends back
east.

925
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.690
She liked to say that she had been born loved though Taylor left both of them

926
00:52:35.691 --> 00:52:38.840
when Zooey was eight and sandy had not always been the most stable if mothers.

927
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.960
So he had always felt acres of love.

928
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.200
Can you go through the closet in the spare room?
Sandy said,
no problem.
Said so,

929
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:48.710
hey,
have another pair if you want it.
They're completely yours.

930
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.870
Sandy called after her so he didn't respond.

931
00:52:50.871 --> 00:52:53.630
So she got out pita bread and Hummus and went to her desk in the living room to

932
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:55.730
do paperwork.
She passed.
Well,

933
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:58.190
her mother did and so he had always admired for her that.

934
00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:01.220
And now that she herself a transition,
she especially admired it.
Now,

935
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:02.150
in the old days,

936
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:05.210
no one had known about sandy and with her being six one and broad shouldered and

937
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:08.620
poor is that he thought it really couldn't have been easy.
I always wore jeans.

938
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:12.470
Sandy told Zoe wants when Zoe's 17 it had been the fifth anniversary of Sandy's

939
00:53:12.471 --> 00:53:15.320
bottom surgery and she'd been unusually talkative about the subject.

940
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:16.490
I always wear jeans.

941
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:19.730
She said almost never skirts or dresses because Justin People's heads

942
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:23.330
subconsciously,
the idea of trainees wearing jeans doesn't Mesh.

943
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.700
Zoe had listened to this rapidly.
They said,
I looked manage San Diego,

944
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:28.140
but they never thought I was a man.

945
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.960
I tricked him and she sounded like she was floating.
She said,
you know,

946
00:53:30.961 --> 00:53:34.110
they just passed me off as some big earthy dyke.
Well,
you know,
that's okay.

947
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.030
From very early in her childhood.
So he knew that sandy had one slid as a man.

948
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:40.980
Neither of her mother's had hidden it from her,

949
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:44.100
but it was also understood to be a buried subject,
something gravely serious,

950
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:46.320
as though he was never supposed to talk or ask about.

951
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.010
I did have some really pretty dresses.
Sandy had said in the conversation,

952
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.580
but I had to be very careful about wearing them.
I just had to be careful.

953
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.300
They moved out to the apartment off eighth when Zoe was in third grade.

954
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:00.360
It had been right after Taylor left and right when sandy got her job with the

955
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:01.020
county.

956
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.990
That's when they got one of the few bungalows left along Ayers on the north edge

957
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:05.460
of town,
just shy of the city line.

958
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.130
Sandy was from the country and she missed the stars.

959
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.590
She said she missed the stars and the quiet.

960
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

961
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.080
<v 5>Skipping to another section more middle eighth today.
This the story.</v>

962
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:19.921
Okay,
so now he's that way.

963
00:54:19.921 --> 00:54:22.560
He's just gotten a job at a call center doing surveys and this is her first day

964
00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:23.394
at work.

965
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:29.060
On the third call she stuttered a bit because the man on the phone,

966
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:32.780
certainly dairy farmer outside Pacific city sounded exactly like a man she'd

967
00:54:32.781 --> 00:54:33.710
known back in New York,

968
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:37.160
a guy with layered blonde hair who ran a bar in Williamsburg wallpapered with

969
00:54:37.161 --> 00:54:40.460
covers of Gattis books.
They had gone out for dinner,
then out dancing.

970
00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.420
The man had been amazingly charming gentleman me.
She accepted all of the drinks.

971
00:54:44.421 --> 00:54:45.590
He bought her and back at his place,

972
00:54:45.591 --> 00:54:47.930
he began squeezing her nipples and stuffing his hands south.

973
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.130
And her last memory was as much really shaking her head,
wait,
hold on.
I like you.

974
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.980
I want to.
It's like,
wait.
And when she woke up,

975
00:54:54.981 --> 00:54:58.130
she was on his bed alone and he was at his desk on his computer,

976
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.950
and those sides of her bottom had a dull vomit spring lake.

977
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.760
How many milk giving cows did you say?
Said Zoe.
Now,
I'm sorry.

978
00:55:04.761 --> 00:55:07.700
Including heifers that are not yet.
52 said the man.
Now,

979
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:11.060
do you have at this time or do I need to repeat it again?
You tell me here.

980
00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.130
And so he said,
yes,
of course.
Of course,
sir.

981
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:17.000
And by nine o'clock so he had covered this scratch paper on her office desk with

982
00:55:17.001 --> 00:55:18.800
black and white penciled swirls and shapes,

983
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.550
criss crossing paisleys and hectic grandson.

984
00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:25.130
Triple Helix is on the outlines of faces.
Some of the faces resembled her mom,

985
00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.293
<v 1>her mom.</v>

986
00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.710
<v 5>So we had always seen her mother is deadly gorgeous.</v>

987
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:33.950
She had short coiffed ash blonde hair like Sharon Stone and casino without the

988
00:55:33.951 --> 00:55:37.580
rat tail.
She wear blue or green skinny jeans,
tank tops,
which shiny satin edge.

989
00:55:37.581 --> 00:55:41.300
I said edges that showed up lightly muscled swimmers arms and long earrings

990
00:55:41.301 --> 00:55:44.510
that's scattered around her colorbond wherever she moved her head in winter,

991
00:55:44.511 --> 00:55:47.570
she worked cable and separate hoodies and Zoe on the other hand kept her hair

992
00:55:47.571 --> 00:55:49.400
black like dresses with stripes or Polka dots.

993
00:55:49.401 --> 00:55:51.860
See through glasses ever camisoles the patterns sweater,

994
00:55:51.861 --> 00:55:55.220
tights in winter she spent through tubes that eyeliner and Lipstick Sandy,

995
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:57.350
maybe you still a little mascara once in a while.

996
00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.130
Even as though he took no part of her own style from her if she had to be
honest.

997
00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.660
So dressed a bit like our other Meyer,

998
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.900
other mother Tonya who now spoiled here with clothes on visits.

999
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:10.340
Zoe did admire the wave.
Sandy looked,
she admired a lot about her mother really.

1000
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:14.210
She admired the way she hadn't hid from Zooey the pain of Taya leaving her,

1001
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:18.500
but she rarely bad most or castigated Taya herself and given the ta had to party

1002
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:19.311
with the load of their money.

1003
00:56:19.311 --> 00:56:21.770
And a note including the words like anyone else would have loved you.

1004
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:23.090
She would have had plenty of reason.

1005
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:26.140
She admired how sandy treated Zoe's boyfriends in high school.

1006
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:29.620
The one she'd drag up from south of the UFO cause no gay boys were out of her

1007
00:56:29.621 --> 00:56:32.950
own school and how sandy you welcomed them and cook for them even when sometimes

1008
00:56:32.951 --> 00:56:33.940
they were snotty to her.

1009
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.790
She admired the sex talk sandy had given her when she was really young,

1010
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:38.670
before puberty,
sandy had told her,

1011
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:42.220
now this is a thing that teenagers and adults like to do and they get to do.

1012
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.820
Kids don't,
it's not a kid thing.
You don't even want to do it and you shouldn't,

1013
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.020
but this will happen.
What will happen when you're older and it can be wonderful,

1014
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:51.460
but it is important.
You're safe.

1015
00:56:51.461 --> 00:56:54.550
There's a safe way to do it in an unsafe way and it's like driving without a

1016
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:57.250
seatbelt where something bad happens,
you can die,
but if you're safe,

1017
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:57.941
it gives you freedom.

1018
00:56:57.941 --> 00:57:00.880
You can't imagine the happiness and the freedom when you're older.

1019
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:02.470
I will help you and we can talk about it.

1020
00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:03.850
This is something that I want you to do,
right?

1021
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:05.500
And it's something that I want you to look forward to.

1022
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.220
I want us to be a good and healthy part of your life.
She had said,

1023
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.440
and so we really admired that,

1024
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.350
especially when she found out about all of Sandy's friends who died or in what

1025
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:16.330
she'd only for referred to as the plague.

1026
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:18.730
So he had remembered a few of them from when she was a kid,

1027
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:22.990
but only faintly and only a few.
Thanks for your time sir.

1028
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:25.770
So he said to her last call.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good night man.

1029
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.700
The man grumbled Zooey folded the drawing.

1030
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:30.460
She made thought of sticking them in her bag and then drop them in the trash.

1031
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:34.660
Not the recycling,
the trash.
So New York,
Huh?

1032
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:37.450
The supervisor asked as they left their building together after the work.

1033
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.930
After work.
Sorry,
why'd you come here?

1034
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:44.980
Zoe was really tired of answering that question and lately she's just been

1035
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:45.550
snapping.

1036
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.490
I'm helping my mom in a tone that made everyone think her mom had a deadly

1037
00:57:48.491 --> 00:57:51.340
illness and needed,
so either tend to her last days or something.

1038
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.960
It usually got people to leave her alone.

1039
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:57.030
But when she said that now who supervised Subaru?
Ooh,
Ooh.

1040
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.950
Too much coffee.
But when she said that now her supervisor just said,
Huh,

1041
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:05.860
do you like it here though?
Like do you think you want to stay here in Eugene?

1042
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:11.260
So he considered how to answer that to a stranger.
Well,
I grew up here.

1043
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:15.520
She said softly walking down darkened slick Willamette street with their hoodie

1044
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:16.840
up in the sprinkle Mr Rein.

1045
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.900
It occurred to her that she'd walked these streets late often since coming back,

1046
00:58:19.901 --> 00:58:22.930
but hadn't been propositioned to harassed once and Eugene or be made to feel

1047
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:25.930
that safe in any way.
Really.
When Zooey was a kid,

1048
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:27.340
she thought she looked in a great town.

1049
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:29.320
She thought no place was better than this little city.

1050
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.150
A Term Taya had liked to use.
Oh,

1051
00:58:31.151 --> 00:58:33.400
this little city is though he didn't like the neighborhood.

1052
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:36.400
They'd ended up in a weird little bumpkin and religious yuppy enclave,

1053
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.320
but she loved downtown and she left the Ufo and she even loved the dumb

1054
00:58:39.321 --> 00:58:42.610
political battles that played out in the city bike paths to the Catholic school.

1055
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:45.160
The cross Skinner's dispute where to build a new hospital.

1056
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:48.640
All the little clashes between right and left hippies and Mormon Mormon's

1057
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:49.960
developers and virus.

1058
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:53.680
It had felt like that's stupid idea of what America was supposed to be and no

1059
00:58:53.681 --> 00:58:54.491
one was from there.

1060
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:57.580
It was a place that you moved to even from middle school on and it seemed like

1061
00:58:57.581 --> 00:58:58.420
being born in town,

1062
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:02.230
put her in the minority and when she was a teenager leaving just didn't occur to

1063
00:59:02.231 --> 00:59:05.830
her like,
why would you do that if you are lucky enough to be from here?

1064
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.230
She thought when she left home,

1065
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.330
she just get a room in a house back downtown by the Weill Hall and go be a

1066
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:13.630
stupid duck for four years,
then get a job and a little house of her own.

1067
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.390
Then there should be there she be,
as her mom would say,

1068
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:20.140
in one of her few kept Midwestern isms and so he was rarely bitter about being

1069
00:59:20.141 --> 00:59:23.490
trans.
If you needed to believe in the possibility of unmetered Trans Women,

1070
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:26.840
Zoe would be your girl,
but she knew she wouldn't have left.

1071
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:29.300
If it hadn't been for that,
she would've stayed.

1072
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:31.520
She would have gone to the country fair,
signed on with the Co op,

1073
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:34.640
checked in on her mom live the beautiful new liberal American life.

1074
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.070
It had been so close hell on the face of it.

1075
00:59:37.071 --> 00:59:40.370
The town that's current era had been designed specifically for someone like her,

1076
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:42.000
like who else,
if not for the fag,

1077
00:59:42.001 --> 00:59:45.020
Kate of a woman like sandy queer and transplanted and the hippy to boot.

1078
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.420
So we had really always thought it was a great town.

1079
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:50.000
She'd never hated that growing up,
ever,
ever,
ever.

1080
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.420
But she knew that staying meant a boy.
Future,
a pretend to be CIS future.

1081
00:59:53.421 --> 00:59:55.460
She didn't have the strength to figure out the gender thing you're on.

1082
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.280
Everyone she'd known and she known that in part from her mom.

1083
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.860
You couldn't transition and keep everything else in your life the same.

1084
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:02.690
It couldn't happen.
She tested it.

1085
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.840
If it one summer by telling a few friends about sandy the one she thought in

1086
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:08.810
react the best and the looks on their faces,

1087
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:11.660
especially her boyfriends of revulsion of horror,

1088
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.080
the things they said about her mother.
One just said simple,
dumb stuff like,

1089
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:19.910
Oh groceries,
your dad,
that is fuck up.
That is fucked up.
And another said,
Huh,

1090
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.610
well she was too pretty to actually be real anyway.
Hey,

1091
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.030
maybe he'll be a penguin next huh.
Though the worst was a girl,

1092
01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:29.000
a close friend who looked ashen and said,
you know,
it sucks.

1093
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.360
I knew she had problems,
but I still looked up to her as a strong woman.

1094
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.550
I thought I had this strong woman in my life.

1095
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.380
I thought you had this strong mother.

1096
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:40.550
So he climbed out about telling clammed up about telling anyone after that she

1097
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:43.790
didn't even mention it to Frankie and old best friend of hers.

1098
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:47.600
And so when fall came and she applied for and speaking to a fancy school in the

1099
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:50.750
east coast,
she saw for the first time in her town and void and less black,

1100
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:53.900
she'll be forever grateful.
She grew up there.
But the future we saw it was,

1101
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:57.620
she saw it was for some willowy gay kid.
Lovely but not her.

1102
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.650
And everyone's fucking attitudes about trans stuff changes so quickly.

1103
01:01:00.651 --> 01:01:03.290
After a few years,
Chaz Thomas Beatie,
all those fucks.

1104
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.700
Had she been born five years later,

1105
01:01:04.701 --> 01:01:07.100
she thought some time that she might've felt like she could have stayed.

1106
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.790
So Zoe was bitter about that.

1107
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.380
She looked away from her supervisor and adjusted her bag.
I don't mind it.

1108
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.660
She said quietly,
there's a lot of worse places to be.

1109
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:21.410
Oh Jesus said the supervisor,
you have no idea.
I love it here.

1110
01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.650
And he started talking about his hometown in Arizona and how there were grocery

1111
01:01:24.651 --> 01:01:26.000
stores and bars here in Eugene.

1112
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:27.830
He just loved and you'd never find that where he was from.

1113
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:29.780
And it's even the people were so nice,

1114
01:01:29.781 --> 01:01:32.390
like they gave a shit about being humans here.
You know,

1115
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.500
he had great eyes and the kind of sparkle as he talk.
So he said,
uh Huh.
Totally.

1116
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.000
And decided to picture this guy.

1117
01:01:38.001 --> 01:01:40.820
Al Lube didn't naked until it got to the bus station where she returned some

1118
01:01:40.821 --> 01:01:45.200
techs and her supervisor got on the 24 going somewhere south.
Thank you.

1119
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.120
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
