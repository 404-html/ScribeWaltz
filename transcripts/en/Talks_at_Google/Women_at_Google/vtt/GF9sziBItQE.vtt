1
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.030
Okay.

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.500
<v 1>Good afternoon and welcome to talks at Google in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.</v>

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.610
Today it's my great pleasure to introduce Beth Shapiro.

4
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.520
Dr Shapiro is here today to discuss her book,
how to clone a mammoth,

5
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.380
the science of de Extinction.

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.080
We have the science today to restore extinct species to life,

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.890
but should we be ethical?
Challenges are enormous.

8
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.660
Using DNA collected from remains as a genetic blueprint.

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.260
Scientists aim to engineer extinct traits,

10
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.560
traits that evolve by natural selection over thousands of years into living

11
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:48.650
organisms,

12
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.320
but rather than viewing de extinction as a way to restore one particular
species,

13
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.210
she argues with the overarching goal should be to the revitalization and

14
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:02.750
stabilization of Contemporary Echo Systems.

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.020
Doctor Sapiro is an evolutionary biologist who integrates molecular

16
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:14.021
phylogenetics with advanced computational bio statistics to reconstruct the

17
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:19.691
influences on population dynamics in a wide variety of organisms.

18
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.320
She is associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.

19
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.480
Her work has appeared in numerous publications including nature and science and

20
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:35.960
she was a 2009 MacArthur foundation fellow.

21
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.140
Please join me in welcoming Beth Shapiro.

22
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.480
<v 0>Thank you.
Well,</v>

23
00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:48.130
thank you very much for inviting me to come here and for taking the time out of

24
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.230
your busy and hectic days to come and listen to me,

25
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:52.030
especially after David did coffee,

26
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.590
who I'm sure it was quite entertaining and maybe probably more entertaining than

27
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:59.380
I can possibly be.
So let's just leave it at that,
right?

28
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.810
I thought we'd begin with a video that kind of explains what I do when I'm in

29
00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:08.050
the field.
So the quality of the sound is a little bit poor,

30
00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:11.140
but the video is kind of neat.
So bear with me here for just a sec.

31
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.060
<v 2>Just found,
you can see one,
two,
three,</v>

32
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.310
four pieces here.
This is hard.
So you can see how big.

33
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.540
The neat thing about this is that these are the small pieces,

34
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.140
which means that this stuff is washed downstream.

35
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.650
These pieces are actually still frozen in the permafrost.

36
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.140
You can't get them down the goal.
You're going to be really well preserved.

37
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.750
Just heard that big splash of water back there.

38
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.050
Here comes the water.
We better get outta here.

39
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.220
So

40
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.850
<v 0>that last part is a little bit ridiculous,
but in my defense,</v>

41
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.740
the water is really gross.
Like what that is,
that's um,

42
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.300
active plaster mining gold binding sites up near Dawson City in Canada's Yukon

43
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.880
territory.
So during the spring when the snow melts,

44
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.390
the miners collect all the water in these big holding ponds and then they pump

45
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.950
it up to whatever they're trying to wash away that permafrost and they wash away

46
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.470
whatever thought and then let it stop for a bit,

47
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.350
let the next little few inches thought,
and then wash that away.

48
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.920
Their goal is to get rid of the,

49
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.660
all of that permafrost to get to the gold bearing gravels beneath.

50
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.020
But while they're doing that,
we find hundreds,
thousands,

51
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.400
sometimes tens of thousands of these bones that are incredibly well preserved

52
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.990
and we bring them back to the lab and use them for research.
So I'm a biologist.

53
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.880
I'm an evolutionary biologist or a geneticist or molecular paleontologist.

54
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.710
Lots of ways to describe that,

55
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:48.700
including some new ones that were used in the introduction just a moment ago.
Um,

56
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.050
so what,
what does a biologist wants to do with frozen bones?

57
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.750
Collected from the permafrost?
Well,

58
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.820
my research is actually focused on trying to understand how populations and

59
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.540
communities and ecosystems respond to rapid,

60
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:06.940
large scale changes in climate in the present day.

61
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:10.510
So when we see and hear about climate change going on today,

62
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:14.830
often what we hear about are large scale changes in precipitation patterns that

63
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:16.450
change the distribution of water,

64
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.070
maybe differences in storms and of course species that are on the verge of

65
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:25.120
extinction.
And when we hear about this stuff reported by the popular press,

66
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.870
often we're just told that everything is going to hell in a handbasket right?

67
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.890
But if you're a biologist and you want to avoid some of these particularly dire,

68
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.660
dire predictions here,

69
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.860
you might want to understand or be able to predict in some useful way.

70
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.970
How will the species and communities that we're trying to protect are going to

71
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:47.971
respond for the change and the climate that's predicted for the next decade to

72
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.710
century.
So if you keep up with the climate change literature at all,

73
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:54.250
you'll no doubt be familiar with this particular graph here or something similar

74
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.310
to this.
This is,
um,
Michael Mann's hockey stick graph.

75
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.970
It's called a hockey stick graph because it kind of looks like a hockey stick

76
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.270
laying on its side.
Here's the end of the stick and the part that goes up here.

77
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.220
This is the average temperature around 1960 and this is really just a plot of

78
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:12.790
how that temperature has changed over the last thousand years.

79
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.920
So you see the temperature remained pretty constant,

80
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.280
maybe declining a little bit through time until a couple of hundred years ago

81
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.320
when it shot up pretty quickly.

82
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.040
Now this plot can be extended into the future and we see all sorts of

83
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.450
predictions of climate increasing the temperature increasing exponentially

84
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.870
throughout the next 50 years to 100 years.
Of course,

85
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.250
this is not the first time in Earth's recent history that the planet has

86
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:39.340
experienced a really rapid increase in temperature.

87
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.790
If we extend this plot backward to the last 50,000 years,

88
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.800
we see an interval right here in between around 18,000 years ago and maybe 12 or

89
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.180
13,000 years ago when the average global temperature increased by about eight

90
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:55.090
degrees.
This here is only about one and a half degrees.

91
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:56.680
This is an eight degree increase.

92
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.860
Some of the work that we're doing right now is suggesting that this last period

93
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.570
of really rapid increase,

94
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.890
this is the transition from the peak of the last ice age into the Holocene warm

95
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:08.720
interval that we're experiencing today.

96
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.340
This last period possibly happened over less than a hundred years or even as

97
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.720
quickly as a few decades.

98
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.810
So this is a very rapid period of widespread global warming that's going to be

99
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.990
associated with all sorts of changes in temperature and precipitation and

100
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:27.860
changes to the biological species that are living out there.

101
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.220
So what I tried to do with my research is asked the question,

102
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.140
how did species and communities and populations and ecosystems change,

103
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.280
uh,
in response to this past period of rapid climate change?

104
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:44.180
And is there anything that we can use from learning about what happened in the

105
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:49.040
past to make better decisions about how to spend the limited time and energy and

106
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.130
resources?
We have to conserve species today.

107
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.860
So the field I work in is called ancient DNA.

108
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:59.060
It's pretty clear what ancient DNA means.
Means old DNA,
not old people DNA,

109
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:01.850
but actually really old DNA like mammoths preserved in ice.

110
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.940
I work at a place called Beringia.

111
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.330
Berenjena spans this kind of part of Alaska here across the Bering land bridge

112
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:09.770
into eastern Siberia.

113
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.760
All of this white stuff here is just an indication that the,
the,

114
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.320
it's not as deep in the ocean there.
So when the,
during the ice ages,

115
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:22.400
when much of the water on the planet was taken up into making giant glaciers

116
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:25.550
sitting on top of the continents,
this was actually exposed.

117
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:26.690
This was exposed land.

118
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:31.370
And this of course is a very important corridor for movement of many species,

119
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:33.410
camels and horses going in this direction.

120
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.540
Bison and people going in this direction to move between the two continents.

121
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.400
So today Bringi looks like this.

122
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:43.850
I'm actually in that helicopter taking this picture and I'll show you a picture

123
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:47.450
of that fantastic flying machine in just a moment.
And it looks like this,

124
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.520
but in the past and during the last ice age,

125
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:54.521
it looked more like this with a very rich and diverse plant community that was

126
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:59.630
grazed on by rich and diverse herbivore community that was haunted by lots of

127
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.160
different types of carnivores.

128
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:05.900
There were mammoths and mastodons at various times and North American camels,

129
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:09.050
several different species of big cat that were giant bears.

130
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.490
Arcadis that if it's stood up was 16 feet tall and there was even a giant

131
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:18.050
Campbell,
uh,
sorry,
a giant beaver that was the same size as me,

132
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.750
which is I'm the funniest extinct animal.

133
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.030
So we fly out here in this fantastic flying machine.

134
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:27.800
You'll notice that there are some windows missing,

135
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:31.910
which is great in case anybody wants to smoke on board and celebration of taking

136
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.850
off.
I'm not saying that happened,
but I'm not saying it didn't.

137
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.210
Then we stay in five star combination.
As you can see here,

138
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:42.260
this is a picture that I took of my tent by backing up and unfocusing my camera

139
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:46.850
lens that I could really get a picture of the depth of field of mosquitoes that

140
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:50.990
we were dealing with up there in the Arctic and we walk along all sorts of

141
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.740
places,
wherever the permafrost is thawing like these plaster mining sites.

142
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:57.000
This is again back in Dawson city.

143
00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:59.850
The previous pictures were from the time your peninsula and north central

144
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.160
Siberia.
This is a,
again,

145
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:05.310
an active mining site where you see them washing down the permafrost in here,

146
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:09.720
my folks kind of wandering around waiting to pick up bones that are coming out

147
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.430
as the dirt washes away,

148
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.500
so in a day out in the field will generally collect anywhere between five and 20

149
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:20.400
bags of bones like this.
Most of the bones there are bison.

150
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.430
There are also mammoth and Caribou and horses and sometimes we get lucky and get

151
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:30.150
wolves or bears or lions,
and we take a piece out of these bones,

152
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:33.750
a tiny piece that's just a regular dremmel tool with little cutting desk and

153
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:37.230
bring that piece back to the lab,
grinded up and extract DNA.

154
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.540
And then we correlate the amount of genetic diversity that we observe in any

155
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:47.130
species at one point in time with the size of the population.
So in essence,

156
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:51.720
we can use DNA extracted from thousands of these bones to learn how populations

157
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:54.990
were growing or shrinking or moving across the landscape,

158
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:59.130
or whether there were local extinctions followed by replacements of populations

159
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.510
coming in from somewhere else.

160
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.590
And we've learned an awful lot of stuff over the last couple of decades of doing

161
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:05.580
this.
For example,

162
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:10.530
we've learned that bison horses and mammoths all peaked in population size

163
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:13.620
around 40,000 years ago and then started to decline.

164
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.000
And this is interesting because two of the main hypotheses about what caused the

165
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:22.140
mega fano mass extinction at the end of the pleistocene when we did lose

166
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.000
mammoths and many other of these big species were that they didn't like the peak

167
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:27.870
of the last ice age.

168
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.200
It was too cold and too terrible for them or that people turned up and hunted

169
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:36.180
them to death.
But at the initial decline begins about 30,000 years ago.

170
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:41.181
That's 10,000 years before the peak of the last ice age and 15,000 years before

171
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:43.950
any evidence of large numbers of humans in North America.

172
00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:47.250
So it looks like we're off the hook for the beginning of these extinctions,

173
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:51.090
although I'm quite willing to let us off the hook for the ultimate extinction

174
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:52.620
event of many of these species.

175
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.570
We've watched carnivore populations grow and move in response to changes in the

176
00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:59.820
dynamics of the herbivores that they prayed on.

177
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.540
And we're starting to learn why some species like Caribou survived.

178
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.810
They like to live where humans didn't,
which is a pretty good trick.

179
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:12.110
And other species like cave lions when extinct and I and colleagues who work on

180
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:16.080
this stuff often get to publish these papers and pretty high profile journals.

181
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.350
They get lots of press attention and people care.
People are really interested.

182
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:19.801
They call.

183
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:23.910
I'm often really excited to talk about what we've learned and how it applies to

184
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.670
present day problems and biodiversity conservation,

185
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.670
but they only ever really asked me one question

186
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.130
and it's kind of annoying

187
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.330
and since there really is no sound bite size response to this,

188
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.390
I decided to write this book,
right?
So the field,

189
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.170
the field of bringing extinct species are extinct traits back to life has come

190
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:48.120
to be known as de extinction.

191
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:51.750
Now we're all partly familiar with de extinction because we were there when it

192
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.890
happened the first time and we know what happens.

193
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.920
We know it all went off without a hitch.
Everything was perfectly good,
right?

194
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.300
Yeah,
we remember this,

195
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.560
but today we're not going to talk about dinosaurs because we can't clone

196
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:06.640
dinosaurs.
There are no dinosaur bones that contain DNA.
They're all rocks.

197
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.080
There's no DNA in rocks regardless of what you read in high profile.

198
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.460
Nice publications like science and nature.
There's no DNA in dinosaurs.

199
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.490
You heard it here,
right?
So how are we going to bring back a mammoth?

200
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:21.340
We know there's DNA in mammoths,
right?
The first step,

201
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:23.170
the first thing that everybody thinks we're going to do,

202
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.260
the first process that's proposed is,
let's clone it.

203
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:28.780
Let's clone a mammoth.
Well,

204
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:32.020
cloning is actually a specific scientific process,

205
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:37.021
a specific type of work that's actually known as somatic cell nuclear transfer.

206
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.020
So in ourselves we basically have two different kinds of cells,
germline cells,

207
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:44.530
which are sperm and eggs and somatic cells,
which are everything else.

208
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.100
What normally happens?
A sperm and an egg come together,
fertilized,

209
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.830
create a small thing as I go.

210
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.860
And that differentiates and that particular cell that they create has the power

211
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:58.150
to become any type of cell in a whole body pair cells,
skin cells,
heart cells,

212
00:12:58.151 --> 00:12:58.721
liver cells,

213
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:02.980
every type of cell there is somatic cells already know what their job is and

214
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:04.450
they can't do anything else.

215
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.220
So the idea of somatic cell nuclear transfer is to trick a somatic cell into

216
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:14.221
forgetting all the instructions necessary to be that type of cell and to revert

217
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.610
into a state where it can actually then become every type of cell in the body

218
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:20.590
and create a whole being.

219
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.880
So the most famous in the first example of somatic cell nuclear transfer was an

220
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.730
experiment in the mid 1990s that brought us Dolly the sheep.

221
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.560
Probably everybody's heard of this,
right?

222
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.180
This was worked by the Roslyn Institute Scotland.
And they took a somatic cell.

223
00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:37.870
In this case,
it was a mammary cell from an adult sheep.
Uh,

224
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:41.470
you and they take,
took those cells and basically starved them.

225
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:44.770
They starve them of nutrients in a dish,
in a lab.
At the same time,

226
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:48.790
they took an egg cell from a different breed of sheep and they removed the

227
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:52.200
nucleus,
all the genetic material from that unfertilized egg.

228
00:13:52.201 --> 00:13:53.950
So you had an egg with nothing in it.

229
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.710
And a bill starves starved cells right here.

230
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.460
Put them next to each other as zap him with electricity.
The membrane bursts.

231
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:02.470
The nucleus here dumps into this cell.

232
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.880
Zap It again and the proteins in that egg is somehow cause the genetic material

233
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:10.900
from that somatic cell that's been stressed out to forget all the instructions

234
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:15.580
and turn into the type of cell that can become everything in a particular
animal.

235
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.600
This is then implanted into surrogate host who was yet another species of sheep

236
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.620
or breed of sheep.

237
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:25.330
And eventually Dolly was born and Dolly was a genetic clone of the memory cell

238
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:30.331
donor and not avoided the egg cell donor or this surrogate mom easy.

239
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.660
So how do we do with a mammoth,
right?

240
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.980
Well we go out in the field and we find one of these fantastically preserved

241
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:38.780
mammoths and we removed some cells and then we stress them out.

242
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.530
Then we stick those cells in the nucleus of an egg and it doesn't that little

243
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:43.900
magic thing.
And then we stick it inside an elephant and you know,

244
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:48.590
grows up into be a baby,
release it.
And it's called wood.
Right?
Right.

245
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.170
Yup.
Here we have our first problem.

246
00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.870
So we do find a lot of incredibly WellPreserved remains up in the Arctic.

247
00:15:00.871 --> 00:15:01.770
This is an example.

248
00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:06.540
This is a a horse jaw that we found up in the permafrost near Dawson city that

249
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:09.720
dates to some time in the last hundred thousand years or so.

250
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.620
This is one of the very many WellPreserved mummy's that's been found in Siberia

251
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:17.280
and a couple summers ago there was a report of this incredibly WellPreserved and

252
00:15:17.281 --> 00:15:21.600
mummy that was associated with what looked like a viscous read material that

253
00:15:21.601 --> 00:15:23.550
they thought might be blood right,

254
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.970
but regardless of how well preserved these things are,

255
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.060
there is not going to be a living cell to be found in any remains of any

256
00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:34.560
mammoth.
Once an organism dies,

257
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.850
the cells and the DNA within them begins to get broken down into smaller and

258
00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:41.550
smaller pieces almost immediately.
First,

259
00:15:41.551 --> 00:15:45.180
it's enzymes within our own body that chop up the DNA.
If you're a mummy,

260
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.680
you might have the guts burst and then all of that microbiome that lives in

261
00:15:49.681 --> 00:15:49.831
there,

262
00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:53.100
it's going to circulate throughout the system and those are living microbes that

263
00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:57.270
will just catabolize eat up.
That DNA son is particularly bad.

264
00:15:57.271 --> 00:16:00.930
Uv light will hit those mummies just like it hits us when we're alive and we

265
00:16:00.931 --> 00:16:04.830
walk outside.
But unlike us,
the mummies are dead or the bones are dead.

266
00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:08.790
So there's no proofreading mechanism to fix the damage caused by solar,

267
00:16:08.791 --> 00:16:12.300
radiation,
water,
hydrologist,
hydrolysis,
oxygen.

268
00:16:12.301 --> 00:16:15.420
All these things are terrible for DNA survival.
And in fact,

269
00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:19.530
the DNA begins to break down immediately and it's eventually broken down to a

270
00:16:19.531 --> 00:16:23.820
state where there's nothing that's recoverable where there are no living cells.

271
00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:26.460
There's no living genomes,
there's no intact DNA.

272
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.280
We cannot clone a mammoth.

273
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.080
<v 2>Thank you for coming.
I'm just kidding.</v>

274
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.200
<v 0>No,
I'm just kidding.
So what's the next step?</v>

275
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.860
So we all probably heard last week because there was a lot of press attention.

276
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.740
That's a group,
an international group of scientists,
but mostly a,

277
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:48.750
a group that was in,
in Stockholm,
led by,
uh,

278
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.150
Luva Dolan had published the genome sequences,

279
00:16:52.151 --> 00:16:54.440
complete genome sequences of two mammoths,

280
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.940
one mammoth from Wrangel island that was around 3,500 years old and another

281
00:16:57.941 --> 00:17:01.720
mammoth from Siberia that was somewhere in the realm of 40,000 years old.

282
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.790
So now what we have is this nice big list of Aacs g's and t's the nucleotides

283
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:10.870
that make up DNA that will spell out the instructions to make the genes that

284
00:17:10.871 --> 00:17:14.680
make the proteins to make a mammoth to make it how it looks and how it behaves.

285
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.430
So surely the best thing that we can do to bring a mammoth back to life would

286
00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:22.510
just be to synthesize these long stretches of DNA and then get them into the

287
00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:26.380
chromosome and then put the chromosome into the egg cell and then,
you know,

288
00:17:26.381 --> 00:17:29.200
do the thing with the going around and making the mammoth,
right?

289
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.310
<v 2>Yeah.
That,</v>

290
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.200
<v 0>so the problem with this is that a complete genome,</v>

291
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.480
well there's lots of problems here,
but let's just start with this.

292
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.360
They said it was a complete genome,
but in fact it's not.

293
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.820
It's not really a complete genome.
In fact,

294
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:49.150
we don't actually know the complete genome sequence of any vertebrate animal,

295
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.090
including humans.

296
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:54.000
And I know that that sounds a little bit strange since we've been saying for

297
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:57.150
quite a long time that we know of the human genome sequence.
And to be fair,

298
00:17:57.151 --> 00:17:59.910
we do know most of the human genome sequence.

299
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:02.700
We know at least all the parts that contain genes,

300
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.210
the important parts that make the proteins that make us look and act the way we

301
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:06.900
do,

302
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.130
but there are parts of the human genome in of every other mammalian genome and

303
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:15.240
vertebrate genome that are extremely hard to sequence through these complex

304
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:18.180
patterns of highly condensed repeat things,

305
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.630
often near the center of the chromosomes and near the end of the chromosomes

306
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.130
that there isn't any existing sequencing technology that can get through and

307
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:28.350
this means that we don't know the whole sequence.

308
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.960
We don't know how long these are.
We don't know if they're important.

309
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.760
We don't know whether there are any genes in them.

310
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:35.340
We don't really understand quite yet what they do,

311
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.530
but the truth is we don't have the complete sequence for mammoths.

312
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.950
It's even harder than that,

313
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.750
and there are two reasons why it's harder for anything that's extinct.

314
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.411
In particular,

315
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:49.980
we're talking about mammoths here than it would be to assemble a complete human

316
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:50.814
genome.

317
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.570
The first is that the sequences that we recover from these bones are very short

318
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.290
and damaged.
And this is because of all of the stuff that I just talked about.

319
00:18:58.291 --> 00:18:59.460
Solar radiation,

320
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.180
enzyme is from in the body and from microbes that are in the soil that we'll get

321
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:06.300
into the particular bones after they're buried and eat up the DNA.

322
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.020
All of this stuff is acting to break those DNA sequences down.

323
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.500
So if you imagine that I could get modern DNA out of something that looks like a

324
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:17.850
nice big party streamer.
Ancient Dna looks more like confetti,
right,

325
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.550
but not confetti.
That's in that good of a shape,
right?

326
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:24.210
More like confetti that you might find on the ground in the gutter or the day

327
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:25.230
after the parade.

328
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.640
Right when it rained the night before and maybe there were elephants in the

329
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:34.320
parade and flux of passenger pigeons flying over and you know,
not,
not good,

330
00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:35.040
it's not good.

331
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.330
The other problem is that the samples are full of all kinds of stuff in addition

332
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.890
to mammoth DNA.

333
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:44.610
So if you imagine that I took a piece of my own hair or a cheek swab and

334
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:48.330
extracted all the DNA in there and then sequenced everything I got when I

335
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:50.310
extracted DNA.
Um,
Martin,

336
00:19:50.311 --> 00:19:52.860
nearly everything that I could get out of there would be my own DNA.

337
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.430
That's cause I'm living and my DNA is in pretty good condition.

338
00:19:56.431 --> 00:20:00.090
Then there's not that much that might be contaminating my DNA sample.

339
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.070
In 2006 I was involved with the group that used the new sequencing technology,

340
00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:08.130
next generation sequencing to shotgun sequence.

341
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.760
That's what we call sequencing everything we get out of the DNA extract a

342
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:16.650
mammoth bone for the first time and this is what we got about half of the

343
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:21.030
sequences that we recovered from that sequence map to mammoth DNA.

344
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.040
The rest of it was stuff like soil bacteria,
environmental microbes,

345
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:30.420
other stuff that was probably also soil microbes that we just haven't sequenced

346
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:33.690
yet.
So they weren't in the database for us to compare the data to some

347
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.090
contamination.
We often find human dog,

348
00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:40.020
domestic cats and birds sequences in our extracts.
That's not that surprising.

349
00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:43.710
So about half of what we got was mammoth.
We were pretty bummed about this.

350
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.080
We thought,
well,
half,
that's terrible.

351
00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:49.840
How are we ever going be able to piece together a complete genome with only half

352
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:51.730
of what we're getting is actually ancient DNA?

353
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.150
It turns out several decades or a decade later,

354
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.680
we know that this was actually an exceptionally WellPreserved sample and that

355
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:04.681
most of the remains that we recover have less than 20 less than 10% of the DNA

356
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.450
that we want is actually the DNA from the host.

357
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.750
If you've heard of the neanderthal genome that was published recently,

358
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:12.670
the first and the endo tall genome sequence,

359
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.450
they used a couple of different bones and none of those bones bones had more

360
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:20.140
than 1% neanderthal DNA in them.
That's pretty standard,

361
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:23.020
especially when you're not coming from a kind of cold region.

362
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.200
So what we have is this kind of junked up bit of Confetti.

363
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:28.840
If you can imagine confetti that looks more gross than this.

364
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.660
And what we really want are just the purple bits,
right?

365
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.640
So how do we go about finding the stuff that we want from amid the entire mess

366
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:38.350
of stuff that we actually get?

367
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.530
How do we tell what DNA is mammoth when most of what we're getting is actually

368
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:46.690
just soil microbes that we really want to throw away?

369
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.760
What we do is we map the data that we have these broken little tiny pieces of

370
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:56.110
fragments to the already published complete genome sequences of living animals

371
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.210
or complete ish,
right?
They're in good shape.

372
00:21:58.211 --> 00:22:01.510
They're much better than anything that we would be able to generate use from an

373
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:03.670
ancient sample.
So for the mammoth,

374
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:07.090
we would map it to an Asian elephant and for the neanderthal are able to map it

375
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:07.900
to a human.

376
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.740
We take these broken fragments and we matched them where they go using this

377
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:14.770
genome sequences,
a guide to figure out where they go.

378
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.660
One of the key problems that arises immediately when you think about this is

379
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.100
what if something weird has happened in the evolutionary time between when a

380
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:28.330
mammoth lived and when the Asian elephant lives since that common ancestor.

381
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.150
If something weird happened,
like a big duplication,

382
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:34.450
there's a whole new bit of DNA or something changed a lot,
right?

383
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.770
That would be missing.
We wouldn't have that part of the genome on our map.

384
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.750
We would think that whatever it was,

385
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:44.380
if mammoth DNA that matched that real part of the mammoth genome,

386
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.980
because it's not part of the elephant genome that we're using as a scaffold was

387
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:52.660
probably just environmental DNA and we would throw it out so it's harder to

388
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:56.080
generate a complete sequence for something that isn't alive where we can't

389
00:22:56.081 --> 00:22:58.060
generate the genome sequenced by itself.

390
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.960
And one would think that if you're trying to identify the parts of the genome

391
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:06.430
that are most important to make a mammoth look more and act more like a mammoth

392
00:23:06.431 --> 00:23:10.600
instead of like an elephant,
those might be some of the important places to look.

393
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.060
The other problem is that having the DNA sequence is not the same thing as

394
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.290
having a living cell.

395
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.910
We're getting better at being able to synthesize these long strands of DNA that

396
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:24.100
we might use to generate a complete sequence,

397
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:26.980
but we don't know how to wrap those things up properly and get them into a

398
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:30.160
chromosome in a state where they're actually going to make jeans and make

399
00:23:30.161 --> 00:23:30.994
proteins.

400
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.060
And we don't know how to get chromosomes into a cell in any logical way.

401
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:36.100
So it looks like if this is the pathway,

402
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:38.830
plan B is what we're going to use to bring a mammoth back to life.

403
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.070
We're stuck at that first step.
And that's not gonna work either.

404
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.750
Of course there's another way.
So the last plan,

405
00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:51.620
and this is the one that really is at the core of what people are thinking about

406
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:54.710
for de Extinction,
is to engineer a mammoth.

407
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.720
And this is really similar to just thinking about cutting and pasting your DNA.

408
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.690
So you find a part of the genome that you want to swap out.

409
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.780
Say some gene that's different between elephants and mammoths.

410
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.110
You cut it out and paste in the version that you want.

411
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.640
So mammoths in Asian elephants diverge from each other.

412
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.330
Something like 6 million years ago.

413
00:24:14.331 --> 00:24:17.990
We now have genome sequences from both of these sequences and we can start

414
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:22.280
combing through those genome sequences to look for places where the two species

415
00:24:22.281 --> 00:24:23.360
are different from each other.

416
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.110
Sequence a whole bunch of Asian elephants finds a place where they're all the

417
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:30.080
same as each other,
whole bunch of mammas and see where they're all the same.

418
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.800
And if these two are different than that's probably kind of critical to making a

419
00:24:33.801 --> 00:24:35.300
mammoth look and act like a mammoth.

420
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.500
So imagine then you had a little machine that you could use a machine that you

421
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:44.501
could send into the genome of an elephant cell and identify exactly that place

422
00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:45.830
that you want to change.

423
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:49.040
And also you could give that little machine a package to take with it,

424
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.903
which was a,

425
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.630
an artificially synthesized bit of mammoth DNA that it would take with us to

426
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:55.160
this place in the genome.

427
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.630
And that machine could then cut out the elephant version of the gene and swap

428
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:03.890
the mammoth version gene in there in its place.
Well we have that machine.

429
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.990
That machine is called Crispr cas nine and this is something that you might've

430
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.610
heard a lot about in the news in the last couple of weeks.

431
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.480
There was a Chinese team recently that use this particular enzyme.

432
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.650
This is a naturally occurring enzyme,
not a machine that we've built.

433
00:25:17.651 --> 00:25:21.470
It's something that bacteria and archaea use to protect themselves from invading

434
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:22.304
diseases.

435
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.760
People have figured out how to use this to harness this machine to identify

436
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:27.530
parts of the genome and cut it out.

437
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:30.980
And this Chinese team had done that with human embryos raising all sorts of

438
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.180
ethical issues about this incredibly powerful new technology.

439
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.630
So this machine here,
this molecule here is your,
your little machine.

440
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.950
This is an enzyme and here's the part of it that recognizes a specific part of

441
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:47.780
the elephant genome sequence.
We send in there a bit of synthesized mammoth DNA.

442
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.980
The machine here chops it in half.
It's like a molecular scissors.
That's its job.

443
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.970
Of course,
the DNA in a cell doesn't like to be in half.
So it has a whole,

444
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.780
it has a couple of different mechanisms that it uses to fix those double

445
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:00.770
stranded breaks.

446
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.360
We harness the cell's own repair mechanism and stick in there,

447
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.310
that synthetic piece of mammoth DNA.

448
00:26:07.311 --> 00:26:11.690
So we end up with an elephant that's just a little bit mammoth like right,

449
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.430
so what do we change?

450
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.230
I said there are about 6 million years of evolution separating these two species

451
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:22.010
and indeed there have been some efforts so far within the last couple of weeks

452
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:25.640
even to catalog the differences that existed between these two guys.

453
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.380
One of the first differences that was found was a work that was done by Kevin

454
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.220
Campbell's lab in Manitoba in 2010 they found that there were only three

455
00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:34.971
differences,

456
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:39.971
three changes that needed to be made to change the Asian elephant red blood cell

457
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:42.140
hemoglobin component of the red blood cell,

458
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:46.350
which is responsible for carrying oxygen around the body into the woolly mammoth

459
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:47.670
virgin of the red blood cell.

460
00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:51.840
And they made these changes in cells in the lab and they were able to then do a

461
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:53.940
little tissue tissue culture experiments,

462
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:58.170
gene expression experiment to try to figure out what those differences did for

463
00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:00.330
that version of the hemoglobin protein.

464
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.970
And they found that when these changes were made,

465
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.350
the hemoglobin was much better at carrying oxygen around the body at low

466
00:27:07.351 --> 00:27:08.184
temperatures.

467
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.110
This is clearly something that is an adaptation that arose in mammoths as the

468
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:17.190
tropically adapted ancestor of these two species moved out of the tropics and

469
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:18.510
into the Arctic.
Right.

470
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.600
So this might be a powerful new first approach to going about trying to create

471
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.440
or change an elephant genome so that you could create a mammoth.

472
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.600
So what else should we change?
Well,

473
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:33.900
there's a team that's nearby here that's led by George Church that had been

474
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:38.130
working on this for some time and using this CRISPR type of genome editing,

475
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:41.610
they've so far been able to swap out 14 different genes.

476
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:44.910
Every one of them that they've tried so far has worked with this CRISPR

477
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:49.500
technology.
These genes are associated with increasing thermal regulation,

478
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:54.540
maybe thicker subcutaneous fat layers and and thicker hair or the red blood

479
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:58.710
cells and also things that are associated with diet and metabolism,

480
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:02.250
all sorts of things that one might think were important to making an elephant

481
00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:04.950
look and act more like a mammoth.

482
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:10.140
And so far they have succeeded in creating something that is about a small

483
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:13.740
fraction mammoth in a dish in a lab,

484
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:18.690
which of course is a very long way from creating a living,
breathing mammoth.

485
00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:23.520
But it is hopeful and it does say that with this genome sequence which we do

486
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:27.510
have for the most part and with this CRISPR cas engineering technology which we

487
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:28.344
also have,

488
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:33.470
we can then create an elephant cell that's alive that contains a few mutations

489
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:37.620
that make it look and act more like a mammoth and at that point we can go ahead

490
00:28:37.621 --> 00:28:41.640
and use cloning the traditional technology use to bring something back.

491
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.800
Of course the next step here,
creating a surrogate mom,

492
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.130
growing it up,
putting it in the environment,

493
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.640
I like to call it phase two of the extinction is probably even harder than what

494
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:58.050
we've been able to accomplish so far.

495
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:02.490
And when you read about de extinction or hear about it on the radio,

496
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:05.550
often there's a focus on this first part,

497
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:08.500
phase one with the thought that just because we can get this far,

498
00:29:08.501 --> 00:29:11.970
it means that we are super close to being able to bring a mammoth back to life.

499
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.760
But that is really,
really not the case.

500
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:17.730
We are far from being able to create a mammoth.

501
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.210
So the next thing we would have to do in this step would be to find a surrogate

502
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:23.190
mom.
So for many species,

503
00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:26.790
this might be easy if they have very close evolutionary relatives that are still

504
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:30.600
alive than it might be relatively straightforward to finding a surrogate mom

505
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:31.850
that could carry a problem,

506
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:36.630
an edited embryo or an edited and edited embryo to term.

507
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:41.140
But the more evolutionary distance accumulates between the living species and

508
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.160
extinct species you're trying to bring back,
the harder this is likely to be.

509
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.150
There may even in some cases be some unpleasant,
uh,

510
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.830
constraints associated with,
uh,
with trying to do this.
Um,

511
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.240
I know I say here that you probably don't want to photo,

512
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:58.330
but you're a bunch of computer sciences,
so you probably do want a photo.

513
00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:02.860
So I'm here is one you're hoping for something grocer,
right?
Yeah,

514
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.040
I knew that.
I'll try to find something gross or for next time.
This is a,

515
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:10.000
this is a stellar sea cow and this stellar seek out.
This is a foot.

516
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.540
There's a scale bar right there.
This is a big animal.
Steller sea cow.

517
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:16.270
When extinct a couple of hundred years ago,
we hunted them to death.

518
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.290
One of these guys could feed a crew of 30 or so men for a couple of weeks.

519
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:23.170
So you can see why potentially they were,
they were nice.

520
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:24.880
Pray for people who are out on the ocean.

521
00:30:24.881 --> 00:30:26.860
They lived along the coast of California,

522
00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:30.370
up across the Aleutian islands and onto the commander islands and they went

523
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:32.230
extinct really recently,
a couple of hundred years ago.

524
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:37.150
The closest living relative to the steller sea cow is a dugong hair.

525
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.290
Right?

526
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:43.030
And if one were to estimate the size of a newborn steller sea cal by looking at

527
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:46.570
the ratio of newborn manatee and good dewgong to the ratio,

528
00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:48.160
to the size of their mom,
um,

529
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:52.510
a newborn steller sea cow would be larger than its mom,

530
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.400
which just wouldn't be pretty.
So in some cases,

531
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:00.130
there may be some physical constraints,
technical problems,

532
00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:03.310
technical challenges associated with this part of phase two.

533
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.440
It's also pretty clear by now and becoming more and more clear,
uh,
uh,

534
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.270
through time that we as organisms and every organism are more than the sum of

535
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:17.440
just our acs,
g's and t's that make up our DNA sequence.
In fact,

536
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.580
we are a product of both our genome sequences and the environment in which we

537
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:24.190
live in that environment begins in the womb.

538
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.020
The same would necessarily be true for an elephant or an edited elephant that

539
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:32.810
was attempting to be a mammoth.
Asian elephants and mammoths genomes are already,

540
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.680
without thinking about anything,
about 99% the same.

541
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:38.530
But I'm the same as we are and with chimpanzees.
Right?

542
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.480
And so if you put something that's tiny,

543
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:44.380
tiny bit changed inside a mom who has pretty much the same genome and pretty

544
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:48.640
much the same genes and the developmental process here is going to be controlled

545
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:52.600
and affected by her hormonal environment and her diet and what's going on,

546
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.320
how do we know that the changes that we've made are going to have any effect

547
00:31:56.321 --> 00:32:01.321
whatsoever on what this animal looks like and once it's born is going to be born

548
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:03.730
to and live in an elephant society.

549
00:32:03.731 --> 00:32:07.430
Elephants eat the dung of their moms just after they're born.

550
00:32:07.431 --> 00:32:11.290
In order to establish the microbial community that they need to break down the

551
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:12.124
food that they ate.

552
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.840
This newborn mammoth elephant hybrid would eat the dog of an elephant so that it

553
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:19.390
could establish an elephant microbial community.

554
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:23.860
We know how important the gut microbes are and determining how we look and how

555
00:32:23.861 --> 00:32:27.670
we act and how we feel.
Why would the same not be true for an animal like this?

556
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.290
It would then join an elephant society and eat whatever food elephants are fed

557
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:34.990
in captive environments and uh,
you know,

558
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.710
all of these things are going to affect the way that this animal behaves and the

559
00:32:38.711 --> 00:32:39.590
way that looks.

560
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:43.610
This is something that's unquestionable and yet something that we haven't really

561
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:46.970
questioned.
And speaking of captive environments,

562
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.710
this in my mind is probably the biggest challenge associated with mammoth de

563
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.120
extinction.
We know that elephants don't fair particularly well in captivity.

564
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.240
They often fail to reproduce in captivity if they do,

565
00:32:59.241 --> 00:33:03.860
they injure and sometimes even kill their offspring until we have figured out

566
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:08.750
how we can meet the physical and emotional psychological needs of mammoths in

567
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:09.470
captivity.

568
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:14.180
I think that we should not be using mammoths for this type of research or

569
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.020
keeping them in captivity.
Maybe for other species,

570
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:21.050
these particular types of concerns are less birds.

571
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:26.030
We may not to need have birds and bird species might not have very much parental

572
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:29.780
guidance.
So maybe it's,
it's ethically simpler to bring birds back.

573
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:32.840
But there are of course technical challenges of bringing birds back that we

574
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:35.960
don't have when we're dealing with mammals.
So you know,

575
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.230
there are many different ethical considerations to be aware of,
but again,

576
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:43.940
this is something that I think not enough attention has been paid to and finally

577
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:49.330
it would be remiss of me not to point out or to acknowledge that the world has

578
00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:54.440
changed a lot in the time since many of these species have gone extinct and

579
00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:58.160
bringing something back and introducing it into an environment where it doesn't

580
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:01.310
live is definitely going to affect those environments.

581
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.370
Environments are not stable things.
A species doesn't go extinct.

582
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:07.880
Leaving this giant gaping hole into which we could just stick it back,

583
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.650
they'll change,
they'll adapt.
New Species move in,
everything changes.
This here,

584
00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:14.870
this is the range of the passenger pigeon,

585
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:18.830
which is one of the species that's been proposed to bring back to bring back to

586
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:19.664
life,
right?

587
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.650
Where would a passenger pigeon a bird that flocked in the billions and fed on

588
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:27.740
forests killing huge sways of forests all at once?

589
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.470
Where would it go if we were to bring it back?

590
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.210
Clearly the ecological implications of de extinction need to be considered

591
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:38.150
carefully for any species that we're considering bringing back.

592
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:41.660
Before we go down the road to actually making it happen.

593
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.980
So de extinction can we do?
It's not yet.
We can't yet,

594
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.140
but the technology is increasing rapidly both in phase one and in phase two and

595
00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:54.020
there will come a time where we can do this for some species.

596
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.190
So maybe we should start focusing more on the question.
Should we,

597
00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.980
and as somebody who's written a book about this,

598
00:35:00.981 --> 00:35:04.790
it's clear that I should have a very informed and direct opinion about this.

599
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.530
And I do.
I don't know.
I don't know.

600
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.460
I honestly don't know.

601
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.510
There are a lot of different species that have been proposed as candidates for

602
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:17.810
de extinction.
This is the heath hen that used to live in Martha's vineyard,

603
00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:22.250
mammoth passenger pigeon,
thylacine steller sea cow,
the gastric brooding frog,

604
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:25.540
the Bucardo and type of Ibex that used to live in the parentees.

605
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.420
All of these things have been posed by groups who are interested in working them

606
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.070
to be resurrected.

607
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.570
But I think that the really the most important thing to do and deciding whether

608
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:38.850
we should proceed with any of these species or any other species that someone

609
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:42.960
might want to bring back is to really try to understand why.

610
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.140
Why might we want to bring a species back that's been extinct for a long time?

611
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.050
Why is this such a compelling area of research?

612
00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:54.780
Why are so many people so fascinated by this idea?

613
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.800
And to answer this question just in the last few minutes here,

614
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.910
I'm going to return to mammoths and I'm going to kind of ignore the fact for a

615
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:07.020
moment that it's not possible to do and that ethically it's probably a terrible

616
00:36:07.021 --> 00:36:11.880
idea to deal with elephants and to bring mammos back to life and talk about why

617
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.080
we might want them back.

618
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.100
Because I do think there are a couple of compelling reasons to think about

619
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.360
bringing mammoths back or at least creating an elephant that looks and acts a

620
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:24.690
little bit like a mammoth.
The first is ecological,

621
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.230
so there's a place up in northeastern Siberia called Pleistocene Park.

622
00:36:28.231 --> 00:36:33.120
It's been established in about the mid 1990s by scientists with the Russian

623
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.260
Academy of Science named Sergei Zimov.

624
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:38.580
He started buying up lands near his home at the northeast science station and

625
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.750
preparing a park for the resurrection of Ice Age animals.

626
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.900
So far he has bison imported from Canada,
some species of horse,
uh,

627
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.900
five different species of deer and he's been doing some experiments where he's

628
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:55.590
keeping them out of some parts of Pleistocene Park and letting them graze on

629
00:36:55.591 --> 00:36:59.160
other parts of Pleistocene Park to see what the effect of having those animals

630
00:36:59.161 --> 00:37:02.370
there is on the,
the ecosystem,

631
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:06.300
the environment itself as a whole.
So here's a picture that surrogate took.

632
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:07.650
This is very early spring.

633
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:11.580
This is the side that doesn't have any grazing animals and this is the side that

634
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:13.290
does have grazing animals.

635
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.970
And what you see here is a really stark contrast between the type of vegetation

636
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:18.923
that's there.

637
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:23.010
Here we have pretty much only one species of grass that's very low productivity,

638
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:27.210
really can't support grazing herbivores in any way.
And over here,

639
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.020
remember this is early spring so the grass hasn't had time to regenerate.

640
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.960
You still see lots of green and you can't really tell,

641
00:37:33.961 --> 00:37:36.660
but there are a bunch of different species of grass that are there.

642
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:40.920
What he's found is that these animals,
by their presence alone moving around,

643
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:43.350
turning over the soil,
recycling nutrients,

644
00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:47.490
distributing seeds have essentially created their own habitat.

645
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.290
They've made the habitat that's necessary for them to survive.
In fact,

646
00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:55.770
they've made so much that even after the very cold Arctic winter,

647
00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.060
there's still some green grass there left for that community to come back the

648
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:00.540
next year,

649
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.990
and he's observed not only that these animals are happy and healthy and living

650
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:04.651
in these areas,

651
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:08.640
but that other species have come to visit the park because it's such a rich

652
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.850
source of food.
Things like saiga antelope and endangered species.

653
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:17.510
Essentially these animals with their presence have recreated that rich Tundra

654
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:22.800
grassland that used to be there potentially making habitat and saving species

655
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.430
that are in danger of extinction today because this is all they've got.

656
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.550
The next reason is more emotional.

657
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:38.240
I think few of us are willing to accept the idea of a world that doesn't have

658
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.180
elephants,
but elephants aren't endangered species.

659
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.510
Asian elephants are in trouble,
their habitat is declining.

660
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.850
We're having a difficult time stopping poaching.

661
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:53.470
Human populations are growing and every year fewer and fewer Asian elephants

662
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.333
exist.

663
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.050
What if we could use this technology not to bring mammoths back to life,

664
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:04.180
but to create elephants that are capable of living in a more diverse

665
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.133
environment?

666
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.860
Elephants that could live in temperate zones or arctic zones moving into the

667
00:39:08.861 --> 00:39:11.620
types of habitats that were once occupied by Mamet's.

668
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.940
We could use this technology not to bring something that's gone and has been

669
00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:17.410
gone for a long time back,

670
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.880
but really to save a species that's still alive today but in danger of

671
00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:26.680
extinction,
let's not use this crazy technology to d extinct mammoths.

672
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:32.010
Let's use it to save elephants and that's what I think the most compelling use

673
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:36.190
of the technology that's being developed here really is not to bring stuff back

674
00:39:36.191 --> 00:39:37.024
that's gone,

675
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.950
but to change and manipulate and give a genetic booster shot,
if you will,

676
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.970
to populations and species and communities that are in danger of going extinct

677
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.580
because of our actions today because of climate change,

678
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:50.110
because of decreases in habitat,

679
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.550
that evolution itself alone can't keep up with this in my mind,

680
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.120
is the most powerful use of de extinction technology.

681
00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.890
Thank you for your attention.

682
00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.570
I'm happy to take any questions.

683
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.983
<v 2>If anyone has any,</v>

684
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.020
<v 3>a fish question comes back to what you said at the very beginning,
which is this,</v>

685
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:20.370
this is not your,
what your field was halves.

686
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.810
The question caused you to become interested in this question and change what

687
00:40:23.811 --> 00:40:28.540
you're working on or or is it just cost you to write this book that you're,

688
00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:29.560
you're,
you know the tour.

689
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.311
<v 0>Yeah,
no,</v>

690
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:33.790
I'm definitely more interested in now and actually writing this book was,

691
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:37.000
it was an experience in and becoming more and more interested.

692
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:40.940
We now have a couple of different projects where we're hoping to,
uh,

693
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.010
use ancient DNA technology to learn,
uh,

694
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.980
what's the diversity was in populations that were extinct in the past that are

695
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.300
that not extinct,
but where recent changes in population size.

696
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:55.780
Like I'm a black footed ferrets and the central plains for example,

697
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:57.780
are nearly genetically Depop,
right?

698
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.000
They're all almost the same and that's because of a recent really tight

699
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:04.990
population bottleneck and near extinction.
These guys are now in trouble.

700
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.340
There is a disease that's killing them off.
Um,

701
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.220
it's not something that we can do yet,

702
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.390
but it would be possible to look at black footed ferrets that are preserved in

703
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:16.960
museum collections or living cells that they have in the collection at the

704
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:21.040
frozen zoo in San Diego and learn how much diversity there was in the past and

705
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:25.180
then use this technology to inject that diversity and to living populations of

706
00:41:25.181 --> 00:41:28.090
black footed ferrets.
I'm also really interested in birds.

707
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.450
There are tons of species of birds that are in danger of going extinct.

708
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:35.720
And yet the biggest technical hurdle here is that we can't clone birds.

709
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:40.160
There's no way to actually get to that egg cell at the point where it's ready.

710
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:41.480
It's ready to be fertilized,

711
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:45.260
but it hasn't yet been fertilized because of the peculiarities of the bird

712
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:48.680
reproductive tract.
And so there is no way to clone birds.

713
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:51.740
There's a different type of technology that one would use to,

714
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.080
to change the genome sequence in birds.

715
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.970
And we've been working with other groups to try to refine that technology for

716
00:41:58.971 --> 00:42:03.740
endangered bird species.
It's kind of neat when,
uh,
uh,
bird chicken egg is laid,

717
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:04.990
for example,
the,

718
00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.900
the germ cells with the primordial germ cells that are going to go on to become

719
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:12.950
sperm and eggs aren't actually in the gonads yet because the gonads don't exist

720
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:14.600
yet,
but they're migrating around the,

721
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:18.890
outside of that embryo to the place where the gonads will be.
At that point,

722
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:23.330
you can stick a needle in the egg cell and suck out some of those germ cells,

723
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:26.840
primordial germ cells without harming the embryo or the egg.

724
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.070
And you can put those into a dish and you can actually edit those primordial

725
00:42:31.071 --> 00:42:35.060
germ cells and then you can stick them back into another ag as it's just been

726
00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:35.301
laid.

727
00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:39.110
And they will migrate around the embryo to become those primordial germ cells.

728
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:41.330
So the egg when it hatches will be totally normal,

729
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.970
but its offspring will have the edits that you've made.

730
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:47.720
And this is a really cool and potentially powerful technology that's really at

731
00:42:47.721 --> 00:42:49.340
the early stages of being developed.

732
00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:57.760
<v 4>You taste the question as,
you know,
can we,
and should we do,</v>

733
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.440
do you not feel like we live in a world where it is inevitable that probably

734
00:43:01.441 --> 00:43:03.570
within the lifetime of people in this room,

735
00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.000
people will actually decide to do this and they'll,

736
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:10.770
we'll be baby elephants with a little bit of wooly mammoths or BB humans with a

737
00:43:10.771 --> 00:43:14.880
little bit of Neanderthal or whatever your favorite choice is as one of these

738
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.040
inevitable.

739
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.400
<v 0>Those are two particularly hard choices,
right?
So,
um,
there,</v>

740
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.770
there are a lot of technical hurdles with both of these and with,

741
00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:23.740
with neanderthals,
there's a big ethical question there.

742
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.740
Nana tells her people too,
right?
So,
um,

743
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.430
how are you going to get informed consent to bring one of those guys back to

744
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:30.710
life?
You know,
that's a pretty touchy thing,
I think.

745
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.880
I don't think we should go there.
Um,
whether we do or not,
I don't know,
scary,
but,

746
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.180
uh,
there are a lot of scary things that can be done with crispers.
So,
uh,

747
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.410
I don't think we should talk about that.
We'll see through mammoths.
The,

748
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:47.210
some of the biggest hangups are actually in the cloning process itself.
Um,

749
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.910
and then every time an elephant gives birth,

750
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.570
the hymen actually grows back and the hymen has a tiny little hole in it that's

751
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:57.500
just big enough for the sperm to get through and it sits there during the

752
00:43:57.501 --> 00:44:01.100
pregnancy to actually maintain the pregnancy.
It's a big heavy thing,
right?

753
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:05.190
And it's a two year pregnancy,
so you got to hold it in there for two years.
Um,

754
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:10.130
there's certainly is no way to insert a developing embryo into the uterus of an

755
00:44:10.131 --> 00:44:13.170
elephant without destroying that hymen.
I think that's a,

756
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.520
this stuff is going to involve,
you know,
are creating,

757
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:19.250
growing elephant eggs on the backs of mice.

758
00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:22.550
I know that there are groups that are actually working on doing that and maybe

759
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.330
completely artificial wombs where the entire gestation process takes place

760
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:30.260
outside of a,
of a species and all of that stuff might be developed,

761
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.140
probably not de extinction,
probably because we want to use it for humans.

762
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.790
There certainly isn't any money being invested into developing technologies for

763
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:41.850
the purposes of the extinction.
Um,
but yeah,

764
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.370
do I think that somebody is going to try?
Yeah.

765
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.120
I'm more likely somebody is going to achieve what George Church's lab achieved

766
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.360
and then the press is going to say George Church cloned a mammoth,

767
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:55.110
which is not what George Church said at all.
Right.
And to be fair,

768
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.080
there was only one,
uh,
media outlet that said that.
So,

769
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.750
and I won't say what it is since I know this is going on youtube

770
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:08.790
<v 5>to play devil's advocate here.
So let's say that we succeed in,</v>

771
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.330
in,
um,
genetically engineering.
Elephants have it,

772
00:45:11.331 --> 00:45:14.090
they can survive in different habitats to make nationals living.

773
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:18.830
Now that that feels to me like,
you know,
going after the same,
we'll,

774
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.530
we've destroyed your natural habitat here,

775
00:45:21.531 --> 00:45:26.450
but we found this other place in North Dakota where you can live.
Um,

776
00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:31.540
and so we're going to genetic genetically reengineer your offspring and have

777
00:45:31.671 --> 00:45:32.540
them go do that.

778
00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:37.820
<v 0>I'm not saying that this should be a substitute to trying to protect the species</v>

779
00:45:37.821 --> 00:45:40.600
that are alive and in danger today,
but I think that's,

780
00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:44.120
that we have come to a point where we're playing conservation triage and we

781
00:45:44.121 --> 00:45:48.650
might need to reach deeper into our arsenals and find the most powerful weapons

782
00:45:48.651 --> 00:45:50.900
we have to stop these species from going extinct.

783
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.270
I would rather have elephants in Africa,

784
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.900
but I would rather have elephants in North Dakota then no elephants.

785
00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:00.610
<v 5>So,
but yeah,
I know on the one hand,</v>

786
00:46:00.611 --> 00:46:03.260
I don't like to anthropomorphize the,
the argument,
but I'm going to hit,

787
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:06.570
if we did anything like that with humans,
it would be,
um,

788
00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.740
ethically important and the number of fronts.

789
00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.870
<v 0>Do you have to be tried to save humans from going extinct?</v>

790
00:46:11.871 --> 00:46:13.310
It would be ethically important

791
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.260
<v 5>worry if we relocated them and said,
[inaudible] genetically engineering use of,</v>

792
00:46:17.261 --> 00:46:20.890
that's going to be okay without consent from the police.

793
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.310
<v 0>You're making an argument that says we should focus on saving elephants where</v>

794
00:46:24.311 --> 00:46:26.620
they are and I totally agree with you on that.

795
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.570
I completely agree that we should do that,

796
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.680
but I'm saying that it's not enough and it's probably not going to be enough.

797
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.520
There are situations we can't control.
Look at the look at the Rhino,
right?

798
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:40.750
We haven't been able to save the Rhino,
right.
The cabots hat where it lives is,

799
00:46:40.751 --> 00:46:42.310
is something that we can't,

800
00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.160
we can't deal with because of current political situations.

801
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.200
What if we relocate elephants to North Dakota and then in that time when they're

802
00:46:50.201 --> 00:46:54.160
gone completely fixed the political climate and the expansion of human

803
00:46:54.161 --> 00:46:57.190
populations in Africa and then we can put them back in Africa.

804
00:46:57.191 --> 00:47:00.910
Would having them live in North Dakota for a short period of time be a terrible

805
00:47:00.911 --> 00:47:01.481
thing to do?

806
00:47:01.481 --> 00:47:05.500
If our ultimate goal was to create a native habitat for them to thrive as a

807
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.050
living species rather than something that's just gone.

808
00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.280
<v 5>How do we actually know what modifying rich bitch is going to help elephants</v>

809
00:47:14.591 --> 00:47:15.610
live in North Dakota?

810
00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.630
<v 0>We have no idea.
And this is uh,
this is really part of the process.</v>

811
00:47:19.631 --> 00:47:22.300
So we now have these genome sequences,
right?

812
00:47:22.301 --> 00:47:26.350
Which is like somebody handing you two massive phone books for New York City and

813
00:47:26.351 --> 00:47:29.710
San Francisco,
but without any names and addresses them.
Right?

814
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.900
The next step is trying to figure out where the genes are,
what the genes do,
uh,

815
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.150
doing these experiments like George Church in his lab are doing where they'd

816
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:40.000
switch a little bit out and then they test those cells.
You know,
you can,

817
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.910
you can actually perform some,
some acid in,

818
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.120
in tissue culture and culture to figure out whether those changes have done

819
00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:50.680
something and what those changes might be before using them to go on and make an

820
00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:55.060
animal.
But yeah,
we're very much at the early stages and trial and error.

821
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.120
We don't have to make animals though that are somehow unfit.

822
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.970
We can do those early stages in the lab.

823
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.010
<v 6>I guess I was thinking like even later,</v>

824
00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:08.300
like we know if we know how to modify the blood cells to live in a colder

825
00:48:08.301 --> 00:48:08.691
climate,

826
00:48:08.691 --> 00:48:12.890
how do we know how much of that we need to do or whether that's going to be

827
00:48:12.891 --> 00:48:16.700
helpful and whether the elephants are even going to survive in North Dakota.

828
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.040
Yeah.

829
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.290
<v 0>We don't know,
do we?
But,
uh,
yeah.</v>

830
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.340
We'll know more after we've tried than we knew before we tried.

831
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:24.343
<v 2>Okay.</v>

832
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.390
<v 0>All right.
Thank you very much for your attention.</v>
