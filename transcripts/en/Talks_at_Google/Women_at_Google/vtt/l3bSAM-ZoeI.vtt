1
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.080
Thank you guys

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.690
<v 1>for coming.
I'm super excited.</v>

3
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.980
Carla is a good friend and she's in my head a lot,

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.140
which just probably a little dangerous.
But,
um,

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.590
she was here last year.
She had her first book.
This is her second book.

6
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.830
I haven't read it yet.
I know it's gonna be amazing.
Um,

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.710
one of my experiences that I can share.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.950
My daughter just turned two and on her second birthday,

9
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:37.810
literally she woke up from her nap and screamed for 15 minutes.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.280
I timed it.
Um,
no reason.
She woke up crying.
She,

11
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.510
whatever was going on,

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.680
the first thing that popped into my head was Carla's voice from the first book

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.950
telling me that I need to react in a way that's going to help her.

14
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.220
And it was a total mindfulness thing where I just sat there and held her and was

15
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:01.570
calm and as peaceful as possible.
And we did it for it to all pass.

16
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.980
And we keep doing that as she wakes up from nap screaming.

17
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.490
But the thing that I find is that she walks away from that in a much calmer

18
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:14.050
state than had I gotten super upset.
Super worried,

19
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:16.540
reacted with her reaction.

20
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.180
So that's Carla in my head.
Um,
she has this awesome new book.

21
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.530
It's called ready,
set,
breathe.

22
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:27.370
And it's practicing mindfulness with your children for fear of meltdowns and

23
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:31.500
more peaceful family.
And I'm so excited to read it.
So without further ado,

24
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.703
Kyla,

25
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.180
<v 0>yeah,</v>

26
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.620
<v 1>fabulous.
Thank you all so much for coming today.
This is as Tash mentioned,</v>

27
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:50.640
my second time speaking here at Google and I had a fabulous time last year,

28
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.770
so I'm thrilled to be back and I want to say thank you,

29
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:56.280
especially to toss Ross who helped set this all up and she's been super

30
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.200
supportive and great.
Um,

31
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.040
so what we're gonna do today is I'm going to do some reading from the book so

32
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.630
you can get a sense of what the book is like.

33
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.670
I'm going to do a little bit of talking about the book,

34
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.470
about mindfulness with our kids,

35
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:09.510
and then we'll have some time for questions and answers.

36
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.460
So I hope that sounds good.
All right,

37
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.180
we're going to dive right in at the very beginning and the introduction.

38
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.590
Will you please just calm down and take a breath?

39
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.260
I snapped at my five year old daughter the other morning.

40
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.760
We had both gotten up on the wrong side of the bed and things had gone downhill

41
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.470
from there.
She was circling me in the kitchen,

42
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
whining and crying because we had run out of her favorite cereal and I had

43
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:36.000
denied her request to take a tiny and very beloved toy to preschool.

44
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.600
Her four year old sister who was supposed to be sitting at the table eating her

45
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:40.434
breakfast,

46
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.670
kept getting down to grab a toy or finish a drawing she was working on and I had

47
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:49.140
to keep reminding her to get back in her seat and finish eating.
Meanwhile,

48
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.040
I was stressed about everything I needed to do that morning,
make lunches,

49
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:53.671
get dressed,

50
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.640
finished packing my work bags and hustle everyone out the door on time.

51
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.290
In the back of my mind,

52
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:01.600
I was feeling guilty about leaving that afternoon for a three day work trip,

53
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.260
even though I knew the girls would be fine at home with their dad who sitting

54
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.760
right over there.
Hi Josh.
Um,

55
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.310
I also knew that my impending absence was part of why my daughter was having

56
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.250
such a hard morning and I couldn't help but feel bad about it.

57
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.930
Not unlike my little girl.

58
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.010
I was tired and overwhelmed and barking at her to breathe was the closest I

59
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:23.170
could get to my mindfulness practice in that moment,

60
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.090
which is to say not very close at all.
Not surprisingly,
she responded in kind.

61
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.190
They don't want to breathe mommy.
The ridiculousness,

62
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.090
ridiculousness of her statement may have been lost on her,

63
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.390
but it snapped me out of my own irritability just long enough to give me a

64
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.090
little perspective.
I put down the peanut butter knife,

65
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.000
put my hands flat on the counter and took a few deep breaths.

66
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.360
When I felt myself calmed down a little bit,
I picked up my daughter,

67
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.250
sat her down on my lap and kept breathing.

68
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.690
Eventually her heaving chest calm down and her breathing became more slow and

69
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:57.010
steady.
After a few minutes,
she asked me what I was doing.
I'm just breathing.

70
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.220
That's all.
Oh,
she replied with a smile.
Me Too.

71
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.130
And so we sat for a few minutes and just breathe together.

72
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.440
While I know that she actually was breathing,

73
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.350
I don't know if she was aware of her breath in the same way I was.

74
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.080
I had been purposely paying attention to the air,

75
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:15.040
moving in and out of my nose and each time a stressful thought entered my mind

76
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:18.160
about everything I had to get done or how I was going to get her sister eat her

77
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:22.540
breakfast.
I let the thought go and came back to my breath.
For All I know,

78
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.450
my daughter could have been thinking about baby dolls or Unicorns or ice cream

79
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:29.140
sandwiches,
anything but her breathing.
The truth is it doesn't really matter.

80
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.710
By the time I went back into the kitchen,
we were both feeling a lot calmer,

81
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.650
more connected and present with each other and ourselves.

82
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.810
It's not that anything had really changed.

83
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.990
My daughter still wasn't getting her favorite breakfast or bringing her toy to

84
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.120
school and I still had a million things to do.

85
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.700
The difference was that once we had calmed down,

86
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.970
rather than freaking out in our own minds are subsequently all over each other.

87
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.090
We were both able to deal with these challenges a little more effectively.

88
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.800
The moment,

89
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.370
etc. Morning on a better path was the moment when I put down the knife.
Oh yeah.

90
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.260
Put down the knife,
mindful parenting pro tip,

91
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.180
put down the knife and took a few deep breaths.
When I did that,

92
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:07.360
I was intentionally trying to get myself into a more mindful mindset,

93
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.590
which is simply about paying attention to whatever's happening right here and

94
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:14.110
right now without judging it or wishing it was different.

95
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.950
I had spent most of the morning doing one thing with my body,
showering,

96
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.250
getting dressed or making breakfast,
and another thing with my mind,

97
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.620
generally stressing,
worrying,
and feeling guilty.

98
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.610
This split attention characterizes the way most of us move through our daily

99
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.370
lives most of the time,
often without even noticing it.

100
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.090
Multitasking often feels a void,
unavoidable in modern life,

101
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.380
and it can at times help us be a bit more efficient.
More often than not,
however,

102
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:39.760
it leads to increased stress,

103
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.760
mistakes and errors and snappy responses to our children.

104
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.340
When I was in the kitchen making sandwiches,

105
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.850
I was so wrapped up in my own unhelpful thoughts that I wasn't really paying

106
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.590
attention to what was going on with my daughter,

107
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.830
which is how we got caught up in a power struggle over toys and cereal.

108
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.250
But after taking the time to notice what was really happening,

109
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.520
I was able to respond to it in a much more skillful and effective way by giving

110
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.860
my daughter the attention she had been asking for all along.

111
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.610
The deep breaths I took were an important step in helping me get out of my own

112
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:11.150
head and back into the present.
And that's what mindful parenting is all about.

113
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.960
Making a choice to focus our attention on the present moment with kindness and

114
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:18.500
curiosity so we can make a thoughtful choice about how to proceed rather than

115
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:19.760
reacting out of frustration.

116
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.220
So I chose this passage from the book for a few reasons.
Number One,

117
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.910
as you noticed that moment of mindfulness with my daughter started with me,

118
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.660
right?

119
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.250
I was in a pretty not helpful headspace and I kind of had to turn it around so

120
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:35.990
that I could then be present with my daughter.

121
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:37.790
And in the process I was teaching her something.

122
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.500
The second important point from that is that mindful parents are not mindful all

123
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.900
the time.
There is this assumption when somebody says,

124
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.490
I practice mindful parenting,

125
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:48.470
especially if they say it in a noxious voice like that,

126
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.640
that it sounds like you assume they sort of walked through their parenting life,

127
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:57.110
blissed out in zenned out and totally present and calm no matter what happens.

128
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.101
And I don't know,

129
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.860
I've never met anyone like that and I'm certainly not like that.
And um,

130
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.080
what mindful parenting means or practicing mindfulness means is that we have a

131
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:10.790
set of school skills and tools and a specific insight about our own experience

132
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.300
that we can use when we get off track.
And I get off track many times a day.

133
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.770
And all it means is that when I can finally notice that my mind is a million

134
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.210
miles away,
that I'm not paying attention,

135
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.160
that I'm wrapped up in my own thoughts and worries.

136
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.390
I now have this understanding that I don't have to take the bait of my own brain

137
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:29.090
as it were.
I can make a choice to come back to the present moment.

138
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.960
And often that means just taking a few breaths until I can figure out what I

139
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.250
actually need to focus on.
Uh,

140
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.360
the next reason I read that passage is because when we are teaching mindfulness

141
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:42.500
to our kids,
it works best if we do it with them,
especially initially,

142
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:43.730
but in an ongoing way.

143
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.980
And I think we all have this little fantasy that we can kind of hand our kid a

144
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.890
snowglobe or glitter won and say,
here,

145
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:52.250
go look at this and breathe and come back when you're calm.
And yes,

146
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:53.900
I wish that too,
but it just doesn't work that way.

147
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:58.010
Most of the time we need to sit with our kid and do the practice with them and

148
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:01.220
we're both going to benefit and eventually they'll integrate it and be able to

149
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:03.930
do it on their own.
And the last,
uh,

150
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.130
reason I read that is it's really important to be transparent with our kids

151
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:10.010
about what we're doing.
And so in that moment my daughter said,

152
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:11.690
what are you doing?
And I said,
I'm breathing.

153
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.140
And I specifically said that to her because I wanted her to know exactly what I

154
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:15.561
was doing.

155
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:19.670
I didn't say I'm trying to calm down because that doesn't help her like that,

156
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:23.630
doesn't tell her,
give her any information about what we do to try to calm down.

157
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.710
So I was very concrete.

158
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:29.480
I'm breathing and being transparent about our own mindfulness practice is

159
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:33.230
actually harder than it sounds because it's such an internal experience.

160
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:36.290
It's all about our minds and how we're perceiving the world and what we're

161
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.590
choosing to focus on and finding a way to say to your kids,

162
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.620
I'm having a really hard time.
I'm about to lose it all over you.

163
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.500
I'm going to go in the other room and breathe.
It's weird.

164
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.070
It's a weird thing to do because you have to have the presence of mind to notice

165
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:49.904
what's going on.

166
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.210
You have to be able to remember to tell it to your kids and then you have to

167
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:53.930
actually go do it,

168
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.040
which is the hard part because we say all these things we're going to do and

169
00:08:56.041 --> 00:09:00.900
then we don't do them.
So that's the tricky part.
Uh,
but I found that,
you know,

170
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.570
for a long time when I was about to lose it or when I had just lost it,

171
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:04.470
when I'd yelled at my kids,

172
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.800
I would go on the kitchen and put my hands on the counter and start breathing,

173
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:09.600
and then I'd come back and I'd be a little calmer.

174
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.050
And my daughter's had no idea what I was doing in there for all they knew I was

175
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:14.400
sticking my head in the refrigerator.

176
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.910
So I had to make a point of starting to say to them,

177
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:22.350
I'm going in the kitchen to breathe so I can calm down.
And now they'll say,
oh,

178
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.100
mommy must be upset.
She's going,
she's breathing,
Mommy's breathing.
Yes,

179
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:29.970
I'm breathing.
So those are some important points.
Um,

180
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.440
now modeling and transparency are just two of the ways we can teach mindfulness

181
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:38.340
to our children.
And I would argue they're two of the most important ways.
Um,

182
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.610
but some other ways are sharing an activity with your kids such as reading a

183
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.850
children's book.
There's some really great ones out there.
Um,

184
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.590
my favorite current picture book,

185
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:49.410
which is probably good up through second or third grade,

186
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.270
is called Charlotte in the quiet place by [inaudible].

187
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.170
And it's a lovely story about this little girl named Charlotte who can't,

188
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.660
she lives in a busy city.
She can't find any quiet.

189
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:01.320
And she goes out for a walk with their dog.
The dog runs away,
she chases him,

190
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:04.440
and then they're both kind of panting because they'd been running.

191
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.590
And in that she finds her breath and find a quiet place.
Um,

192
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.290
but you can read a children's book to your kids.

193
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:13.470
There are some great apps for kids.
Um,
just to be clear,

194
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:15.600
screen time is not mindfulness practice,
right?

195
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.570
Because even though our kids look like they're being calm and focusing their

196
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:21.690
spacing out,
it's not mindfulness.
So that's not to say screen time is bad.

197
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:24.010
It's just to say,
don't think your kids are metaphor.

198
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.610
Meditating in front of Chi you.
Cause they're not.
Um,

199
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.080
and then you can also teach your kids specific skills and tools like breathing

200
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:34.770
activities,
noticing activities.
And I'm going to talk about some of those today,

201
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.601
but before we go on,

202
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:39.750
I want to take a minute to define mindfulness because this is a word that's all

203
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:40.890
over the place these days.

204
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:44.250
And I think many of us have misconceptions about what it is and what it isn't.

205
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.510
So the traditional sort of western definition of mindfulness,

206
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.910
which was first put forth by Jon Kabat Zinn,

207
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:55.200
who worked out at umass Worcester for a long time and he started mindfulness

208
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:56.970
based stress reduction.
Uh,

209
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:01.620
his traditional definition is paying attention to the present moment,

210
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.160
um,
in a nonjudgmental way.
Now,
I don't know about you,

211
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:06.690
but those are pretty big words for kids.

212
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.600
And I personally don't like it when somebody tells me to pay attention.

213
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.130
I don't think my kids respond particularly well.
And furthermore,
how many times,

214
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:17.400
how many of you have ever had someone tell you or defined for you or tell you

215
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:18.390
how to pay attention?

216
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

217
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.010
<v 1>Anybody I don't like.
Okay.
So what did you hear?
What,
what did somebody tell you?</v>

218
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.373
<v 2>Nope.</v>

219
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.080
<v 1>Okay.
So for everybody out there,
what he said was,
uh,</v>

220
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.020
he was told to focus on what they were saying and listen to the way they wanted

221
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:43.570
him to listen and it didn't feel very helpful.
I agree.

222
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.770
That doesn't sound very fun.
So the,
the definition I like for kids,

223
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.410
which I also borrowed components from Amy Saltzman,

224
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:53.020
who's a physician out in the bay area who also teaches mindfulness,

225
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.760
is noticing the present moment with kindness and curiosity.

226
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.090
So we can choose our next behavior that choosing the next behavior.

227
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.700
That's like the pot of gold at the parent,
at the end of the parenting rainbow,

228
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:05.740
right?
We all want kids who can take a moment and say,

229
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.030
I'm actually going to choose to use my words instead of dropping to the floor

230
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:11.380
and screaming like a crazy person.

231
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.950
So that's what we're going for with our kids and with ourselves is this sense

232
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.800
that we have some choice in what we're going to do instead of just reacting.

233
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.410
So let's,
let's break down this definition a little bit.

234
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.830
So the first part isn't noticing.
Kids know how to notice,
right?

235
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.230
My daughter can notice a baby at all from like a mile away.

236
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:28.930
She's got an insane radar for it.
Um,

237
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.370
little boys often can notice trucks and tractors and I know gender split,

238
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:35.890
Blah Blah Blah.
But what I've seen,
this is like how it seems to break down.

239
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.200
So noticing is super important because so much happens in our life that we just

240
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:45.070
don't even see it.
I mean,
we can walk through our,

241
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.610
I mean I've driven the same way to school every day and I had no idea that the

242
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:51.140
giant Santa was up on the corner until my daughters were like,
whoa,

243
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.930
they're Santa there.
And I think he'd been there for a week.

244
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:55.180
This thing is like 10 feet tall.
It's enormous.

245
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.540
I was so wrapped up in my own mind,
I missed it.
Right?
So,

246
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:02.080
so much of our life happens without noticing it.
And if we aren't noticing,

247
00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:06.160
if we aren't paying attention to use that phrase,
it'll go right past us.

248
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.760
And so how do we notice things while we can notice them with our eyes,

249
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.400
we can notice them with our ears.
With,

250
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.190
I mean all of our senses when we touch something,
when we taste it,

251
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:18.250
when we smell it,
but the art of noticing is about,

252
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.430
or paying attention is about choosing to bring our attention,

253
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:25.480
whatever part of our body we're doing that with and focus it on something,

254
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:29.800
right to like notice it,
to pay attention to it.
And then when our mind wanders,

255
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.300
we bring it back.

256
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.450
And that's the part that I think we lose in this definition is that everybody

257
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:36.010
assumes that when you're paying attention,

258
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.700
you are paying 100% attention in your mind.
Never strays.
Well,

259
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:42.490
I don't know how many of your minds can do that,
but mine certainly can't.

260
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.150
And so the trick to noticing and paying attention is to be okay when your mind

261
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:48.400
wanders and then say,
oh,
my mind just wandered.

262
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:51.850
I'm going to bring it back to what we're talking about.
So that's the first part.

263
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.060
The next part is the present moment.
Now,

264
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.660
the vast majority of us spend the vast majority of our time in the past or in

265
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:01.870
the future.
We're worried about something that may or may not happen.

266
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:05.830
We're planning for events where sort of fantasizing about how a conversation may

267
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:09.640
go or were in the past kind of regretting wishing things had been different or

268
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.620
feeling nostalgic for something that's already gone.
Um,

269
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.100
this is a very useful skill to have.
In fact,
you know,

270
00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:19.780
the caveman whenever millions of years ago who could remember that when uncle

271
00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:23.380
Joe went into that cave and got eaten by a saber tooth tiger and can plan in the

272
00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:27.130
future to not get eaten by the saber tooth tiger is the one who's more likely to

273
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:29.560
have kids and you know,
pass along his genes.

274
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.070
So this brain that can do this is a very useful thing.
And you know,

275
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.901
and now as parents,

276
00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:37.990
when we can remember the Anna Filactic shock that our kid had when she ate a

277
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:42.190
peanut and make a plan to send it peanut free cupcake to the birthday party,

278
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.390
not only are we avoiding an allergic reaction,
but potentially a major meltdown.

279
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.800
So this is a good thing.

280
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.860
The problem is our brains don't know when to turn it off,
right?

281
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.470
We're constantly doing it and there's a couple of problems with this.

282
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:59.471
One is we can't get accurate data on what's actually happening if we're not

283
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:02.480
paying attention to what's actually happening.

284
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.330
If we're too busy filtering the world around us through a lens of what's going

285
00:15:06.331 --> 00:15:08.300
to happen next,
or oh gosh,

286
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.480
this is reminding me of this thing that happened all this years ago and now I'm

287
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:14.900
sort of thinking about that and I'm not really seeing and parenting man,

288
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.900
that gets us going,
right?
Because no matter what's going on with our kids,

289
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.410
we're always sort of balancing it between what's going to happen next and what

290
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:22.790
already happened.
So my daughter,

291
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.740
when she was having a hard time learning to ride a bike,

292
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.920
I was automatically like,
she's going to be 40 and she can't ride a bike.

293
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.920
And her husband's gonna wanna like take her on this bike trip to France and

294
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:32.030
she's not going to be able to go.

295
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.280
And all their friends are gonna go and it's gonna be like this awkward thing if

296
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:37.640
it's going to cause the marital 10 what?
That's insane.

297
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.820
But that's where my brain went.
And then of course I was worried about the past,

298
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:44.540
like,
Oh man,
last summer we didn't work on the bike riding and it's my fault.

299
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:46.130
If I had worked on the bike riding last summer,

300
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:49.010
we would totally be all over this and she'd be with all these other kids riding

301
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:53.000
their bike,
like a little gang of hello kitty sparkled gangsters or something.

302
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.513
Um,

303
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.150
but what I needed was to be with their right it be with her right there in that

304
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:01.220
moment,
holding the handlebar and walking with her.

305
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:03.800
That's where we can make a difference,
right?

306
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:05.240
The president is where the action is.

307
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.540
So it's where we can get the best information on what's actually happening and

308
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:09.890
it's where we can actually take action.

309
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.040
That's why the present moment is so important.
Um,

310
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.170
let's talk about this kindness and curiosity,

311
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:19.490
but this is also the nonjudgmental thing.
So for most of us,

312
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:22.130
when we actually come to the present moment,
we immediately judge it.

313
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.670
Sometimes we judge it as pretty good and then we whip out our phones and want to

314
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:28.580
take a picture of it,
which immediately it takes us out of the present moment.

315
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:31.340
Cause then you're like,
Ooh,
I got a Facebook message.
A better check that one.

316
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.600
And all of a sudden you're like,
you know,

317
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:36.320
buried with some other person a million miles away on Facebook.
Um,

318
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.410
or we judge it is kind of boring and we don't like boring.

319
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.210
Human beings are terrible and boring.

320
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:45.410
So we really want that to be different or it's great.
And then we're like,
oh,

321
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.650
it's going to end.
This is awful or it's terrible.
And then we all,

322
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:51.650
we can think about his house and we can get out of it.
Most of us,

323
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:53.690
most of the time are not walking around going,
Huh,

324
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.550
these are pretty okay right now.

325
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.770
All right with this or most of the time we're not curious like what's going on.

326
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.250
So if we're in a like a terrible traffic situation,
it's like,
wow,

327
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:08.210
this is miserable.
I'm never going to get to work on time as opposed to,
Huh,

328
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.050
why is all this traffic here?
Which it sounds like a really ridiculous question,

329
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.300
but it gets you out of this crazy mind.

330
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.910
So when we can be in the present moment with his kind,
curious stance,

331
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:23.060
not only is it sort of a much more pleasant way to be,

332
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.510
but we're more likely to take more effective action.

333
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.750
So there's this whole field of study now called self compassion.

334
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.230
How many of you like have that word come into your lives on a daily basis?

335
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.700
Even a regular basis?
Well,
my husband,
but yeah.
Okay.
Um,

336
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.900
so what researchers have found is that when you take a compassionate response to

337
00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:47.630
anything that's happening in your life,
especially difficult things,

338
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.190
you are much more likely to take the next.

339
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.500
Your next action is much more likely to be more effective.

340
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.570
So let me give you an example that um,
most women,
many men can relate to.

341
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.260
You decide you're going to go on a diet and two days later you find yourself

342
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:05.070
eating an Oreo.
Now what most people think after they eat the Oreo,

343
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.600
I suck.
I'm miserable.
This,
everybody else can dye it and I can't.
This is so hard.

344
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:12.150
It's never going to happen.
Forget it.
And then what happens?

345
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.680
You eat the whole sleeve,
it's gone,
right?
The Oreos are gone.

346
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.810
But if your responses,
Huh,
that was interesting,
why did I do that?

347
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.340
Dieting is really hard.
Everyone struggles with it.
It's okay,
I made a mistake.

348
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.430
You are much more likely to put those Oreos away.

349
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.220
And this is true for almost every behavior change.

350
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.370
So sometimes when we talk about self compassion,

351
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:36.690
it can sound a little touchy feely.

352
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:40.110
It's actually an incredibly effective way to approach our own experience and our

353
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:43.920
kids experience.
And then the last one is sort of choosing our next behavior,

354
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.250
right?

355
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.820
So we've got noticing the present moment with kindness and curiosity so we can

356
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:50.910
choose our next behavior.
This whole noticing the present moment,

357
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:52.200
kindness and curiosity bit.

358
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.130
That's all about creating enough space in our awareness so we can figure out

359
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:59.670
what's actually going on and then make the best and most skillful choice about

360
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:03.630
what to do next.
Because most of the time it's like something happens,

361
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:07.440
we get this input and then we immediately react,
boom.
And that reaction,

362
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.220
it could be from a place of worry,
it could be from a place of anxiety,

363
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:14.220
it could be from a place of remembering something that happened two weeks or 20

364
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:16.920
years ago.
And we don't even know that we're remembering it.
Right?

365
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:20.070
Our brains work that amazingly,
that all of a sudden we're triggered,

366
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.750
our kid spills the milk,
the cheerio's,
right?
And we're flipping out at our kid,

367
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.380
not because we actually care about the spilled milk or cheerio's,

368
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.760
but because when we were kids,

369
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:32.850
we got yelled at for spelling Milken Cheerio's and it triggers that automatic

370
00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:36.450
reaction.
So we can,
we can slow down and say,
Huh,
that's interesting.

371
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.370
Sounds really cheesy when I say it,

372
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:40.230
but when you do it enough times in your brain,
you get used to it.

373
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.240
Then we can say,
okay,

374
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.300
my kids spilled the milk and Cheerio's what is the most effective way to respond

375
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:49.020
to this?
And then you figure it out.
So does that all make sense right now?

376
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.660
All right.
So if we start with this mindfulness definition,

377
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.200
let's take a minute to talk about why do we actually want this for our kids and

378
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:59.250
ourselves.
Like why we parents have enough on our plate to figure out,
right?

379
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.700
Why interject this new practice,
this new idea?
Well,

380
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.800
there has been a shocking amount of research on this with kids,
um,

381
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.270
primarily in schools and clinics where they're teaching it to children.
Uh,

382
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.630
and what they found is everything we want for our child,
right?

383
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.240
Growing awareness of our body,
of their bodies,

384
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.300
their thoughts and their emotions and an increased ability to verbalize it.

385
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.420
And how great would it be if every time our kids were having a hard time,

386
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:24.540
they came to us and said,
gee,
mom,
I'm having a hard time today.

387
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:25.530
I think my stomach hurts.

388
00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:29.310
Can you please help me find a solution to this as opposed to like melting down

389
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.750
and flipping out in the car on the way to school.
Right.
So kids do that.
Um,

390
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.630
increased resilience and ability to soothe themselves,

391
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.970
to calm down and to regulate their emotions.

392
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.850
This is something most of us grown ups are still working on.

393
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.340
If we can start to help our kids do it,
that's amazing.

394
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.710
Increased empathy is stronger sense of other people's emotions.

395
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:51.430
Improve competence,
concentration and ability to focus better sleep.

396
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.910
That's a good one,
right?
Um,
increased confidence,
decreased anxiety,

397
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:58.750
like all of these things.
And it sounds like this panacea,

398
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:02.590
like this magic potion and it's not.
But if you think of all of these things,

399
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.770
so many of them happen.
So many of the challenges we face,

400
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:09.190
not being able to concentrate now struggling with big feelings,

401
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:11.440
not knowing how to manage them,
not sleeping well at night.

402
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.680
So many of those come from this awareness and this attention that's all over the

403
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:19.520
place.
It's like that pinball machine you guys have right here.
Uh,

404
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.110
the thoughts are like constantly bouncing around and that makes it hard to do

405
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:24.730
the things we want and need to do in life.

406
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.190
So the good news is that our children are already a little zen masters.

407
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.980
Now there's two ways to think about this.
One,

408
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:35.530
the role of a zen master is to constantly push your buttons.

409
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.100
So you have lots of opportunities to practice mindfulness and I'm sure that's

410
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:41.770
the one many of you can relate to,
right?
Um,

411
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:47.370
but I would argue that children are also capable of great mindfulness of moments

412
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:51.580
of intense awareness,
concentration and presence.

413
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.640
The problem is they always want to do it when we need them to put on their shoes

414
00:21:54.641 --> 00:21:57.490
so they can get out the door.
Having said that,

415
00:21:57.491 --> 00:22:01.930
I would like you to read you a section from the book about sort of encouraging

416
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.630
these mindful moments in our kids,

417
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.140
how we can sort of recognize and support when our kids are already being
mindful.

418
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:12.250
Inherently,
I'm sure you've witnessed your child having a mindful moment.

419
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.510
Perhaps it's when he is intent on building the tallest lego tower ever or

420
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:20.170
spending an elaborate fairy tale about fairies living in the bedside table,

421
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.670
elaborate tale or is focused on hearing every word and note have a favorite
song.

422
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.210
Maybe it's when he's in the zone on the soccer field about to score a goal.

423
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.120
While none of these may seem like particularly mindful moments,

424
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.540
they are when your child is focused on just one thing.

425
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.680
When he's fully engaged,
not judging himself or wishing something were different,

426
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.220
he is practicing mindfulness even though he's not sitting cross legged on the

427
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:43.420
floor with his eyes closed.

428
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.270
When your child is expressing interest in the world around him,

429
00:22:46.271 --> 00:22:49.930
by mushing has banana between his fingers to see what it feels like or by

430
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:53.800
stopping to notice a flower growing through a crack in the pavement or by asking

431
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:55.630
questions about what happens when we die,

432
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.720
why we have to eat vegetables or the shape of the human body.

433
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:02.770
He's being mindfully curious around about the world,
around him.
And finally,

434
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:06.070
when your child is being aware of and concerned about someone else's feelings or

435
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:07.540
health or wellbeing,

436
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.230
when he brings a special toy to a crying sibling or makes a card for a friend's

437
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:13.870
birthday or visits the sick friend after school,

438
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.550
he's practicing mindful compassion.

439
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.320
These moments are important for several reasons.

440
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.270
Each time our children are concentrating,

441
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.260
being curious or creative or demonstrating compassion.
See what I did there.

442
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:30.100
Concentrating,
curious,
creative compassion.
All the cs help you remember.

443
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.820
They are learning to pay attention and notice what is happening within them and

444
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:36.130
around them.
They are learning to make connections,

445
00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:38.800
think in new ways and respond skillfully to difficult,

446
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:40.600
challenging or boring situations.

447
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.920
They are practicing empathy and kindness towards themselves or others and they

448
00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:48.140
are on their own inner experience for inspiration,
guidance,

449
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:51.320
and soothing rather than counting on someone else to do it for them.

450
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.480
The more often they do all of these things,

451
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:57.160
the more likely they will be able to do them in the future because even the

452
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.310
seemingly small behaviors are developing and strengthening habits and skills and

453
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:03.590
the neural connections in the relevant parts of their brains.

454
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.400
These are just a few of the reasons why it's important to practice mindfulness

455
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:09.980
with our children when they're calm,
happy,
and doing well.

456
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.220
The other reason is that those are the times when they're most likely to be

457
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:15.200
receptive to what we're trying to teach them.

458
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.530
The more they practice these skills when they are in a good space,

459
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.920
the more likely they'll be able to access and utilize them in difficult moments.

460
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.170
As one of my mindfulness teachers once put it,

461
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.120
you can't practice crisis meditation.

462
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.380
As our children get better practicing mindfulness in the calm,

463
00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:31.190
an uneventful moments of daily life,

464
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.280
the more likely they'll you'll be able to access this skill.

465
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.950
They'll be able to access this skill when we really want them to,

466
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.860
when they're overcome with anger,
anxiety or sadness.

467
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.820
Actively teaching your children about the ideas and practices of mindfulness is

468
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:47.630
part of the process to be sure and will be covered more later chapters.
However,

469
00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:49.250
you'll be most successful in your endeavors.

470
00:24:49.251 --> 00:24:52.460
If you can notice when your child is already being his own little zen master and

471
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:55.730
support him in that process or at the very least not getting the way.

472
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.160
So two important points here.

473
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:03.161
One is that we need to find and create those times in our lives when our kids

474
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:05.270
can be mindful and we can stay out of their way.

475
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.220
Because so often we're nudging and nagging and let's go and let's go and we got

476
00:25:08.221 --> 00:25:10.310
to do this next thing and you've got to clean up your room and it's time to do

477
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:10.761
your homework.

478
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:13.580
And we got to get ready for dinner that we don't give them that space.

479
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.040
And so I was guilty of that too.

480
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:20.900
This year we had our kids in swimming guitar and dance and they're in

481
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:23.660
kindergarten and first grade.
And somehow when I set this all up,

482
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:26.450
it seemed reasonable.
And now that I say it,
it seems totally ridiculous.

483
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.680
But what I realized is that they had no free time and they needed time to just

484
00:25:30.681 --> 00:25:33.170
sit and be in play.
And I was seeing it in their behavior.

485
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:36.320
They were getting grumpy and irritable and basically we'd spend all day Saturday

486
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:38.720
managing tantrums because they were exhausted after the week.

487
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.800
So swimming and guitar out there doing dance on Sunday mornings because we need

488
00:25:42.801 --> 00:25:45.860
some place to take them in the winter on the weekends and that's it.

489
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:49.130
And we come home from school and I'm like,
go play,
I'm making dinner.

490
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.100
And sometimes they need a little help getting into it,
but once they're into it,

491
00:25:52.101 --> 00:25:55.140
it's their space to kind of be present and creative.
Um,

492
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:57.310
and they really need that.
Uh,

493
00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.170
and this is a big challenge for us parents parenting in this cohort,

494
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:03.620
in this culture because it's like we have to prepare our kids for everything.

495
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.350
They have to be able to play an instrument and speak a language where they will

496
00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:07.400
never work at Google.

497
00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:13.100
And the thing about that is they also need the emotional skills to deal with

498
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.300
boredom and frustration because we can send them to every math camp.

499
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.360
But if they get frustrated when they get one problem wrong and they give up on

500
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:22.160
the test,
it doesn't matter how much they know,

501
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.190
and especially at the younger ages,
but it all ages.

502
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:28.160
We need to create this space for our kids.
Um,

503
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.940
the next thing I would say that's super important is the reason that many of us

504
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:35.450
come to mindfulness for ourselves and for our children is to deal with our own

505
00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:37.940
personal challenges and our children's challenges.
Like,
Dear God,

506
00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:40.760
I want this child to stop melting down in Panera.
I can't deal with this.

507
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.310
And so then what we do is we bust out our little trick when they're having a

508
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:46.320
hard time that doesn't work.

509
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:51.410
That's like you trying to teach me to code computer languages when I'm like

510
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.320
really sad about something or really angry,
it's not going to happen.

511
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:58.590
Like we can't integrate new information when we're in a bad space emotionally,

512
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.390
especially little ones.
But all of us,

513
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:03.090
their brains are just flooded with hormones when they're melting down,

514
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:05.550
they can't even hear the words coming out of your mouth,

515
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.740
much less learn something new from that you.

516
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.700
So we have to find ways to start integrating this into our daily lives when

517
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:16.020
they're calm and happy and feeling connected.
And if we do that often enough,

518
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.240
then they'll have it available when they really need it.
So the other day,

519
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:25.470
my five and a half year old was sitting on the couch like this
and I was like,

520
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:29.430
rose,
what are you doing?
And she's like,
I'm visibly upset,
Mommy.
I'm weaving.

521
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.030
And like,
this is not the breathing.
Again.

522
00:27:32.031 --> 00:27:33.570
I think is really going to help her calm down.

523
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:37.410
But for a month now we've been practicing breathing and doing breathing.

524
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:40.470
And finally she was like trying to breathe in the middle of a meltdown.

525
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:40.831
And I was like,

526
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:43.800
that is a huge win right there even though she was actually hyperventilating.

527
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:45.450
But we'll get there.
Um,

528
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.990
so starting at when your kids are in a good space and working on this and as

529
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:53.640
you'll notice in the book,
it doesn't have to be a huge thing.

530
00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:56.130
It's not like we're going to pull out the meditation cushions and light the

531
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:59.520
incense and bang the,
you know,
singing bowl and sit down and breathe.

532
00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:03.000
Like if that's your style,
that's fantastic.
But if it's like,
hey,

533
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:06.630
let's sit down and play Legos and I'm going to work really hard not to nag you

534
00:28:06.631 --> 00:28:09.000
about how to make that tower the most stable tower ever.

535
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.910
And I'm just gonna let you be.
Or if it's like,
you know,

536
00:28:11.911 --> 00:28:14.040
my daughters and I will sit on the front porch and I'll say,

537
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.140
let's just listen for sounds.

538
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.800
I'll give you one minute and I want you to report back to me two sounds.

539
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.890
And the minute is actually like 25 seconds because that's what they can handle

540
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:23.724
right now.

541
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.760
But they get quiet and they listen for two sounds and then I'll say,

542
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:33.090
let's just sit together and breathe for 10 seconds.
Can we notice our breathing?

543
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.190
My seven year old can definitely do 10 seconds.

544
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:39.720
My five year old is like four seconds.
My brain is like two seconds.
So,

545
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.381
but you know,

546
00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:43.470
practicing these things and finding ways to work them into your daily life.

547
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:45.270
If you have a religious or spiritual practice,

548
00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:48.810
you can say your prayers together and recognize that as a mindfulness practice

549
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.200
and many of these these things,
when you read the book,
you'll be like,
oh,

550
00:28:52.201 --> 00:28:54.000
I'm already doing that.
We play Jenga.

551
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.230
I didn't know that was a mindfulness practice.
The trick is deciding.
It is.

552
00:28:58.231 --> 00:29:01.170
So making a point to pay attention and the notice when your attention has

553
00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:02.550
wandered and then bring it back.

554
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.500
And so all of these things when we really make a point to insert them into our

555
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.180
day,
um,
are going to end up being quite useful.
Uh,
let's see.

556
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:16.990
So I want to give you a couple of tricks and tips before I leave.
Um,

557
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.040
my favorite mindfulness trick is that you can't be curious and angry at the same

558
00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:24.804
time.

559
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.530
This is extremely cool and I never noticed it until someone told me recently.

560
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.890
But curiosity comes from our prefrontal Cortex,
which is right up here.

561
00:29:31.891 --> 00:29:36.090
And it requires that this part of our brain that can plan and think and process

562
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:40.290
and manage emotions that this part is online and anger comes from back here,

563
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.500
right?
This is like the reptilian fight,
flight freak out,

564
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:46.960
freeze part of our brain that's like,
I can't even think.

565
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:49.030
And even though you just offered me a snack and ice cream,

566
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:51.100
I'm still screaming at you because I'm losing my mind.

567
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.000
So those can't function at the same time.
They just can't.

568
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.000
So when this part's turned on,
our kids can't think or do anything.

569
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:01.270
But if we can get this part to come online,
the back calms down a little bit.

570
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.050
So one of the tricks I'll do with my daughter when she's really losing it,

571
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.860
and I have to wait until she's calm enough to at least hear my voice,
um,

572
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.200
is I'll try to get our curious about the world around us.

573
00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:14.080
So if we were in this room together and she was losing it,
I'd say,
Hey,

574
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:18.580
can you find a screen in this room?
Like make it really easy to start.

575
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:21.550
So I'm not going to say,
can you find somebody who's wearing brown boots?

576
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.790
That's too much.
And then can you find me like a chair?

577
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.540
And sometimes if she sold lots of,
like she couldn't find a chair in this room,

578
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:33.310
but make it really easy and see if he can get them curious.
Now if you know,

579
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:35.710
my older daughter will say to me,
don't,
don't do that trick on me.

580
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:37.960
I don't want that trick.
I want to be angry.
And I'm like,
okay.

581
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.970
Then you let her be angry and you're,

582
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.470
your job in that moment is to stay calm so she can get through the anger.
Um,

583
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.190
so that's a nifty trick also in life when you're getting like pissed off.

584
00:30:48.191 --> 00:30:51.910
Like when I'm pissed off in traffic,
I tried to get curious about um,
tail lights,

585
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.780
tail lights come in,
a lot of different shapes and sizes.
It's amazing.

586
00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:58.120
I had no idea.
And I'm like,
Ooh,
there's a round one.

587
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.560
So can you get curious about something?
It really helps you calm down.
Um,

588
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.340
and then I want to read you a little bit about something called a cool down

589
00:31:06.341 --> 00:31:11.050
corner,
which is a very helpful,
uh,
space to set up for a kid.

590
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.290
And I also thought it'd be appropriate for Google because you guys have like a

591
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:18.470
million of them here and they're shaped like airplanes and jails and really
cool,

592
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.080
well not jails,
that's not the best example,

593
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:23.740
but so creating a calm down corner.

594
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.920
In addition to making a more mindful environment throughout your house,

595
00:31:26.921 --> 00:31:28.300
which is something I talk about in the book,

596
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.390
you may want to consider creating a special calm down corner.

597
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.180
This can be a small room or even a corner of a room,

598
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.730
a small comfortable chair or an indoor child's tent.

599
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.150
The idea is to create a space that is conducive to a calm,

600
00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:44.230
mindful experience and that specifically cues your child to get quiet and

601
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:45.064
focused.

602
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.420
It's a good idea to involve your child as much as possible in the design of the

603
00:31:48.421 --> 00:31:50.260
space and in choosing what to put in it.

604
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.290
You want it to be decorated in a way that appeals to him or her,

605
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.200
keeps her interested and helps her get in.
Stay calm.

606
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.180
Here are a few ideas to keep in mind.

607
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.330
You can choose a common theme for the space,
but you don't have to.

608
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.350
I have one friend who named her kids space,

609
00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:07.030
the cool down corner and filled it with books about Antarctica as well as a few

610
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:11.050
stuff.
Polar bears and penguins.
Another friend created a Seton space.

611
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.070
She and her son cut out some stars and planets to hang from the sky and included

612
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:18.190
a few favorite stuffed alien doll and a few different space.

613
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.270
Theme toys and books.

614
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:23.080
Choose a few toys that your child would like to have or activities she can do

615
00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:26.950
completely unsupervised.
So like if Plato freaks you out,

616
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:30.160
don't put the Plato in there like put stuff that you can leave the kid alone

617
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:30.994
with.

618
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.640
You'll want to work with her to choose things that are age or developmentally

619
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:34.474
appropriate.

620
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.590
Don't put too much stuff in the calm down corner regardless of how cluttered the

621
00:32:38.591 --> 00:32:41.900
rest of your house may be.
This is an area that should have just a few items.

622
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.470
Too much stuff will make it hard for your child to focus and choose what to do.

623
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.010
You want to include items and toys that are known and comforting to your little

624
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:52.400
one,
not items to challenge her to try new or different activities.

625
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.850
No need to spend much money you likely already have or can make anything you

626
00:32:55.851 --> 00:32:58.130
want to include.
No screens,

627
00:32:58.131 --> 00:33:02.090
tablets or electronic toys in the calm down corner with the exception of an MP

628
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:05.510
three or CD player loaded with guided meditations and you can get them on like

629
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:05.841
Ebay,

630
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:10.490
really cheap that don't have a screen on them like the old school iPod ones.

631
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.570
This is not a timeout spot and your child should not be forced into it.

632
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.940
It may be a spot she chooses instead of timeouts.

633
00:33:16.941 --> 00:33:18.410
If you use timeouts in your house,

634
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.570
but it should always be a place she goes willingly.

635
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.600
You want your child to have positive associations with the calm down corner,

636
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:25.790
which won't feel easy if it feels like a jail cell to her.

637
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.870
The calm down corner is a sacred space where shouting,
nagging,
arguing,

638
00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:32.570
discussing,
questioning,
and negotiating are not allowed.

639
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.750
This space isn't for figuring things out or rehashing problems.

640
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:39.800
It's just for being,
breathing and doing quiet soothing activities.
That's all.

641
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:41.060
Once you're there,
you're safe.

642
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.540
And that last pit is the hardest part for me because I want to like go after my

643
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:48.170
kid and be like,
wait,
we're not done talking about this.
Not the time to do that.

644
00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.420
If you don't have the space in your house to do that,

645
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:54.080
you can also create like a calm down box or a little cloth bag and you can put,

646
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.950
um,
my kids love silly putty is always a good choice and it doesn't,

647
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.340
I mean it can sort of get mashed into a rug,
but not as bad as Plato.
Um,

648
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.370
like they sell little glitter ones that are nice things to look at,

649
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.040
a small notepad and some pens.

650
00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:09.740
If your kid isn't a Rubik's cubes and that's not going to stress her out,

651
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:10.580
something like that.

652
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.050
Anything they can sort of manipulate with their bodies is really useful.
Um,

653
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:15.850
or that will,

654
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.070
I mean some kids really like strong sense so you can find a little sentence

655
00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:20.000
pillow to put in there.

656
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:22.910
Whatever works for your kid and you really have to pay attention to your child

657
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.670
because everybody's got different things that work.

658
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:29.690
And then the last trick I really have is get your kids outside as much as

659
00:34:29.691 --> 00:34:33.230
possible.
And I know we all hear this and when somebody tells me that,

660
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:35.510
and I'm going to stress moment,
I'm like,
I can't even deal.

661
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:37.970
And have you met Boston winter?
Like don't talk to me.

662
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.470
But it makes a huge difference.
There's not as much clutter about around it.

663
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:43.850
Kids can move their bodies more.

664
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.700
All of this helps us get into a more mindful space.

665
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.210
And so in the winter we bundle our kids up and we go outside and sometimes we

666
00:34:50.211 --> 00:34:54.050
spend 10 minutes getting dressed in five minutes outside and that's okay.

667
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.380
But it's much more easy for kids to get into mindful space when they're outside.

668
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.970
So those are some ideas.
There's a lot more in the book.

669
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.060
And at the risk of sounding like a TV salesperson,

670
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.570
there are over a hundred activities in this book.
And,
um,

671
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.630
I interviewed 30 different parents for this because there are many,

672
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:14.360
many great books on the market about teaching mindfulness to children.

673
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:16.400
And I can recommend some to folks who are interested.

674
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.300
Most of them are based on the author's experiences in schools and clinics,

675
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.310
which is really useful and important.

676
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.790
But anyone who has ever tried to teach their own child anything knows it's

677
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.800
really different from how kids learn at school.

678
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.980
And there's all sorts of dynamics that happen at home and we also have lots of

679
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:33.970
opportunities at home that don't happen at school.
Um,

680
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.830
but I wanted this book to be representative of a lot of different families

681
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.020
experiences cause my family is quirky and we have our own preferences in a

682
00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:41.160
certain way of doing things.

683
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.490
So I talked to 30 different parents about how they do this at home.

684
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:48.480
So there's a whole lot of activities and ideas in here and choose the ones that

685
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:51.960
work for you and make up your own.
And don't worry if some don't work for you.

686
00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:56.010
It's not your Gig.
That's fine.
But that's the book.
That's the talk.

687
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.570
Hopefully we have some time for questions.
Oh,
here's somebody you mentioned a one

688
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.710
<v 3>picture book to share with kids in the course of it.</v>

689
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.160
I wonder if you had any suggestions for even moving older,

690
00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:09.780
the 10 and 11 year old,

691
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.100
who one is old enough to recognize?
Wow,

692
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:18.250
I regularly screw things up when I get really stressed out.
And you know,

693
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.200
I say things that uh,

694
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.350
I don't want to say so little older than picture book that maybe not ready to

695
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.840
just take an adult self help book off the shelf and

696
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.660
<v 1>plow.
This is a question I frequently get.</v>

697
00:36:30.661 --> 00:36:33.870
It talks and I've been looking for something and I haven't found anything I love

698
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:36.810
for that age.
There is,
and again,

699
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:41.430
I don't like pushing his screen time for this particular issue because it's not

700
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:45.420
really what we're going for.
But there's a website,
I think I could be wrong.

701
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:47.610
I think it's called [inaudible] dot com okay.

702
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.650
But if you look up like zen anxiety,
kids,
youtube,

703
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.380
it'll pop up.
And whether or not anxieties the issue,

704
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.200
I know that that's one of the things they addressed and they have some pretty

705
00:36:58.201 --> 00:37:01.650
good animations that are helpful.
Great damage.
Yeah,
please.

706
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.670
Then hour does it not work?
Oh yeah.

707
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.830
So the question was does it not work for kids under three?
No,

708
00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:10.200
we definitely works for kids under three.

709
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:12.720
I mean my publisher was like picking age range and I was like,
okay.

710
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.740
But I mean the reality is it's all about figuring out what works for your kids.

711
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:20.820
Like under three you can totally start doing these activities with your kids.

712
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.670
The ones that are going to be most effective is the ones you practice.

713
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.840
And then it sort of leaks out for lack of a better term to your children.

714
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:31.960
So when we can stay calm,
when our children wake up from the nap screaming,
um,

715
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.370
that's a great one.
When we can let our,
you know,

716
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.880
toddlers and little ones have the space and the time to just play and explore

717
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:42.000
the environment.
And we're not like getting in their space.

718
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.390
And I never thought this would be a thing I did until I had kids.

719
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:48.300
But then I'm like,
oh,
you're playing,
let's make your play better.

720
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.660
Like let me get in your space and help you make that better.
And we,

721
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.320
Josh and I stopped doing this when we read a quote by Jack Black,
the actor,

722
00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.450
he said,
uh,
in USA Today,
never give a happy child ice cream.
And I was like,
oh,

723
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:03.030
that's right.
I'll say the ice cream for when,
you know,

724
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:05.970
maybe they're not so happy,
bribed them with ice cream.
No,
but um,

725
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.760
like just if they're,
if they're doing well,

726
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:12.600
we were alone and that's surprisingly hard to do when it's especially me.

727
00:38:12.601 --> 00:38:13.680
I want to get like in it.

728
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.910
And then Josh was like ice cream and then I can like step away.
So,
um,

729
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.350
with the little ones and also food is a great time to let them sort of mindfully

730
00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:24.510
be curious if you can tolerate it right.

731
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:26.790
Because then you end up with food all over the place and it's like,

732
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.800
I just gave you a bath and now you have hummus and your hair.

733
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.520
But if you can let them really explore food and kind of sit with it and mush it

734
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:34.590
around,
that's a great practice for little ones too.

735
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:41.430
<v 4>Do you have any tips for parents in the moment when kids are freaking out with</v>

736
00:38:41.431 --> 00:38:43.270
the parents that are freaking out because of it?

737
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.820
<v 1>Yes.
Tips were parents who are freaking out in the moment.</v>

738
00:38:46.821 --> 00:38:48.380
So that's what the first book is about.

739
00:38:48.381 --> 00:38:51.470
It's called parenting in the present moment.
But briefly,
yes,

740
00:38:51.471 --> 00:38:55.280
when you are freaking out,
my tips are,
see if you can breathe,

741
00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.200
like pay attention to your breath.

742
00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.560
And a lot of times people think breathing meditation is this like whole big

743
00:39:00.561 --> 00:39:00.981
thing.

744
00:39:00.981 --> 00:39:03.860
Like you have to breathe in for four and breathe out for seven and then stand on

745
00:39:03.861 --> 00:39:06.230
your head and then like chant a mantra.

746
00:39:06.231 --> 00:39:10.010
It's not just notice your breath however it is,
wherever it is.

747
00:39:10.011 --> 00:39:12.920
Some people notice it in their nose,
some people notice it in their chest,

748
00:39:12.921 --> 00:39:17.750
some people notice it in their belly.
Just notice and that'll like calm you down.

749
00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:22.430
Um,
another one is like for some people putting their hands on a countertop that

750
00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:26.150
works for me,
Connie,
to get grounded.
For some people just sitting down,

751
00:39:26.151 --> 00:39:30.470
like feeling your body in contact with something firm can help you feel
grounded.

752
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.340
Um,
and then remembering a few things.
One is unless your child is endangering,

753
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.710
you don't have to react right away,

754
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.840
which it can be such a hard thing when they're screaming.

755
00:39:38.841 --> 00:39:40.790
Like they can screen for a minute,
they can tolerate it,

756
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.510
especially if they know there that you're around and they're safe.

757
00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.880
And if they ask you something and you don't know what to do,

758
00:39:46.881 --> 00:39:49.580
like you don't have to have an answer,
right?
You can say,

759
00:39:49.581 --> 00:39:52.150
I need some time to think about that.
Um,

760
00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.280
and the other thing is that you can always start a mindfulness practice again

761
00:39:58.041 --> 00:40:01.010
and again and again.
So there's a saying in the mindfulness world,

762
00:40:01.011 --> 00:40:03.110
which is that it's really easy to be mindful.

763
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:06.050
It's really hard to remember to be mindful.

764
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.050
And so some of us will get to this place where it's like,
ah,

765
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.140
it's the end of the day and I forgot to do laundry.
And I forgot to be mindful.

766
00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:13.130
I totally screwed that up.

767
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.830
And then we beat ourselves up because we want to be these calm parents and

768
00:40:15.831 --> 00:40:17.150
instead we yelled at our kids.

769
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:21.050
So that moment when you notice that you're ramped up,

770
00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.540
that you're a million miles away,
that you're yelling,
whatever it is.

771
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:25.490
That's what Sharon Salzberg,

772
00:40:25.491 --> 00:40:30.290
who's a very well regarded and one of the leading meditation teachers in this

773
00:40:30.291 --> 00:40:35.180
country.
She calls it the magic moment.
Any moment you notice and become aware,

774
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.510
I am losing it with my kid is the moment you can choose to make a different

775
00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:39.290
choice.

776
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.840
And every once in a while I have enough awareness that I will actually stop

777
00:40:41.841 --> 00:40:43.310
yelling at my kids made yell.

778
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.690
And it's surprisingly effective because they're expecting this rant and then all

779
00:40:47.691 --> 00:40:50.300
of a sudden you just stop and they're like,
Whoa,
what happened?

780
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.690
And so whenever you can catch it,
you can always stop.

781
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.400
And we also have this thing with parenting that we have to be consistent,
right?

782
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.550
So once you've laid the law down,
like you cannot change your mind to ever,

783
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.570
it's actually not true.
Like we make mistakes.
We say the wrong thing,

784
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:08.060
we set a limit that's not the right one.
Or we don't set enough of a limit.

785
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:12.620
You can go back and say,
actually,
I changed my mind.
Right?
But that it's,

786
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.450
it's important that we've,
when it can't,

787
00:41:14.451 --> 00:41:17.840
it comes from a mindful place as opposed to,
I'm going to set this limit,

788
00:41:17.841 --> 00:41:19.790
but now you're being a jerk about it and I don't really want to fight with you

789
00:41:19.791 --> 00:41:22.040
and I'm tired and I just want you to go to bed so I can watch my TV shows.

790
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:24.950
So I'm gonna change my mind.
Like that's not really so effective.

791
00:41:24.951 --> 00:41:27.170
But when you can say,
Huh,
now that I'm calm,

792
00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:29.810
I realized I didn't actually mean that.
That's a better way.

793
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.850
But check out the first book parenting in the present moment.

794
00:41:31.851 --> 00:41:32.571
It's got some good tips.

795
00:41:32.571 --> 00:41:34.760
And also last tip and then I see there's another question.

796
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.940
Start practicing this when your calm,

797
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.830
because just like we talked about with your kids,

798
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:41.870
you can't teach them a new skill when they're freaking out.

799
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.390
We can't teach ourselves a new scale when we're freaking out.

800
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:48.170
So if we expect ourselves to be able to start a mindfulness practice when our

801
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:51.110
kids are like really pushing our buttons,
it's not going to happen.

802
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.800
So either try meditation,
which is a great one.
Or if you're like,

803
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:57.200
I am not sitting on a cushion right now,
that's not happening lady.

804
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.920
Then the other thing you can do is pick one or two activities you know you do

805
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:02.900
every day and pay attention to them.

806
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.500
And when your mind wanders as it will after about two seconds come back.

807
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:10.340
So for me,
it's taking a shower.
I can get to the end of my shower,
my hair is wet,

808
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:12.200
I have no idea if I watched it.
Not a clue.

809
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.710
And so can you pick one or two things you enjoy doing?

810
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.890
Don't make it harder than it has to be drinking your coffee,

811
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.500
reading to your kids,
whatever it is,
and just pay attention.
So that's the,

812
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.620
those are things that'll help.
And the more you do that,

813
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.100
the more you bring gets better noticing,
the more likely you will be to notice.

814
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:29.623
Yeah,
please.

815
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:34.810
<v 5>Um,
this book looks great and really looking forward to reading it.
Thanks.</v>

816
00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.500
One place that we found the good ideas tend to break down is,
um,

817
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.880
when we have multiple kids and I'm curious to know whether the book addresses it

818
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.841
or not.

819
00:42:45.841 --> 00:42:50.250
I'm thinking of the calm down space in my house that would turn into the thunder

820
00:42:50.251 --> 00:42:51.084
dome.

821
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.053
<v 1>Yes.</v>

822
00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.130
<v 5>Kid.
We could maybe do that,</v>

823
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.770
but then especially if there's just one parent at home,
yeah.

824
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.400
You got to go make dinner.
Um,
and usually,
you know,
we,

825
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:05.230
we try good ideas and then it's either yelling or TV,
you know,
it was like,
yeah,

826
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.230
those become our two options.
So I'm just curious if you have,
you know,

827
00:43:08.231 --> 00:43:11.640
when you're outnumbered.
Uh,
yeah.
Anything in the book or otherwise that,
okay.

828
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.720
<v 1>How many kids do you have?</v>

829
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:14.260
<v 5>A three so far.</v>

830
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.770
<v 1>Yes.
So you are well out numbered if you know this is a huge problem.</v>

831
00:43:17.771 --> 00:43:21.910
So the calm down space,
you're right,
this is a great,
a big issue that comes up,

832
00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.360
but you can still do it with a calm down space.
Even with multiple kids.

833
00:43:25.361 --> 00:43:26.810
And like in my daughter's classrooms,

834
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.050
in every classroom at my daughter's school from k through eight,

835
00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.960
they have a calm down space.
It's one space for like 24 kids.

836
00:43:31.961 --> 00:43:34.540
So they have to take turns and my daughter will come home frustrated sometimes

837
00:43:34.541 --> 00:43:35.980
that she didn't get her term.
That's fine.

838
00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.790
So having a space in the house is a good idea.
But yes,

839
00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.510
when all three kids are melting down,
um,

840
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.610
that's when you have to put down the knife and like,

841
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.200
which I'm making reference to my own experience.

842
00:43:47.201 --> 00:43:51.790
I'm not implying you carry knives around,
although,
um,
and,
and go be with them.

843
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.080
And that's a moment.

844
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.430
So one of the words that comes up a lot in mindfulness world is acceptance.

845
00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.400
I don't love that word because it's like we have to accept and just be okay that

846
00:44:00.401 --> 00:44:03.610
our kids are going to like cry forever.
I like the word acknowledgement better.

847
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:07.780
You have to just acknowledge in that moment that everyone is melting down and

848
00:44:07.781 --> 00:44:10.840
you have to make the best choice you can.
And sometimes the best choices,
TB,

849
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:16.470
like practicing mindfulness does not mean we do the number one best parenting

850
00:44:16.811 --> 00:44:18.550
intervention at all times.
And in fact,

851
00:44:18.551 --> 00:44:22.150
I would argue that's not helpful for your kids because then your kids learn that

852
00:44:22.151 --> 00:44:24.970
all of their needs will be met in the most effective way at every moment,

853
00:44:24.971 --> 00:44:28.720
which guess what is not how the world works.
So sometimes you yell,

854
00:44:28.721 --> 00:44:30.010
sometimes you turn on the TV,

855
00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.210
but when your kids are old enough that you can start to strategize.

856
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.330
Like can one of them go to their rooms if they need a break and by choice,

857
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.520
you know,
can you use the calm down corner?

858
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.880
Maybe a kid needs to plug in some headphones and listen to a guided meditation.

859
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.980
Maybe.
You know,
I mean it's,
it really involves a lot of creativity.

860
00:44:46.981 --> 00:44:48.660
But you can do it with more than one kid.

861
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:50.430
You just can't expect to do it perfectly all the time.

862
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.050
And that's when the self compassion and kindness and curiosity is really

863
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:57.840
important because it's like,
oh well I just lost it.

864
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.460
And so can I be nice to myself and forgive myself?
Because when you,
most of us,

865
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:05.370
when we do an unskillful parenting intervention,

866
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.160
we tend to beat ourselves up about it.
I'm a terrible parent.

867
00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:11.410
I can't believe I lost it.
Everybody else is doing it better.
Um,

868
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.440
and then we get stuck in that.

869
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.020
Our kids come in the room when we bite their heads off because we're in a bad

870
00:45:16.021 --> 00:45:19.020
head space.
So when you can be like,
okay,
well that was a rough moment,

871
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:20.490
glad that's over and you know,

872
00:45:20.491 --> 00:45:23.850
thank God for TV because it's really useful sometimes then you're much more

873
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:27.870
likely to do a better,
have a better intervention next time.
But it's tricky.

874
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:29.640
Multiple kids is tricky.
Um,

875
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.400
you can also do a little like group meditation things like I'll get my girls

876
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:36.240
together and we do practices together.
And again,

877
00:45:36.241 --> 00:45:39.240
this comes back to starting it when everybody's in a good space because the more

878
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:40.890
you try to just start it,
when they're in a bad space,

879
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:44.910
you're setting everyone up for failure.
And then,
um,
you know,

880
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:48.090
maybe boarding school,
I don't know,
that could help.
And yet there was,

881
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:49.560
was there somebody over here who had a question?

882
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.950
It was a sibling arguing.
Okay.
So here's the thing about sibling arguing.

883
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:59.010
I am not an expert in sibling arguing and I did a lot of it when I was a kid and

884
00:45:59.011 --> 00:46:03.540
my girls do it now.
Um,
Laura Markham has a book,

885
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.520
m a R K H,
a m about sibling rivalry that I've heard good stuff about.

886
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:13.050
Um,
but I think that remembering that it's normal,

887
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.030
like some amount of it is normal.
This is,
I mean,

888
00:46:15.031 --> 00:46:17.850
I saw some statistic that kids get into it with their siblings like once every

889
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:22.290
seven seconds or something.
Um,
yikes.
Uh,
but that it's,

890
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.910
it's an important part of their socialization.

891
00:46:23.911 --> 00:46:27.480
Like that's how they learn to figure things out.
And what I would say,

892
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:29.250
and this isn't necessarily a mindfulness bit,

893
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.620
is depending on how old they are and if everybody's safe,

894
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:34.470
can you just get out of the way and encourage them to figure it out?

895
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.240
And one of my friends would,
she'll do is she'll say,

896
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:40.260
either you guys figure it out or I take away the 20 to go to your room and you

897
00:46:40.261 --> 00:46:42.480
give him a choice.
And,
but again,

898
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.690
different families have so much different stuff going on that the sibling stuff

899
00:46:45.691 --> 00:46:46.524
is really tricky.

900
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.710
I find the other really good trick for sibling is just making sure everybody is

901
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:52.800
fed and well slept,
which is like a good life thing.

902
00:46:52.801 --> 00:46:56.160
Our worst sibling fights or in the afternoon when they're tired and they're worn

903
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:59.700
out and then I just have to like work really hard to get him set up in some

904
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:02.910
activity that involves relatively little interaction because they can't handle

905
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:06.990
it.
Um,
other questions?
Thoughts?
Yeah,
Jesse.

906
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:11.330
<v 6>So thinking about being mindful and yes and how I would do that in my life.</v>

907
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.510
I worry that a,
that time pressure is the enemy of mine.

908
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:19.850
Mindfulness and that a lot of times to be intense moments all have a time

909
00:47:19.851 --> 00:47:20.810
pressure aspect.

910
00:47:20.811 --> 00:47:25.811
Like I need to get this done by this time or get over to this place and taking a

911
00:47:26.031 --> 00:47:28.580
step back and slowing down feels very hard.

912
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.160
<v 1>Yes,
I agree.
And I think we can all</v>

913
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.540
<v 0>relate to you and certainly you can move fast and be mindful.</v>

914
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:37.480
There's no question,
like mindfulness does not require us to be slow,

915
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:39.280
but it's just easier.
Right?

916
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:44.730
And so what I would argue is that they're always going to be days and moments

917
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:47.620
when you just feel like you're moving at a hundred miles an hour.

918
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.490
I think the trick is to convince yourself that you don't actually have to move

919
00:47:51.491 --> 00:47:54.220
at a hundred miles an hour and you'll be more effective if you don't.

920
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.610
And my best example is I'll get really stressed when we're trying to get out the

921
00:47:57.611 --> 00:47:59.500
door in the morning.
And I'm like trying to make the lunches or whatever.

922
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:01.530
Although in all fairness,
Josh make lunches,

923
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.740
most mornings I have to give them that.

924
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:06.160
But when I'm trying to like get everything together and what inevitably happens

925
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:07.810
is I dropped the blueberries all over the floor,

926
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:10.990
or I like I've got everyone in the car and I realized that I'd forgotten

927
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:12.220
something and we have to go back.

928
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:17.260
And so when we can start to convince ourselves that when we can practice,
um,

929
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.290
a little bit of mindfulness that will actually make things go faster and more

930
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:21.700
smoothly.
And when I say a little bit,

931
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:25.690
I mean literally can you stop and stand and take three deep breaths and then ask

932
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:27.910
yourself,
what do I need to do now?

933
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.300
Or if you're staring down the barrel of an insane day with a ton of meetings and

934
00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:34.270
all these projects,
can you stop and take some deep breaths?
And if you're a,

935
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.520
if you're a person who likes to write things down,

936
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:39.970
can you sort of make yourself a quick list and say like what are the things I

937
00:48:39.971 --> 00:48:43.990
need to focus on?
Because when our brains get going,
it's that forward thinking.

938
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.140
We get so wrapped up in everything that has to happen in the future and all the

939
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:51.040
worries about what if I don't get this done that we end up just reacting like,

940
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.650
oh and now this thing popped in my brain so I'm going to do this.

941
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.540
And then this thing popped in my brain so I'm going to do this.

942
00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.870
And that may not be the most skillful way to approach the day and maybe better

943
00:48:58.871 --> 00:49:01.480
to take a few like,
and it can literally be five minutes,

944
00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:04.360
which I would argue that since most of us aren't like the president of the

945
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:08.230
United States,
we actually have five minutes.
We can sit down and say like,

946
00:49:08.231 --> 00:49:11.670
what are the things I need to do?
They,
what are the most effective,
you know,

947
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.890
ways to plan my day.
And then when stuff pops up,

948
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.700
we had this map in our mind of,
okay,
but this is what I was going to do today.

949
00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:20.140
And is that thing that just popped up?

950
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:23.200
Is that worthy of intruding on this space and time?

951
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.060
And it's the same thing with parenting.
You know,

952
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.100
if I can go into the afternoon with a plan or it,

953
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:29.530
I'm going to give my girls a snack and then we're going to have some play time

954
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:32.410
and then I'm gonna make dinner and then something pops up,

955
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:34.120
I can sort of make this choice.

956
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.700
Is this the most skillful place to put my attention right now?

957
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.180
And sometimes it is,
sometimes we just have to react.
Especially in parenting,

958
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:41.650
like when your kid's about to fall down the stairs,

959
00:49:41.651 --> 00:49:44.830
you got to drop whatever you're doing,
go grab them.
But more often than not,

960
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:46.780
I would argue we react when we don't need to.

961
00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:51.840
So I think small amounts of time on a busy day can make you feel,

962
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:54.070
can make you actually be more effective during the day.

963
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.370
This book is on Amazon and local bookstores,

964
00:49:57.371 --> 00:49:59.440
and then parenting in the present moment is my first book,

965
00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:02.050
which is really meant more for parents who want to practice mindfulness.

966
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.240
And I just really appreciate y'all coming.
Thank you.

967
00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:09.010
[inaudible].
