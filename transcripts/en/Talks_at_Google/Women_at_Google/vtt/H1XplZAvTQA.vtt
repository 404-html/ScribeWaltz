00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.950
I can't hear you,
man.
How's everyone doing?

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.780
<v 1>Ah,</v>

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.810
<v 0>so I let you in on a secret for 40 years,
40 years.</v>

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.330
I've been trying to learn how to dance.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.130
Every teacher I hired quit on me,

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.320
so I decided to hire the best in the war.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.370
So everyone with loud,
thunderous applause.

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.450
Please welcome my new dance teacher Madre.
They should minute

9
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.660
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.150
<v 0>dearly.
Uh,
these two need no introduction.
Uh,</v>

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.670
but you know,

12
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:45.600
let me just remind you for some of those who are a bit younger than I am.
Okay.

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.810
So Marjorie is clearly one of the most popular leading at press in Indian
cinema,

14
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
known for her powerful performances and amazing dance skills that you just saw.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.780
She voted audience in classic films like Dayjah,
Ramla Con,
uh,

16
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
sergeant [inaudible].
They have dust and many,

17
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:13.530
many more six film theater awards,
grace,

18
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.960
her mantle piece at the house.
Okay.

19
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.470
And that's out of a 16 record nomination that she got in film pedal boards.

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.370
And that's just the film fair award.
So,
okay,
let me just read a list of awards.

21
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:32.220
She has one pretty much anything that you can win in Indian cinema.

22
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.970
Marjorie has one them and that's why I need the paper because I won't be able to

23
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.080
remember those.
Okay.

24
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.830
So [inaudible] is one [inaudible] three award platinum diva award screen award,

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.270
woke Bali view beauty legend award,
right guys,

26
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.210
z scenario ward.
Just to name a few.

27
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.880
And to top it all off,

28
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.280
she was awarded the Button Shri one of the highest civilian honors by the

29
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.900
government of India in 2000 a day.

30
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.333
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

31
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.300
<v 0>She's also a UNICEF goodwill ambassador and her husband is an accomplished</v>

32
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.370
cardiothoracic surgeon,
Dr Three Romney Ne.

33
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.550
<v 0>Now Rom is a product of some of the top cardiac schools in the country,</v>

35
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.760
Washington University and Ucla and practiced for over a decade before moving to

36
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.330
India with Marjorie and they're two lovely sons.

37
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.380
<v 1>Okay.
Do</v>

38
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.310
<v 0>gather this doctor dance with Maddrey,
an initiative to,
uh,</v>

39
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.610
help teach everyone in the world about dance and wants to expand it to include

40
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:52.050
music,
acting and medicine.

41
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.160
I've known both of them for a bit and there is one thing for which they do not

42
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.470
give out an award,

43
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.460
but if they did RAAM in Matraville vinet hands down every year of their lives.

44
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.960
And that one thing is humility.

45
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.400
They both have hearts of gold and they have filled their lives with family love,

46
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.350
selflessness and yes,
humility.

47
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.770
Martha Vietnam.
It's a joy to welcome you to the Google stage.

48
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.340
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

49
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.660
<v 2>thank you very much.
I mean it's our pleasure to be here and um,
you know,</v>

50
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.720
Amit and I spend a bit of time together last summer,

51
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:45.880
which he may or may not have told you about.

52
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:50.881
We did a a six day trek in the dock and we started about 9,000 feet when all the

53
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.760
way to 17,000,
500 feet.

54
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:59.080
And this was the sort of track that humbles any one of us.

55
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200
And this guy was like iron man,
you know,
he came in,

56
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.830
flew in at the last minute on Dymocks and uh,
the rest of us,

57
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:10.120
we're all having our vasal dilation headaches.
And you know,
I mean,

58
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:15.121
you can imagine walking between 10 and 15 miles a day at that altitude.

59
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.920
It really tests you.

60
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.100
And the bottom line is having friends like him is what matters in anyone's

61
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:27.530
lifetime.
And that's what makes it full.
And so it's,

62
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:31.930
it's an absolute pleasure to be here amongst friends and family and,
uh,
we,

63
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.280
we were really looking forward to that.

64
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.850
<v 0>Thank you ram for the kind words.
Okay.</v>

65
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:43.280
Now you all guys be nice to me in the future.
Okay.
All right.

66
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.020
So mothery uh,

67
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.010
when you started on the Bollywood scene,
uh,
you are known for your dance.

68
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.060
Um,
how long have you been dancing?

69
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.890
<v 3>Well,
been dancing ever since I was three years old.
I'm classically trained,
uh,</v>

70
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.080
I've learned Cuttack that's a north Indian style of classical dancing.
Yes.
Ooh,

71
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.220
I love that style.
I really loved that style because I feel once you learned,

72
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.320
you can do any style in the world.
And which I have done through my movies.

73
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.600
Um,
I'm a very,
very passionate actress.
Uh,
it's my first love acting,

74
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.070
but dance has always been my passion.
I've grown up dancing.
So,
uh,

75
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.910
even when I did my films,
I tried to do some extra,
you know,

76
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.250
that add a little bit of extra with me and zero g,
uh,
as,
uh,

77
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.260
the choreographer.
He has everybody knows about her.
Uh,

78
00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:35.530
we formed a lovely team and,
uh,

79
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.530
we worked so well together because we were both passionate about dancing and we

80
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:42.980
wanted to take Indian film dancing to a different level,
you know?

81
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:47.360
And that's what our,
um,
uh,
you know,
uh,
uh,

82
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:49.430
Google used to be every time we did a song together.

83
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.640
<v 0>Awesome.
Um,
what,
what drew you to dance?</v>

84
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:55.920
Was it instant when you were like three years old?
I'm at,

85
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.970
this is what I want to do.

86
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 3>It came,
I don't know,
to me it came naturally.
Um,</v>

87
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.800
I just was attracted to dance and,
um,
I think,

88
00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:09.880
you know,
it's,
it's everything to me is everything because,
um,
it keeps you fit.

89
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.680
It makes you feel good.
It,
you know,
it makes your soul feel good.

90
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.300
And,
uh,
it's just,
it's,
um,
it's a beautiful way to express

91
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.080
<v 0>and there are lots of parents in the audience here who are probably putting</v>

92
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:27.130
their kids in dance school right now.
Um,

93
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.530
what advice would both of you have for those parents here?

94
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.580
<v 3>Well,
I would say,
uh,
Gloria computers</v>

95
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.750
and Google as Don's with Marguerite is my a website,

96
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.740
then you can go on that.
You can take a look.
There are so many different styles.

97
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:48.020
We are teaching a on this site and a,

98
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.080
I think what is important is to see what your kid takes to like your child has

99
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:58.000
to take to a certain style of dancing and they will just know it within their

100
00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.440
souls that,
you know,
this is what I wanted,

101
00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:03.220
what that is what I want to do and let them follow their heart because you know,

102
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:07.650
if they do something they love,
they'll really,
really give it their all.
And um,

103
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.080
all the styles are they under one roof on a dance with mothery.

104
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:15.040
So I would first like them to try it out and see and select which dance they

105
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:15.874
would like to learn.

106
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.760
They can learn it on the website where they can go to a school in London.

107
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.150
<v 2>I think to add one thing to that dance,</v>

108
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.400
to me it's about happiness,

109
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.640
confidence and health and what did epitomizes is a holistic way to kind of take

110
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:35.860
care of yourself.
It becomes a metaphor for life in some regards.

111
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.500
So when we put this project together,

112
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.840
quite an interesting journey in that,
um,
as some of you know,

113
00:07:43.841 --> 00:07:46.420
I grew up here and um,

114
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.690
I had done some software entrepreneur work at the age of 14 and had a company

115
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:54.330
and my Indian parents said,
you either become a doctor,

116
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.770
engineer or we won't pay for it.

117
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:03.190
Does that sound familiar to you guys?
Yes.
Yeah.
And so,
so the thing was I,

118
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.430
being the dutiful son became a doctor and I became a heart surgeon and I really

119
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:10.330
loved my career.
Very rewarding.

120
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.480
Took care of some amazing people in very difficult times.

121
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.410
But my problem was I couldn't scale it.
And no matter how hard I worked,

122
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:19.480
three to 500 patients per year.

123
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.160
And the issue for me was that there's 7 billion people on the planet.

124
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.540
So the journey I made was that if I could take my original skills combined with

125
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:32.950
her media talent and then amalgamate them with brick and mortar,

126
00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:35.560
we could change the way people think about medicine.

127
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.670
And we moved to India in 2011 kind of a bold thing.

128
00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:41.920
You can imagine my parents' face.
What are you doing?

129
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.190
You are the head of a hospital,
you are a partner in a group.

130
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.790
You've been practicing for 10 years and you do three to 500 cases a year and

131
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:52.270
you're just abandoning all that to go and start a startup or something like
that.

132
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.291
I don't know.

133
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:56.580
It's a journey many of you might have made or will make at some point in your

134
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:58.410
life,
but daunting.
Nevertheless.

135
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.940
So then during the course I was building out the healthcare constructs and one

136
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:06.990
day she said to me that,
you know,
culture as we know it is changing.

137
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.270
And I learned dance and acting because I loved it.
It was passionate.

138
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.890
And what ended up happening was now in the cinemas and other things,

139
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.920
it's a lot of commercialism.
She's like,
if I could teach this,

140
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.530
I could change the way people think.
And I'm like,
well,

141
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:25.950
you were facing the same problems that I am,
that we can't scale it.

142
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.640
So what if we put a team on this and scaled it?

143
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.010
And what ended up happening was,
uh,

144
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.150
three months of rapid prototyping and engineering launched in 2013.

145
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.470
Didn't know if it would work.

146
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.150
And what we ended up finding out is that people could learn remotely and they

147
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:45.630
could extend their level and move forward.

148
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.280
So the idea is to build a global village for culture where everyone is equal.

149
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:54.450
And you know,
I think the last thought is genius exists in everyone.

150
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.130
The standardized test don't examine it.

151
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.190
And the problem is there's a lot of people on the planet who don't have the

152
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:00.270
opportunities that we do.

153
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.070
And so the idea is if you can take this out to them and find them and nurture

154
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.680
that kernel of genius into a full grown plan,

155
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.980
you've will change the way people think and how things happen.

156
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.310
So her love of dance kind of spurned this and it became a platform and it grew.

157
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:20.970
And so I'll,
I'll show you some of that later.
Yeah,
great.
Thank you rob.

158
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:22.180
That's great.

159
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.281
<v 0>As you said,</v>

160
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:29.930
you were raised here and I know for a fact that before you met Madre,

161
00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:34.490
you did not follow in the cinema very much.
Okay.
So what happened dude,

162
00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:36.830
when someone mentioned mothery for the first time,

163
00:10:36.831 --> 00:10:38.480
we do run to your computer and Google her.

164
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.120
<v 2>That's a good way to set it up there.
I uh,</v>

165
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.430
you know,
I might've,
I don't know.
I,

166
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.460
I the the thing is my folks are from Mumbai and I could only speak for it.

167
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.730
I didn't speak in the end.
So we hadn't grown up watching Hindi cinema.

168
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.830
And the other thing was I was at Ucla and so we took care of the lot of the

169
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.950
Hollywood industry and I'll be very candid with you that the industry there is

170
00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:12.710
completely crazy.
I mean,
the types of people you meet,
I'm like,

171
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.360
the last thing I want to do is see someone in the industry.

172
00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:19.840
But then I met her brother and he was phenomenal and very down to earth,

173
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.140
very grounded and kind of fit our sort of overall mindset and agreed to meet

174
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:31.540
her.
And I think I probably might've googled her back then.
Right?

175
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.660
<v 0>Yeah.
Hooters.
He just doesn't want to admit it.
Oh No,
I'm,
I'm,</v>

176
00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:38.430
I'm giving them the whole,
we all know how it works.
That's okay.

177
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.600
<v 2>Yeah.
The rest is history.
Yeah.
There you have it.</v>

178
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.250
<v 0>So my three,</v>

179
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:52.250
how was it leaving Mumbai Bollywood and coming here and living in Denver rather

180
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:57.280
cold compared to Mumbai for over a decade.
How was it for you?

181
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.700
<v 3>Yeah,
you know,
and,
and Mumbai,
it's hot,
hotter and hottest.</v>

182
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.740
Last time I saw snow and cold and fall and,
you know,

183
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:08.290
all the four seasons and it was beautiful.
But I mean,

184
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:13.291
then what is a beautiful place to live for anyone you walk out and everything

185
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:18.310
that I'd never found in Mumbai,
I gotten Denver because,
um,
you know,
just the,

186
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.070
it was pleasing to the eyes that the air is so beautiful and,
uh,

187
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.790
the mountains all around a very beautiful place.
Um,
you know,

188
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:31.330
in life,
everybody has dreams,
right?
You have goals,
you have dreams.

189
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.530
And having a family,
having kids was a big part of my dream,

190
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:40.510
not just my profession and being an actress and or everything else.
But for me,

191
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:44.920
this was a big,
big deal for me because I grew up in a big family.
Uh,

192
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.900
we have four siblings.
And,
uh,
so for me,
having kids was,
um,

193
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.640
you know,
very,
very important,
um,
having a husband and a home and that's,

194
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.460
that's was a big part of my dream.
Um,

195
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.360
of course I wanted to 12 children at one point when I was little bad,

196
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.700
but after I had to,
I was like,
yeah,
this is good enough.
Um,

197
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.970
but it's really,
I mean,
that's why I enjoyed myself.
I,
I,

198
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.310
I kind of throw myself into everything I do.
Um,

199
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.780
whether it was looking after my kids or my home or,
uh,
you know,

200
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:18.490
living their live,
going out shopping it,

201
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:20.890
it gave me a sense of freedom because in Mumbai,

202
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.960
if I go shopping and they're like 10 people around me,
you know,
um,
and,
uh,

203
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.380
I was never left alone.
Basically,

204
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.790
I remember the first time I went out just to grocery shop,

205
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:34.390
I had to take my car and go in.
My heart was just like thumping.
It was like boom,

206
00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:35.201
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

207
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:39.450
As if I'm trying to do something that I've never done before and um,
but it,

208
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.880
it just freed me to give a,
give a sense of freedom.
And for me,

209
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.560
life is not all about just my profession or just acting or just dancing.

210
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.110
It's as experiencing every day,
you know,

211
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.040
the different kinds of things you have to go through the situations and how you

212
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:56.800
deal with them.
And uh,
the life lessons,
you know,

213
00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:59.110
I love to live my life basically.

214
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.230
And so that's what was most attractive about it.

215
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.260
<v 0>Wonderful.
That's so wonderful.
Yes.</v>

216
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.360
We're talking about movies you have done like 70 plus movies.
How many?

217
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.200
<v 3>78 [inaudible] 78 less movies.</v>

218
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:17.643
<v 1>Yes.</v>

219
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.380
<v 3>It's been a paper at one for you.
Um,
you know,
everybody asks me that,</v>

220
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.120
but it's a very cliched answer.
People might say,
Oh,
you're very diplomatic.

221
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.590
But it's true because every movie we do,
there's a little bit of me in the movie.

222
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.460
Um,
but if you like put a gun to my head and said no,
you have to say one movie.

223
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.350
Oh,
but you have really enjoyed I would say,
um,

224
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.120
I enjoyed doing that movie because we were a lot of actors together at every

225
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.760
point in the movie.
12 of us,
six of us.

226
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.330
And we really had fun making the movie.

227
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.540
Also talked about all the values that I believe in,
you know,
a family and uh,

228
00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.810
like uh,
uh,
you know,

229
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:03.770
extended family and everybody living together in peace and harmony and all that.

230
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:05.890
And it will be a mob guy had gone obviously.
Right.

231
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:10.960
<v 4>Okay.</v>

232
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.140
<v 0>Alright.
So after that question here,
the two part question</v>

233
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.530
two part question,
part one is there Edward Beads on movie night at the home.

234
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.930
When you put a modern movie and all of you watch it,
number two,

235
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.580
when you do do that or when your kids do watch Ahmad re movie,

236
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.500
how judgmental are they?
About

237
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.583
<v 4>four minutes.</v>

238
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.550
<v 3>I just tell you one incident,
I as,
as I was leaving home,</v>

239
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.940
my kids were watching cable and one of my movies was on Goya and they were like

240
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.670
in a sitting in front of the,
and I'm,
yeah,
I'm out of here.
I'm leaving.

241
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.830
So I left and I came back in the evening and on the computer,

242
00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:00.180
on one of my kid's computer,
there was little note hanging there,
which said,
mom.

243
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.790
And I'm like,
what's this?
So I just picked it up and it was deal,

244
00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:08.900
mom,
why are you acting so funny?
And coya

245
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.113
<v 4>orange.</v>

246
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.470
<v 3>So for them it's like,
you know,
uh,
it varies.
Uh,
the reaction varies.</v>

247
00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:19.270
And I remember in glove gang,

248
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:23.440
there was this one shot where I raise my hand and I'm like the big boss kind of,

249
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.830
and I'm doing this and my kid's side and just freaked out.

250
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.460
And they would do doing variations of that little walking

251
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.663
<v 4>that.</v>

252
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.760
<v 3>So nobody takes me seriously,</v>

253
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.410
<v 4>me and my family.
That's what I'm trying to say.</v>

254
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.700
<v 2>I think the other comment to make is we don't wear stars on our shoulders.</v>

255
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.490
And when we go home,
all of that turns off.
In fact,

256
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.770
all of the trophies you were talking about are all in the office.
Um,

257
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.790
we don't allow him at home.
And you know,
we,
we don't watch her films.

258
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.400
I mean,
I've only seen like a handful since we've been married,

259
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.630
mainly because of the Indian Ocean.
Now I speak in the,
but the,
the issue is,
um,

260
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.830
uh,

261
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.830
I think it's about being grounded and not getting caught up in your careers.

262
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.910
I mean,

263
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.090
whether it's a heart surgeon or an actress or anything else that's just a job.

264
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.860
You're passionate about what you do,

265
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:18.950
but it's the holistic kind of balance that you strike in your life.

266
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.610
And just remember that,
you know,
you're very fortunate in every,

267
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.570
every one of us is in this room.
And there's a lot of people who don't have that.

268
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:31.070
And so the idea is to think of others when you do stuff and to do it for those

269
00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:32.660
reasons rather than for yourself.

270
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.530
Although we are very passionate about what we do,
regardless of what it is.
Um,

271
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:39.710
but I would say the movie nights are generally the transformers or,

272
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.860
or something like the hat with the place.

273
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.200
And I'm just hanging out and having some fun.

274
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.130
<v 0>So how's the move to India bead?
Ah,
I think</v>

275
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.090
<v 2>it's been amazing.
I mean India has changed dramatically.</v>

276
00:17:55.091 --> 00:17:57.930
I,
I my inlaws I'm sorry,
my,

277
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.200
my family came from the other and I'm in Mumbai if you guys have been to Mumbai

278
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:08.090
at all and I would go back there every summer to,
uh,

279
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.530
hang out with my grandma and GRANDPA.
And uh,
so I,

280
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.630
I'd been there and seen it change over 40 years.
If you go there now,

281
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.050
not just Mumbai,
Delhi,
Bangalore,
any of these cities,

282
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.480
it's come in such a direction.
And I,
I don't know if you call it forward,

283
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:26.070
sideways,
upside down and whatever,

284
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.540
but I mean it's becoming a western culture very quickly and they have some

285
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:34.860
significant issues that grapple with and yet the culture is so beautiful.

286
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.110
And you know,
I call him one by my,

287
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.700
my Manhattan of sorts because you can get food anytime of day.
The,
uh,

288
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.560
people are very warm and there are different struggles.

289
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.180
I mean traffic is the same everywhere I found out today.
And it was the same.

290
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.810
It was the same in La and same in Mumbai and whatnot,

291
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.910
just very Asians on the theme.

292
00:18:56.911 --> 00:19:00.630
But I think overall it's been an amazing experience.
And,
um,

293
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.330
I would recommend if you guys get some time,

294
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:06.420
I mean a lot of you guys I see in the audience are from India originally and so

295
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:10.380
you understand it,
but I think it's so rapidly changing.
And I,

296
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.160
I mean this new prime minister and whatnot is bringing us in a direction which

297
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:18.390
is unfathomable.
And even in the last 10 years,
the number of advances,

298
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.840
um,
are amazing.
Cool.

299
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.730
So that's great.

300
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:28.380
Now you move back to India and the first question my daughter had for me was,

301
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.630
does she go to subdue Mandy herself?
Now?

302
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.890
<v 3>Uh,
no.</v>

303
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.400
I think it's back to square one where I have to pick and choose where I can be

304
00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:47.060
away.
I can go,
but I do try,
you know,
because,
um,

305
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.770
after living in Denver and after being so independent,
um,

306
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:56.020
when you go back and everything is a little different then because when you live

307
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:58.340
there,
you take everything for granted,
you know,

308
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.760
oh my mate is going to go and get this,
that and that.

309
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.840
But now when you lived by yourself,
I'm done everything.
It's like I want to go,

310
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.980
but how do I do it?

311
00:20:06.981 --> 00:20:11.981
So then I'll wear my hat or my big goal glares or something like that and I

312
00:20:12.021 --> 00:20:13.570
feel,
oh,
this is the proper disguise.

313
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.430
Nobody's going to look at me and while you're buying,
you know,

314
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.860
your veggies or whatever,
and then somebody comes in with us.

315
00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.940
I haven't heard of half these,
I failed again.
But,
um,
but yes,

316
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:28.280
I do try to do that.
Um,
it's,
it's a little limited,
but I still try,

317
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.220
<v 2>I would say the truth is this,
right?</v>

318
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:34.190
<v 3>Okay.</v>

319
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.310
<v 2>There's not many places she can go with me.
On the other hand,
I'll,</v>

320
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.980
I'll go by train,
I'll go by bus and my people will say,
no,

321
00:20:42.981 --> 00:20:47.930
you can't do that.
And it never really bothered me.
Right.
I grew up in the US.

322
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.180
The hardest part for me is that I can't change a light bulb without someone

323
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:55.900
saying,
no,
you got to call this person or do this.
I'm like,
really?
Come on.

324
00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.400
I grew up in the u s we did everything for ourselves.
And so it's been that way.

325
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:02.920
A little bit of a change.
But for her,

326
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:06.430
I mean in the u s she would put together the Ikea furniture and the other stuff

327
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.340
we got and she loves that.
Yeah,
exactly.

328
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.550
<v 0>And from what little,
I know he was much better at it then Rom.
Okay.</v>

329
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.560
Not True.
So let's talk about dance with my buddy Tom.

330
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.780
You're trying to build a community of artists,
of dancers,

331
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:29.280
people who love dancing,

332
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.300
people who want to learn dancing there.

333
00:21:33.301 --> 00:21:35.700
Did the idea come from,
where do you want to take it?

334
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.040
<v 2>Um,
so you know,
the,
the thing is,
I kind of hinted at this earlier,</v>

335
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.240
every single one of us has a little genius in him,
right?

336
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.810
And it just dawned on us that what if Pablo Picasso never got his pencil or pen

337
00:21:52.121 --> 00:21:56.410
or paintbrush?
What if Marie Curie never got an opportunity to go and learn?

338
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.720
And what if Einstein never had an opportunity to write this thesis and then

339
00:22:01.721 --> 00:22:05.110
think how many people in the world never have that opportunity?

340
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.150
And so for me,

341
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.740
I started out with this health construct to take good evidence based medicine to

342
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:12.850
everyone on the planet.

343
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.720
Because what I saw was that there were a lot of people who weren't getting the

344
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:21.721
opportunities that all of us have in this room and in the u s and even in the u

345
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:26.020
s for that matter.
When I was practicing several years ago,

346
00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:28.060
38 million people never had insurance.

347
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.920
And the idea is that medicine is one of those things that everyone should have.

348
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.350
But I,
it went further than that.

349
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.380
And what it became was a platform where we could experiment and we could teach

350
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:42.850
people in a fun and social manners.

351
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:45.700
So this is one of those things where if you gamify learning,

352
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.190
you can change the way people learn.

353
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.720
I remember learning when I was growing up that it was all rote memorization,

354
00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:55.840
right?
You must learn this and then throw it up on the test and you will do well.

355
00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.090
But my,
my feeling is that that really leaves out the bell curve,
right?

356
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:02.020
The ends of it.

357
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.440
And so what we've done is tried to make it fun and social at the same time.

358
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.860
We've taken dance in particular and used it to stay fit.

359
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:13.270
So I put a fitness band on her and in 15 minutes she,

360
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.330
her heart rate sustain was one 32 one 60 and her a caloric burn was 400

361
00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:20.740
calories.
So we put that on our youtube channel.

362
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.330
Just wanted to put that plug in there,

363
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:24.743
<v 0>add.</v>

364
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.220
<v 2>We had like 175 hours of viewing per month became like our number one,
you know,</v>

365
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.170
most viewed thing.
And so when we found is people were learning certainly,

366
00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:37.440
but they were using dance as a means to work out.
And if you think about it,

367
00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:41.580
what would you rather do?
Be on a treadmill,
you know,
looking at a TV or whatever,

368
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.620
or have some beautiful woman in front of you,

369
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:47.960
taking you through the moves and losing calories in 15 minutes.

370
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.730
And then what we did was we knit that together with a social network and a

371
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:56.240
marketplace.
So now when these people learn,
they're not just learning,

372
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:59.750
but they're creating video resumes and what they're doing is essentially

373
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:01.280
becoming marketable.

374
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.790
So what we're doing is we're discovering talent from all over the planet,

375
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.880
not just from,
you know,
one area.

376
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.340
I would love to cue that one video if we have it on the edge of naturally piece.

377
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.570
All right guys,
can we kill the video please?

378
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.750
I think this tells a story very nicely.

379
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.670
So all in all,

380
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:28.730
it became a passion play in that what could we do to change people's lives?

381
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.730
And dance was really the tip of the iceberg because if you take this and build

382
00:24:32.731 --> 00:24:37.140
it out to the other verticals,
it becomes incredibly even.
So the video,

383
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:40.643
<v 1>this is an aboriginal.</v>

384
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.500
<v 3>So before we actually start the lesson,</v>

385
00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:59.660
I want you to get familiar with some of the hand would raise

386
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.710
your right hand with the Lotus.
And the other hand is like a dia hand.

387
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:13.110
One,
two,
three.
So you're curling your hands.
A pizza style.

388
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:15.983
It doesn't it.

389
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:35.843
<v 1>Cool.</v>

390
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.200
<v 3>Okay.
So this is the sign or the hook or the signature stamp.</v>

391
00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.190
<v 1>God separate</v>

392
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.033
Gada

393
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.950
<v 2>speaking of bands,
Ram,
could you dad's before he met her?
Yeah,</v>

394
00:26:29.951 --> 00:26:31.750
I could cut a rug,
but not like after.

395
00:26:31.751 --> 00:26:34.790
I mean some of the parties we've gone to in some of the things she's taught me,

396
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.070
it's another world,
you know.
And Are you any better now?

397
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.530
I would say so.
Can you answer that?

398
00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.750
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean</v>

399
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.850
we wouldn't have this body and um,
you know,
they were like,
oh,
you have to dance.

400
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:52.620
This is doctor Neha.
You go to Dan's,

401
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:56.670
Dan's and it would produce insisting and those Riddick and those shadow can

402
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:59.880
Florida and everyone.
And you know,
uh,
yeah,
who said that?

403
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.310
All of the them.
And um,
I had to grab him and say,
Oh,

404
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.670
you go to dad's on the floor.
And he was like,
Oh my God,
I'm like,

405
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:14.310
we were shooting for all this.
And I think he's picked up a lot.

406
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:20.010
It's just watching and he was so good on the floor that Pharaoh came up to me

407
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:24.780
and says,
he's going to be my next dance bar there now.
Yeah.
So yeah,
I mean he's,

408
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.810
he's,
you know,

409
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.820
he's free of spirit and he loves to learn and he is very observant and I know of

410
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.890
you were doing classes or whatever,
by the way.

411
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:37.160
He's also done one of the classes where,
um,

412
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.990
it's called dance for the non dancers.
So,

413
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:41.540
<v 4>okay.</v>

414
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.310
<v 3>So his trading started there.</v>

415
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.903
<v 0>I will take that.</v>

416
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.740
<v 3>Yeah.
And,
and I think you should try it.
Yes.</v>

417
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.203
<v 4>Okay.</v>

418
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.700
<v 2>I think it's infectious.
You know what I mean?
You,</v>

419
00:27:52.701 --> 00:27:56.290
you see these people and it's just as I say,

420
00:27:56.291 --> 00:28:01.291
poetry in motion or fluid and it really kind of drives you after awhile.

421
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.190
I mean,
there's a lot of things that do,
but there's different types of art.

422
00:28:06.191 --> 00:28:09.160
This is one of those things that really makes it happiness.

423
00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:13.900
<v 0>Cool.
So in a minute I'm going to open it up to the audience for questions.</v>

424
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:17.590
If you have a question for a Maddrey and Ram,

425
00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.310
please get to one of these mics.
Uh,
you know,
the Tgi of routine.
Um,

426
00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.060
and I'm going to make just one comment,

427
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.980
<v 2>two comments.
Actually.
The one is,</v>

428
00:28:27.981 --> 00:28:32.720
it's free and our goal is to keep it free forever so that there's absolutely no,

429
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.960
you know,
impediments or obstacles to the end user.

430
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.150
The second is all of the greatest artists are coming on the platform,

431
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.600
whether it's BG,
Hamachi,
Saroj,
con Terrence remo,
um,

432
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.220
and a host of Jelic and other choreographers.

433
00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.580
The idea is to create one place where everyone can go and feel free to add and

434
00:28:55.611 --> 00:28:57.740
subtract and bring everyone together.

435
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.100
And the idea was literally global village for Culture,
right?

436
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.170
And so that's the idea behind it.

437
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.110
<v 0>Hmm.
Okay.
Before I open it up,
one question.</v>

438
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.040
What's that one piece of technology that you guys can't live with that

439
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.370
<v 3>miles,
we cannot live without technology.</v>

440
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.790
There has to be a gadget for everything in the house,
right?

441
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.760
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
No,
but that's like,
I love all my children.
Answer.</v>

442
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.550
<v 1>Right.
That's</v>

443
00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.860
<v 0>what a guy's supposed to give us an answer.
Okay.</v>

444
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.910
Now someone put a gun to your head and said,
what's the one piece of technology?

445
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:50.200
<v 3>My goodness.
Yes.
Iphone.
Easily the,
yeah.</v>

446
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.150
<v 4>All right.</v>

447
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.140
<v 2>All right.
All right.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Hang on.
I'm going to show you some love.</v>

448
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.700
I've got my android

449
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.930
and,
and actually,
yeah,
I'll just tell you one other thing.

450
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:09.060
I've got dance with mothery on it.
It actually runs better than my iPhone,

451
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.330
<v 0>so try it.
Oh,
that's so awesome.
Now</v>

452
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.320
we asked people who couldn't get in today,
uh,

453
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:24.720
to submit a bunch of questions for you and let me start asking some of those

454
00:30:24.721 --> 00:30:28.650
questions that people have submitted for you.
Now,

455
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:34.010
many of us who came to the u s as adults have found the social anonymity of not

456
00:30:35.341 --> 00:30:40.110
being known by anybody.
Something to adjust to.
In your case,

457
00:30:40.111 --> 00:30:44.730
the feeling must have been far greater.
Did you welcome that change?

458
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.500
If not,
how did you deal with it?

459
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.770
<v 3>Yeah,
it was a welcome change.
Uh,</v>

460
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.620
because then you're like famous or you're a celebrity in India.

461
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.710
There's not much you can do.
You know,
and the way I worked,
um,

462
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.210
for me,
life was just,
you know,
from one studio to another to another to another.

463
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.380
And I really didn't get to live life normally,
you know,

464
00:31:10.381 --> 00:31:14.610
like how everybody lives.
They go out with their friends,
the college friends.

465
00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:19.440
And I started very early.
I started when I was 16,
so I missed out on all that.

466
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.030
And uh,
not that I'm complaining,
but,
but that's,

467
00:31:24.031 --> 00:31:28.300
that's the life I knew.
And when I moved to Denver,
it was like I said,
you know,

468
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.220
freedom for me because suddenly I was free to do anything that I wanted to.

469
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.540
I could go to the grocery shop,
I didn't have to,
you know,

470
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.810
dress up or do anything.
I could just go the way I was and a,

471
00:31:39.811 --> 00:31:42.750
I could get grocery,
I could take my kids out,
go to the park,

472
00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:45.810
just enjoy everything.
And um,

473
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.960
another part of it is when I met Rom,
um,

474
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:53.310
he was into adventure sports and he used to do all kinds of crazy stuff and

475
00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:56.160
which had no done in my life.
I'm a very careful person and you know,

476
00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.960
a very protected,
and I'm just,
I just knew that I was,
you know,

477
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:05.100
an actress and I went from one studio to another and I danced and I sang and I

478
00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:08.010
acted and everything.
But this was like freedom.

479
00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:12.230
I was outdoors the first day after we met,
he said,
um,

480
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.730
um,
let's go mountain biking.

481
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.440
And I had not ridden a bike in 20 years.

482
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.380
I had done it when I was little and I had not.

483
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.470
And I thought mountain biking is this,
taking a bike and going on a mountain.

484
00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:33.360
Right.
How hard can that be?
And when I went with him,
it was like,

485
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.080
Whoa,
I was coming down like rocky thing.
Then I was like,
did I just do that?

486
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.980
And that was like,
at some point I was like,
you know,

487
00:32:39.981 --> 00:32:43.500
I don't think I can do this and say why.
And I said,
oh,

488
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.550
because I haven't done this in 20 years.
So he's like,

489
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.690
you cannot mountain bike as it.
No.

490
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.160
So there was some portions made to carry my bike and we just walked across and

491
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:58.010
did all that.
But it just gave me a sense of freedom.
Just showed me another,

492
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.180
you know,
life all together and I really,
really enjoyed every moment of it.

493
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:07.260
<v 2>That's,
that's so joyful.
Let's take the first question.
Uh,
please.</v>

494
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.730
<v 3>Hello.
Hello doctor.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
First compliment first.</v>

495
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:18.160
Mothery you are great.
Amazing gift to this universe.

496
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:24.070
It's,
it's,
it's really,
really amazing.
And here I was not listening anything.

497
00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.760
I was just staring you because this is the first time I'm seeing you in person.

498
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:33.000
Thank you.
I have two questions,
one to moderate and one to Dr [inaudible].

499
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.120
I'm Audrey.
How does it feel like being mothery?

500
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:45.050
Like do you see like something special or like it's kind of God give Troy I

501
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.320
know.
Let's put it this way that you guys make me feel special.
Okay.

502
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.500
Yeah,
there's a lot of love around me and I know everybody's looking at me very

503
00:33:55.510 --> 00:34:00.460
lovingly and it makes me feel special.
It makes me feel special.
But I don't know.

504
00:34:00.461 --> 00:34:04.930
I,
I'm,
I'm just a very happy person.
I,
I'm very positive in life and,

505
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:10.210
uh,
whenever I look at something,
I see life,
you know,
like the glass half full,

506
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.890
not half empty.
So I just enjoy every moment in my life.
And um,

507
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.360
I don't think too much about that.

508
00:34:16.361 --> 00:34:19.480
I don't think about the fact that I'm Marjorie or you know,
whatever.

509
00:34:19.481 --> 00:34:22.180
I'm just a person and,
um,
you know,

510
00:34:22.181 --> 00:34:27.181
who loves doing things and I want to share that with my fans now because I love

511
00:34:27.401 --> 00:34:31.000
dancing so much.
I want to share that with them.
And so,
um,
you know,

512
00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:33.790
that's how I look at it.
Okay.
What's,

513
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:38.410
what's the one thing you want to give it to the world other than dancing?

514
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:43.080
Um,
I think joy,
happiness,
um,
just um,

515
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.140
feel good about themselves.
That's something I would really love to give back.

516
00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:50.830
Okay.
Thanks.
A question to Dr Nina is,
um,

517
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.290
what was your first reaction when you met mothery?

518
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:59.550
<v 2>Um,
you know,
I don't know what to say.
It's,
I,
I didn't know who she was.</v>

519
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.810
He was speechless.

520
00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.250
<v 4>Yeah.
That
this</v>

521
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:11.690
<v 2>man will never learn.
I've tried teaching.
Okay.
I've been married long enough.</v>

522
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.870
It probably doesn't matter,
but I make him speechless.

523
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:20.160
What,
no,
but,
um,
I mean,
what,

524
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.620
what you find,
so there,
there's a couple of points.

525
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.760
The first is,
um,
I grew up in La.

526
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.520
I was surrounded by the industry,
you know,
and,

527
00:35:32.521 --> 00:35:36.230
and so what you found is they put their pants on one leg at a time just like

528
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:40.960
everyone else.
And the issue is that,
um,
the,

529
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.840
the connect was that we didn't treat it there are different regardless of what

530
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:47.250
our stature was,
what we did.

531
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:51.390
And the one thing I loved about her was that she's down to earth and very,

532
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:55.680
very straightforward and focused and no nonsense.

533
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.100
Um,
and that's not always the case in the filming line.

534
00:35:59.101 --> 00:36:00.990
And I'll tell you that I think you can answer that.

535
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.200
And so we are kind of the unfill me people,
you know,

536
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:06.870
and that we're real and we like to stay that way.

537
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.670
And you won't see us going out and doing crazy stuff.
I mean,

538
00:36:10.671 --> 00:36:15.030
it's fun once in a while,
but the bottom line is that it has to be a balance.

539
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.360
You know,
so the answer is,
um,
she was real,

540
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.320
that that was what mattered to me and certainly with my career and her career.

541
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:27.390
The other comment someone had asked,
I think was the anonymity factor,
right?

542
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.690
She's the one person who's been everywhere and yet been nowhere.

543
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:36.050
And what I mean by that is they close the Eiffel Tower for one of our shoots and

544
00:36:36.301 --> 00:36:39.210
imagine that the Eiffel Tower,
the gendarmes,
everything else,

545
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.020
they went to a glacier in Alaska,

546
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:47.490
had multiple chopper setups and shooting for a movie called Paccar.

547
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.830
And yet for these guys,
it's a matter of getting in,
getting in hair and makeup,

548
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.040
putting on your clothes and jetting out.
So,
you know,

549
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:57.270
in the time we've been married,

550
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:02.300
the one kind of gift was that we could go and do things normally and the u s

551
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:07.320
kind of afforded that in that she could actually go out and drive to whole foods

552
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:09.930
or whatever and buy groceries,
which,
you know,

553
00:37:09.931 --> 00:37:12.330
that doesn't sound like a lot of sounds like a chore to most people.

554
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.510
But for someone like this,
it's,
it's like freedom.

555
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.460
<v 3>Yeah,
I can imagine.
Thank you.
Yeah.</v>

556
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.340
I really want to thank Google for organizing this.
Thank you.

557
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.540
<v 2>Thank you.
That's big.
The next question.</v>

558
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.590
Hello again guys.
So a mother,

559
00:37:29.591 --> 00:37:33.380
you when at what point in your career did you realize maybe where you're

560
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.180
reflecting at some point that you had made it because there are a lot of men and

561
00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:39.260
women in India and everyone in the world who want to be where you are at.

562
00:37:39.261 --> 00:37:41.020
When did you feel yes,
I've done it.

563
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.100
<v 3>Um,
you know,
um,</v>

564
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.710
my film was released in [inaudible] 89 and I remember I was not in India when it

565
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:51.600
released.
Um,

566
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.410
I was here in the U S and I was in Washington know Chicago.

567
00:37:55.411 --> 00:38:00.411
I think because my sister was getting married and my agent at that point,

568
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.760
uh,
had called me and he said,
um,
who don't get Hindou Hindou get here

569
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:10.360
and I know how to hit film.
So for me it was like,
oh good,
I have a hit vote now.

570
00:38:10.361 --> 00:38:13.290
I,
it's a hit.
It's like success.
And uh,

571
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.600
so I was very happy about that,

572
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.220
but I had never faced a recognition before when I was working on once in a while

573
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:24.210
maybe.
But I landed at the airport and it was these two little kids,
you know,

574
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:27.300
who come and kind of wipe your car sometimes and they're like,
uh,

575
00:38:27.301 --> 00:38:32.280
so they were looking at me and a 71 of them says,
I knew the Eagleton good.

576
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.830
And I'm like,
I said,
yeah,
it's just give me,
have an autograph.

577
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.800
And I was so thrilled,
you know,
saying anything,
an autograph.

578
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.940
And somebody recognized me and I signed my name and Arrow model addiction,

579
00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.780
then I gave it to him and he don't do,
the other guy says [inaudible].

580
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.123
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

581
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.210
<v 3>So yeah,
that was the first time I thought,
oh my goodness,
I made it.
Thank you.</v>

582
00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.960
<v 2>All right,
let's take the next question over there.</v>

583
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:05.200
<v 3>Hi,
my name is [inaudible].
Hello.
First of all,
I still feel I'm dreaming.</v>

584
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.630
I cannot believe that you are watching me right now.

585
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.670
So I have two questions.
The first is about dance with Monterey.

586
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.020
I've never danced in my entire life and it's probably because of that inhibition

587
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:21.490
that you were talking about and that has grown so much that I'm not at all

588
00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:22.450
comfortable dancing.

589
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:26.470
So how would dance with Marjorie health and what advice do you have for people

590
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:29.770
like me was dance with modular is something you can do in your own time,

591
00:39:29.771 --> 00:39:31.030
in your own space.

592
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.140
You could when you own room in front of your computer that nobody's watching
you,

593
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.920
you know,

594
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.920
and it's just the teacher in front of you and you and I think somewhere it'll

595
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:43.990
help you get all your inhibitions because nobody's watching you do that.

596
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.880
And we dance with modular.

597
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.360
You can rewind it 20,000 times and see it again and again and again,

598
00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:52.480
which a school doesn't afford you because once you go there,

599
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:56.600
the classes just for one hour you come home and you have to basically work where

600
00:39:56.601 --> 00:40:01.000
your memory,
you know,
whenever your memory is good,
that's what you will remember.

601
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.480
But with this you can practice in your own time and your own space and you can,

602
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.470
every little lesson is split into 15 second does,
you know?

603
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.060
So they will teach you step by step every little thing and I think it'll be

604
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:17.050
easier to learn that way.

605
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.250
<v 2>Let's take the next question over there.
I'm keeping time.</v>

606
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.010
I want lots of people ask.

607
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.800
<v 3>Great.
All right.
Thank you.
I hope that answers you.
Yes,
thank you.</v>

608
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.560
<v 5>Hi Marjorie,
you've got an enigmatic spider,</v>

609
00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.890
a fantastic dance for and definitely a fabulous artist.

610
00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:33.680
I mean we're all crazed here.
My question to his friend,

611
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:38.490
Dana is you are walking down the aisle with the heartthrob of India,
right?

612
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.020
All the men.
I mean,

613
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.010
how many letters and emails did you get from all the men from India grabbing

614
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:44.844
this lady?

615
00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.660
<v 2>I,
you know,
I don't remember much of that.</v>

616
00:40:48.661 --> 00:40:51.920
It was my chief resident year at Ucla in general surgery and,
um,

617
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.240
we didn't get a lot of sleep.
Um,

618
00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:59.190
fortunately there was a good PR core there and,
uh,
they would protect me.

619
00:40:59.191 --> 00:41:02.040
But once in a while on rounds,
someone would surprise you and say,
Hey,

620
00:41:02.041 --> 00:41:06.420
are you this person or that person?
And that was new for me.
And so I,

621
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.060
I didn't really live in that.
I mean,

622
00:41:09.061 --> 00:41:11.990
we were kind of insulated our agents and everyone

623
00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.400
<v 3>do.
You didn't know what he was getting into</v>

624
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.130
<v 2>in short.
That's,
that's good.
Uh,
mixed question.
I'm sorry.</v>

625
00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:21.740
I'll have to make that the last question over there.

626
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:26.990
<v 5>Which,
uh,
hi Aparna biggest bunker now.
Um,
which,</v>

627
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.260
um,

628
00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.260
who among the following are the best is the best dancer according to a critic

629
00:41:32.271 --> 00:41:33.830
Roshan be

630
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.400
<v 3>someone can see Govinda the Prabu diva.</v>

631
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:42.043
Oh my God.

632
00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:45.470
<v 0>Huh.</v>

633
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.580
<v 3>Yeah.
The thing is that all these guys are such good dancers,</v>

634
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.790
but of course if you take the whole package,

635
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.730
I would say no,
not in that sense.

636
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.983
<v 2>Um,
what,</v>

637
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.300
<v 3>yeah,
I know.
I know.
Um,
if you dig the hole,
uh,</v>

638
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.400
functionality and everything,
I think that's a better word.
A,

639
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.920
it'll be to take Russian because I think,
yeah,

640
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.770
cause when he dances it's like he's just mesmerized as you,

641
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:21.250
<v 0>I would say probably deva by a long stretch.
He's like on fire.</v>

642
00:42:21.251 --> 00:42:24.760
He has no bones,
literally no bones.
The guy can twist and do any.

643
00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.830
<v 3>Yeah,
I remember doing case the restaurant.
So that was a quite a duff song.</v>

644
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.520
<v 0>Uh,
so I tell you a story,
you know,</v>

645
00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.380
Rahm and I were hiking for six days in the dark and six days or a long time.

646
00:42:37.381 --> 00:42:42.381
Periodically we'll get bored and whenever I got bored I made rom sing one of

647
00:42:42.991 --> 00:42:46.620
those Hindi songs so far.
Okay.
And with Roms?
Hindi,

648
00:42:46.621 --> 00:42:50.670
I would be entertained for hours.
So Ron,

649
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.410
would you please do us the honor.

650
00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.230
<v 2>Oh Hey.
And VR going egg dough team for you.
Okay.</v>

651
00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.420
All right,

Let's give Rom.

652
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.243
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

653
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.880
<v 0>What are we singing?
Whatever you like.
One of her songs</v>

654
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.290

655
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:23.350
Egg Blue.
Fine.
I really,

656

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.210
we're not up there.

660
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.353
