1
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.130
[inaudible],

2
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.480
<v 2>you know,
since we're here at Google and we know that we love numbers,</v>

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.450
I thought I'd start this introduction with some numbers.

4
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.740
A one in five women in America have been to a planned parenthood last year.

5
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:30.680
Planned parenthood provides 10.6 million services,
uh,

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.290
over 270,000 pap smears,

7
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.710
360,000 breast exams,

8
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.950
4.2 million tests and treatments for sexual transmitted diseases including a

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.070
650,000 HIV test.

10
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.230
A 97% of what they do is not about abortion.

11
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.070
And I think we always have to remind ourselves of that only 3% is.

12
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.450
And what I think is so amazing is that planned parenthood has been around for a

13
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.150
hundred years is our a hundredth anniversary this year.
Yeah.
Wow.

14
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.553
<v 1>I know.</v>

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.750
<v 2>Feel has led this organization for the last 10.
Uh,</v>

16
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.820
and I think first why don't we start out with,
um,

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.020
there's a lot of misconceptions about what planned parenthood is,
what it does.

18
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:20.180
Can you kind of clear that up and tell us what we all do?

19
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.380
<v 3>Well,
you did a great job.
I think.
Just interject and in the introduction,</v>

20
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.620
and let me just say thank you also for having me here at Google.

21
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.650
We love Google is the way probably most of the people find us now and which is,

22
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.930
has just been amazing to see the last 10 years of transformation,

23
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.260
that access on the web and on mobile phones has made.
So yeah,
for,

24
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.970
as you said it,
and we see about two and half million patients a year.

25
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.660
We were in every single state,
red and blue and purple.
It doesn't matter.

26
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.040
And the patients who come to us,

27
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.530
it's always say they're not coming to make a political statement.

28
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:55.220
They were coming because they need access to high quality and affordable

29
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.740
healthcare.
And in a lot of parts of the country,

30
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.940
we are the only doctor that women will see it.
Maybe they're only medical visit.

31
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.830
And that's an incredibly important part of what we're talking about now because

32
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:11.690
I think there's so much at risk for women's health and for basic basic access to

33
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.750
healthcare,
uh,
not only here in California,

34
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.910
but particularly in some of the Midwestern states and southern states where

35
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.480
there just aren't,
um,
health centers on every corner for,

36
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.550
for everybody who needs them.

37
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.700
And the only thing I'd say that's important is half of our health centers are

38
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.160
located in medically underserved communities.

39
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.740
So we were proud to be there for folks who again,

40
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:32.180
may not have a lot of other options.

41
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.390
<v 2>That's great.
So just,
I can't even believe it was month ago,</v>

42
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.000
uh,
was the,
uh,

43
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.450
women's march and you were a key participants in that.

44
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.800
Can you talk to us about how that began and how it all

45
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.260
<v 3>ruin what you thought of that?
Well,
the amazing thing about the march,</v>

46
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:52.990
and it wasn't even a march,
it was marches,
right?
That was what it was,

47
00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:56.710
I think so stunning is that I,
and I was in Washington DC,
which was,

48
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.330
the march was so enormous and so many more showed up that there was no marching.

49
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.680
I mean,
they were just sort of standing in place.
I'm moving back and forth.
Uh,

50
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.940
but it,
and it was extraordinary.
It was really a civilian led march,
if you will.

51
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.600
And was started by some women who just felt that they wanted to organize

52
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.200
something.
And then what we saw is it just grew around the country.
And to me,

53
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.480
the thing that was amazing,
and I know here in California,

54
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.730
folks marched in San Francisco in the rain,

55
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:25.440
and I think Los Angeles had just record crowds,
but also,
uh,

56
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.330
places like El Centro.
And,
you know,
every town,

57
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.450
we had 10,000 people in Salt Lake City,
Utah.

58
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:35.260
And then there's a great photograph of folks in Fairbanks,
Alaska,
in the snow,

59
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.700
in a blizzard,
like with their signs.
Uh,
uh,
so to me that was,

60
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.780
that was the extraordinary thing is it wasn't,
uh,
uh,
March,
uh,
about the coasts.

61
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.890
It was a march of more than 4 million people in this country saying,

62
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.190
we believe in women's rights and women's equality.

63
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.630
And I think the other part of that was so stunning and you just couldn't help.

64
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.640
But,
uh,
well I guess two things.

65
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:01.360
One is there were women of sort of my mother's generation that were marching

66
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.200
with signs saying things like,
I can't believe I still have to protest this,

67
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.150
fill in the blank.
Um,
and,
and then people who had never marched to their lives,

68
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.480
you know,

69
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.540
young people for whom this was just a completely transformative experience.

70
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.740
And then you couldn't help but be blown away by the number of men who are

71
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.640
marching.
And maybe some of you in this room,
I don't know.
But,
uh,
um,

72
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.710
it was,
there were fathers marching with their granddaughters and there were,

73
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.970
um,
brothers marching with,
and four,
there were sisters.

74
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.900
And to me that was the big theme,
which is I just think that,
um,

75
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.650
no one wants to see their daughters have fewer rights than they did.
And,

76
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.040
and I think there's a generational shift happening in real tipping point here

77
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.510
that men want their daughters to have every opportunity that there,

78
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.780
that their sons have.
And that means being able to finish school,

79
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.120
that means being able to get a career,
maybe work for Google,

80
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.490
maybe do whatever they want to do.

81
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:57.550
And part of that means being in control of your reproductive health.
Right.

82
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.770
When I was talking to a lot of people and asking me what I should ask you,

83
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.920
um,
and knowing we're problem solvers here,
uh,

84
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.240
it was interesting to hear people say the largest share of what you do isn't

85
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:13.984
about abortion,

86
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.400
but you're so pinned as abortion.

87
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.430
Do you ever find that if we,

88
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.130
if you marketed yourself as differently,

89
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:28.960
if you didn't speak out so much about that it's still did them,

90
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.650
but you might have more success.
Have you ever thought about that?
Well,

91
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.920
actually I think that people that are obsessed with abortion are the people who

92
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:40.360
are against it.
And,
um,
so I,
I would say that we are,

93
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.650
we are very proud to provide all reproductive healthcare access and that

94
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:48.850
includes safe and legal abortion.
It is still a legal right in this country and

95
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.063
<v 1>mmm,</v>

96
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.400
<v 3>I do.</v>

97
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.580
I think it's important that we don't do anything more to stigmatize or shame

98
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:02.420
people who have made that decision.
And I think it's,

99
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.130
it's just an important part of women's health care access.
The,

100
00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:09.350
the interesting thing is I do think there was some times,
uh,
uh,

101
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.550
there was sort of folks who consume a lot of news and think that this is all the

102
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.920
conversation and this is what everybody is thinking about when,

103
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.220
of course the vast majority of our patients come to us for basic preventive
care.

104
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.560
Yeah.
Um,
our support is at record numbers.

105
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.740
We're at 70% of people in this country actually not only support planned

106
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:25.041
parenthood,

107
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:29.120
but think we should be funded and actually support for Roe versus Wade is at the

108
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:33.110
highest point it ever has been 70% of the country.
Again.
So I think we,

109
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.520
we make a mistake sometimes when we don't lean into,
um,

110
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.000
to quote a friend of mine,
uh,
lean into the fact that this is a,
this is a right,

111
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:44.630
that's been established for many,
many years.
It's access that people need.

112
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.310
And quite frankly,

113
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:50.900
if we could quit obsessing over this and actually talk about the fact that,

114
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.580
I mean maybe something you want to talk about.

115
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:57.581
We were making historic gains and reducing unintended pregnancy,

116
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.670
uh,
teenage pregnancy.
I can give you the numbers.
It's amazing.

117
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.110
And that's the bulk of what we do is help people prevent an unintended pregnancy

118
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.610
and stay healthy and safe.

119
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.390
But we have to spend too much of our time fighting with politicians who want to

120
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:15.740
end women's rights and women's access to care.
Yeah.
Prompts to issues.

121
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.460
Uh,
one which you alluded to,
uh,

122
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.520
for those of you don't realize we were at a 30 year low for unwanted pregnancies

123
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.590
and at record lows for teenage pregnancies.
Yep.
Uh,

124
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.670
do you take responsibility for that?
Well,
not personally.

125
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.890
I've talked to a ton of people,

126
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:37.370
but I don't know that it's made that big an impact.
But I will say this is where,

127
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:38.780
again,
I think it's important to link,

128
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.100
like why things change in government has the biggest influence on people's lives

129
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.610
at any other institution.
And that's just the truth.
So if you don't vote,

130
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.210
you get the government that,
um,
you know,
sort of someone else's notes for.

131
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.260
I had the real honor,
uh,

132
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.690
during President Obama's presidency to work very hard sometimes with the

133
00:07:56.691 --> 00:07:57.410
administration,

134
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.710
sometimes fighting the administration to expand access to healthcare.

135
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.310
And one of the things that planned parenthood really lead on was the birth

136
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:08.990
control benefit.
Now,
55 million women in this country have access to no cost,

137
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:12.420
birth control and their insurance plans.
Yeah.
This is revolutionary.
And

138
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.980
<v 1>yeah,
it really is.</v>

139
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.470
<v 3>Um,
and we were talking,
I was telling you a story.
Uh,</v>

140
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.240
my sister's an ob and one day she had come home,

141
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:28.090
this was several years ago and said,
uh,

142
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.450
this woman was pregnant and you know,
distraught about it.

143
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.610
And what made it so bad was she was a poor woman,
uh,
working for,

144
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.810
and she had to choose between paying her electric bill and taking birth control.

145
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.130
That's right.
And,
uh,

146
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:46.360
so she was taking pills every other day trying to stretch them,
you know,

147
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.870
and it didn't work.
And I think sometimes,
and if you could talk to this,

148
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.850
we forget that it's a struggle.
If you can't afford birth,

149
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.150
you're absolutely right.

150
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:01.320
And I could recount story after story of folks who have come to planned

151
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:02.870
parenthood.
Uh,

152
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.790
a couple of things that are important for those of you are interested in the

153
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:06.690
health care side.

154
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.080
One of the problems with birth control has been that women would just choose the

155
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:10.890
cheapest kind,

156
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.730
whatever they can that's usually meant birth control pills and which are not the

157
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:18.060
most reliable for the one.
One of the reasons is what you mentioned.

158
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.210
So the exciting thing to us as women have been able to now choose a birth

159
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:22.290
control that works best for them.

160
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:26.100
And that includes many times long acting methods like an Iud.
And in fact,

161
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.850
one of the craziest things was within the two days after the election,

162
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:34.500
we had a 900% increase in women trying to get an Iud at planned parenthood that

163
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:38.910
would last for years.
Um,
and uh,
so,
uh,

164
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.030
that is so that'll just show you that women are very aware of what they need and

165
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:48.810
how expensive it can be.
Here's a,
here's an interesting economic fact.

166
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.640
After the birth control benefit went into,

167
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.340
went into effect before it was even in effect for everyone.

168
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.180
Women saved one point $4 billion on just birth control pills in the first year

169
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.033
alone.

170
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.210
Now for anyone who thinks that that doesn't make a difference in the lives of

171
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:05.520
women who are struggling to pay rent,

172
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.960
young women who are in college and have to choose sometimes between groceries

173
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:13.770
and birth control,
that is just not a choice any woman should ever have to make.

174
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.670
And you know,

175
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.290
we may talk about the threats that Speaker Ryan has made to defund planned

176
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:21.630
parenthood.
Ironically,

177
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.920
we're the largest provider of women's reproductive health care in the country.

178
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.900
This is what we've been doing for a hundred years.

179
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:29.780
I feel like we keep getting better at it and,

180
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.360
and anything now we should double down on these kinds of services because

181
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:36.200
they're working for women and working for families.
Talk,

182
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.180
I think a little bit about some of the,

183
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.470
we'll call them case studies of what happens when those rights who are rooted in

184
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:48.150
what you've seen in some of the areas where uh,
people don't have access to.

185
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:48.840
Sure.

186
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.960
I know cause we discussed a little bit that we live in a pretty wonderful place

187
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:55.920
here.
If those of you are from the bay area or California and it's great to have

188
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:59.370
states like California,
I don't know my colleague from more Monte may be here,

189
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:03.420
but constantly just pushing the envelope,
you know,
really expanding access.
Well,

190
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:06.870
I happened to come from Texas and I know that one of my colleagues,

191
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:09.960
one of my friends is here from Houston,
who knows what it's like down there.

192
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.400
It is not the same.
Uh,
we,

193
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.020
we had a state legislature there that declared war on women's health.

194
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:20.100
They basically ended the women's healthcare program that had been operating for

195
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.980
many,
many years.
Dozens of women's health centers,
not just planned parenthood,

196
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.970
but others were shutdown.

197
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.950
So places that women had gotten birth control or gotten their cancer screenings

198
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.550
and uh,
it has absolutely impacted women's health.

199
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:36.120
We've seen a doubling of the maternal mortality rate in the state of Texas.

200
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.980
And the thing to me,

201
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:40.470
and it's something that I think we should also think about in terms of the

202
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.150
impact of these policies,

203
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.080
the folks that get hurt are the women who have the least access to care.

204
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.050
You know,
there are other women who they lose their benefits,

205
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.340
they're going to figure something out.

206
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.770
But if you look at low income women of color in,

207
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.590
they're the ones who have really been hurt,
uh,
and hit the hardest.

208
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:01.591
And that's to me that what's so discouraging about some of the proposals and the

209
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.000
actions of the legislature,
they are,

210
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:07.900
but now our federal government is that it's going to hurt women who have,

211
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.420
are finally beginning to make some progress here.

212
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:14.470
And I think they were talking about just turning it all back.
Yeah.
Can you,
uh,

213
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.870
I think,
uh,

214
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.130
the Washington term of defunding planned parenthood is a bit,
a little bit of,
uh,

215
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.970
uh,
not the correct term.
It's right.
It's not.
Yeah.

216
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.280
Can you talk a little bit about that?
Sure.
No,
I appreciate it.

217
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.170
So that's what is what Paul Ryan said,

218
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:30.910
the second day of Congress that he was going to,

219
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.460
when they're going to repeal the affordable care act,

220
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.370
there are also going to defund planned parenthood.
Um,
and by the way,

221
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:39.170
within two hours,
you couldn't get a phone call into Paul Ryan's office.
I mean,

222
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.880
it was just an explosion.
And even in the last few weeks,
I mean,

223
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.160
it has been record numbers of calls to Congress.

224
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:47.170
They have literally shut down the congressional switchboard.

225
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:49.760
So all of you are calling members of Congress,
keep doing it.

226
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.080
It's working and it's,
it's incredibly important.
So

227
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.203
<v 1>yeah,
to do that,</v>

228
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.170
<v 3>what it would mean,
and this is really important.</v>

229
00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:03.140
So thanks for giving me like a little bit of a chance to explain.
Uh,
we see,
uh,

230
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.160
about half the patients we see are on public assistance of some sort,

231
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.720
primarily Medicaid and title 10,
which is the national family planning program.

232
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.320
So,
uh,
and federal funds do not pay for abortion.

233
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.650
They have not for decades.
Now.

234
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.260
We think that's wrong and we believe it is hurt.
Low income women.
Uh,

235
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.660
I'm fairly for many,
many,
many,
many years,
but that is the law of the land.

236
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:27.360
And planned parenthood obeys the law to the letter.

237
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.650
So what they're talking about doing is saying women and young people are men who

238
00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:35.400
come to us for cancer screenings,
birth control,

239
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:38.490
STI testing and treatment.
Well,
woman visits,

240
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.630
they can't come to us anymore for those basic preventive care.

241
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.130
And that we believe is illegal and we will fight them in court.

242
00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:50.010
But first we want to beat it in Congress if we can because we don't think it's

243
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:50.844
right.

244
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.630
We just believe that if a member of Congress can choose where they want to go to

245
00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:57.270
for healthcare than women in America should have the same.
Right.

246
00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:02.290
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

247
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.210
<v 3>if I can't,
I'll,
I'll just mention one other things I suppose.
Right.
Interesting.</v>

248
00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:06.044
I'm actually,

249
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.080
I'll be going tomorrow to Wisconsin and that's the state where we are major

250
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.470
family planning provider,
especially in rural,
small town Wisconsin and in,

251
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.330
in Speaker Ryan's own district,
we have three planned parenthood health centers.

252
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.560
We don't provide abortion services and those centers we provide preventive

253
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.530
healthcare,
family planning and so on.
And in one of those towns racing,

254
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:32.930
seeing we are the only safety net provider in racing Wisconsin.

255
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.010
And so essentially what Paul Ryan is saying and politicians who agree with him

256
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.630
is that those folks are going to be left out of the healthcare system.
Um,

257
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.271
and again,

258
00:14:41.271 --> 00:14:44.030
so at the same time they were both wanting to repeal the affordable care act,

259
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:47.000
take away their health insurance and then take away the only healthcare provider

260
00:14:47.001 --> 00:14:48.460
that they have.
Uh,

261
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.460
that's why I think you're seeing thousands of people actually rise up and speak

262
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:55.640
out.
And that's what we'll be doing in Wisconsin this weekend.
Oh,
good.
Yeah,

263
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.833
that'll be fun.

264
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.703
<v 1>MMM.</v>

265
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.210
<v 2>Talk a little bit about,
um,</v>

266
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.870
your newest constituent or I guess you say you're growing constituent of the

267
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:08.680
trans community and treating them shortly with,
you know,

268
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.090
what's the latest thing is,

269
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.961
<v 3>no,
exactly.</v>

270
00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:13.570
And we were talking about this a lot last night and I was in San Francisco.

271
00:15:13.571 --> 00:15:17.590
I mean,
we are proud our,
our motto at Planned Parenthood is Karen,
no matter what.

272
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.850
And that means no matter where your income,
your,
um,
your background,
uh,

273
00:15:21.851 --> 00:15:26.140
where you live,
uh,
no matter you know,
who you love,
how you love.

274
00:15:26.141 --> 00:15:30.340
And we've been proud to serve the transgender community here in the bay area.

275
00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:35.050
I know we provide services we do in 16 states around the country and it's

276
00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:36.810
continuing to grow.
Uh,

277
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:41.110
and that only not only a means providing specific services like hormone

278
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:42.650
replacement therapy,
but also plate.

279
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.440
I hope being a place where the trans community can come to for basic healthcare

280
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.580
and feel welcomed and not shamed and not stigmatized in any way.

281
00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:56.581
It has been heartbreaking to hear the stories of what the Trans Community faces

282
00:15:58.421 --> 00:16:00.400
just to get basic access to healthcare in America.

283
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:05.460
And this decision by the administration to repeal the just some basic rights for

284
00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:11.890
young people in this country is heartbreaking and it's wrong.

285
00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:14.620
And we have to fight back at every single opportunity.

286
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.103
<v 1>It's just</v>

287
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.460
<v 3>so,
and I,
and I will add,</v>

288
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.410
we are very proud and always have served anyone regardless of their immigration

289
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:29.030
status or the refugee status.

290
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:33.050
And we always will because healthcare should be a human right.

291
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.450
It shouldn't be a privilege and an honor.

292
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.450
<v 1>No,</v>

293
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.790
<v 2>you have this,
um,</v>

294
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.690
amazing or around you and you're at this fighter.
Um,
but you don't,

295
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.140
you I should say you come by it honestly.
And we would talk a little bit about,

296
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.760
uh,
your mom who I'm a huge fan of a hope for those who don't know her mother.

297
00:16:53.761 --> 00:16:58.260
Is Ann Richards or was Ann Richardson who is the governor of Texas,

298
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.480
went from school teacher to governor.

299
00:17:00.481 --> 00:17:03.870
It was rice and her father was a,

300
00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:08.460
is a major civil rights lawyer.
Argued in front of the Supreme Court.
Yeah.

301
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.150
<v 3>Dad is going to be so thrilled when he got,
he made Google,
well,</v>

302
00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:15.200
I have to tell him,
I mean it,

303
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:20.650
but what is it like to grow up in that family be expected to be out there?

304
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.520
Yeah.
Well,
uh,
I,
so I grew up in Texas and my parents were kind of,
um,

305
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.540
they were fighting everything in Texas and so,
but it was a,

306
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.730
it was a very privileged childhood.

307
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.690
I will say when everything that came through town,

308
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.790
my folks were into the civil rights movement and the women's movement and the

309
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:38.810
farm workers movement.

310
00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:42.620
And my dad was defending conscientious objectors to the Vietnam war.

311
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:46.280
And so it was a place where they really taught us that you could make a

312
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:50.010
difference in this world.
And um,
and so from a very early age,

313
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:53.460
we had that opportunity.
Um,
and one thing we were talking about earlier,

314
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:56.850
which is kind of funny,
my,
my folks,
uh,
eventually they moved to Austin,

315
00:17:56.851 --> 00:18:00.360
which was just frankly a more hospitable climate for their progressive.

316
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.580
Uh,
and there was a young woman who wanted to run for the state legislature.

317
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.310
And it's funny cause she wanted to run for the state legislature because she

318
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:11.940
couldn't get credit in her own name,
even though she was an attorney,

319
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:13.890
even though she had argued before the supreme court,

320
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.000
but she had to have her husband cosign.
I'm telling you guys,
this is like,

321
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.400
we're not that far away from this.

322
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:24.300
And so she wanted to run for the state legislature to change this and she

323
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:27.690
couldn't find a man to run a race.
And so my mother said,
well,
I'll do it.

324
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.760
And her name is Sarah Weddington.
And uh,
she was Sarah for those who don't know,

325
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:36.360
argued the Roe vs Wade case at the age of 26 years old.

326
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:41.820
So get busy like whatever you're doing now.
Um,
and uh,
anyway,

327
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:44.830
it was really interesting.
So mom,
you know,
as kids we got to,
you know,

328
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.930
do the kinds of things you do as kids on campaigns and learn those skills.

329
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.980
And Sarah one and then of course mom got the bug and decided if she can do it,

330
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:53.731
why don't I run?

331
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:57.510
And eventually was elected the first a pro choice woman governor of the state of

332
00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:02.400
Texas.
Yeah.
So it was pretty,
it was exciting time.
Yeah.
And do you think that,

333
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.680
uh,
I mean that has to be a little weird.

334
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:07.110
I mean to Sarah here and then planned parenthood.

335
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:09.960
Have you ever kind of thought about that?
Well,
it's just funny.

336
00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:11.260
I was in Houston last weekend.

337
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.550
They actually had the biggest planned parenthood luncheon in the history of the

338
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:15.710
organization.
And I mean,

339
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.250
that's what we're seeing around the country is folks just coming out in such big

340
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:20.880
ways.

341
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.570
And it was wonderful because Sarah was there and another good friend of mine,

342
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:25.441
Wendy Davis,

343
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:28.680
who of course led the historic filibuster in the state capitol in Texas.

344
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:32.540
So it was pretty,
it was pretty awesome.
Yeah.

345
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.670
<v 2>So I think there's also a misconception that if the government wouldn't pay you</v>

346
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:43.611
back for the services that maybe all this money and goodwill and all this stuff

347
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:47.010
that's coming in would be able to keep you all flipped.

348
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.380
<v 3>Is that,
that's a great,
that's a great question.
Yeah.</v>

349
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.020
And I should've probably finished on the whole defunding question.
We,

350
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:55.310
we operate just like hospitals and all of their healthcare providers and we just

351
00:19:55.311 --> 00:19:58.250
get reimbursed for services.
And so really the defunding is,

352
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.040
we're not in the federal budget.
We just,
they're just saying,

353
00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:03.620
you could no longer actually provide that care to folks.

354
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:09.670
There's no way you could make up for all the public services that we provide

355
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:10.850
through private donations.

356
00:20:10.851 --> 00:20:14.790
Even though we're incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support and,

357
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.890
and in addition,
I just think it's so important this country that we,

358
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:24.050
that we hold up and hold onto public health care as a,
as an important value.

359
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.050
We can't prioritize healthcare in this country because when we do folks who,

360
00:20:29.051 --> 00:20:33.320
who miss out or the folks who have the most,
most need,
uh,
to get healthcare.

361
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.460
And so I just think this is going to be a big,
a big fight here,
um,

362
00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:41.270
about the belief in the public healthcare system that it's a value not only for

363
00:20:41.271 --> 00:20:45.350
individuals but for our communities and for our economy.
Yeah.

364
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.740
<v 2>Do you think,
uh,</v>

365
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.800
<v 3>back to abortion for just one sec,</v>

366
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.160
if just for something would happen and you wouldn't be able to provide abortion,

367
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.830
there's this concern,

368
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.580
this idea that then it would be over that abortion would not happen.

369
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.730
Can you kind of,
they would just,
yeah.

370
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.760
I think that having a place that provides a safe place to have an abortion,

371
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:18.190
it's important.
Right,
right.
I mean,
abortion existed before Roe versus Wade.

372
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:21.280
It was just illegal and it was unsafe and young,

373
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.730
healthy women died routinely and emergency rooms across this country.
Yeah.

374
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:25.631
In fact,

375
00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:30.230
I was in San Francisco last night and there was a doctor there who wrote,

376
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.600
who was telling me he remembers in his residency seeing women with septic

377
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:37.420
abortions,
uh,
coming into the hospitals.

378
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.310
So it's not that abortion won't exist,
it's that it will be unsafe.

379
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.380
Uh,
and you know,
it's,
it's already in many areas of the country.

380
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.190
87% of the counties in this country don't have any abortion providers.

381
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:54.010
So women already face enormous obstacles,

382
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:57.710
particularly if they're low income or if they live in a state where there,
um,

383
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.910
where the politics make it very difficult.
To me,

384
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:04.570
the most important thing is that we make sure that it's safe and available for

385
00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:06.340
people,
that it's legal,
uh,

386
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.430
and that we do everything we can to make sure that folks have access to

387
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:13.360
preventive care that helps prevent unintended pregnancy in the first place.
And,

388
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.140
and frankly,
that's something that the vast majority of Americans agree on.

389
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.020
And I'll just put it in this one.

390
00:22:20.021 --> 00:22:23.620
Political plug is if more members of Congress could get pregnant,

391
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.420
we look at fighting about a lot of these issues.

392
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.790
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

393
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.640
<v 2>take questions in just a second.
But,
um,
I wanted to ask,
you know,
once again,</v>

394
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:36.850
we live in California

395
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.340
<v 3>and we can,
you know,
call our congressman,
call everyone,</v>

396
00:22:41.341 --> 00:22:44.490
but we are preaching to the choir a bit.

397
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.460
What can we else can we do to help you?
Well,

398
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.730
why it still is important to call your members of Congress because I was

399
00:22:50.731 --> 00:22:51.361
actually just in,

400
00:22:51.361 --> 00:22:55.200
in Washington and speaking through to a number of the senators and it makes a

401
00:22:55.201 --> 00:22:57.990
difference when they hear from you.
And uh,

402
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.540
can I just say thanks for sending Camilla Harris to the United States

403
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.720
<v 1>part of that.</v>

404
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.520
<v 3>She's,
she's,
uh,
she's already making a huge difference.</v>

405
00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:11.370
So it does matter actually,
uh,
that,
that you get involved.

406
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.150
The other thing you can do is be a defender and sign up with planned

407
00:23:15.151 --> 00:23:20.151
parenthood.org and sign up to be a volunteer because there were actions that

408
00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:22.290
we're asking people to take every single week.

409
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.070
And you can do that no matter where you live.
And if you're in virtual,
uh,

410
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.420
if you're a Google or out there in the world,
um,
we would love to have that.

411
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.750
And then the third thing is something that is just critically important.

412
00:23:33.751 --> 00:23:38.160
That is the work you took.
Google.
I mean,
I can't overstate,
I,
you know,

413
00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:40.980
back in the olden days when I started playing parents,
I was like,
oh my God,

414
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:44.160
the Internet and,
and planned parenthood where like a match made in heaven.

415
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:49.190
Because if the idea of planned period has always been to reduce access at me,

416
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:54.290
reduced barriers to care,
uh,
and barriers to lifesaving information,

417
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:59.820
we now see more people,
um,
through Google every month than we do,
you know,

418
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.810
in an entire year.
I mean,
literally,
I think in,
in January,

419
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:05.330
almost 10 million people came to us online.

420
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.320
And it's everything from being able to find a health center to getting

421
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:12.910
information about something you don't know about,
uh,
to,
um,
uh,

422
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.400
texting with us if you want to talk to someone in that way.

423
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:21.401
And so thank you for always thinking about creative ways that we can take away

424
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:23.863
the,

425
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.780
not only the cultural barriers but the literal barriers that folks have,
um,

426
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.470
have in getting care.

427
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.250
Because you mentioned being in San Francisco here,

428
00:24:34.251 --> 00:24:38.810
it is a good supportive community,
although I don't want to overstate that.

429
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.730
Still people struggle.
It's not that there's no place that's easy for everyone,

430
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.650
but the work that we're doing in California,
uh,

431
00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:51.590
in terms of now being able to give access to birth control online and even do

432
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:55.070
STI testing and treatment,
um,
virtually so that we can send,

433
00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.190
send 'em both pharmaceuticals and testing kits has really made a difference.

434
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:01.281
And we just dropped,

435
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:05.910
shipped us a birth control to women who want to Arctic glacier literally had,
um,

436
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.350
uh,
through a video chat had,
had gotten a birth control appointment.

437
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:14.351
So I just think the opportunities we have to apply technology to the issues that

438
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:17.570
we work on is limitless.
And thanks,

439
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.840
thanks to Google for being such a great partner over us.
Appreciate it.

440
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.490
You're welcome.
So
I want to make sure that I don't just talk.
So clip,

441
00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:27.170
I think it could ask some of the dory

442
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:34.080
<v 4>low on the topic of transgender,
Karen that you mentioned before.</v>

443
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.280
I have two related questions.
First of all,
you said only in 19 states,

444
00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:42.540
what is preventing you from expanding this to all 50 states?

445
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.460
And secondly,
uh,

446
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.730
I noticed that you still use women centric language,

447
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.080
talking about dealing with Eh,

448
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.900
giving women access to abortion and birth control.

449
00:25:54.901 --> 00:25:58.830
Obviously transgender men also need those same services.

450
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.050
Are you planning on using more inclusive language in that?

451
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.740
<v 3>Yup.
Thank you.
Quite well taken.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for that.
Um,</v>

452
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.370
and you're exactly,
you're exactly right.
And in terms of,

453
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.450
in terms of transgender care,
it's being just expanded state by state,
by state,

454
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.280
and it's ugly.

455
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.480
I think it's only a matter of time and I think that the uptake has been very,

456
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:24.590
very fast and we're proud to do that and we got to,

457
00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.860
we're going to fight to stay open so that we can continue to expand access to

458
00:26:27.861 --> 00:26:30.550
care because both of these things kind of go hand in hand.
Uh,

459
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.570
but thank you for your advocacy.
Thank you for your question.
Uh,

460
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.680
and we always tried to do,

461
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.640
do better in making sure that everyone can come to us for care regardless of

462
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:44.820
what they need.
Can you think for one second men coming to planned parenthood,

463
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:49.710
what percentage of your clients are men?
Um,
about 10%.
And it's,

464
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:50.040
um,

465
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.090
it's growing particularly because a lot of folks come to us for STI testing and

466
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:58.500
treatment,
which is a matter not only have I think convenience,

467
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.720
but I hope also of being a welcoming place.
And I mean,

468
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.180
I think of like I grew up in Texas where you didn't always want to just go to

469
00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:08.940
your family doctor or sexual reproductive health care issues.

470
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:13.600
And so I think it's so important that we provide a place that,
um,
uh,

471
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:18.330
that people feel welcome and that's includes,
um,
for testing.
I know.

472
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.170
I was in San Diego the other day,
uh,

473
00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:23.290
at one of the health centers and I looked into the waiting room and um,

474
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.890
usually it's the soaps on or something on the TV,

475
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:30.090
but it was ESPN and it was full of,
you know,
it was all guys,

476
00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:32.970
it looked like in the waiting room and it turned out it was a vasectomy day at

477
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:37.950
planned parenthood,
which is cool.
Um,
so anyway,

478
00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:38.983
yeah.

479
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.300
<v 5>Thank you for coming today.
I wanted to ask a question based on your,</v>

480
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.570
I would check your sources.
Uh,

481
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.680
wonderful and legendary moment.
Right now.
We know the facts,

482
00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:54.760
we know the numbers,

483
00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:59.380
but in the administration they are blatantly making that an issue.

484
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.910
They are promoting alternative facts and the true in Congress as well.

485
00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.070
And so many people are believing that around the country.

486
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.310
How do we constructively engage those people,

487
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:13.900
both the leadership and of course the average person on the street who believes

488
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:17.500
this stuff,
to help them really understand what the true issues are.

489
00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:22.270
The true numbers behind planned parenthood and other similar organizations.

490
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.500
<v 3>Look,
if I could figure out a way to,
uh,</v>

491
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.310
solve the fake news problem,
I'd probably be at another line of work.

492
00:28:31.311 --> 00:28:34.790
And I had I,
and I think it's,
but it is incredibly disturbing.

493
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.820
And when you have folks in elective office who are willing to misstate the truth

494
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.020
over and over again,
and that's why frankly,
everyone here is important.

495
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.690
People lifting up,
um,
real information and it,

496
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.330
but it is very difficult because I see members of Congress say things that are

497
00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:57.950
absolutely untrue.
Some of them I don't even know that they know,
uh,

498
00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.790
or I don't know if it's they don't know or they don't care to find out the
truth.

499
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.240
I will say I have been just so encouraged and excited to see hundreds of

500
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.780
thousands of people showing up at town hall meetings now with members of

501
00:29:11.781 --> 00:29:16.040
Congress.
That's the only way I know to really get truth out there.

502
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.580
And people telling their own personal stories and experiences with planned

503
00:29:19.581 --> 00:29:23.000
parenthood.
Those are things that are irrefutable and I get,

504
00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:27.050
I think sometimes we get caught up too much in numbers and we really have to

505
00:29:27.051 --> 00:29:28.100
lift up the,

506
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.880
the lived experiences that people have in this country trying to access

507
00:29:31.881 --> 00:29:36.710
reproductive health care,
accessing planned parenthood,
accessing other,
um,

508
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.350
other healthcare access.
It is at risk.
And I look,

509
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:44.110
I don't know that we're going to turn things around overnight,

510
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.860
but support in this country not only for planned parenthood but for,

511
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.940
for reproductive rights and reproductive access is growing.

512
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.700
And that's because of people speaking up and speaking out.

513
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.440
I think the only thing I would ask folks of if I feel like we're all going to

514
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:02.680
have to do things that are tougher than anything we've ever done because we're

515
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:06.490
living at a time that is really has been not like anything we've ever

516
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:10.270
experienced.
And so if you have had an experience,

517
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:11.950
I guess I would just ask anyone here,

518
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:14.230
and I know some of you have come up and told me your experience.

519
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.600
If you've been a planned parenthood patient,
you,
if you've gotten healthcare,

520
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.580
one in five folks in this country have,
tell your story,

521
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.550
posted online,
tell us at planned parenthood,

522
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.120
because those are the voices we have to lift up in this country if we're going

523
00:30:28.121 --> 00:30:32.960
to turn things around and actually go into a future that we,
that we want.
Um,

524
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.710
so thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Yep.

525
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.340
<v 6>Opinion about the supreme court nominees.</v>

526
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.910
So isn't he the one who physically denied birth control this ugly lot of

527
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:53.780
companies to deny birth control based on religious beliefs?
Strange.
Um,

528
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.020
should we ask our members of Congress to fight him?
Look at any costs.
Filibuster,

529
00:30:58.021 --> 00:31:01.990
do everything to stop this person.
And then if so then,
but about the Knicks,

530
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.550
we need it.
Yeah.
So it should be a strategy.

531
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:10.690
<v 3>Right?
So the question broadly is about the Supreme Court,
um,
and,</v>

532
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.770
and Gorsuch,
who was the nominee?
Um,
first of all,
I just have to,

533
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.470
I can't even answer that without saying it.

534
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:21.340
Just to me still an outrage that President Obama didn't get a hearing for his

535
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:22.630
nominee to the supreme court.

536
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.550
<v 1>It's really,
that was a [inaudible]</v>

537
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:32.010
<v 3>that was a betrayal of our,
our,
our constitutional system of government.
And so,</v>

538
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.000
and it has made even more highly partisan and political.

539
00:31:35.001 --> 00:31:36.230
I think the supreme court process,

540
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.510
obviously this nominee is going to be really important.

541
00:31:38.511 --> 00:31:42.860
He has some very disturbing,
uh,
views a about birth control access for women.

542
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.330
Uh,
and I assume more information will come out in hearings.

543
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.790
We feel very strongly at planned parenthood.

544
00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:53.480
We will not support any supreme court nominee who opposes women's rights,

545
00:31:53.481 --> 00:31:57.170
who opposes or suppose as to my friends,
good,
good point.

546
00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:01.040
Reproductive access for all people and abortion rights for people in this

547
00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:03.530
country.
Uh,
Roe versus Wade.

548
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.950
It's important for people to know this,
right?

549
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:12.130
Which folks have had for more than 40 years hangs by a thread and this nominee

550
00:32:13.191 --> 00:32:16.130
may not make the difference,
but the next one will.

551
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.930
And so it is incredibly important that folks lift up the,

552
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.140
how they feel about these issues and the fact that we are not going to go

553
00:32:24.141 --> 00:32:27.040
backwards in America on abortion rights.
Yeah.

554
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.170
<v 7>Um,
how do you stay hopeful in times like these weird,</v>

555
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:33.270
you know,

556
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.530
it just feels like access to healthcare and women's healthcare is kind of under

557
00:32:37.531 --> 00:32:40.130
attack and yeah,
basically how do you stay hopeful

558
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.880
<v 3>and stay active and not get burnt out?
Yeah.
Um,</v>

559
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.580
it's by meeting a young people like you.
Honestly,
I,

560
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.200
I'm an orbital organizer on my life and I feel like if you're,

561
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:54.440
or if you work for progressive change,
it's just always going to be tough.

562
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:58.580
And if it isn't tough,
you're not fighting for the right things.
Uh,
so,
uh,

563
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:03.910
but I have been encouraged by the amount of public participation now and not

564
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:04.850
just the marches,

565
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.900
but then what happened at the airports on the immigration bans and the Muslim

566
00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:12.700
bans and the fact that I think progressive,
the progressive community,
uh,

567
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.710
is standing,
uh,
together more than ever before.

568
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.130
That's the only way we're actually going to make change.

569
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.040
And in my day to day job,

570
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.130
what gives me sort of the energy in the morning,
uh,

571
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.440
besides getting to come here to Google,
which is a nice vacation from,
uh,
um,

572
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.520
some of this stuff I do is that,
and a friend of mine said this to me,

573
00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:35.990
the day was really important.

574
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.110
Every single day that planned parenthood stays open.

575
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:44.240
That's basically 8,118 people who got health care that day.

576
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.210
And so I just have to hold them

577
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:53.350
up here and think about that's why it's worth fighting every single day.
And,

578
00:33:53.351 --> 00:33:55.190
and ultimately,
um,

579
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.520
Tony Kushner wrote in angels in America,

580
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.660
the world only spins forward and I do believe that.

581
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.100
So even in our toughest times,

582
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:08.960
we just have to keep making sure that the world spins forward.
Thank you.
Yeah.

583
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:09.973
Thank you.

584
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.520
<v 8>You have some questions from folks tuning in on the live stream.
Um,</v>

585
00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:18.340
so Tim in San Francisco or San Francisco office is wondering,
um,

586
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:22.810
in terms of rhetorical strategies,
ways of discussing your response,
um,

587
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.090
in defending abortion,
where do you stand between,
um,

588
00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.140
your values based appeals?
You know,

589
00:34:28.141 --> 00:34:32.010
the fundamental right to bodily autonomy for example,
versus pragmatism,

590
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.910
pragmatic based appeals,
you know,
um,
health risks and so forth.

591
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.100
<v 3>Uh,
I think that the,</v>

592
00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:44.130
the whole topic of abortion in this country for too long was talked about and

593
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:48.570
sort of this binary political way,
right.

594
00:34:48.571 --> 00:34:51.730
And so in it sort of got labeled many,
many years ago,

595
00:34:51.731 --> 00:34:54.790
decades ago was sort of you're either pro choice or pro life,

596
00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.670
whereas most people in this country and particularly young people,
yeah.

597
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.640
Really reject labels and they don't want to be labeled in,
in any way.
And uh,

598
00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.320
which I think is a great thing.
I mean,

599
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.350
and so we started a long time ago really to not use those that always,

600
00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:14.710
you know,
there,
I'm sure we lapse sometimes,

601
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.570
but really to talk about to people about abortion as a,

602
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:21.730
just a deeply personal issue.
Yeah.
Because people do have feelings about it and,

603
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.070
and oftentimes people have had experiences about it.

604
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.160
And I think the question is not,
um,
what would you personally do?

605
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.610
Because I think we really,

606
00:35:30.611 --> 00:35:33.010
it's important to dignify that everyone has to be able to make their own

607
00:35:33.011 --> 00:35:34.990
decisions.
But that basically is the point,

608
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:37.920
is it everyone needs to be able to make their own decisions.
And that,

609
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.370
and what we have found over and over again is that people in this country,

610
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.320
even in some of the most conservative states,

611
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.340
politically conservative political states believe that at the end of the day,

612
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:50.610
a person to be able to make their own decision about their pregnancy without the

613
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:54.780
interference of the,
of the government or their member of Congress.
And,
uh,

614
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.290
you know,
we had an interesting experience in Mississippi and in South Dakota.

615
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.840
Those are states where they tried to ban abortion.
Um,

616
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.900
the legislature passed abortion bans and then it went to the ballot.

617
00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.870
And those are states that if you had polled them,
it would have,

618
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:09.330
they would have come out as being pro life states.
Right.

619
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.411
And folks would have said,
well,

620
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:13.740
there's no way you're going to defeat an abortion ban.
But in fact,

621
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:14.820
on election day,

622
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.480
the voters of those two states overwhelmingly rejected these bands.
Yeah.

623
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.160
Because people could,
could have,

624
00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:22.830
there could make the distinction between how they,

625
00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.610
they personally felt and what they believe the government,
um,

626
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.460
whether the government should interfere in those kinds of personal decisions.

627
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.080
So I think it's really more and just being willing to have conversations with

628
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:35.760
folks and we find that when you,

629
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:39.420
when you acknowledge that people have deeply personal feelings and you're not

630
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:42.150
trying to push them into a political space,
right?

631
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.340
Just like with everything else in this country,

632
00:36:44.341 --> 00:36:47.070
folks kind of relax and then can have an authentic conversation.

633
00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:50.190
And I just think we need to be doing more of that.
Um,
in America.

634
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:55.530
<v 2>How have you seen or have you seen a change in our country?</v>

635
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:01.240
Um,
how we talk about things,
how we talk to each other.
Have you seen we,

636
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.060
I think it's,
to me it seems like it's gotten worse,

637
00:37:04.061 --> 00:37:08.380
but I don't know if that's just me or where you are on the front lines of this

638
00:37:08.381 --> 00:37:10.930
and some very difficult issues over the last 10 years.

639
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.850
<v 3>Well,
I mean it's hard to,</v>

640
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.520
I think it's hard to make a blanket statement about that.

641
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.750
I will say something.
And,
and,
and I mean,

642
00:37:20.751 --> 00:37:24.620
it would be dishonest not to say how disturbing it is to see some of the lack of

643
00:37:24.621 --> 00:37:26.000
empathy,
um,

644
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:31.310
that we're seeing every single day now from some of our political leaders.

645
00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.260
Um,
that is,
I just,
we're better than that.
Um,

646
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.840
and,
and again,

647
00:37:38.841 --> 00:37:43.841
I think the lack of empathy for folks whose shoes they've never walked in.

648
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.950
And I guess I,
you know,
I just the,

649
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.490
again,
because I guess it's just so,
so recent,
um,

650
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:57.050
the stories of transgender people in this country and the barriers they face,
uh,

651
00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.670
and the harassment and bullying and the fact that we can't even let them go to a

652
00:38:01.671 --> 00:38:05.270
bathroom that,
uh,
and young people,
it just,

653
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.310
that's heartbreaking to see the,

654
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:12.410
the lack of compassion for immigrants,
for Muslims,

655
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.460
for people of different,
um,
uh,

656
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.540
countries and backgrounds is extraordinary.
Uh,
and,

657
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.830
and that,
so I,
I feel like we as,

658
00:38:24.831 --> 00:38:29.831
as a community collectively have to do more to reach out to people because I

659
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.730
simply do not believe that is where the majority of this country is.
And we are,

660
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.340
um,

661
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.340
we are not being well represented in Washington DC by folks who are fomenting a

662
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.790
divisiveness,
but it's going to take a lot of us standing together,
um,

663
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.180
to move forward.
But it's tough to see.
It's really tough to see.
Yeah.

664
00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.440
<v 8>Building off what you just said,</v>

665
00:38:52.441 --> 00:38:56.280
we have a Corey also in San Francisco wondering about the balance between

666
00:38:56.281 --> 00:38:56.911
planned parenthood.

667
00:38:56.911 --> 00:38:59.970
It's a national organization and the work you do on the front lines in different

668
00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:04.380
states that have different restrictions and so forth.
So how does,

669
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.440
how do,
how do you work as a national organization at the state level?

670
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.670
<v 3>Right.
Well,
so as I think I said earlier,</v>

671
00:39:10.671 --> 00:39:13.460
we're really proud that we're in every single state and also we do a lot of work

672
00:39:13.461 --> 00:39:18.080
overseas in Latin America and Africa.
Uh,
and I think that,

673
00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:18.621
you know,

674
00:39:18.621 --> 00:39:21.680
and what our colleagues would would say that it's very different depending on

675
00:39:21.681 --> 00:39:26.180
where you live,
um,
how,
how you operate,
uh,
you know,

676
00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:31.330
providing health care in a rural Wisconsin versus Berkeley versus,

677
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.370
um,
Dallas is different.

678
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.720
But I feel like we are all joined together by a common commitment to make sure

679
00:39:38.721 --> 00:39:42.710
that we serve folks who have the least access,
at least access to care.

680
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.900
But I think it is really important to recognize that it is.
Um,
it's,
it's,
um,

681
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:53.210
there are materially folks in this country who are low income people who have

682
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.260
live in political states where the,
the adversity is huge.

683
00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.480
It's really,
really tough.
It's really,
really tough.
And,
um,

684
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.820
I,
I guess I can't leave this topic without saying,
you know,

685
00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.120
there are a lot of people that inspire me and I've had the good fortune to have

686
00:40:11.121 --> 00:40:13.340
mentors and people who I look up to,

687
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.330
no one inspires me more than the doctors and clinicians that go through sunrise

688
00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.890
walk through picket lines and protesters to provide healthcare.
Yeah.

689
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:25.460
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

690
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.500
<v 2>I,
I,
um,
once,
when I was young,
much younger,
um,</v>

691
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.680
a very dear friend of mine who was in residency and got pregnant from her

692
00:40:35.991 --> 00:40:38.690
boyfriend who had Hodgkin's.
So it wasn't supposed to be able to.

693
00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.100
And so she asked me to walk her to the clinic,

694
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:48.160
to planned parenthood and just to see the screaming and the showing pictures and

695
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:52.250
this.
And I was like,
I can't imagine.
Right.

696
00:40:52.251 --> 00:40:55.400
And then that's your work environment and that people come because I feel it's

697
00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:56.360
the right thing to do.

698
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.530
<v 3>It's really amazing.
Uh,</v>

699
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.930
just the commitment and the passion that folks have that provide the care.

700
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:06.931
And I will say for every angry person with a ugly sign yelling at women,

701
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.630
there are thousands of supporters.
And I think that's what I will say,

702
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:14.590
even since the election,

703
00:41:14.591 --> 00:41:18.610
just the outpouring of people coming with baked goods to the clinics and to,

704
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.450
you know,
sending Valentine's and,
uh,
uh,
that I think too,

705
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.990
someone asked earlier,
what can you do?
It's like,
you know,

706
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:31.020
hug a clinician today because I can't tell you that that does make a difference

707
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.770
to people.
And,
um,
so,
so that,
that has been amazing.
You know,

708
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:40.490
last year we had the like,
um,
well it's,
it's,

709
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:44.990
sorry it's been now I'm more than a year.
Um,
but we had,
you know,

710
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:47.240
one of the worst shootings in our,

711
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:51.140
in our history in Colorado Springs and um,

712
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.430
I mean it's,
uh,

713
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:59.490
it's sort of an unthinkable that that would happen outside of a health center

714
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:04.270
and the outpouring of support from that community and the fact that our

715
00:42:04.271 --> 00:42:08.710
clinicians are now back at work.
Um,
and providing healthcare in Colorado Springs,

716
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.310
I hope shows the resilience of this community.
I remember the,
the,

717
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.290
the night of the,
after they finally apprehended the gunman and,
uh,

718
00:42:17.291 --> 00:42:19.060
we were on a national phone call,

719
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.940
four with all of our planned parenthood folks around the country about what to

720
00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:25.210
do the next morning because we had folks scheduled for four services and

721
00:42:25.211 --> 00:42:30.211
schedule for a clinical appointments and it was unanimous that we would reopen a

722
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.640
and we would reopen Saturday morning.
And of course,

723
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:37.780
as always happens when our folks got there to open the doors the next day that

724
00:42:37.781 --> 00:42:39.730
were women lined up outside waiting for us,

725
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:43.660
just hoping that we would be there for that.
And then so that is,
um,
that is our,

726
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.230
that is our commitment as these doors stay open no matter what.
Yeah.

727
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.793
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

728
00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:58.080
<v 9>So I wanna start by probably just thanking you and your organization on behalf</v>

729
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.480
of,
I think sort of all of us here.
I'm sure.
Uh,
it's,

730
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.980
it's sort of awkward to hear you speak so highly of,
of us and the work we do,

731
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.840
we need him.
We,
uh,
you know,
uh,

732
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.630
especially given the outpouring of support that planned parenthood got among

733
00:43:15.631 --> 00:43:20.460
Googlers in this past year.
Yes.
I think it's,
uh,
you know,

734
00:43:20.461 --> 00:43:24.420
we are in awe of the work that the organization do.
So yeah,

735
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.380
I guess I'll just take the opportunity to thank you on behalf of all of us who

736
00:43:28.381 --> 00:43:30.360
are,
uh,
admirers of yours.

737
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

738
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:41.590
<v 9>An actual question that you mentioned,
empathy and you know,</v>

739
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:44.190
me and so many people are struggling with sort of senior,
oh,

740
00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:48.650
that's happening across the country.
Um,
and,
and there's some folks that you,

741
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:52.000
the three here in the media that probably are lost causes,

742
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.960
we've probably sort of can't really speak to them.
Uh,

743
00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:00.300
I think you and your mom and your family spent a lifetime sort of trying to

744
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.300
convince people who can be turned around,
right,
who are capable of empathy.

745
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.450
I have cases in my own family where people,

746
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:11.090
you'll logical,
uh,

747
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:15.380
or religious views that seem to be incompatible with basic empathy.

748
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.460
How,
can you give us some tips for how to reach out to these folks?

749
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.010
<v 3>Um,
I mean,
it's an important work and I,
I guess I think that we,</v>

750
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:30.230
if we all start from a point of empathy and trying to really hear and understand

751
00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:32.790
where others are coming from,
that's the best we can do.
And I don't,

752
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.130
I don't think people necessarily change in a moment.

753
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.030
I think they changed from their lived experiences.
Uh,

754
00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.700
I mean we see at planned parenthood,
it is,

755
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:47.300
it is not uncommon to have someone who was picketing our clinic before come in

756
00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:53.510
and bring her daughter in and say,
you know,
I,
you know,
we,

757
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.640
we need your care.
We need,
uh,
and,

758
00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:01.620
and I hope that we always carry ourselves in the way that that's what we're

759
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:05.940
there for is care no matter what.
Uh,
I think,

760
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.720
I do think people telling their stories,
and again,
one of the,

761
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.750
one of the things that I feel like we're not going to change in a way the

762
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:17.070
politics of this country until we change the culture and cultural attitudes.

763
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.780
And so one of the things that we've been working hard on is to lift up stories

764
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:25.080
of people because I think it's just harder for people then to me,

765
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:30.110
statistics and numbers and policies and rights are really not what,

766
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.930
what reach people.
It is literally people's lived experiences.
And,

767
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.350
and that's what I mean,
it's been fascinating to see.

768
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.340
And there were not that many people who don't have some kind of lived

769
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.220
experiences with re some kind of reproductive health issue.

770
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.210
I mean you were talking about your sister and uh,

771
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.610
your experience with your friend.

772
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:50.490
And I think lifting up those stories and making people think,

773
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.710
because I think the struggle we have sometimes is folks,

774
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.200
they can't relate because they think,
well,

775
00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:58.290
it's never going to be an issue for me.
And for a lot of people in this country,

776
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.660
even when abortion was illegal,

777
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.160
they were able to fly to France or they were able to fly to another country.

778
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.860
And so I think it is really important that we do lift up the stories of the

779
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:11.550
folks who are affected and who are going to be the most effected if we lose

780
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:15.240
access to healthcare in America.
Uh,
and that's the best we could do.

781
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.240
Cause I just believe in their core people are good.

782
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.330
Sometimes they're afraid and sometimes they are,
um,

783
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.440
they don't have exposure to other ideas and we just have to keep,
um,

784
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.980
keep trying to lift,
lift those up.
And I,
again,

785
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.120
I've even seen in my short time of planned parenthood that the support,

786
00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:36.510
not only for this organization,
but the engagement and involvement has grown.

787
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:41.010
And that is to me is just cause you just never quit and never give in.

788
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.880
Uh,
one other thing that to me is just,
this is,
I started getting back to numbers,

789
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:48.780
but 4 million young people turn 18 every single year in this country.
Okay.

790
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.200
So talk to them.
I mean I just,

791
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.660
I mean I think there are some folks in this country who was sort of like,

792
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:57.210
are not going to really necessarily be open to new ideas,

793
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:01.200
but young people are in general,
so eager,

794
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.600
they want to get involved,
they want to do things,

795
00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:07.380
they want to make a difference in the world.
There are more progressive.
They are,

796
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.070
um,
they're,
they're,
they're,
they're uh,

797
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.800
open to all of us and I think that we have to spend more of our time,

798
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.850
tried to engage them and bring them along and let them break,

799
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.670
make them leaders of this country.
Um,
if the young people of this country lead,

800
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.140
we will change everything.
You sound good.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask,

801
00:47:25.141 --> 00:47:27.990
because this last month has been full of so many news cycles.

802
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:30.130
And one thing that I think was somewhat is the global gag

803
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.420
<v 10>rule and how that affected,
uh,
you mentioned your work in other countries,</v>

804
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:35.254
if he could speak to that.

805
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:39.420
<v 3>Right.
So the global gag rule that was signed by the president,
they want,</v>

806
00:47:39.421 --> 00:47:43.800
I believe,
right.
I think before it was really red,
um,

807
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:48.800
because it was very expansive,
uh,
at not,

808
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.820
it not only threatens access to,
uh,

809
00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:54.870
I mean programs that had been providing family planning,

810
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.530
but programs that provide all kinds of basic maternal healthcare around the

811
00:47:58.531 --> 00:48:02.820
world and,
um,
and women will die as a result.

812
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:04.920
And that's unacceptable.

813
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:08.280
Know we made a lot of progress and why I say we,

814
00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:12.420
I mean the collective public health community made a lot of progress in the last

815
00:48:12.421 --> 00:48:16.830
eight years in reducing maternal mortality rates,
uh,
globally and,

816
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.600
uh,
and rates of unsafe abortion.
And it's,

817
00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:23.460
it is absolutely unconscionable that we would now go back in a different

818
00:48:23.461 --> 00:48:27.000
direction.
And again,
that's the other reason why it's so important that we,

819
00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.220
the politics of this country not only effect is you're saying,
you know,

820
00:48:31.221 --> 00:48:34.380
or as we all know that only affect the people that are in this country,

821
00:48:34.381 --> 00:48:37.050
the effect millions and millions of women nationwide.

822
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.610
And that is so the,

823
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:44.340
our global policy or is going to be as impactful as some of the decisions that

824
00:48:44.341 --> 00:48:48.520
are being made domestically.
Um,
so it's,
um,

825
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.010
that was very disturbing.

826
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:55.150
And then I didn't realize someone told me that with the global gag rule also,

827
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.350
you're a woman in serving in the military,

828
00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.120
in a country where abortion is illegal,

829
00:49:00.121 --> 00:49:04.110
where you could have gotten it on the base.
Now you're not allowed to.

830
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.220
And I don't,

831
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:09.630
I don't actually think that relate that the gag rule related to global funds.

832
00:49:09.631 --> 00:49:11.260
But I could be,
I could be wrong though,

833
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.610
but I don't think that actually is connected to that particular executive order.

834
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:19.740
Um,
and of course the global gag rule,
it's not only about services,

835
00:49:19.741 --> 00:49:23.640
it's about even telling women what their legal rights are in a country.
Um,

836
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.620
you could no longer receive,
receive,
um,

837
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.900
a USA ID money.
So it's um,

838
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.480
farby beyond services.
Yeah.

839
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.580
<v 10>Um,
you talked a little bit about the change that comes from women actually</v>

840
00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:41.970
governing and obviously we haven't made much strides in that in Congress or in

841
00:49:41.971 --> 00:49:42.960
state legislators.

842
00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:47.220
So I was just wondering if you are hopeful for the next cycles and for 2018 or

843
00:49:47.221 --> 00:49:51.060
if you're seeing more women running for office after what's happening

844
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:55.250
<v 3>more women are definitely raising their hand to run for office and I think it's</v>

845
00:49:55.251 --> 00:49:56.360
not just giving congress,

846
00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.750
I mean one of the problems is we've got to start like now school boards,

847
00:49:59.751 --> 00:50:03.230
city council.
So if there is anyone in here who wants to run for office,

848
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.190
see me later.
It really is,
I do think folks are just,

849
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.270
I think after this election everyone I know looked up and said,
okay,

850
00:50:11.271 --> 00:50:14.360
what am I doing with my life?
Is there something more I could be doing?

851
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.200
And for a lot of folks that may mean considering running for office and they had

852
00:50:18.201 --> 00:50:22.430
never thought about it before and it,
it makes an enormous difference.
So,

853
00:50:22.431 --> 00:50:24.020
I don't know if you're a potential candidate,

854
00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:28.130
but I would just say don't shake your head.
Uh,
my mom would say,

855
00:50:28.131 --> 00:50:31.760
don't shake your head because I think the problem is a lot of women wait for

856
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:35.420
someone to come and ask them,
you don't go,
you would be the perfect candidate.

857
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.610
This is going to be,
you know,
great.

858
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:42.050
And so they wait for everything to be perfect.
So do not wait,

859
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.060
just do it.
Uh,
I,
I think,
um,
mom used to always say that,

860
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.510
that,
um,
and when we talked about this a lot that I think,

861
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.850
and I don't want to be gendered about this,

862
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.480
but I think women have had historically,
um,

863
00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.990
they think somehow they're not right for the next thing.

864
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:02.000
Whether it's running for office for the next job because they don't have the

865
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:04.610
right degree or they don't know the right people or they didn't take the right

866
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:07.200
class or they don't speak the right language,
you know,
x this.

867
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.800
And there's always a reason why we're not qualified.

868
00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.710
And so just want to say this is a time,
if ever,

869
00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:16.940
in your lifetime to just just do it.
And just take the chance.
Um,

870
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.730
I have seen in Congress,

871
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.090
in the United States Senate every single time and additional woman has come to

872
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:27.650
United States Senate.
It has made a profound difference in that body.
And,

873
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.980
and as you say,
we've got a long way to go,

874
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:35.870
but if we could get to more gender equity in,
uh,
in,
um,

875
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:38.600
in not only in Congress but across the board,

876
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.590
it makes a difference in everything.
So,
um,
I hope you'll run,

877
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.270
I hope that's what you asked.
Okay.
And then for those of you who don't know,
um,

878
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:51.260
uh,
you worked for Nancy Pelosi.
I did.
I did actually.
Yes.

879
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:55.380
And she absolutely made,
has made,
I mean,

880
00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.480
incredibly impactful in my life has made such a mark in the u s congress.
Yeah.

881
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.380
And,
um,
I think she,

882
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:08.560
she is so much more deserving of praise and adulation for what she has done in

883
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:12.620
her years in Congress.
Um,
I feel like she will never get her favor.

884
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:15.320
Do so just let me just say that to all of you,
you're very,

885
00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:18.980
very lucky to be represented by those who have congresswoman Pelosi as your

886
00:52:18.981 --> 00:52:21.600
representative.
Yeah.
She's amazing.
Yeah.

887
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.270
<v 11>All right.
Thank you very much for being here today.</v>

888
00:52:25.271 --> 00:52:29.980
This will be emotional for me because I'm a,
it was a big fan of your mothers.

889
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:34.360
Um,
and having seen also this month,
uh,

890
00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:39.420
the Condoleezza Rice and Secretary Albright speaking in these exceptional women

891
00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:44.140
who stood up and stood out in a time when it was more difficult,

892
00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:48.490
um,
that inspired me to pursue an education and political science.

893
00:52:48.491 --> 00:52:51.190
I started my career the first decade in DC.

894
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:54.160
A long colorful path has led me here to Google.

895
00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:59.050
Thank you for your advocacy on behalf of planned parenthood.

896
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.570
It is the organization,

897
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.970
but without which the architecture of my life would not have been possible.

898
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.830
And for any one in this room bend,

899
00:53:10.831 --> 00:53:15.831
it doesn't have the experience of a time without access to abortion.

900
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:18.580
Horrible word,

901
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:24.190
a horrible thing to not have access to that changes everything about your,

902
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.500
everything about your sister's lives,
your daughters' lives,

903
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.350
the men in your life,
their lives,

904
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:36.590
the economics of your journey are entirely dependent upon your dominion over

905
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:40.980
your reproductive healthcare.

906
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.070
They are inextricably connected.

907
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:49.230
So please advocate,
please march.
Please send money.

908
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.910
Please run for office.
And I will too.

909
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:59.060
I will see you after and I will raise my hand and I will find a way to,

910
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.020
uh,
represent,
uh,
communities with this voice.

911
00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:10.260
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

912
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:17.290
<v 11>thank you.
Uh,
there is a language problem,
uh,</v>

913
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:21.180
with,
with the entire concept.

914
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:25.490
The word abortion has horrible.
Who isn't prolife I have a life.

915
00:54:25.491 --> 00:54:30.060
I like mine.
Sure.
You're enjoying yours.
And who's pro abortion?

916
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:33.810
How can you say that?
If you've been anywhere near,

917
00:54:33.811 --> 00:54:36.660
if you've walked a friend through those doors,

918
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:41.580
if you've walked out of those doors yourself,
you cannot be pro abortion.

919
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:46.590
We have a language problem in the definitions and this has dominion over

920
00:54:46.591 --> 00:54:50.250
yourself,
over your journey,
over your economics.

921
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.560
I think we need to address that.

922
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:57.690
And then the more subversive me wonders with our current president,

923
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:02.790
with the history of his women,
of his philandering,

924
00:55:02.791 --> 00:55:04.620
of his pussy grabbing,

925
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.480
couldn't we find possibly someone that he's walked through those doors in and

926
00:55:09.481 --> 00:55:12.750
out?
Every male member,
their daughters,

927
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:17.751
their lovers have walked in and out of those doors and yet they vote.

928
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.330
And yet they appoint judicial members,

929
00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:27.090
complete contrast and in assault against your right.
Talk through those doors.

930
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:31.260
How militant should we get?
How subversive could we get?

931
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:35.250
There's so many questions.
I've got like sell 20 Napkins,

932
00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:38.610
sorry to dump all that.
That's good.
But now,
you know,

933
00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:41.400
how hard are we going to need to fight?

934
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.220
What horrible words are we going to have to use?

935
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.650
What accusations will we have to make?

936
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:51.150
What outing may we have to perform to get someone to say,

937
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.220
okay,
you got me.
This isn't my decision.
This is yours.
Yep.

938
00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.390
<v 3>No,
I mean,
I don't think we can be subversive enough.
And,
uh,
it's,</v>

939
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.180
I think that's what is exciting to me is seeing,

940
00:56:03.181 --> 00:56:05.640
seeing folks are pushing further than they ever have before,

941
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:10.320
but we're going to have to,
and,
uh,
so I don't have a,
you know,

942
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:13.990
I think that you've pretty much outlined what we're against.
I would say that,

943
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.010
that I don't think the question so much is,

944
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.910
and I understand that language matters,
but here's the,
here's the question.
If we,

945
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:23.490
I think we get to the fundamental question is,
um,

946
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.280
who is in the best position to decide about a pregnancy?

947
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.690
Is it the person who's pregnant or is it an elected official or a politician?

948
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.670
And that's fundamentally where people are at.

949
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.550
You can have your own decisions about what you would do,

950
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:38.980
but you can never know what another person's situation is.

951
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.430
And that is where we do create empathy,
I think to your question.
Uh,

952
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.330
and we don't try to like push people into political corners and we don't try to

953
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:49.160
like label them with politics and frankly the evidence,

954
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.680
what I would ask the president of the United States is,
um,

955
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:57.370
who should make those decisions?
Is it the,
is it the person who has a pregnancy,

956
00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.300
uh,
be able to make a decision about that with their doctor,

957
00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:05.920
with their partner,
with their family,
with whoever,
or just for themselves?

958
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:09.370
Or is it someone who an elective office.

959
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:14.350
And that is where fundamentally the u s people are on our side.
Um,

960
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:19.380
and we just simply cannot stand back or be cowed by the rhetoric and fake news

961
00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:26.190
on the other side.
So,
but yeah,
I'll see you later.

962
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:30.540
<v 1>Okay.
It's a nasty woman.</v>

963
00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.690
I couldn't think of anything more appropriate to wear today.
Thank you.

964
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.240
<v 11>So I'm also going to start by thanking you for all that you do.</v>

965
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.110
I grew up in Arkansas where I got exposed to avenues abstinence only quote

966
00:57:44.111 --> 00:57:45.340
unquote education,
right?

967
00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.540
And now I work for a sex education nonprofit hotline in San Francisco.

968
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.780
And the amount of questions we get from people that do not have the basic

969
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:58.900
knowledge about their bodies and what is happening to them is staggering.

970
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:01.720
And we were for many of those people to planned parenthood.

971
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:07.020
But I'm wondering what we can do to help young people get access to that

972
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:10.840
information before they even get to the point where they need your services.

973
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:13.140
<v 3>Yeah,
I listen for.
So can I just say back at you,</v>

974
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.000
thank you for what you do because it is

975
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:18.520
<v 1>so important and there is</v>

976
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.530
<v 3>the beautiful thing and what are the exciting things about working with Google</v>

977
00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:26.820
and Facebook and Twitter is that there is so much more opportunity,

978
00:58:26.821 --> 00:58:29.610
but there's a lot of bad information out there.
And you know,

979
00:58:29.611 --> 00:58:34.050
we do a text chat program that allowing not just young people but that's

980
00:58:34.051 --> 00:58:36.840
primarily who does it,
just to text with us.
And the same thing,

981
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:39.510
I mean questions you and unfortunately and is that we've all,

982
00:58:39.511 --> 00:58:42.030
we see this from the moment we started doing the work online.

983
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:44.850
The most common question is do you think I could be pregnant?

984
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:51.060
So obviously that conversation needed to happen at a lot sooner and this is

985
00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:52.500
where it is.
You know,

986
00:58:52.501 --> 00:58:54.570
people ask me what's going to happen now with this government?

987
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.840
And one of my biggest fears with HHS as we were going to now completely go

988
00:58:57.841 --> 00:59:01.710
backwards in terms of sex education.
I mean,
it's so backwards.
Texas,

989
00:59:01.711 --> 00:59:05.880
same as Arkansas,
you know,
uh,
our former governor Rick Perry,

990
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:10.390
who's now a cabinet member,
I can't even believe this,
you know,

991
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.220
was a big abstinence only,
um,
you know,
uh,

992
00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.240
proponent because he said it would work for him.

993
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:19.060
<v 1>Just like the thought that,
that he never did get pregnant.
There we go.</v>

994
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:20.700
That's the kind of way

995
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.050
<v 3>we make.
So we</v>

996
00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:26.540
<v 1>have got to find more disruptive ways to use technology and to use outreach to</v>

997
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:28.790
young people.
It's why we've invested so much money,

998
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:33.620
not only on the tech side but literally like the youth empowerment leadership

999
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:38.240
wise.
Because I think the,
you know,
the old fashioned part of this too is,

1000
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:42.680
I mean they may find you right?
They may find your service,
but um,

1001
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:46.220
they may just find someone who is a peer in their community.

1002
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:49.390
And to me this has been kind of the underground railroad,
uh,

1003
00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:50.660
of planned parenthood for many,

1004
00:59:50.661 --> 00:59:54.770
many decades is the young people who are trained to sex educators and advocates

1005
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:58.640
who carry condoms in their,
in their backpack,
who everyone sort of knows.

1006
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:03.380
And we have to sort of combine that I think high touch with high tech outreach

1007
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:06.320
to young people because basically,
you know,

1008
01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:09.140
people think that they just come to planned parenthood.
Young people come to us.

1009
01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:12.080
I just want birth control.
Basically.
They want someone to talk to,

1010
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:14.940
they want someone to talk to about,
um,

1011
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:19.490
relationships about am I normal?
So common,

1012
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:25.390
just heartbreaking.
You know,
one boob is bigger than the other.
Um,

1013
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.900
is there something wrong with me?

1014
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:33.350
This is where young people are at in this country and why it is so heartbreaking

1015
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:38.351
that we have now I think a government that is turning their back on their lived

1016
01:00:38.451 --> 01:00:41.420
experience.
So,
uh,
I think we can do more.

1017
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.710
That's why I feel like everything we're doing now now is skewing to really 12 to

1018
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:50.210
18 year olds.
Um,
because if we can catch on people early,
we've can empower them,

1019
01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:51.380
we can give them information,

1020
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.080
we give them access to care and we give them support.

1021
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:57.270
They're going to run this country and they're going to run the world.
Um,
and so,

1022
01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.010
uh,
I think the dividends are enormous.
Um,

1023
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.580
but thank you for doing this work.
And I just,
can I just say,
I,
you know,

1024
01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.410
I wanted the luckiest people in the world.
I have a job at planned parenthood.
Um,

1025
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:15.090
it's such an honor to work for this organization and,
uh,
it's,

1026
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.690
it's,
it's just an overwhelming,
um,

1027
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:20.360
I think all of us now at this time in our lives or trying to figure out what do

1028
01:01:20.361 --> 01:01:21.860
we do?
You know,
what can we do?

1029
01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:26.360
And so I'm grateful to all of you who have raised your hand,
um,
who signed up,

1030
01:01:26.361 --> 01:01:29.010
who support us,
who support our patients.
Uh,

1031
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.440
this is a time we've never been called to in any way like this before.

1032
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:37.700
And we just gotta be,
we gotta be up to the challenge.
So hang in there.

1033
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.160
Our time is out.

1034
01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.090
<v 2>And I just wanted to thank you and I also want to point out that,
you know,</v>

1035
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.800
I've seen you and watched you,
uh,

1036
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.450
and the thing that you've taught me is that no matter how he did the situation

1037
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:59.180
is no matter how much rhetoric or whatever's thrown at you,

1038
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:04.181
you always remain graceful and composed and get your points across.

1039
01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:09.840
<v 3>That may be changing,
but just going to say,
but there's a limit.</v>

1040
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:13.740
There's a limit.
Um,
look,
I,
I think,
well,

1041
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:18.360
I believe on,
on these set of issues.
Yeah.
We have the benefit that,

1042
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.580
that people are with us.
And I mean in the broadest possible sense.

1043
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:26.090
And that is where I feel like,
um,

1044
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:31.680
and why I'm just so amazed at the courage of folks just to stand up and speak

1045
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:36.390
out because I really do believe that American people are looking for leadership

1046
01:02:36.391 --> 01:02:39.930
right now.
So thank you all for being leaders and here is one.
There we go.

1047
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:41.140
<v 1>Thank you very much.</v>
