1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.320
Oh,
it's my pleasure to introduce Elizabeth Rozner.

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.760
She's here today to speak about her most recent book survivor cafe,

3
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.610
the legacy of trauma and a labyrinth of memory.

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.080
It grapples with intricate and possibly unanswerable questions,

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.920
but how we recognize and cope with the traumas we inherit and how we can

6
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:29.900
properly keep alive the personal stories behind grid historical atrocities even

7
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.830
after everyone who lived through that and it's gone and her focus on Holocaust

8
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:34.664
survivors.

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.350
Rosner uses the lens of for three visits to Germany with her father who was born

10
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.170
in Hamburg and imprisoned in Brooklyn,
valid concentration camp.

11
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.570
The book also investigates the multigenerational aftermath of the bombings of

12
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:52.460
Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
the Cambodian killing fields,
the legacies of slavery,

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.440
and other historical atrocities.

14
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.640
I could read from any one of dozens of endorsements for this book,

15
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.310
but I'll choose one from the San Francisco Chronicle,

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.790
which name survivor cafe want to be a hundred best books of 2017 survivor cafe

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.980
feels like the book Rosner was born to ride.

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.350
Each page is imbued with urgency,
with sincerity,
with heartache,
with heart.

19
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.790
Her words,

20
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.350
alongside the words of other survivors of atrocity and their descendants across

21
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.110
the globe can help us build a more humane world.

22
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.660
Prior to survivor cafe,
Elizabeth published three bestselling novels,

23
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.440
the first of which the speed of light was internationally acclaimed and

24
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.120
translate it into nine languages.

25
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.990
Its central theme addresses the effects of the Holocaust and the descendants of

26
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:43.160
survivors.
A graduate of Stanford,
UC Irvine,

27
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.210
and the University of Queensland in Australia.
Elizabeth is awesome.
My aunt,

28
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.140
I had the opportunity to accompany her on the third of the trips to Germany with

29
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:55.640
my grandfather after which she started putting pen to paper on survivor cafe.

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.780
Without further ado,
Elizabeth Rosner.

31
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.560
<v 0>Thank you.
As raw.
You forgot to introduce yourself.
That was Ezra Brittler,</v>

32
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:08.670
my nephew and employee of Google.
It's great to be here.

33
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:13.050
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for spending lunchtime with me.

34
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.980
My hope today is that I will share with you some of what I think of as the

35
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:22.860
highlights of what I learned while writing this book.

36
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.690
It's a blending of the personal narrative as as ray mentioned,

37
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:28.524
my,

38
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.560
my role in life in a way as a daughter of two Holocaust survivors.

39
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.790
Please help yourselves to books as you come in there for you and um,

40
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.840
and that then led me to reaching into a wider research based approach to other

41
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:51.621
lineages that seemed to carry residue from historical trauma.

42
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.290
And as we mentioned,
a few of them I'll touch on.

43
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.320
I'll touch on some of them in my talk and I also am going to share with you some

44
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:05.731
things that we are learning in the realm of science about measurable evidence

45
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:11.701
based studies showing that trauma actually modifies the expression of DNA and

46
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.460
that what we have long known as anecdotally children,

47
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:19.181
grandchildren,

48
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:24.181
great grandchildren of people who have endured war and genocide and other acts

49
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.570
of violence,

50
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.250
that that residue seems to pervade subsequent generations.

51
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.560
Scientists in the field of genetics,
a new field actually called epigenetics,

52
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.480
is starting to show that this is not something we're just imagining that it's

53
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.280
actually present and measurable.

54
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.060
Then I'm going to touch on some of the impacts of memory studies and the ways

55
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.780
that we memorialize the past that also relate to how,

56
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:55.270
not just personal inheritance of trauma,

57
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.300
but the collective inheritance of trauma can be addressed in terms of culture,

58
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:03.730
in terms of shared memory,

59
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.950
and ultimately in the hope of healing and transforming some of those legacies

60
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:13.951
into something more hopeful and in order we hope not to continue to repeat a lot

61
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:20.520
of the atrocities of the past.
So to start with,
um,

62
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.120
a little bit about me,
I,
um,
I grew up in upstate New York.

63
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.470
Both of my parents,
um,
as I mentioned were Holocaust survivors.

64
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.710
My mother was in the Vilna ghetto,

65
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.290
which you may be familiar with historically,

66
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.670
and then she survived the war in hiding with her parents in the Polish

67
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:44.590
countryside.
As a young teenager,
my father,
as you also heard,

68
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.100
um,

69
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.690
was imprisoned in the bullhorn walled concentration camp at the age of 15.

70
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.430
And the camp was liberated just after he turned 16 years old.

71
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.120
My parents ended up meeting as refugees in Sweden,

72
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:01.120
getting married in Israel and then coming to America.

73
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.720
And by the time I was born on the very last day of the fifties it was as though

74
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:12.991
I were being born into the other life that my parents had created their American

75
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:16.090
selves.
They're reinvented selves,

76
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.480
and yet I really did feel as though something had been transmitted to me in

77
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:25.330
utero and for a long time,
people like me,

78
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.510
children of Holocaust survivors were told that we were being hysterical or too

79
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:34.540
sensitive about feeling as though our emotional landscape,

80
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.160
our psychological landscape was so impacted by something that didn't happen to

81
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:41.710
us.
But in fact,
as I mentioned,

82
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.970
we are starting to recognize that this is a real phenomenon.

83
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.350
So I became a writer partly because I kept on wanting to ask questions.

84
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.340
You've probably heard that writers are encouraged to write what they know will.

85
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:03.590
In my case,
I wanted to write what I wanted to know.

86
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.790
So writing for me has always been an active curiosity and inquiry and

87
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.980
investigation.
And this book,

88
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.010
even though it comes after three novels and a poetry collection in many ways,

89
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:20.120
really does feel like the book that contains all of the questions I've been

90
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.710
asking all of my life.

91
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.090
What is it that I carry that happened before I was born?

92
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.390
How does that not differentiate me from others but actually make me feel even

93
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.030
more connected to others?
When I was growing up,

94
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.870
I often felt like I was markedly different from my peers.

95
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.870
A lot of the Americans in my hometown had been there for generations.

96
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.190
I was a first generation American,
as was my older sister and my younger brother,

97
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.290
so we had something in common with each other and our small kind of tribe.

98
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.400
My parents' friends,

99
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:59.210
a lot of them were also survivors of the Holocaust in Europe,

100
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.430
but in the larger sense,
I didn't feel like I was much like my peers.

101
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.910
And so over time I started to recognize that the more I looked into what I felt

102
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:16.031
made me so unusual that I felt so sensitive to let's say,

103
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.540
anxieties or preparing for catastrophe.

104
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.570
Or there were some friends of mine I know whose parents also survived going into

105
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:28.010
exile from the Holocaust.

106
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.690
They always kept a suitcase packed just in case things like that,

107
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.340
that we considered normal.

108
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.470
Most of our friends thought that was a little bizarre,
a little paranoid maybe,

109
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:41.870
or a little overreactive over sensitive.

110
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:47.270
And yet over time I became more and more clear that in fact,

111
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.050
subsequent generations of Japanese who survived Hiroshima and Nagasaki actually

112
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:57.620
have some similar behavior patterns and thought patterns.

113
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.100
So do the descendants of slaves,
excuse me,

114
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:03.530
African American slaves in the United States.

115
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.830
So do refugees from Cambodia who survived the killing fields in Cambodia.

116
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.330
And unfortunately the list does go on.
Um,

117
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.390
it's a big list.
And in the book I don't cover every atrocity because in fact,

118
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:24.320
the more research I did,
the more I realized that even in the news,

119
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:28.490
as I was writing the book,
new atrocities were taking place.

120
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.050
So I don't for example,

121
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:35.051
include what's happening to the Rohingya in Myanmar even though that is in this

122
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:40.250
moment,
a genocide unfolding before our eyes.
Um,

123
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.280
so the conversation is a big one and what I'm trying to do is allow you some

124
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:52.871
intimate access to a personal story and then see how you might find your own

125
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:59.040
connection to that story even if you don't necessarily recognize any of the

126
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.600
places I've referred to,

127
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.870
but your own family lineage is probably inscribed with something that does then

128
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.570
pass through you.
Intergenerationally

129
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.570
I'm going to read you a passage from one of the psychiatrists that I cite in my

130
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:22.980
book who specializes in inherited trauma.

131
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.040
She works with families whose children seem to be exhibiting signs of PTSD even

132
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:33.750
when the children themselves have not been traumatized.

133
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.890
And this is the great mystery that we've been trying to understand.

134
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:42.840
How is it that you can look at somebody who grew up seemingly in a safe and

135
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:47.280
protected environment,
still be displaying signs of PTSD.

136
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:50.670
So I'm going to read you her,
her definition of how,

137
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.620
how this PTSD shows up.

138
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.560
Unresolved trauma takes two different forms.

139
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:04.020
The first is dissociation,
where the trauma is blocked.

140
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.260
There are no words not only pushed away but insecurely pushed away.

141
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.010
And just to explain about that a little bit.
So,

142
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.370
so this kind of numbing effect,

143
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.400
this way of sort of not being present in the moment is is for some people a form

144
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.100
of PTSD and inability to manage their emotions is so overwhelming that they just

145
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:34.920
shut down completely emotionally.
The second way,

146
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.950
the opposite way is where the trauma is uncontainable overflowing.

147
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.070
Interactions are overflowing with emotion.

148
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.460
The person mixes past and present the trauma intrudes in places it doesn't

149
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:54.120
belong and that's the sentence I really want to focus on.

150
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:57.420
The trauma intrudes on places it doesn't belong.

151
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.840
It's sometimes defined as people's inability to feel safe in a safe environment.

152
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.830
So you may know someone or have witnessed someone or experienced it yourself

153
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.500
sitting in a perfectly quiet place out in nature perhaps where everything seems

154
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:20.931
to be completely tranquil and unthreatening and yet your heart is racing your

155
00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:25.650
pulses going mad.
You might break out in a sweat.

156
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.250
These are signs that internally you're experiencing,

157
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:31.770
not what the present moment is offering up,

158
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:37.010
but some associative experience that makes you feel as though you're not in the

159
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:38.101
present.

160
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:43.101
You're actually in some other past may be experiencing things that were handed

161
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:47.670
to you by parents or even grandparents.

162
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.030
So I'm going to try to define epigenetics,

163
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.730
you briefly and to say first of all that I'm not a scientist.

164
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.120
And so sometimes people object to the concept of epigenetics as though,

165
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.713
um,

166
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.250
they want to take issue with it and you're welcome to look it up and do your own

167
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.180
research.
I'm not the person who has done the research.
I'm citing the research.

168
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.890
So at,
it began with mice at Atlanta University,

169
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.260
I mean Emory university in Atlanta,

170
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.860
a group of geneticists took some pre adolescent mice and expose them to the

171
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:28.960
scent of Cherry Blossom,

172
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.160
which is a chemical compound and an electric shock.

173
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.680
So the mice quickly learned to associate that scent with fear,

174
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:42.790
panic,
and pain.
So even when the shock was no longer present,

175
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.970
they would get extremely agitated when these mice produced offspring.

176
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.290
Now remember they were pre adolescent.
So none of these mice was pregnant.

177
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:55.570
There were no baby mice in utero.

178
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.720
Three and four generations of mice.

179
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:03.721
Later when those mice were exposed to cherry blossom for the first time,

180
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.410
they panicked.

181
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.840
They acted as if they already knew the associate of pain that they might

182
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:11.674
receive.

183
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.740
They'd never witnessed their ancestry mice being exposed to the scent or the

184
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:19.750
shock.

185
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.100
So these researchers concluded that something had shifted in the DNA that was

186
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:25.330
being passed to them.

187
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.530
Now the DNA itself wasn't necessarily being modified.

188
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:33.790
It was epigenetically meaning something on top of the,

189
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:38.230
of the DNA on the gene was being modified and they call that the expression of

190
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:40.270
the gene.
Sometimes cortisol levels,

191
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:45.271
which are associated with stress hormone that we produced to help us respond to

192
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:50.350
stress was either suppressed or exaggerated.

193
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.770
At the same time that those studies with mice were going on,

194
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.600
there were researchers in Israel looking at Holocaust survivor families and

195
00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:02.260
noticing something similar that grandchildren,

196
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:07.261
great grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were coming in for therapy with

197
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.760
symptoms of PTSD for trauma that they themselves have not lived through.

198
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.790
And so they started to connect the dots between these studies and they,

199
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.090
the studies are small,
humans don't reproduce as quickly as mice.

200
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.320
So we don't know yet how residual,

201
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:28.660
how long lasting these effects are.

202
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.900
But notable enough for people to raise questions and,

203
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.780
and encourage more studies to be done to look into this.

204
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.660
So it turns out that for example,

205
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:45.690
Cambodian refugees living in the United States are coming into therapeutic

206
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:51.330
contexts with about a 95% rate of PTSD and the community off the charts high in

207
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:56.120
Cambodia,

208
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:01.210
it's estimated somewhere between one out of four and one out of every three

209
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.700
Cambodians was murdered by the Camaro Rouge.

210
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:10.030
Monumental portions of the population were impacted not only by the losses but

211
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:15.500
by the fear associated with those losses.

212
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.670
The reign of terror that lasted for the years,
the Khmer Rouge were empower.

213
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:25.280
And you can sort of do the math yourself.
These numbers need to be looked at.

214
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.790
So what's happening in the United States right now I think is pretty strong

215
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:35.420
evidence that we have unresolved trauma throughout the country.

216
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.490
We have unresolved legacies of racism,
slavery,

217
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.240
Jim Crow laws,
you name it,
lynching.

218
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.920
The aftermath of lynching in a community has never fully been addressed.

219
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.270
And we are seeing what it looks like when we don't address trauma,

220
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.190
when we don't address the residue of trauma in Japan.

221
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.400
They also have similar investigations into these lineages of the survivors of

222
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:08.060
Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
who,
for example,

223
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.060
were often completely silent on the subject.

224
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600
They're radiation exposure was so severe that they feared that if their children

225
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.910
were known to be the offspring of people who had been exposed to radiation,

226
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.260
no one would want to marry them because of fear of birth defects.

227
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.500
So there was a long history of silence about the effects of those bombs and the

228
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:38.030
fallout,
the literal fallout.
We use fallout now as a metaphor,

229
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.910
but it was literal.
It's still his literal.

230
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:45.440
So a lot of what I'm talking about in my book is actually this interconnection

231
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:48.080
between literal residue,

232
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:53.110
literal lasting radioactivity in the body and what that means metaphorically,

233
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:59.471
that we do carry the effects of what happened to our ancestors and our cultural

234
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:05.210
companions,
our compatriots.
So

235
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.580
what,

236
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.290
what that leads me then to consider is how do we do this memory together?

237
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:16.490
How do we remember not just what happened in my family.
For example,

238
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.120
my nephew introduced this story of three different trips I took to Germany with

239
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:24.374
my father,

240
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:30.310
one in 1983 one in 1995 and the third in 2015 so in 1983 I was in my twenties my

241
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:39.440
father was in his 50s and Germany was still divided.

242
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.010
So when we went first to Hamburg,

243
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.390
then to Berlin to pass through checkpoint Charlie to get permission to enter

244
00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:50.250
into East Germany and visit site of the camp.

245
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.060
What we were facing was a culture,

246
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.750
a country that was choosing to remember the past in a particular way.

247
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:03.170
They're historical version of what had happened in World War II,

248
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.540
focused primarily on the victory for them of communism over fascism.

249
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.570
When we tried to visit the site of the concentration camp,

250
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.840
we were directed away from the camp itself to a monument located a couple of

251
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.100
kilometers away that had victorious communist statues celebrating their victory

252
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.900
over the fascists.
Jews were not part of the conversation.

253
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.130
So my father and I did find our way to the side of the camp.

254
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.580
There was nobody there.
We were the only two people there.

255
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.380
It was this vast barren field of gravel,

256
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.460
still surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers,

257
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.380
but nobody inside them.

258
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.160
So that was my first experience of feeling the presence of those ghosts and the

259
00:18:56.521 --> 00:19:00.570
fact that I could share this with my father in such a way that literally,

260
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.660
literally we both heard in the wind the sound of people screaming at the same

261
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:07.764
time.

262
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.940
And for me that was a palpable sense in my body.

263
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.130
That's something my father had lived through,
was really passing into my body.

264
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:19.200
And at the end of that trip he said,

265
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.300
I want to come back with the rest of the family.
I had begun writing about,

266
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.400
I was becoming a writer.
And of course my material seems so obvious.

267
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.520
My family's story was my material.

268
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So flash forward 12 years later to 1995 and now my siblings and I,

269
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.300
my mother and my father are all going to the reunified Germany together

270
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:51.300
and Brooklyn Bald is now the center of a commemoration site.

271
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.703
Um,

272
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.970
it was being celebrated with a feast,

273
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.420
a banquet on the site of the concentration camp.

274
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.230
A completely surreal event that I write about in the book.

275
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:09.240
I felt like Fellini had filmed this.
It was just bizarre,

276
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:13.740
a giant tent on the site of this place where so many people were starved and

277
00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:18.360
work to death and murdered.
And right in the middle of the meal,

278
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.490
one of my father's front teeth fell out and suddenly he looked,

279
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:26.340
have you ever seen someone with a missing front tooth?
You know,

280
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:30.390
this whole suddenly appearing in his smile and his face.

281
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:35.580
And I was remembering in that experience that when we had been there in 1983

282
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:38.940
together,
he passed a kidney stone while we were there.

283
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.600
So you can see how the body has its own way of remembering trauma and re

284
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:47.280
experiencing revisiting trauma.

285
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.340
So now the context was Germany was reunified.

286
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:56.340
They were trying to re organize their memory literally of how they were

287
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:00.490
remembering what had happened during World War II.

288
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.830
20 years later,

289
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:07.831
2015 my nephew and I and my father are all in the same place.

290
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.941
Now.

291
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:14.941
We're three generations together and we are being echoed and met by three

292
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:17.380
generations of Germans,

293
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.410
especially the grandchildren who call themselves like the Jewish,

294
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.120
you know,
um,

295
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.770
compartment of generation of survivors.

296
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:32.210
Third generation they call themselves three g.

297
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.500
That's how I found out I was two g because my three g nephew explained to me

298
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.080
that I was now a member of this second generation.

299
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.440
The grandchildren of the survivors and the grandchildren of the Nazis were now

300
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:50.680
taking it upon themselves to remember together what had happened.

301
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:56.250
So there was this remarkable bridge across the great divide of history to say

302
00:21:56.771 --> 00:22:01.771
it's our obligation to remember this together and to look at our counterparts as

303
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.950
fellow travelers through this journey of what part of the past is still

304
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:13.990
impacting us.
Now in the present
in Japan,

305
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.050
something similar is happening.
The first,

306
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:22.051
second and third generation survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are also asking

307
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:25.840
themselves,
how do we keep this memory alive?

308
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.310
And I mentioned a little while ago that this memory is both personal and

309
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.810
collective,
even if you're not personally related to the survivors.

310
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.500
How do we all carry this in a shared way?

311
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.710
And in Japan there's a remarkable role being taken on by people who call

312
00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:47.960
themselves den Shosha,
um,

313
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.040
which is translated as the designated transmitter of memory and the den Shosha

314
00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.690
are memorizing the stories of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki so that

315
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:07.891
they can tell the story when the firsthand experience is no longer available in

316
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:09.034
person.

317
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:14.070
They are literally choosing to embody the story and humanize it,

318
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:17.950
keep it individual and meaningful in that way.

319
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.680
So what are some other parallels for that?
Well,
in South Africa,

320
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:27.100
you probably know after apartheid ended,

321
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:33.120
they create Mandela and others created something called the Truth and

322
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:38.490
Reconciliation Commission where they chose to coordinate the remembering of the

323
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:39.580
past,

324
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.580
not in a legal punishing a format,

325
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.890
but in a way of creating dialogue.
And conversation,

326
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.920
allowing the victims of apartheid to speak to the perpetrators and be heard.

327
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.480
Simply have their stories be told as the truth because one of the first things

328
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:03.920
that goes in war and atrocities and genocide is truth itself.

329
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.151
The facts,

330
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:09.530
I am afraid we're witnessing a lot of this right now in our culture when facts

331
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:14.150
are becoming distorted and the truth seems blurry at the edges,

332
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.230
blurry at best.

333
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.580
So in Rwanda where there was also a horrific genocide in the late 1990s when

334
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:29.350
800,000 Tutsis were murdered by their Hutu neighbors with machetes informance

335
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.160
800,000 people murdered in a period of four months.

336
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.700
Now the Rwandan government is trying to help the remaining Hutus and the

337
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:48.221
remaining Tutsis work together to rebuild the country as neighbors.

338
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.690
They were neighbors before the genocide.
They are neighbors again.

339
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.880
How does this work?

340
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.560
How can you bring victims and perpetrators together in a way that isn't

341
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:04.130
retraumatizing?
Well,
it's complicated.

342
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.830
When I was revising survivor cafe.

343
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.380
Every time I wrote about something like this,

344
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.740
I would go back over the book again and again my last time to reread it.

345
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.190
I looked for the word complicated.
I did a word search for complicated.

346
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.460
It showed up 49 times.

347
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.630
I had to go back through and really consider the nuances of that word,

348
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:31.220
but everything I was talking about was indeed complicated.

349
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.700
The complication of how many generations past slavery in America are we,

350
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.650
and yet we are still bearing witness to the unresolved trauma that it left

351
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:45.830
behind.
Bryan Stevenson,

352
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:51.130
who is an African American lawyer who used to be with the southern poverty law

353
00:25:51.741 --> 00:25:55.760
center and started something called the equal justice initiative,

354
00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.360
has been determined to create monuments in every location where a lynching took

355
00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:05.900
place in Europe.

356
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:10.930
Something similar had been done is being done and artists put down what he

357
00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:14.480
called stolper Steiner stumbling stones,

358
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.340
replacing individual cobblestones with gilded over stones,

359
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.150
stamped with the name of a person who was murdered and they say,

360
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:25.790
here lived this person's name,

361
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.950
this person birthdate,
and died in Auschwitz.
Treblinka,

362
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.100
Robin's Brooke,
my Donek,
the names of camps,

363
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.100
the names of maybe unknown locations.

364
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:42.370
So Bryan Stevenson said the power of standing on a spot where you know,

365
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.200
an atrocity took place has to be replicated in the United States where these

366
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.460
lynching sites were.

367
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.750
Thousands of people witnessed lynchings in America.

368
00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.030
It wasn't just the horrific violence done to the individual.

369
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:05.300
There was an act of violence committed in full view of often the entire town.

370
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.530
So how do we remember that in a way that honors the victim and tells the truth

371
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:11.490
about what happened?

372
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:17.090
So plaques are being placed in locations where lynchings took place and a big

373
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:20.100
museum in Montgomery is,

374
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:25.130
is being built with soil from each of those places to be held in jars and

375
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:31.020
vessels to say,
we are all connected by this earth that we stand on.

376
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:36.150
So even though I might be tempted to say my ancestors weren't slave owners,

377
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:38.370
I'm a first generation American.

378
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.870
I don't have to take responsibility for the residue of this trauma simply by

379
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:45.690
being an American standing on American soil.

380
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.350
I do have to take responsibility for what happened in this country.

381
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.590
And that I'm the beneficiary of a lot of things that we all benefited from

382
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.840
during slavery and all of the inhuman violence committed against post slavery

383
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.730
Americans.
So how do we remember,

384
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:10.650
well,
how do we,

385
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.680
how do we work carefully to preserve this memory and to keep it personal,

386
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:16.861
as I said,

387
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:21.861
and also to keep it alive once the witnesses and the people who enacted those

388
00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:27.801
crimes or were the victims of those crimes are no longer here to remind us of

389
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:29.550
the human experience.

390
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:35.000
So I don't know how many of you have ever been to Washington DC,

391
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:40.010
the US Holocaust museum in Washington DC and also the very recently completed

392
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.090
African American Museum of history and culture.
Anybody?

393
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:50.190
Have you been there?
Both astonishingly important institutions?

394
00:28:50.191 --> 00:28:55.191
I really recommend that you visit them and they each tell a story,

395
00:28:55.891 --> 00:29:00.891
a narrative that is meant to engage you physically in the process of memory.

396
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.370
So at the Holocaust museum,
when you enter the museum,

397
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.940
you're conducted to an elevator taken up to the top floor.

398
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.070
And when you step out of the elevator,

399
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:15.540
the first thing you see is a photograph of American soldiers.

400
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.070
Looking down at a pile of corpses that they encountered when they arrived at a

401
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:25.071
concentration camp in Europe in April of 1945 now,

402
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:29.670
what I realized when I went to that museum and saw that image was that this is

403
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:33.030
the American version of that story.

404
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.800
My version growing up,

405
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:39.000
as I told you was before I even knew what I knew.

406
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:44.540
I knew that something horrible had happened to my parents in Europe that

407
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:49.651
involved images and situations that I was now seeing Americans encountered and

408
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:53.350
thought,
oh,
now we understand.

409
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.850
But of course there's a whole story that has to be revisited in order to

410
00:29:57.851 --> 00:30:00.610
understand what they were seeing for the first time.

411
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.330
So then you work your way through the museum,

412
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.500
finding out everything that took place that led to that moment,

413
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.340
but it's still an American frame around a story.

414
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.650
I think that's really important to understand that museums as fact based as they

415
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:20.320
can be our framing a narrative.

416
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.340
So what's happening now in the south where they're talking about what should we

417
00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:29.341
do with confederate statues is a question about who gets to frame the narrative.

418
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:35.020
Do we keep the statues there because they signify a civil war that really did

419
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:39.190
take place in America?
Well,
don't we need context around them?

420
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.030
Don't we need to know that they were defending something that we now consider to

421
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:45.460
be completely important?
It wasn't just,
Oh,

422
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:50.461
the north one in the south lost it was that they were diametrically opposed

423
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:51.550
ideologies,

424
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:56.500
one of which believed that you were entitled to own other people.

425
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.700
That was a wrong ideology.
So for us to say,
well,

426
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:05.701
there were just two different ideologies is I think an affront to the victims,

427
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:06.640
right?

428
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.530
So now there's this debate about what kind of structure or museum can we put

429
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:14.050
these confederate statues inside of.

430
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:18.610
So a fuller story gets told about who they were,
what they meant,

431
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.240
and,
and they were on the wrong side of history,
basically.

432
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:28.930
So the African American Museum of history and culture,
interestingly to me,
takes,

433
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:33.190
uh,
the other approach from this Holocaust museum,

434
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:36.040
top down,
descent into the past.

435
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.870
The African American museum starts with the past underground.

436
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.320
You start down below in this museum and you read and enter into the centuries of

437
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:52.480
the slave trade,
a lot of which was based on sugar.

438
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.980
So I'll let you think about that for a moment.
Sugar,
the demon.

439
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:02.250
So you climb through this lower portion of the story and you work your way up

440
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:06.160
through slavery in America,

441
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:11.110
the civil war followed by Jim Crow,
the civil rights movement,

442
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:16.380
and finally at the very top of the museum in this incredible celebratory way,

443
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.300
you get to experience the beautiful and significant contributions of African

444
00:32:22.301 --> 00:32:27.010
Americans to American culture,
music,
dance,
theater,
language,

445
00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:31.930
fashion,
everything,
language,
hip hop,

446
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:36.040
the vernacular expressed through architecture and movement,

447
00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:41.460
all of which shows that the bones that lie underground have still somehow

448
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:48.731
managed to produce this incredible resilience and beauty and transformation.

449
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.180
So weirdly,
I decided to start that museum at the top.

450
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.720
I think I saw all the crowds going down and I wanted to be different.

451
00:32:56.721 --> 00:33:00.590
And I started at the top and I'll tell you,
it was hard to leave that floor.

452
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.620
It was so full of wonder and joy and celebration and innovation and creativity.

453
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:11.480
But then I remembered that I had to see what was buried under that.

454
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.620
I had to see what was in the soil that gave birth to that.

455
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.390
And it reminded me that we don't just inherit the trauma of our ancestors.

456
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.330
We inherit the resiliency of our ancestors.

457
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:28.540
We inherit the perseverance of our ancestors and the will to go on and the will

458
00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:32.540
to create a new life in a new place like my parents did,

459
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:37.250
like maybe many of your parents or grandparents did.
So,

460
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:40.310
um,
I want to leave you with,
um,

461
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:45.730
with a couple of questions about consciousness with language consciousness,

462
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:47.840
with how we use our words.

463
00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.400
So I don't know how many of you react to language the way I do,

464
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.800
but for example,

465
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:58.040
when I hear the words ethnic cleansing,

466
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.970
the phrase ethnic cleansing,
which we heard

467
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.220
during the eruptions in Bosnia,

468
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:10.050
when you get Slavia was falling apart and the Serbs were trying to ethnically

469
00:34:10.051 --> 00:34:11.130
cleanse

470
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.250
the Christians out of the Serbian held territories,

471
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:21.320
there was a big outcry about what a euphemism that phrase was that ethnic

472
00:34:21.321 --> 00:34:25.220
cleansing was essentially a coverup for genocide and mass murder.

473
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.083
Do you remember?

474
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:31.010
It's come back into our vocabulary again.

475
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.990
The New York Times is referring to what's happening in Myanmar as ethnic

476
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:40.991
cleansing and sometimes they put quotation marks around it and sometimes they

477
00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:42.434
don't.

478
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:47.890
And to me this seemingly normalized version of that phrase is saying something

479
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:56.261
about how we have accepted propaganda terms into our vocabulary as if they are

480
00:34:57.501 --> 00:35:02.210
descriptive rather than
propaganda.

481
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.260
So chain migration is another phrase.

482
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.620
There is debate about the use of the phrase chain migration.

483
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:11.570
If you're not aware of it,
look into it.

484
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:16.571
The idea that people who are legally immigrated into America and want to bring

485
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:20.990
family and relatives.

486
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.560
Now that phrase chain migration is being used again in a propaganda stick way to

487
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:31.850
hear these echoes of,
I hear slavery,

488
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:35.030
I hear chains of you know,

489
00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:40.031
poverty of lower class relationships of illegal activity,

490
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:44.520
all of these evocations that this language produces,

491
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:45.990
we need to question.

492
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.000
So instead of using these phrases automatically,

493
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:56.330
I recommend that we use the phrase family unification or read a unification

494
00:35:57.841 --> 00:36:02.610
instead of chain migration.
It's actually more accurate.
It's equally descriptive.

495
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:07.611
It's more accurately descriptive than chain migration instead of ethnic

496
00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:12.060
cleansing.
Genocide is the more appropriate term.

497
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.230
Mass murder is the more appropriate term.
Why did these words matter?

498
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.890
Because they impact our ways of thinking about the world.

499
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.670
They impact how we see one another.
The assumptions we make.

500
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.120
Do you remember when the photograph of the drowned Syrian child was appeared

501
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:30.510
everywhere?

502
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:35.690
One of the victims of a drowning off the coast of Greece.

503
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:42.000
There are millions of refugees in flight for their lives.

504
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.420
That one photograph of a drowned child was a way of saying to people,

505
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:51.540
don't forget this is happening to one person at a time.

506
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:57.570
When you call people immigrants,
it's different than when you call them refugees.

507
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:02.490
The emotional content is really different in those two terms.

508
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.780
Doesn't,

509
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.650
don't you feel your heart and more likely to open toward a refugee than toward

510
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:10.200
an immigrant who the implication being,
oh,

511
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:14.130
they just come are coming here because they want better opportunities.
They,

512
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.760
I should say we are coming here for better opportunities,

513
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.270
but refugee means,
oh,
someone who has no choice.

514
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:26.250
Someone who's in flight for his or her life or the life of their extended

515
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:27.084
family.

516
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:32.240
So language matters because it impacts how we think and feel about human lives,

517
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.510
about human lack of choice,

518
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.840
about humans and exile about humans who are suffering.

519
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:45.360
So for me,
all of this research was a way of saying to myself,

520
00:37:45.361 --> 00:37:50.310
what I grew up with didn't just teach me that I was carrying a particular

521
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:51.120
burden.

522
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.980
It taught me that I have a responsibility to be empathetic toward those who

523
00:37:55.981 --> 00:38:00.750
suffer too.
Whether I know their full story or not,

524
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.100
whether I know how many generations back the suffering goes or not,

525
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:10.460
but that each individual actually has some kind of legacy of sorrow,

526
00:38:11.701 --> 00:38:16.200
of loss,
of harm,
of pain.
And it may be vast,

527
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:18.180
it may be on the scale of Cambodia,

528
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:23.181
one out of three or four people in the entire country murdered by the Camaro

529
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.280
Rouge.
It might be on a smaller scale,

530
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.770
but it doesn't matter the scale.

531
00:38:28.771 --> 00:38:33.771
What matters is the personal level of identification and that willingness to say

532
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:36.130
we are connected by what we carry.

533
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.840
And we can recognize that in one another through our language,

534
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:42.400
through our storytelling,

535
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.470
through our collective forms of memory in museums or institutions or

536
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.430
installations,

537
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:53.431
like a stone placed on a sidewalk saying this was a person who lived here and

538
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:55.774
was murdered.

539
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:02.680
So if I may,
um,
before I open it up to your questions,

540
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:05.650
which I really welcome and invite questions or comments,

541
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:10.651
I want to leave you with an image and it's a Japanese term and a Japanese art

542
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:15.910
form that I think is,
again,

543
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.940
a beautiful metaphor for all that I've been talking about today.

544
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.400
Can Sugi is sometimes translated as golden repair,

545
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.220
but I've recently seen it translated as the art of embracing damage or the art

546
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.180
of precious scars,

547
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.460
the art of embracing damage,
the art of precious scars.

548
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.300
So imagine a precious bowl,

549
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.410
a piece of pottery that was handed down to you or something you made or

550
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:53.740
something you paid a lot of money for and it shatters,

551
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.810
cry,
throw it away.
You have a lot of choices.

552
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.160
Replace it with a new perfect one.
Kim Sugie says,

553
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.130
you fill in the cracks with gold.

554
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.060
You repair it in such a way as to enhance and identify more fully where the bowl

555
00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:18.901
has been broken and how in healing it and putting the pieces back together.

556
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.340
You see all of its history.

557
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.970
You see the damage it went through and is still not just hold,

558
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:30.280
but in fact more beautiful than it was before.

559
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.820
So the damage that we carry doesn't have to be looked at as loss or pain that

560
00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:38.380
will never go away,
that will never heal from.

561
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:43.690
But neither does it mean that we're trying to make it go away and erase it so

562
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:45.730
that we never have to look at it again.

563
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.950
The truth is we have ongoing damage every day,

564
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:55.330
all the time to our bodies,
our psyches,
our culture,
our truth,

565
00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.280
our story.
So this image for me is so,

566
00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:02.410
so resonant of an option.

567
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:06.570
We have to hold our damage,
um,

568
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:08.440
delicately,

569
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:13.441
lovingly and to let it be seen to say I am not only the the pain and the loss

570
00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:17.440
that have happened to me,

571
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:22.441
but I'm also filled with something even more precious and more beautiful,

572
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.910
which is the restoration of self.

573
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.670
And ultimately I hope an image like this is an indication of what we're capable

574
00:41:30.671 --> 00:41:32.680
of as human beings.
That we can,

575
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.860
a wholeness that doesn't keep repeating the separations and the murders and the

576
00:41:39.471 --> 00:41:44.471
hatreds but rebuilds a culture that is based on something collective and

577
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:50.060
connected
and healing.
I hope so.

578
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.440
Thank you for listening to me.

579
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:55.810
I really hope that you'll make sure to take a book to take with you to read and,

580
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:56.840
and consider,

581
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:00.530
but I would love to know if you have any questions right now or comments.
Yes,

582
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.050
<v 3>you're not to leave.</v>

583
00:42:03.051 --> 00:42:08.051
When we pass away our body and returns with dust and the spirit persists by all

584
00:42:08.781 --> 00:42:13.460
the memories,
all the experiences actually persist.
Not,

585
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.090
let me use a technical term like cloud.
Imagine all those memories safe,

586
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:23.100
even cloud and the younger generation has a different generation can access that

587
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:24.880
piece of it made mission.

588
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:30.190
Using a token password from the cloud that could explain the different

589
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:36.450
generations may be able to be on the same traumatic experience and somehow you

590
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.350
just persist throughout the generations.

591
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.790
<v 0>I love it when I think about it is that I love it.
I think it's,
um,</v>

592
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.250
it's a brilliant interweaving of,
um,

593
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.060
of our technological understanding of how data is,

594
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.930
is saved and this human data,
this data of memory.

595
00:42:56.931 --> 00:42:59.990
My father actually,
who thankfully is still alive,

596
00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:03.800
he's going to be 89 in April,
has often said to me,

597
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.810
I wish there was a way that all of my knowledge that I've gained over all of

598
00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:13.811
these years of living and learning could be stored somewhere and saved so that

599
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:18.410
it can be passed on.
What a shame that it can't be saved.

600
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:23.330
And so he's envisioning this giant brain download,
you know,
but as you say,

601
00:43:23.331 --> 00:43:27.620
it's spirit too.
It's not just what we hold in our minds and our bodies.

602
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:32.860
There's something that we don't quite know what it is or how it operates.

603
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.320
Young talked about this too young,

604
00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:41.270
envisioned your cloud as well when he talked about the collective unconscious

605
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:46.570
and that what we carry ancestrally shows up in our dreams sometimes.

606
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.510
I know a woman whose mother was also in a concentration camp and this woman has

607
00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:58.040
dreams that when she tells her mother about them,
her mother says,

608
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.310
you dreamed something that happened to me.

609
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.530
How is that possible that a dream could be transmitted?

610
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:11.060
Well this is the kind of thing that I think you've just described that it's all

611
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:15.980
being stored somewhere and that we are I that at birth,

612
00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:19.520
that token that you just mentioned are birth is,

613
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:24.380
is our past key to access.
That brilliantly said.

614
00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:29.300
Thank you for sharing that.
Any other questions or comments please?
Sorry,

615
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:31.440
that microphone is so far away,
right?

616
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.160
<v 4>I noticed that most of the examples you gave were like large,
uh,</v>

617
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:42.810
large scale societal things like the Holocaust or slavery and wondering if you

618
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:47.811
think the same idea as you presented applied to like smaller things like

619
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.230
individual trauma or maybe like what I have in mind.
I think like mass shootings.

620
00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.780
<v 0>Absolutely.
Thank you for that question.</v>

621
00:44:55.781 --> 00:45:00.100
I think that I do in the book talk about nine 11,
um,

622
00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:04.780
which of course as a country we thought of as happening to all of us,

623
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:09.520
but we know that in actual fact it happened to,
you know,

624
00:45:09.521 --> 00:45:12.340
two buildings in New York City and the Pentagon.

625
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.260
We know that in theory anyway,
it was a limited number of victims.

626
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:22.710
But what we recognize is that the entire country does still feel the

627
00:45:23.021 --> 00:45:24.820
reverberations of that event.

628
00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.640
So I don't know if that's an example of what you're talking about,

629
00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:32.140
but I also think the me too movement right now is evidence of something very

630
00:45:32.141 --> 00:45:32.974
similar.

631
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:38.790
Women and young girls who've all experienced some form of sexual assault,

632
00:45:39.731 --> 00:45:41.680
sexual violence,
sexual abuse,

633
00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.580
one by one individual stories begin to emerge as a way of experience that lasted

634
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:54.160
not just for generations,
but millennia in a way.

635
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:59.670
So the connection I think between the individual experience and the bigger story

636
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:04.350
is present.
Whenever there's an individual trauma that,
um,

637
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:07.090
I don't go into this in the book.
Again,
like I said,

638
00:46:07.091 --> 00:46:12.040
I had to choose what I included,
but I know for example,
in the,

639
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.240
in the gay community,

640
00:46:13.241 --> 00:46:18.241
especially in the community of people who were exposed to aids in the,

641
00:46:18.941 --> 00:46:20.530
in the eighties and nineties,

642
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:26.160
that there's actually a syndrome that is referred to as aids survivor syndrome.

643
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:35.160
That people who lived and had all of their friends die all around them but

644
00:46:36.491 --> 00:46:40.620
didn't die for whatever reason,
we're still trying to study.
Why did,
uh,

645
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.340
very few people who were HIV positive not succumb to aids,

646
00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.310
they have this experience of,

647
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.140
am I fortunate or am I hugely unfortunate that I've lost everyone?

648
00:46:54.581 --> 00:46:59.050
I loved that I witnessed everyone's death and dying all around me.

649
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.680
So that's another example.
Also just um,

650
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:07.980
individual experiences of a suicide in the family that can feel certainly like

651
00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:15.061
an ongoing trauma in a family and then an individual might look back at

652
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.550
multigenerational patterns in the family and see,
oh,

653
00:47:18.551 --> 00:47:21.760
each generation had a suicide.
What does that mean?

654
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.940
We're just starting to understand this.

655
00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:28.960
There's another term you might come across in addition to epigenetics.

656
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.600
It's an acronym,
Ac ease,

657
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.900
adverse childhood experiences and pediatricians and educators are starting to

658
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:42.871
come up with a tool for measuring when they meet a young child and the child is

659
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:48.310
acting out behavior early in school or not wanting to go to school or they're

660
00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:50.170
crazy things going on with the kid.

661
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.580
They'll ask the kid how many of these things or they will ask an adult related

662
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:58.750
to the kid,
how is there,
is there poverty in the home?

663
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.510
Is there someone incarcerated in the family?

664
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.040
Is there mental illness in the family?
Is there homelessness in the family?

665
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:11.370
And they calibrate and quantify these adverse childhood experiences and say a

666
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:17.380
score of such and such is likely to lead to mental illness,

667
00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:20.050
health problems,
early death.

668
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.700
So we're trying to intervene at younger and younger ages now to recognize how

669
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:29.701
even individual traumas reverberate throughout a culture and a system.

670
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.630
Yeah,
I hope that it,
does that answer your question?
Thank you.
Other questions?

671
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:37.780
<v 3>Not so much in a question.</v>

672
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:42.950
<v 0>A comment is more than welcome to.
Yes,
please.</v>

673
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.610
<v 3>Oh,
I'm gonna ask you that.
Um,
all,
um,</v>

674
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.890
what I actually see is that if 15 hundreds,
uh,

675
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:51.910
Japan in bed,

676
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:56.930
Korea and they to thousands of a craftsman before dead,

677
00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:01.810
um,
most of the bad word.
And so when I ended up,

678
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.910
and I hate to be,
see that powder it in Brooklyn,
um,

679
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:10.950
I see,
um,
the history where that actually came from.

680
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.940
So we only see that as a sign up at conciliation,

681
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:19.980
but that itself,
um,
match the Hess,
he then set history behind you.

682
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:25.470
And then you,
I should've mentioned Austin.
Yeah.
Uh,

683
00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:28.100
the serves,
uh,
when he was going around,

684
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.150
there was a newspaper article have maybe long time ago,
uh,

685
00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:35.530
in serve yet there's actually a museum where one of the things that was the

686
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:39.840
speeding the vizio is something that looks like a tuning fork.

687
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.280
A tuning fork has a new shape.
Um,

688
00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:48.300
Syrian people actually headbutt tuning fork because before,

689
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.640
uh,
the Bosniaks we're actually gals,
you'd be eyes up the service,

690
00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.133
you just can get boring.

691
00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.560
So when we actually see a history of genocide,
um,

692
00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:05.250
it actually goes deeper.
It's not just okay,
it serves are awesome guys.

693
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:09.540
There's deep history of a vicious cycle that they went on.

694
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:15.080
And so we don't get to see a lot of big inspiration throughout the history.

695
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.470
Um,

696
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:21.210
my recollection of the only history of reconciliation was,

697
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:24.850
uh,
when I started recording Nelson Mandela,
uh,

698
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.550
being interviewed after he is prison release.
Well,

699
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.300
as one of the first things that he said was,
I forget,
and Ben,

700
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:33.570
they don't only use,

701
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:38.330
made me jump out of a chair because that's something totally unexpected,

702
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:43.430
but that actually gave hope to the future of South Africa.

703
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:47.920
They're black people coming for the lack of better term.
I'm not your back.

704
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:52.490
People coming into power in South Africa wasn't going to be that bad because

705
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.520
here's the fighter who resisted apartheid for such a long time and put on their

706
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:03.880
how spreads and RSN prison life was coming out and saying that he actually

707
00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:07.970
forgive those perpetrators and he's active,

708
00:51:07.971 --> 00:51:11.900
willing to work with them or better future.
Unfortunately,

709
00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:15.260
those are rare occurrences in history.

710
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.680
And now what I'm seeing is that,
um,
I hear news about,
um,

711
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:26.410
Syria where people like die Stephen,

712
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:31.290
they're inside of dying.
And I hear about a Yemen where,
uh,

713
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.400
there's a proxy war going on between Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia and Iran and

714
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.640
even in the states.
Um,
I like to travel,

715
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:45.890
but probably the last place I want to travel these problem that Alabama hair

716
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:50.630
people are,
we're actually rooting for Roy and war in this present day and age.

717
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:54.440
Yeah.
And so I have three kids.

718
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:59.480
I want to leave a better future for my kids.
But at the same time,

719
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.330
you know,
I wonder is that word getting any better has history,

720
00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:09.110
Palestinian lessons,
where do we,
you know,
and this fissure say,
well,

721
00:52:09.111 --> 00:52:11.370
how can uh,
contribute,
uh,

722
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.530
and seeming the I'm in the minority and my voice is I drawn down.

723
00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.100
It's like,
how do I reconcile it?

724
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:24.440
And I was actually coming to the pet dog two here.
Um,

725
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.390
a little bit of maybe I was hoping for some sort of a clue as to how you are

726
00:52:29.391 --> 00:52:34.391
able to find the closest to the risk and station between the Germans and the

727
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.460
Nazis.
Yeah.

728
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.120
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay.
I don't mean to cut you off.
We're running out of time.</v>

729
00:52:42.121 --> 00:52:44.190
I want to say you do have a voice.

730
00:52:44.191 --> 00:52:47.250
Your voice is really powerful in what you've just been saying.

731
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.750
And I do think that Mandela is a beautiful example.

732
00:52:51.751 --> 00:52:53.040
A rare example.

733
00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:58.850
Forgiveness is not necessarily something that can be flipped like a switch.

734
00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:03.950
It's incredibly rare that somebody can even privately make a statement like

735
00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:06.270
that.
Um,

736
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:11.510
but Germany is an amazing exemplar right now are a model country in taking

737
00:53:12.391 --> 00:53:17.391
responsibility for their history and preserving it even when it shows them in

738
00:53:17.521 --> 00:53:22.170
their worst light.
And that,
that gives me hope,
right?

739
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.980
That Germans aren't saying bygones,
let it be,

740
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.750
let it be considered history.
And we are no longer obligated to remember.

741
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:32.730
There was a time when German said that,

742
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:36.180
and there are definitely still Germans who say that.

743
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:41.450
So I can't speak for every German who's committed to this to this honest

744
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:42.960
pathway.

745
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.610
But reconciliation is a goal and it's very difficult to achieve.

746
00:53:47.611 --> 00:53:48.540
And forgiveness,

747
00:53:48.541 --> 00:53:53.460
I don't even know if that is a goal so much as a form of justice.
There's,

748
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.880
there's retribution and there's restoration,
right?

749
00:53:56.881 --> 00:54:01.881
So retribution is more where people want to take revenge and see punishment

750
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:04.920
meted out and rest door.

751
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:09.600
Restorative justice is more a way of saying let's at least have the truth be

752
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:12.300
told and that's where you begin.

753
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.250
And if forgiveness eventually arises as a result,
that's good,

754
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:21.930
but not necessary.
Maybe.
So,
um,
the,

755
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.430
the complications in Asia,
the complications in Africa,

756
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.570
there's a whole colonial legacy underneath all of that,
that,
you know,
the,

757
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:36.670
the Tutsis were raised up by the European colonials and the Hutus were pushed

758
00:54:38.131 --> 00:54:38.521
down.

759
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:43.521
So the Hutus had this long history of feeling dehumanized,

760
00:54:44.011 --> 00:54:48.150
disenfranchise.
So yes,
they were acting out of an old,
old rage too.

761
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:53.390
And there were massacres by Tutsis and Hutus.
Apparently I'm learning now.
Um,

762
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.570
the Armenian genocide is a long story and,

763
00:54:56.571 --> 00:55:01.380
and Armenian genocide is a phrase you can't even say aloud in Turkey.

764
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:05.040
It's illegal to say in Turkey.
That doesn't mean it didn't happen.

765
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:11.030
Now Poland is trying to criminalize references to the Polish participation in

766
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.153
the Holocaust.

767
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:19.050
So I think to end on a note that's complicated,

768
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.480
the worst of us is getting worse.

769
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:26.790
And I hope that the best of us is getting better.
Thank you for your comment.

770
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:29.460
Thank you all so much for being here.

771
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:32.790
I'm going to stick around for awhile if you want to talk.
I think our,
we are,

772
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.660
is our time up.
Um,
we can keep going.
No,

773
00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.320
we ended a long time ago.
Okay.

774
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.150
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
As rhe thanks Google.
Thank you all.
