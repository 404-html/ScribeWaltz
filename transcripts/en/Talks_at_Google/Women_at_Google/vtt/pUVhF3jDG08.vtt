00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.270
Greetings today we want to welcome Brianna Moo,

2
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:15.050
who is the Co founder and the head of development,
that giant space gap,

3
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.110
the game studio nearby and is also on a couple of podcasts that relay FM

4
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.170
isometric,
which is about the game industry and rocket,

5
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:28.610
which I think is about a sorted geekery copics so welcome Briana.

6
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.230
<v 2>Oh,
thank you so much for coming today.</v>

8
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.630
All right.
Why wouldn't that Google for having me today and you know,
coasts,

9
00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:47.720
I know you were responsible for getting me here,
so I definitely,

10
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.630
definitely appreciate that.
My name is Brianna Wu.

11
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:53.120
I'm head of development it giant space count.
Okay.

12
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.660
I'm an expert in the unreal engine and um,
you know,

13
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.350
when I got into this field,
like most software engineers,

14
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.550
I did this because I love engineering.
You know,

15
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.540
I love programming,
I love all this geeky stuff.
You know,
I was a child.

16
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:13.541
I remember my parents were so hesitant to get me a computer because they knew

17
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:15.020
that the moment they did,

18
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:19.700
I would just stay in my room nonstop and never leave the house.
You know?

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.740
So we're find myself,
you know,
especially in this last year,
um,

20
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.490
we have kind of being an unintentional figure for women in tech.
You know,

21
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.830
I just want like,
no,
this isn't why I gotten to this field in the first place

22
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.520
he owned.
That leads to our first slide.
Like,
why do we have to talk about this?

23
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.941
You know,

24
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:45.320
what I've discovered along the way is that we really don't have a choice.

25
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.020
Women in this field to talk about gender issues.

26
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.440
These things are we're going to be talking about today.

27
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.300
They really make or break the careers of women in this field.
You know,

28
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:57.780
often you have,

29
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.230
sometimes I sit there and I listened to my male colleagues in the field and

30
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440
watch what they tweet or what they talk about.

31
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.950
And it really amazes me just how little thought they have to kind of apply to

32
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.440
some of these social things that a lot of women engineers have to talk about and

33
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:19.700
think about every single day.
Little things like being talked over in meetings,

34
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.770
not being recommended for promotions.
And you know,

35
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.470
Google itself has done a lot of really wonderful work on unconscious bias.
So,

36
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.070
you know,

37
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.750
what I want you to know is I would rather be up here talking about anything else

38
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:37.580
today.
Unreal engine,
you know,
implementing unreal Android,

39
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:39.890
open GL just about anything.

40
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.210
But the only way it's going to get better for me and the other women that work

41
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.180
in this field is by talking openly about that.

42
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.260
So this is can be a presentation today.
You know,
I'm not,

43
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:54.800
Oprah Winfrey was software engineer and this is going to be,

44
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:58.040
I'm going to lay it out on the table for you in the same way I would a software

45
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:01.360
bug.
So,
you know,

46
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.990
when I made this talk a few years ago,
um,

47
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.430
I was on my way down to WWDC and I kind of threw it together.

48
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.610
Um,
you know,
on a whim and you,

49
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.380
what really struck me at the time is these issues of gender and tech had really

50
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:22.340
come to a head,
you know,
this was early in 2014,
you know,
my friend,
uh,

51
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.920
Julian Horvath,
um,
received a lot of gender based harassment,

52
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.830
harassment,
it get hub.
I'm sure you read about that.

53
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.200
There was a founder there was um,
you know,

54
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.870
accused and some really horrific ways of uh,

55
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.250
you're beating up his girlfriend 150,
two times on tape.

56
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.480
Um,
you,
you had things like code Babes coming out and you know,
Google,

57
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.320
which I think speaks to your credit now,
have released your,
um,

58
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:49.270
numbers of diversity in the workforce.

59
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.260
I think it's really worth noting that when that story came out in 2014,

60
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.830
I and a lot of people were like,
this isn't so good.

61
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.410
But with you being open with that number,

62
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:03.370
you started to see a trend of other companies like apple bringing that number

63
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:07.690
out.
And it's not any better.
So,
you know,
I think that speaks to your credit,

64
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.270
you know,
and for me,
you know,
every single time I give this talk,

65
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.790
you know,
it's more and more frustrating to me because,
you know,

66
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.560
there are these incidents that break out about what women in tech are facing

67
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.170
than make the news in every single time.

68
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.920
It just gets longer and longer and longer.
You know,

69
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.330
it got to the point where I couldn't even update these slides because it would

70
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:33.160
just keep going through it for 10 minutes.

71
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.430
So we're just going to go through it super quickly right here,
you know,

72
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:41.560
and for me,
one of the most bizarre experiences of my life is,
you know,

73
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.060
I prepared this talk before Gamergate happened to me.
You know,
um,

74
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.580
I don't know if you're aware of what's happened to me in this year.
Um,
you know,

75
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.660
I'm up 265 death threats in the last 11 months in this field.

76
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.850
I have to talk to the FBI and prosecutors,
you know,

77
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.720
this week about updates in my case and trying to get some of these things

78
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.060
prosecuted.
So,
you know,

79
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:08.400
what I've kind of unintentionally found is by speaking out on these issues,
um,

80
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.830
it's literally put my life in danger,
you know?

81
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.850
So I hope that kind of communicates to you how strongly I feel about being up

82
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:17.140
here talking about this today.

83
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.400
So what we're going to do is we're going to go through nine things very quickly

84
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.841
and you know,

85
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:25.810
there's going to kind of be a negative and there's going to be a positive.

86
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:30.811
So what we're going to be talking about is some unconscious things that men in

87
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:36.010
this field kind of tend to do.
And before we get into this,

88
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.080
I just really want to make this clear.

89
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.130
Google has done some amazing work on unconscious bias and it's really important

90
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:48.850
to note these problems if you do them.

91
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:51.220
Do not make you a bad person.

92
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.640
I myself have some of this same unconscious bias myself sometimes.

93
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.540
Um,
our member,
I was an apple two years ago.

94
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.590
I was sitting there and a man was trying to sell me a computer and a woman was

95
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.180
trying to sell me a computer and I found myself unconsciously realizing I was

96
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.890
talking more to the man about my computer needs.
And I'm a woman in tech figure.

97
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.960
We all have problems with these kinds of unconscious biases.

98
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.050
So I just want you to know this is not personal.

99
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.170
This is just talking about a problem in an objective way.

100
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.490
So the first thing I'd like to talk about is you need to stop treating sexism.

101
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.200
Like it's just another controversy to discuss.
Um,

102
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.550
there is an inevitable pattern that happens.
Um,

103
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.570
two days ago I wrote a piece for polygon praising,
uh,

104
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Kajima his team for making women a playable character in metal gear,

105
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:55.340
solid five.
Again,
this kind of quite a bit of sexist controversy.
Um,

106
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.611
yeah,

107
00:06:55.611 --> 00:07:00.590
this is a piece I didn't think you'd be controversial because I was actually

108
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:03.890
praising and aspect of the game for,
again,

109
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.510
they've got a lot of feminist criticism.
And what I found happened was,

110
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.500
although my response was a lot more positive than usual,
um,

111
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.970
I was inundated with men talking to me,
emailing me,

112
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.790
writing me dynamite into my house,
you know,

113
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.750
doing whatever kind of point to discuss it with me.
Um,

114
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.340
and this is a really common theme when we're talking about sexism in the

115
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:29.240
workplace.

116
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.640
This is not like talking about the ending of last or a TV show.

117
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.140
This is not like trying to talk about is it a blue dress or a gold dress?

118
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.540
You know,
these are deeply,

119
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:45.790
deeply personal issues for all of us.
And you,

120
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.800
what ends up happening is sometimes when you tried to talk about your lived

121
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:53.660
experiences in this field,

122
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.010
you'll have male engineers and we'll come up to you and they start talking about

123
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.720
it.
Like it's a problem of implementing a framework,
right?

124
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:05.690
Like they are completely objective and just trying to think through it.

125
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.550
And what I think they don't realize in that moment is it's a real unconscious

126
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:14.180
problem because what you are doing is kind of saying,

127
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.070
prove to me that you're right.

128
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.490
And there's an unconscious message there that my lived experiences are not,

129
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.990
you know,
your your opinions on this Trump,
my own lived experiences.

130
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.930
This is not a very helpful way to do it.

131
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.890
What you're unconsciously doing is when I say,
look,

132
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.790
I've had x problem of sexism with x,
Y,
and Z,
and you're like,
yeah,

133
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:43.190
I'll prove it to me.
Yeah,
well,
have you thought about this?
Oh,
well,
it's just x,
Y,

134
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:44.024
or z.

135
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.860
You were dismissing my life and the difficult things that I've gone through.

136
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.680
What we need you to do is to start showing basic instead.

137
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.440
I want to give you an example.

138
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.710
I had a really good lifelong friend of mine that went through a divorce a few

139
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.850
years ago.
You know,
I knew his wife,
I knew his child,
and he now,

140
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.380
when my friend was sitting there talking to me about his divorce,
you know,

141
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.300
I didn't sit there and say,
hey,
but did you really try to make her happy?

142
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.610
Would you really present there?
You know,

143
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:22.890
I know you feel like she's being unreasonable on this,

144
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.630
but I'm sure it was just blah,

145
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.410
like that would be unbelievably obnoxious,
right?

146
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.890
But that is what happens every single time that women start talking about our

147
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:38.580
experiences in tech.
And again,
this is not intentional,

148
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.850
but what men in this field ended up doing his tone,
this,

149
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:46.851
their own interpretation of our own lives is incorrect in the known understand

150
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:51.960
when we talk about this stuff is very difficult for us,

151
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.560
is emotionally risky.
We're trusting you.

152
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.240
That leads us into this,
you know,
this is something that happened back in 2014.

153
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.450
Um,
you know,
I'm a limit in my thirties.
Okay?

154
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.070
If I'm telling you a king cat called down the street,
like trust me,

155
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.040
that's something that's really happening.
You know,
I don't,
you know,

156
00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:16.230
I'm an engineer.
So yeah,

157
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.120
I'm talking about being out at San Francisco at WWDC and gang harassed

158
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.040
constantly on the street.

159
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.670
So I tweet about this and I ended up getting literally hundreds of responses to

160
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:34.140
this telling me that my interpretation of my own life is wrong.

161
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.640
This happens all the time in technology.
Again,

162
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.410
this is very hurtful.
So what we need you to do instead is just stop doing that.

163
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.760
Again,
this is every single day of our lives.

164
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.080
You know,

165
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.730
there's some things that you have to live to experience and let me give you an

166
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.564
example.

167
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.980
We talked a lot this year about police violence towards people of color,

168
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:00.480
particularly black people.

169
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.590
I have the privilege of being white in our society.

170
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.390
When I get pulled over by the cops,

171
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.560
I don't have to stress that you know that the cops are going to be violent.

172
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:15.270
To me,
a lot of people in this room today have that same privilege.
You know,

173
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.570
I can't speak to any number of experiences in life and that is true for all of

174
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:23.011
us.

175
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:27.900
So when someone is black and they are telling you about their experiences with

176
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:28.890
law enforcement,

177
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.220
you need to just listen to it and understand that that lived experience trumps

178
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:37.290
your own hypotheses about the situation.

179
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.000
If someone gay is telling you about coming out to their parents or the

180
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.840
discrimination they faced as a child,
you need to listen to them.

181
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.800
If someone is transgender and they are telling you about the difficulties in

182
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:52.560
transitioning,
you need to listen to them.

183
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.890
And even if the opinion were hypothetically incorrect,

184
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.060
the emotion that that person is feeling is absolutely true.

185
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.040
I want to tell a very quick story about this.
Um,
related to this point.

186
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.680
So a few years ago,
um,

187
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.980
they were doing a study on Alzheimer's patients who have this phenomenon of when

188
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:19.420
you put them in assisted living care facilities,
they wake up,

189
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.000
they're terrified,
they're confused,
they're scared,

190
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.540
they think they should be home and they're not.
They're in a strange hospital.

191
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.670
So what they would end up doing is constantly leaving this hospital and going

192
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:34.570
down to the bus stop where they would be weighted on for hours.

193
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.430
And what this study found out is that the people in the hospital would go down,

194
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.390
it,
start yelling at these poor,
you know,

195
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.430
elderly people that were suffering from the disease.

196
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:50.860
What do you need to understand is in that situation,
even if that patients,

197
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.770
if the facts of the situation,
we're not,

198
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.250
that they were in a place they weren't supposed to be,

199
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.730
their terror was absolutely real.

200
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.180
Their frustration was absolutely real.

201
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.530
So when these hospital employees were coming down and yelling at them,

202
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.520
they didn't realize that their emotions in that situation,
we're very true.

203
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.320
So what do you need to do again is start just simply respecting those lived

204
00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:25.070
experiences.
These are our lives,
these are our stories.

205
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.810
When you respect our lived experience,
you end up respecting us as individuals.

206
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.100
Oh,
this really makes me frustrated.
So there is a phenomenon.
And um,

207
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.370
when you talk about women in tech issues that it's,
I'm sorry,

208
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.500
I swear it is like you're in court and all of a sudden like you end up getting

209
00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:49.500
it flipped and you end up talking about,
um,

210
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.260
you ended up talking about how these issues affect men.

211
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.590
It is amazing to me just how instantly the script flips and I find the subject

212
00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:01.710
talking to,
if I'm talking about the things I face,

213
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.600
the subject instantly comes to if it's fair to men.
Let me give you an example.

214
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.730
Yesterday,
um,
apple at a rather large event that we're talking about.
Um,
you know,

215
00:14:11.731 --> 00:14:16.140
the iPad pro new apple TV and I was live tweeting a few thoughts about it.

216
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.010
I couldn't help but no for the first 30 minutes of it,

217
00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:24.720
but there were barely any women on stage.
So I tweet something to the effect of,

218
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.330
well,
here,
you know,
here are all apples,

219
00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:31.290
white guys who are all Microsoft's white guys and now we've got Adobe swipe guys

220
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:32.130
coming on stage,

221
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:37.200
the imed Luge with tweets from people saying,
well,

222
00:14:37.201 --> 00:14:40.560
you can't have quotas for women.
You can't do this.

223
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.660
How dare you insinuate that men shouldn't be on stage,
which is a really,
really,

224
00:14:45.661 --> 00:14:47.880
really unhelpful response.

225
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.920
I want to talk a little bit about where that comes from.

226
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.190
We may have heard the word privilege a little bit lately in the truth is men in

227
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.920
this field are kind of blind to how great you've got it.

228
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.590
I don't think you understand what it's like to go to an engineering event and be

229
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:12.050
the only person that looks like you there.

230
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.440
I don't think you understand what it's like to go to a recruiting event and have

231
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:21.140
people talk to your husband,
assuming he's the engineer.

232
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:25.670
We can't even update the software on his iPhone.
You know this,

233
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.840
this entire system has been built for you,

234
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.660
for your comfort.
So when we start talking about other people's comfort,

235
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:39.950
you're so used to it working for you that just the slightest bit of upset.

236
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.750
There's a lot of defensiveness that really happens very quickly with that and

237
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:45.740
it's not helpful.

238
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.810
Again,

239
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.810
this is not about you and I promise you every single woman engineer in this room

240
00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.050
has heard these opinions a hundred times before,

241
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.440
like a tape on repeat with all respect.
You know,

242
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.470
I have heard the argument against quotas for women in tech hundreds of times

243
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:11.660
this week.
You know,
there is a really,

244
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:16.661
really beautiful thing called the bring theory that I'd like to talk about.

245
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:18.440
So you know,

246
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.160
the idea is how not to say the wrong thing to someone.

247
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:27.080
So the idea is you are right here in the center of the circle when something

248
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:28.100
goes wrong for you.

249
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:33.101
So imagine if you have cancer or you've just lost your spouse or you're going

250
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:37.880
through a divorce or your parents have died.
If something really,

251
00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:41.000
or you've gotten 165 death threats in the hair,
you know,

252
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:45.890
imagine you are here in the center of the circle.
This is not a good place to be.

253
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.550
So what the psychologist figured out is when you were in the center of the

254
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.560
circle,
she had cancer,

255
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.240
she had a colleague come to her while she was in the hospital recovering from

256
00:16:56.241 --> 00:17:00.170
cancer surgery.
Who said to her,
well,
you know,

257
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.630
you need to realize this cancer isn't all about you.

258
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:04.610
It's affecting people in our department.

259
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:09.770
And she thought a lot about that conversation and why that was so obnoxious.

260
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:13.790
So there's this thing called the ring theory.
So at the center of the circle,

261
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:15.680
which again is not a good place to be,

262
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.980
is the aggrieved in the outer limits of the circle might be like close family

263
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:22.700
members,
loved ones,

264
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:26.330
your spouse on the outer circle might be colleagues and on the,

265
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.850
the thing here might be strangers.

266
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:34.180
So the idea is comfort flows in grievance flows out.

267
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.600
So if you're not in the center of the circle or in one of these inner rings,

268
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.430
inevitably kind of making it about you is unfortunately obnoxious.

269
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.710
What you need to do is very simple.
Just listen instead.

270
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.590
Okay.
This is a really big one.
Um,

271
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.800
I want to talk very openly and honestly about this.
You know,

272
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.240
I'm 38 year old engineer.
I don't have any children.
You know,
my,

273
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:10.380
my husband and I made the choice to really hyper focus on our careers.

274
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.340
I have been blind to this for a long time and I was very blind to this until I

275
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:21.840
had women with children come work for me.
Or you know,

276
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.850
people on my staff get pregnant.
In the game industry where I work,

277
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.710
we talk a lot about things like death threats,

278
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.640
rape threats,
um,
you know,
sexual harassment,

279
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.800
women getting hit on a conventions.

280
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.100
Something we are AV almost silent about is the way we treat women with children

281
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:44.710
in tech.
And yeah,

282
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.760
this doesn't personally affect me by what to tell you straight up in my career,

283
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:55.191
I've seen more women leave over this issue than anything else.

284
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.010
He knows someone in the society has to have the children.

285
00:19:01.011 --> 00:19:04.110
It's not like women made choice of help this.
Right.

286
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.920
And what I think people don't understand is how ridiculously expensive childcare

287
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:15.030
is here in Massachusetts.
Do you know that having daycare for your child,

288
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.450
it's as expensive as tuition at umass.

289
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.550
I want you really think about that every single year your child is in daycare.

290
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.600
That costs tuition and fees.
Absolutely.
It's,

291
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.010
it's unconscionable.
You know,
this is a really big deal.

292
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.920
So what ends up happening with women have,
you know,

293
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.950
children in tech is they end up slowly suddenly being shown the door in.

294
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.350
I've seen this again,
I have unconscious biases too.

295
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.790
And what I found at first when my employee with the child,

296
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.230
you know,
she got pregnant,

297
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:56.850
my cofounder and I found myself wrestling with all these unconscious biases.

298
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.960
Is Amanda going to be present at our workplace?

299
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.240
Is she going to be able to get her job done?

300
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.900
Is she going to start talking about her kids nonstop?

301
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.670
Which was absolutely wrong for me to think I have.
You know,

302
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.980
I've thought about that and I've grown from that.

303
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.190
This is an unconscious bias a lot of people have.

304
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.400
What you need to know in this is for parents of all genders,
not just women.

305
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.640
Part of respecting a parrot in the workforce means respecting their children.

306
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.130
That means if a parent needs to leave at five to go pick their child up,

307
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.990
respecting that person means respecting that their family comes first.

308
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.120
This is really,
really important.

309
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.860
This is a really hard one and I've run into this a lot in,

310
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.500
I can't tell you how many networking events I've been to in a bar at night with

311
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:59.830
a bunch of dudes in their 20s drinking right here in Boston was one of them.

312
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.350
Went to a while back.
Those right across the street.

313
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.190
What has happened in the field of computer science and engineering is this is a

314
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:15.421
field that was built from the ground up to be by men for men and less stress.

315
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:21.400
This is unconscious bias.
But what ends up happening is she,
you,

316
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.520
you'll have a culture of networking that is built to serve men in the way that

317
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:31.300
you like to network,
like going to a bar and having beer.

318
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.110
Let's take that example for a minute cause I'd like for you to think about it.

319
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:38.830
So let's say you were an engineer at Google in your 20s,

320
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.770
and you choose to go have a,
um,
you know,
like a,

321
00:21:42.771 --> 00:21:47.771
a meeting out with the guys on your team at the bar next door after you leave.

322
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.170
Let's think about how that's affecting women.

323
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.710
So if you're a woman in say your twenties I think you may not know,

324
00:21:57.281 --> 00:22:01.000
that doesn't feel emotionally very frequently,

325
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:02.650
like a safe place for you,

326
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.250
like a lot of you guys drinking heavily and you're the lone woman there.

327
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.530
I can think of three specific friends that have been sexually harassed in the

328
00:22:13.531 --> 00:22:17.140
situation to the point that they've been forced to leave their company.

329
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:22.420
An HR hasn't helped them.
It's not the best situation.

330
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.650
If you're a woman in your thirties maybe you have children.

331
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.950
How many Moms d know that really want to go hit a bar at eight o'clock at night

332
00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:35.440
when their kids have to go to school the next day?

333
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:41.250
This is one of these situations where the system has been built to work for a

334
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:46.951
very certain kind of person and it very unintentionally excludes a lot of people

335
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:53.650
and let's be honest,
networking is how you make careers.
It makes or breaks it.

336
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.370
This is really important.
So what we need people to do,

337
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.520
what I need everyone in this room to do is to think about widening your network.

338
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.880
If Google has a networking meeting or recruitment meeting to bring in engineers,

339
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.350
maybe don't have a bar at night,

340
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.070
maybe have a luncheon here at one o'clock like we're having right now.

341
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.890
Maybe do it earlier.
You know,

342
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.080
it's not enough to just simply believe that women need to be included.

343
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.850
I'm a software engineer.

344
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:29.500
If I go write some code for my game and it doesn't run,

345
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.950
the problem is with my code.
I don't sit there and go,

346
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.090
well I just don't know why it's working,
but we'll just keep compiling it.

347
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:38.020
And that will be that.

348
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.470
The method that we use to recruit engineers in our field is not working.

349
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.100
I've heard from so many people when they tell me,
well,

350
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:52.640
we put a job posting online and no women applied.

351
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:55.280
And that's just the end of that.
You know,

352
00:23:55.281 --> 00:24:00.281
we have made so many advancements in the last 1520 years and yet we can't look

353
00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:06.911
at the hiring process and realize it overlooks a lot of candidates.

354
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.870
Let me tell you a story.

355
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.680
Business Story of how the lead engineer at my team came to work at my company.

356
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.690
So this is a woman that was fresh out of college and you know,

357
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:22.880
she had knocked on the straight and narrow,
you know,

358
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:26.510
she didn't get a cs degree and then just instantly get into the workforce.

359
00:24:26.511 --> 00:24:28.520
She had some life adventures along the way,

360
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:34.210
so she had been working for us part time and we were just dazzled by her work.

361
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.350
She was doing technical rigging in three D,
which is very,
very difficult process.

362
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.800
We'd loved her work and we kept encouraging her to apply to the lead engineer

363
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:46.940
position and she didn't do it.

364
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.600
I asked her to keep coming in and sit with me as we were interviewing other

365
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:56.870
candidates for this position.
As we did that,

366
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.990
she realized that she had the exact same qualifications as the men we were

367
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:07.631
interviewing for that position and that gave her the confidence to move forward.

368
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.930
So yeah,
just for whatever reason,

369
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:15.410
and it's really too much to get into here,

370
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:20.740
a lot of women are kind of trained by society to not believe in ourselves and we

371
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:23.960
don't always apply for these kinds of positions.

372
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:28.880
So what you need to do is to widen your networking efforts to make sure you're

373
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:33.881
looking at absolutely everyone we face a lot more nourishing to getting your

374
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.990
foot in the door.
Okay.

375
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.930
Um,
you know,
this is hard

376
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.680
so many times when you try to talk to people in tech about even a very small

377
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:55.070
behavioral thing they might've done that is not helpful.

378
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.700
It gets defensive very,
very,
very quickly.

379
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.930
And I think part of this problem is,
you know,

380
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.160
being like self,

381
00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:12.161
identifying yourself as a racist or sexist or a homophobe is nearly impossible

382
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.030
because we get all these messages from society that these things are bad,

383
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:18.050
they're terrible.

384
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.210
So what ends up happening is you tell yourself,
hey,

385
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.350
I'm not a bad person.
I'm a nice guy.
I care about women.
You know,

386
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:31.310
you think of like this extreme example and you say,
I'm not that.

387
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.550
And you self identify yourself as a nice person and you're unable to hear any of

388
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:41.810
the criticism there.
And I want to be straight up with you.

389
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:46.811
I think we could do a better job with this as a society of giving people a

390
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:48.330
break.

391
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:53.330
I think we have a really unfortunate tendency to when someone makes one mistake

392
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.650
often unconscious,
often unintentional,
of kind of crucifying them about it.

393
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:02.520
To be honest,
I make mistakes all the time in my field.

394
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.630
I've told you about some today.
I don't think that makes me a bad person.

395
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.350
You know,
we have got to get past this,

396
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:14.280
we can hear about these behavior problems and move forward.

397
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.740
I think it's really,
really telling.

398
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.250
In all the years I've been speaking about women in tech issues,

399
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.700
I have almost never had a guy come up to me afterwards and say,

400
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:29.370
Hey Briana,
you know what?
I am part of the problem.

401
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.170
There's almost never happened.
It's always those other guys.

402
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.120
It's always the other examples.

403
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:41.010
The truth is if you think that the problem is someone else,

404
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.900
you are a part of the prop.

405
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.450
We've talked a lot this year about like people of color and you get,

406
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.570
again to give an example where I have failed,
you know,

407
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.920
my staff for Alaska and that we shipped revolution 60 happened to be all white

408
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:56.754
people.

409
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.830
And I looked at that and I realize that I was not bringing people of color into

410
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:06.480
my own company to evaluate people of color for these positions.

411
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.660
And I realized I had a responsibility to change myself,

412
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.580
change my networking habits,

413
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:15.390
and make sure it was bringing people of color in for those positions.

414
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.800
So this is a mindset where I'm not saying,
Hey,

415
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.850
I'm not a racist.
Hey,
I have nothing to fix here.
Hey,

416
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:25.830
I have no part to play in making it better.

417
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:30.510
This is a very helpful attitude that all of us needed to have.
And again,

418
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:35.520
this is all about responsibility.
It's thinking critically about your behavior.

419
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.820
What I'd love about one of the videos I've seen from Google and unconscious bias

420
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.850
is,
you know,
what they found is the science shows.

421
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:48.750
If you take one of the things I'm talking about today,

422
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:53.700
if you just take one thing,
if you say,
Hey,
I'm not networking enough of women,

423
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.030
Hey,
I am invalidating people's experiences,

424
00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.990
few make a commitment to just change one thing today.

425
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.300
The science shows that that is going to cause you to start thinking about more

426
00:29:06.301 --> 00:29:10.110
things and it will make you a better person and a better teammate.

427
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.320
We all make mistakes.
Okay.

428
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:18.321
So you know there is a misconception I feel in tech that the problem women face

429
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:23.360
is like don draper sitting in and uh,

430
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.180
check office somewhere is drinking some scotch and talking about how broads

431
00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:28.290
can't code,
right?

432
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:34.310
That's the hypothetical situation that we think discrimination is in this field.

433
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.390
Like I have never had from a professional.

434
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:41.920
Someone tell me to go back to the kitchen,
right?

435
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.580
Like these kinds of moments are not the real problem.

436
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:51.030
So what we've kind of set up is this idea in our minds that the real problem is

437
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:57.481
like some raging sexist stereotype from the 50s the science shows that's not

438
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:00.940
quite right.

439
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:06.250
Sexism in tech according to the science of it is death by a thousand cuts.

440
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:11.050
And what happens is it's like every single day you are in this field.

441
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.490
If you're someone that's a person of color.

442
00:30:13.491 --> 00:30:16.930
So when this gaze someone that's a woman,
you know,

443
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.940
you find yourself slowly dying this death of a thousand cuts.

444
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.840
And how that happens is it's little things all day long,

445
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.620
like people not inviting you to meetings,
people you know,

446
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.880
underestimating your capacity as an engineer.

447
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.380
People assuming that you don't know your field even when you may have dedicated

448
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:39.910
your entire career.
Pour it.

449
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.140
I had an example yesterday while I was talking about the apple TV event.

450
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.480
I want to tell you straight up,
I wanted the,

451
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.900
I know more about running the unreal engine on um,

452
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.850
you know,
on apple platforms,

453
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:59.490
apple mobile platforms than almost anyone else.
You could probably find 20,

454
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.460
30 people may be in the world to understand this subject as much as I do.

455
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.890
And I was talking critically about some of the engineering choices the apple

456
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:13.030
made when developing this platform in particular,
the 200 megabyte limit,

457
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:16.030
which is kind of obviated by a cloud solution.

458
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.720
I was inundated by hundreds and hundreds of people writing me,

459
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.720
assuming they knew more than they than I did in this field and telling me I was

460
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:33.160
wrong when all they had was a rather obvious fact that was mentioned in some,

461
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:35.170
some tech documents.

462
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.840
This is a really good example of a death of a thousand cuts like this is just

463
00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:42.820
one minor thing that happens,

464
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.410
but it happens over and over and Dover,
Dover and Dover,

465
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.160
they're called microaggressions and they kind of slowly push you out at field.

466
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.200
Another good example at Apple's event yesterday,
um,

467
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:02.250
they happen to Photoshop a picture of a woman into smiling using the new iPad

468
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:06.070
pro,
right?
This is a pretty tone deaf moment,
right?

469
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:11.370
Like you guys don't understand how often when you're walking down the street,

470
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:13.840
you're instructed to smile.

471
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.740
You're told you it'd be prettier if you would just smile.

472
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.130
This happens all the time.

473
00:32:19.131 --> 00:32:24.131
It's when apple had not had any women on stage yet at that point and they're

474
00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:28.630
photoshopping a woman smiling.
It's a really tone deaf moment.

475
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.260
That's something that a lot of guys I saw on Twitter just didn't understand
that.

476
00:32:33.261 --> 00:32:36.600
It was just a little thing that was really just kind of obnoxious.

477
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.420
It pushes us away.
Yeah.
This is a really good example.
This happened last year.

478
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.470
Know this is just a slide at a conference and you know,

479
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.300
it's completely tone deaf.

480
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.890
Stuff like that will happen to you almost every single day if you're a woman in

481
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:52.724
this field.

482
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.630
What we need you to understand is real sexism in this field.
It's very,

483
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:03.700
very subtle.
A good example of this,

484
00:33:03.701 --> 00:33:06.110
a happened here in Boston is harmonics.

485
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:10.820
You might read this week that they got 15 million new dollars in venture capital

486
00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:14.090
funding.
So you know,

487
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.080
a friend of mine that worked at harmonics was telling me this story.

488
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:23.110
So she was sending out on a meeting and there were looking at getting a new um,

489
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:28.180
person to come in for an engineering position and the team leader kept using

490
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:34.130
masculine pronouns when asking someone to come in from the job,
well,

491
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:38.870
this engineer,
he should have x years of experience with x,
Y,
and z.

492
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.160
He should be x.
He should live in x.

493
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.570
He should have this kind of background.
And she stopped him in the meeting,
said,

494
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.860
excuse me,
you know,

495
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:52.430
this could be a man or a woman that we hire for this position.

496
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.480
This engineer proceeded to then completely talk over her,

497
00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.790
belittle her objection,
and said,
this is not a problem.
He means every body.

498
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.350
That's just a very small thing that happens.
It's subtle.

499
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:11.930
This is a really hard thing to understand and this is something,
again,

500
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.030
I've had learned this in my lifetime.

501
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.880
The absence of privilege is not oppression.

502
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:25.250
And I say this with all respect to all the male engineers in this room.

503
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.540
This is a system that really,
really works for you.

504
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:35.350
So when we're talking about changing the system just a little bit so other

505
00:34:35.721 --> 00:34:39.800
people can come in and you have awesome people on your team,

506
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.061
you know,

507
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:46.061
we are talking about changing things and I want to be clear it is going to

508
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:48.530
disrupt some of the boys club atmosphere.

509
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:51.920
They exists and tech that is not oppression.

510
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:56.510
That is a quality.
I want to give you a very quick story.

511
00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.470
So I was over at MIT the other day and I was um,

512
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.750
giving presentations
afterwards.
Um,

513
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.020
I had some people that were really moved by it and they were telling me stories

514
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:13.760
about being out with drinks with the guys afterwards and there was this one

515
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.661
engineer,

516
00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:18.600
those on the team and who was sitting there and just having drinks out with
this,

517
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.600
his buddies.
And he was really,

518
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:25.601
really angry about the talk that I gave and he was talking about how he felt

519
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:29.630
like he had never fit in anywhere in his whole life.

520
00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:32.510
Something I have a lot of empathy for,
I can understand that.

521
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:35.240
So I felt the entire same way growing up.

522
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:39.930
So what he was saying was he was really,
really scared.

523
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:45.230
The TAC was going to change to this place where he couldn't like how bro time,

524
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.381
you know,

525
00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:50.880
it couldn't have pictures of bikini girls always screensaver and it would be

526
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:53.340
like a different kind of atmosphere.

527
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:58.070
As much as my heart goes out to that person.
Cause I think we all need,

528
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.140
we all need to want to belong to a social group.

529
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.530
It's not fair for him to prioritize his own comfort over just equality for gay

530
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:12.300
people,
for women,
for people of Color.

531
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.790
The culture tech has been built in your own image.

532
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:22.440
I was a pac stuff,
um,
two weeks ago and I found myself,

533
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:26.310
there was this weirdest moment that I had,
um,
you know,
it was a 23 old kid,

534
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.990
you know,
as a white guy,

535
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.100
a sitting there talking to me and he was talking about how I was terrified he

536
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:34.380
was never going to find an engineering position.

537
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.770
And the whole time I was sitting there talking to him and I was realizing all

538
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:42.270
the assumptions I had in my mind.
He looked like an engineer.

539
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.650
Like you got kind of messy hair and you know,
just wearing a tee shirt,

540
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:47.850
a professional event.

541
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:53.190
He kind of looked like that stereotype and in the back of my mind I'm going of

542
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:57.750
course it's going to find a job and I found myself saying I don't know anything

543
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:01.770
about its technical expertise.
I don't know anything about his education.

544
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:04.290
I don't know anything about how well he plays with others,

545
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.630
but it looks like the part,
right?

546
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.060
It's just another example of the entire tech industry being built in your image

547
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.690
and when you close your eyes and think about someone working in this field,

548
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:20.340
it probably doesn't look like me or other women,
you know?

549
00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:25.341
And the truth is I get so much hate mail in speaking out against this and this

550
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:30.570
is what,
this is before Gamergate that I got this,

551
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.370
this is just absolutely terrible at stuff like this.

552
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:38.940
I get every single day speaking out about about this.

553
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:45.020
This is something that would be a benefit to everyone here to understand.

554
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.630
Let's be straight up.
Tech is going to change.

555
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.430
The momentum is on the side of women and people of color.

556
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:54.840
And other minorities.

557
00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.180
We are talking about these problems more and more and more and I feel very

558
00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:04.500
confident the tech in 10 years is going to look different than it does today.

559
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.780
I grew up in Mississippi,
which is a state that was described by them.
Okay.

560
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:14.790
A sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression growing up I sure did

561
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:20.361
meet a lot of people that were extremely homophobic or racist and you know,

562
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:25.050
even in my own social groups in college,

563
00:38:25.051 --> 00:38:28.320
I would find these people and what would inevitably happen,

564
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:29.970
especially with gay rights,

565
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.820
is we kind of have this person there that was kind of ranting about,
you know,

566
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.880
gay being able to get married and then slowly be pushed out of our social

567
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:41.500
circle.
Do you know what I mean?

568
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:46.530
Like they just had views or kind of dated and we started moving away from them

569
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.990
in the same way on talking about this and utterly pragmatic terms,

570
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.290
this change is happening.

571
00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:01.420
Your workforce will include more women in the future.

572
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.870
So it's not just that this is the right thing to do.

573
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:10.000
This is to your own career advantage to develop these skills,

574
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.090
to learn to work with other people?
You know,

575
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:17.800
one of the best skills for any tech professional is being able to work well with

576
00:39:17.801 --> 00:39:22.660
the team.
A lot of times when I talk about women in tech issues,

577
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:26.810
there's this assumption that women,

578
00:39:26.811 --> 00:39:31.210
that attack is just a chick thing,
right?
Like,
oh well,

579
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.870
you know,

580
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.830
that's just a a woman problem and I don't really have to deal with that.

581
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.810
I was at a tech event last night,

582
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.470
those VIP event with investors and wouldn't startup founders.

583
00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.950
As much as I love events like that,

584
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.470
it sometimes feels like there's a,
um,

585
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:52.380
it feels like there's a trade off in this field where,
you know,

586
00:39:52.381 --> 00:39:54.790
kind of the powers that be will let you know,

587
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:59.320
women go have our lunches over here and they'll pay for us to have an auditorium

588
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:03.100
and do some networking events.
But nothing really changes.

589
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.490
I'm going to tell you,
in all honesty,

590
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:11.491
straight up sexism in tech is not a problem with women's behavior.

591
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.440
I could say that one more time.

592
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.210
Sexism in tech is not a problem with women's behavior.

593
00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.540
This is a male behavior problem.

594
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:28.210
I can be up here and I can speak to you about changing this,

595
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.210
but the only person that can make this better is she you.

596
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.050
So what we're gonna do is we're going to start a conversation right now.

597
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.990
I will answer any question the entire world.

598
00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:44.140
So who's going to be brave enough to put their hand up first?
We will.

599
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.063
We will do that.

600
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.090
<v 3>Hi.
Thanks for having the courage to come here and give this talk.</v>

601
00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:52.190
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Um,
your slides are refreshingly direct.

602
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.580
Didn't expect him to be that.
Uh,
that's so,
because I found that people don't,

603
00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.590
don't seem to respond to them that well,
but in your experience,
um,
you know,

604
00:41:01.591 --> 00:41:04.550
if you're with a bunch of people,
one of them makes a,

605
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.420
a comment that they don't understand,
no problem,
you know,
inappropriate.
Do you,

606
00:41:09.421 --> 00:41:12.160
have you found it's better to actually be more direct with them and Saint

607
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.020
[inaudible] then just say straight up that's wrong.
Instead of saying,
well,

608
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.050
maybe you could,
maybe it's not quite like that.
Yeah,

609
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.060
<v 2>I,
that's a wonderful question.
Um,
let me answer an equally directly.</v>

610
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.480
If you're a woman and you do that and had that direct conversation,

611
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.730
you'll get tremendous blowback,

612
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.560
which is why so many of the women I know one game down are very,

613
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:37.400
very careful about dancing around this issue and like just hinting to it as

614
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:40.490
subtly as she can because she gets so much blow back.

615
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.940
This is where you personally can do the most good in the entire world.

616
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.250
So yeah,
with the Gamergate thing,

617
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280
we do have men on our field that are speaking out like Chris clue.

618
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.100
Um,
it's one of them.
Arthur Chu would be another,

619
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:03.550
they don't get a fraction of the death threats that I get remade it.

620
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:07.040
Gunther Zoe Quinn gets from Randy Harper gets,

621
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:10.850
so what happens is when you have that male privilege,

622
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:15.260
you were able to kind of pull your body aside and be like,
Hey,
can we,

623
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:16.520
can we just talk about that?

624
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:20.540
That's not really cool what you just said and just have an open conversation

625
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.100
with them about that.
That is almost no risk for you.
So,

626
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.140
um,
I think if you're a woman,

627
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.690
you need to realize that we're going to be blow back for that.

628
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.510
I personally made the choice to just answer directly.

629
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.770
I'm not Oprah Winfrey again.
Um,

630
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.420
this is where I would really ask guys to step up and help us out.

631
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:42.740
You can do so much good.
You,
you have no idea.

632
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.110
So let's go to another question.

633
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.420
<v 4>I suspect most,
most of the people here in the room are,
uh,
are,</v>

634
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.380
are probably on your side,
are probably very receptive to this message.
Thank you.

635
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.700
Um,
and yeah,
I am too.
And thank you for coming to get the talk.
Huh.
Um,

636
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:03.550
do you think it's better to try to engage people who aren't here,
uh,

637
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.170
and maybe wouldn't be as receptive or do you think it's better for them to come

638
00:43:08.171 --> 00:43:10.420
to this conversation of their own volition?

639
00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:13.240
<v 2>Sure.
I think that's a really good question.
Um,</v>

640
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.570
is there anyone else here see the piece on box last week?

641
00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:21.430
Those talking about what Nernst don't understand about politics by Dr box.

642
00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:24.610
And did you see that that was a 10 out of town talk.

643
00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:29.611
So I called up that writer on the phone afterwards and I started asking him that

644
00:43:30.911 --> 00:43:33.100
exact question,
how we could get that answer.

645
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:37.560
So let me tell you about the science suffix and they'll Google nerds love

646
00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:42.070
science.
So he has a lot of expertise in climate change denial.

647
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.250
So you know people that don't want to believe in global warming.

648
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:50.730
So what happens is with some people you are correct is impossible to change

649
00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:52.001
their minds.

650
00:43:52.001 --> 00:43:54.850
There's nothing that you can say there's ever going to make them feel

651
00:43:54.851 --> 00:43:59.851
differently on that you cannot scientifically change someone's opinion,

652
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.090
what you can change scientifically someone's behavior.

653
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:08.920
So the human mind has this really interesting trait that,
um,

654
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.560
we'd like to think of ourselves as rational creatures,

655
00:44:11.561 --> 00:44:16.450
but we're not with the psychological trick where we decide how we want to feel

656
00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.520
and then our minds act like lawyers and justify the thing that we want to

657
00:44:21.521 --> 00:44:22.810
believe.
And you know,

658
00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:26.260
like if you're a programmer and you've learned to short circuit that to a

659
00:44:26.261 --> 00:44:30.330
certain extent,
like we tend to be very logical creatures,
but you know,

660
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.510
that is the overall human tendency there.
So,

661
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.320
so you can't turn someone's opinion.
You can change their behavior.

662
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.770
So what happens if you make a social cost to that person doing something?

663
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.870
If every single time they speak up,
they face consequences for that.

664
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.530
Even if it's just someone going,
hey,
that's not really cool.

665
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.950
Hey that made me feel uncomfortable.
Hey that's me didn't really key.

666
00:44:59.951 --> 00:45:00.900
It's like about this.
Why?

667
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:05.901
Maybe what happens over time is you change that behavior and then the

668
00:45:07.781 --> 00:45:12.480
psychological trick where you decide how you want to feel and then the mind

669
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:13.560
justifies it.

670
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.610
You just side that you want to feel like not doing this because the social cost

671
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:21.750
is less and then your attitudes slowly start to change.

672
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:26.340
So with the climate change denial thing,
this would be,
um,

673
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:31.020
if you can get through any way possible to like get tax rebates,

674
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:35.220
to get people to put solar panels on their roof,
to save on energy efficiency.

675
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.940
What they found when you do that is their opinions change.

676
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:43.890
So you can have the most,
um,
dedicated climate change denier.

677
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.780
But once I get that,
you know,
government tax rebate,

678
00:45:46.781 --> 00:45:48.540
so like put solar panels on their roof,

679
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.750
suddenly they're proponent of renewable energy.

680
00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.580
It's exactly the same way in the field.

681
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:57.210
So scientifically those the best weapon that we have.

682
00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.070
Do we have another question?

683
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.610
<v 0>So first of all,
thank you for the choice you're making.</v>

684
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:06.360
I can not imagine choosing to live a life or death threats were just sort of a

685
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.620
background factor.
It's really down.
Um,

686
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.270
I think it's necessary to have conversation with speak for,

687
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:15.090
there would be people like you.
So I'm grateful for you for doing something.

688
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:19.620
I don't think I'd be up to do it.
So,
um,
I,

689
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.480
the question I was curious about asking is do you have some understanding your

690
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:28.830
intuition about where the depth of vitriol comes from?
Sure.
I mean,

691
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:31.090
some of it I buy as being the,

692
00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:34.130
the confusion between absence of privilege and oppression and I get,
you know,

693
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.300
I get that,
but it doesn't feel like enough to me.

694
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:39.000
And there's something about it that I'm just not wrapping my brain around.

695
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:43.920
<v 2>Oh,
I've,
I've spent an entire year about this question.
You know,</v>

696
00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:49.180
this is,
this is very insightful.
So this is as best as I can figure it out.

697
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.850
Cause that's a really,
that's getting at the core of the problem,
which I love.
So,

698
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.540
um,
how many people here are gamers?
Can you raise your hand if you're a Gamer?

699
00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:58.643
Great.

700
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:04.550
So the biggest mistake my parents ever made was getting me an intent,

701
00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:09.591
no entertainment system in 1985 I remember opening that box at Christmas and I

702
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:13.440
remember my grades went to Hell.

703
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:18.240
You got to stop socializing and stopped doing my chores.
And that is all I did.

704
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:22.830
That's still doing it.
Oh,
so,
but what are,

705
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:26.340
remember about that era,
and this was 30 years ago,

706
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:31.120
like Maria turns 30 sin guys,
this is amazing.
Um,

707
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.780
what are,

708
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:36.780
remember about this era was how marketed the product was for boys.

709
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.150
And this shows up in all these subtle ways.

710
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.860
Do you know their voice void been to core Mario Games where you could play as a

711
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:49.900
girl character princess peach?

712
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:55.230
The first one is Super Moria too in 1988 and then as far as the core Mari at

713
00:47:55.511 --> 00:47:56.021
titles,

714
00:47:56.021 --> 00:48:01.021
we had to wait 25 years for Princess Peach to be playable again and this kind of

715
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.430
making this a boy space.

716
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.460
It was very deliberately chosen by the Nintendo marketing team back in 1985 they

717
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:15.910
said that they were targeting boys between five and 10 then when the Super

718
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:19.770
Nintendo came out in 1982 they just rewrote the same documents and we're

719
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.780
targeting boys five to 15 so what has happened is I think we'd like to say that

720
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:32.461
the problem is a bunch of misogynistic 15 year olds and that is part of the

721
00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:37.810
problem.
Good.
I think if you want to look at it more deeply,

722
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:43.070
there are all these unconscious messages that been telling boys now,

723
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:48.310
35 year old men,
right?
The games are their space.

724
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:52.630
It's not women's space.
It happens in all these subtle ways,
right?

725
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:57.850
Princess Peach is always waiting to be rescued in the council when women are in

726
00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:01.750
games,
you know,
we're frequently oversexualized,
right?

727
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.690
We're always the sidekick or the damsel in distress and we have huge giant boons

728
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.200
and lots of cleavage out.

729
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:13.590
And what it is is a thousand unconscious signals that had been sent to men

730
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.970
saying,
this is for you.
This is not for women.
And they,

731
00:49:18.971 --> 00:49:20.820
they have this intellectual short cub would,

732
00:49:20.821 --> 00:49:25.360
they might be theoretically fine with women playing games,

733
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:30.250
but the instant we bring their lived experience into it and say,
well,

734
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.710
you know,
it really hurts me to never be able to be the,

735
00:49:33.711 --> 00:49:37.090
the playable character in the game.
Well,
you know,

736
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:42.091
I'd like to see a woman larger than size six represented in a video game.

737
00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.121
You know,
all these,

738
00:49:43.121 --> 00:49:47.410
how many games can you think of where you've seen a mom as a playable character

739
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.270
id now,
how many,

740
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.910
what percentage of women are going to have kids in their lifetime?

741
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.550
So it's like,

742
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.880
it's all unconscious by the people in our field,
but they feel it's,

743
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:01.750
it's kind of the same as politics.

744
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:05.410
Like certain people feel their identities being taken away and they get very

745
00:50:05.411 --> 00:50:08.830
defensive.
Did you have a follow up?
I do,
but I,
yeah,
go ahead.
Go ahead.
Yeah.

746
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:14.100
<v 0>Just what I'm,
if I take what you're saying and I take it just sort of trying to</v>

747
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.370
wrap my brain around it.
What I'm hearing is that there is,
you know,

748
00:50:19.371 --> 00:50:24.371
people create or adopt or dive into spaces that are restricted to one set of

749
00:50:25.881 --> 00:50:28.810
people when they are threatened.
Correct.
Or the set of people.
Okay.

750
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.690
So I'm hearing you as a,
as saying that the people who are feeling,
I mean,

751
00:50:32.691 --> 00:50:36.440
you could look at what they say online and it's pretty clear to yeah,
but look,

752
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:38.920
they're much winter mentioned something.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
no.
Yeah.

753
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.480
The state saying that there is a class of men that feel threatened by the

754
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:44.330
presence of women in gaming seems a little obvious.
Um,

755
00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:49.310
but it does bring up the next question,
which is sort of why,
what's going on.

756
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:54.311
They are that those people feel like they need that space to feel safe.

757
00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:59.840
<v 2>Let me,
let me tell you another quick story.
I grew up in Mississippi.
Um,</v>

758
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:03.950
so my senator at the time,
Trump live,
um,

759
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.590
I actually worked for him one summer,
so I'll leave that there.
Don't judge me.

760
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.513
I was very young.

761
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:17.830
So my Senator Trent Lott once did a study for the Republican Party in the south.

762
00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:21.350
And I'm keeping this very apolitical.
We're just talking about facts here.
Okay.

763
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.690
So,
um,
he did a study,
um,

764
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.820
looking at what would drive voter behavior to vote for the Republicans that

765
00:51:31.971 --> 00:51:32.804
year.

766
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:37.730
So the tested all these questions like the Democrats will raise taxes,
blah,

767
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:38.564
blah,
blah.

768
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:43.040
They found this one question that raised through the roof,

769
00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:45.680
the response of it.
And the question was,

770
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:50.681
the Democrats want to take away your culture and white southern males just

771
00:51:50.811 --> 00:51:55.811
responded off the charts to this like just ridiculously high.

772
00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.840
So what happens is there's a really deep set evolutionary part of our brain

773
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:03.620
where we're programmed,

774
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:08.480
like from back when we were living in caves to have ingroups and outgroups and

775
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:11.300
we're just programmed to say we're in this group.

776
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.720
And then this group over here is the other and they are a threat.

777
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.640
And you can see that portrayed all through history for war through all of this

778
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:20.240
stuff.

779
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.950
So what's happening is it's really tapping into this very reptilian,

780
00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:29.210
primordial part of the brain where people feel like this is their ingroup,

781
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.750
their identity is based in it and they're scared as can be taken away.

782
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.780
So see,

783
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.220
<v 0>I just wanted to pass on a question from a speaker last month,</v>

784
00:52:39.221 --> 00:52:43.660
Elizabeth Schawinski who just wanted to know what we might see next from you and

785
00:52:43.661 --> 00:52:46.570
also how friends can help with anything you're working on.

786
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:51.410
<v 2>Oh,
that's a really great question.
I love her.
You should check out her book.
Um,</v>

787
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:56.710
so what I'm working on next is as if dealing with Gamergate,

788
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.690
we're not big enough for me.
Um,

789
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:01.790
we're working on the venture capital scene right now.

790
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:06.710
Let's do a multimillion dollar expansion.
Um,
and I can't talk about some of it,

791
00:53:06.711 --> 00:53:07.130
but,
um,

792
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:12.130
we're very interested in what we're calling emotional gameplay dynamics.

793
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:13.221
So to me,

794
00:53:13.221 --> 00:53:18.221
I feel like we have reinvented this wheel for 30 years in the video game

795
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:23.090
industry.
How many first person shooters to be played?
Because let's be honest,

796
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.730
call of duty is not that different than doom.

797
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.260
It's like we keep reinventing the same idea because it's the same people there.

798
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.880
What we're doing is taking a step back from the entire video game industry,

799
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:40.230
from all the assumptions that we've made and we're saying what is the goal in

800
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:43.470
the video game industry?
And to me the goal is the Holodeck.

801
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.540
The goal is the hollow deck and to go and interact with different kinds of

802
00:53:48.541 --> 00:53:52.860
people in emotional ways and learn things about yourself along the way.

803
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:56.460
So as we really have an explosion in VR technology,

804
00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:00.660
we have some very interesting ideas of a frameworks to develop for this.

805
00:54:00.661 --> 00:54:03.780
So we're raising millions of dollars for that.
Um,

806
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.020
as far as how to help me guys,

807
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.150
if I personally dealt with all of my death threats myself,

808
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:17.160
I would not do anything else with.
My time is just too much of it and it's sad,

809
00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.610
but I'm just being straight with you being up here today.

810
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.790
People see this video on Google,
I will get threats,

811
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:27.430
I will get attacked and I have to employ at my company,

812
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:32.070
fulltime person to deal with my harassment,
to talk to prosecutors,

813
00:54:32.071 --> 00:54:34.320
to talk to the FBI,
to document this stuff.

814
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.690
Cause I could not work in this field if I did.

815
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:41.750
So I've a patrion where people can help pay for that position because start ups,

816
00:54:42.001 --> 00:54:45.940
don't have room for extra positions to pay people to file death threat and

817
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:49.590
charges with prosecutors.
So that's how you can help.
Um,

818
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.530
maybe we'll give a link to that in the video.
Thanks for that question.

819
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.620
Stepping back to the,
uh,
stepping back to the attitudes that lead to the,

820
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:03.480
it's just a horrible illness.
It makes me wonder where the cultural watchdogs,

821
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:08.470
right.
All along that these games were corrupting us during our formative years.

822
00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:15.240
I tell you the weirdest story about that.

823
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.950
So I remember,
um,

824
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:22.710
who else here was a Gamer in the 90s with Jack Thompson.
Like,

825
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.100
do you remember that?
When they were worried about mortal Kombat,
um,

826
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.960
corrupting the youth.
And I remember being a teenager and being like,
oh,

827
00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:35.220
that's so stupid.
That's so dog that's so full of crap.

828
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:39.930
And I'm not saying that it's not,
but what I'm tell you I experience that I had,

829
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.110
so they're coming out with hatred,

830
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.140
which is this game that's a mass murder simulator and you have a certain person

831
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:54.021
on steam that is demanding the creators ad modifiable tools.

832
00:55:55.321 --> 00:55:59.340
So people can put me in that game to kill.

833
00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:02.010
And Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian hint.

834
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.800
So I have gamers that want to do that.

835
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:09.830
And I keep thinking back to being a teacher and my strong opinion about violence

836
00:56:10.321 --> 00:56:14.030
doesn't matter and look and just be straight up.
I know I'm going to answer.

837
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:18.480
They're like,
I think we should be able to make whatever games that we want.

838
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:20.280
And I'm certainly not pro censorship,

839
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.550
but I think something's really wrong in her industry and I think we need to

840
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:28.240
think about that.
So yeah.
Does that answer your question?

841
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.900
Yeah,
I,
I mean,
yeah,

842
00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.230
I'm not gonna tell you mean you need to like start censoring games.
I don't,

843
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:38.380
I think it's impossible in an age of digital distribution.

844
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:42.520
But what I do believe is that Nintendo,

845
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.770
Sony,
Microsoft,

846
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:49.771
and steam have a responsibility to think about the product that they're putting

847
00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:54.700
out.
When steam reversed their decision and did decide to release hatred,

848
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.610
which guys,
this is made by neo Nazis.

849
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.140
It's a white power thing to just go kill people and you'll watch the trailer and

850
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:05.710
there's a woman begging onto her knees for her life and you'll like stick a

851
00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:07.540
shotgun in her mouth and kill her.

852
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:13.200
It is horrific and I don't think you should censor that by the government.

853
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.420
And I think in an age of digital distribution,

854
00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:20.050
anyone can play that game if they want.
So,
you know,
the quick,

855
00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.590
let's do,
can we do two questions super quickly?
Great.

856
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:27.940
<v 5>Um,
you mentioned a couple of microaggressions.</v>

857
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:31.540
You mentioned mansplaining and I'm interrupting.

858
00:57:31.541 --> 00:57:33.320
I wonder if there's any others you want to call out?

859
00:57:33.321 --> 00:57:36.490
Just maybe anything that's specific to the software development environment.

860
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:38.030
<v 2>I think that,</v>

861
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:44.890
I think a really big one would be assuming women do not know their stuff.

862
00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:48.560
That's a really,
really big one.
It,
it hurts a lot.

863
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:52.460
I think talking over women in meetings,
and let me say this,

864
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:55.610
I love gender neutral examples.
Look,

865
00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.770
a lot of it's here are software engineers.

866
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:02.720
Almost all the engineers I know are introverts,
right?
Like I'm not,

867
00:58:02.721 --> 00:58:04.430
but the vast majority are.

868
00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:09.850
What I have noticed and running my company is if I don't take a firm hand,

869
00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:13.250
the extroverts end up talking over everyone in.

870
00:58:13.251 --> 00:58:17.270
Introverts can't get a word in edgewise.
This includes a lot of women.

871
00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:19.310
So if you are a product manager,

872
00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:24.580
you have a strong responsibility as a team leader to shut down the extroverts

873
00:58:25.071 --> 00:58:29.870
like me from monopolizing the entire conversation and letting everyone be hurt.

874
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:33.470
I could go into a whole bunch of them.
But I think that's a good example.

875
00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:34.663
Last question.

876
00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.570
<v 6>Oh,
um,
so I was wondering,
I mean,</v>

877
00:58:38.571 --> 00:58:42.160
so there was a time right in the late tube in early transistor days when it

878
00:58:42.161 --> 00:58:45.980
computing computer operators were mostly women because she has likes which board

879
00:58:45.981 --> 00:58:50.450
operation.
It was basically seen as secretarial.
Um,
and my question was,

880
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.770
can,
are there any lessons we can draw from kind of the path of computing?

881
00:58:54.771 --> 00:58:57.110
Is there was a time when it was indeed mostly women.

882
00:58:57.111 --> 00:58:59.660
It wasn't prestigious position and became a prestigious position.

883
00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:02.840
Ben came in there.
Anything we can learn from the early part of that history.

884
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.930
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a historical pattern.
Believe it or not,</v>

885
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:10.880
there's a huge pattern through history of fields coming along and being born.
Um,

886
00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:11.600
you know,

887
00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.310
and it starts off as very prestigious and women are drawn to it and there's this

888
00:59:16.311 --> 00:59:20.750
pattern over and over again that men kind of move into from the field and ended

889
00:59:20.751 --> 00:59:23.510
up changing it.
So,
um,
you know,

890
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:26.900
I would love to tell you what happened in competing in those early days is like

891
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:29.570
an aberration,
but it's not.
Um,

892
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:34.690
there is so much baggage that women face to working as professional engineers.

893
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:41.210
I see this with some of my friends' children who are,
you know,
14,

894
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:46.211
15 right now and they're put into a culture where beauty culture starts telling

895
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:48.230
them who their friends are,

896
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.100
what they look like is so much more important than doing that work.

897
00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:56.720
We all know is so important.
Sitting in your bedroom and learning how to code,

898
00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.590
you know?

899
00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:01.490
So there are a thousand messages like that that we really have to move past as

900
01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:05.060
this society.
Yeah.
Guy To leave it there today.
So thank you all for having me.

901
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:10.480
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
