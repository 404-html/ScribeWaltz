1
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.940
How might we live in harmony with nature?
And if you go one step further,

2
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.520
and I think I'll put this into context of all the different things I've been

3
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:20.350
doing,
whether it is for example the advisory or making a physical environment,

4
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.230
zero waste,
you know,
like not having an impact on,

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.830
on the environment or looking at the sort of the data that we can collect from

6
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:30.820
smart cities and sensors and things like that to understand how best we can make

7
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:35.110
those decisions for future designs,
buildings,
et Cetera.
Um,

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.070
one thing that I'm super interested in at the moment is the use of new

9
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:42.370
technologies like fourth industrial revolution type technologies and

10
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:47.371
understanding how people like us are actually using dialogue to understand how

11
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:51.820
best we can understand that technology in the context of the lives that we want

12
00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:53.410
to live with the philosophy that we have.

13
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.230
So it's as if that philosophy was the basis and the foundation and then you're

14
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.210
going to build everything on top of it.
Another thing that I'm looking at,

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.830
and I'm much more practical level,

16
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:07.660
is really looking at how businesses procure that products and their services.

17
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.430
And going into the site supply chains and understanding at that supply chain,

18
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:13.660
where do you get your products from?

19
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.620
Where the resources coming from and is there an alternative that we can have say

20
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.190
shared economy or whether it is that when you're going to be designing your

21
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.000
startup,

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.630
the material that you're using for your products is actually having a beneficial

23
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:26.690
environmental impact.

24
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.150
It is also about understanding where our conduct construction industry,

25
00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:33.900
which is where 40% of our climate,
um,
you know,

26
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.530
carbon related emissions are coming from can actually be reduced to a lot of the

27
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.170
physical environment that we either live in work in.

28
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.530
It's still going to be here 50 years time,
right?
I mean,

29
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.630
can you imagine Aleppo a thousand year old city is still alive today.

30
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.160
It's been bashed about,
you know,

31
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.640
there've been multiple wars and this is just another one to add to its history,

32
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:58.270
but it's a thousand year old city like Damascus's.
Right?

33
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.370
And so it's a really interesting relationship that we have with the,
the,

34
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.740
the consequences that were almost like Italo Calvino the urbanist would say that

35
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.710
humans have left a scar on the city.
Right?

36
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.920
Your relationship with the city has,
has remained.

37
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.090
It's like whatever you did in that city creates the legacy of that city.

38
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.050
And so that's the sort of some of the thoughts that I'm sharing with you through

39
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:23.801
the presentation.

40
00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:27.940
But also the things that I get up to research is really interesting for me

41
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:30.040
because it's,
uh,
it's an opportunity to put a lot of the,

42
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.250
the theoretical models together with the practical,
right?

43
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.130
There's no point in running a business and as a,
you know,
the theory behind it,

44
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:39.520
a lot of people go to university to learn the theory but then don't know how to

45
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:41.560
put it into practice.
And that is the big challenge.

46
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.150
How do you put what you've learned,

47
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.020
like economics into practice when you actually go and leave university.

48
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.280
And then finally when it comes to the relationship that we have with

49
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.980
information,
it's like you can,

50
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.460
I can talk to you until you're blue in the face about certain issues,

51
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:01.210
but I haven't really,
your form of communication,

52
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.830
if you want to learn something,
there are many ways that you learn.

53
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.790
But the way that you learn it is in the context that you know,
right?

54
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.830
If I give you an immersive experience that's going to teach a way more than

55
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.490
something that you would have to theorize before you went into the practice of.

56
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.850
So a big thing for me is how do you engage people in the longer mission with

57
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.620
giving them these sort of immersive experiences.

58
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.840
So the big question is considering we now live in ecosystems and systems and

59
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:36.250
cities and an economic systems that are so interconnected,

60
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520
how do we develop or how might we develop an ecosystem that replenishes planet

61
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.000
earth?
So what do I mean by replenishing,
right?

62
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.610
Replenishing is really being carbon negative.

63
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.750
Like the Prime Minister of Bhutan took sponsoring top gay and his incredible Ted

64
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.740
Talk.
He talks about this idea that he's having a positive,

65
00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:58.270
his country is having a positive impact on the environment.

66
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.260
That means that you're not zeroing out.
It's not like a zero carbon.

67
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.000
I've spent the carbon,
I've now sequestered it.

68
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.350
It's going beyond that so that you've got some sort of regenerative capacity

69
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:09.810
that you're providing planet.
Uh,

70
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.100
it means that you're giving something back in the form.

71
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.810
The earth can actually compose,

72
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.040
like composted and that it has a positive environment,

73
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.270
environmental impact.

74
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.870
So really it's like sustaining the status quo is the way in which a lot of us

75
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.850
for about a good 20 years of being exploring markets and products,

76
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.880
it's like we're going to match that.
We're going to sustain the status quo.

77
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.230
But how can we go beyond that?
It's like,
you know,
if,
if we don't,
from now on,

78
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.490
we make a pledge.
Everything that we buy is 100% compostable.

79
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:49.540
We don't at everything is recyclable.
Nothing goes to landfill sites.
Right?

80
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.600
But what's then going to happen about the Great Pacific gyre?

81
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.440
Who's going to clean that up.
If every country and every citizen in the world,

82
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.320
everyone in the world decides that we're not going to create any more waste,

83
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.730
but who's going to take responsibility for our Global Commons are urban commons,

84
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.230
our communal impact.

85
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.010
That is a legacy that we've inherited and I think this is what I'm trying to get

86
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:10.510
to.
How can you,

87
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.830
how can we get to a point where we create systems naturally,

88
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.910
whether it's to tech tech platforms or physical platforms that can actually give

89
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:22.780
more than we're taking.
So I started to explore,

90
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:27.781
as I mentioned in 2015 around about then what replenish actually meant.

91
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.360
And since then I've been on this huge exploration and I realized to bring back

92
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:37.590
that economics,
right?
Looking at GDP,
which is,
you know,

93
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.600
you can spend money and it will look brilliant on the accounts of a,

94
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.830
of a country like GDP looks brilliant.
Oh,
it's rising,

95
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.190
we're spending a lot of money.
But then these expenditures,
where are they going?

96
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:49.120
What's the impact of them?

97
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.580
I could be spending money on cigarettes that have a negative impact on my
health,

98
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.510
which then somebody else is going to be paying for,

99
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.030
whether it's through national health service or me,
right?

100
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.870
Is the fact that I've spent money on something and there's no judgment here,

101
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.740
you know,

102
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.330
but it's the fact that I've spent money on something then going to relate to a

103
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.640
longer term impact on expenditure,

104
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.580
whether is a lung replacement for like a,

105
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.790
there is actually going to have a negative impact on the health of a person,

106
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.870
but it looks great on GDP because I've spent so much money on cigarettes or

107
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.490
whatever else.
So there's no actual,
um,

108
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.140
ethical or moral or environmental consciousness about that expenditure.

109
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.880
So how do we adjust GDP to also include in the expenditure that it has a

110
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:37.220
positive impact or a negative impact or neutral impact.

111
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.790
And so I wanted to explore that through something called the world's replenish

112
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.683
index.

113
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.750
Imagine if GDP globally was adjusted by every product and service to the

114
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:48.980
environmental impact that it had.

115
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.660
What instead of GDP would you have like a replenish count?
Just like you know,

116
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.410
I'm going to pick up your bottle assuming that it has like a calorie counter at

117
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:56.811
the back of it,

118
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:59.840
which it does and then all of a sudden I'm looking at this plastic bottle and I

119
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:04.070
can have like replenished count,
right?
This product is level five,

120
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:05.540
let's say it's not there yet,

121
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.220
but it's at level five or replenish meaning that your diet for replenish,

122
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.020
like your diet,

123
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.710
it would be for something that you consume was related to the association you

124
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.580
have with replenishing planet earth and that's where I want to get to.

125
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.130
There's a lot of information that I need before I get there.

126
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.380
There's a lot of research that I need to do before I get there,

127
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.820
but that's my mission to try and find a way that we can develop some kind of

128
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:33.440
metric that we could measure how people were positively impacting planet,

129
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.370
planet earth,
and I do this three universities at the moment I've worked,

130
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:39.860
I've been working with a number of Indian universities.

131
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.400
I feel as if if there's one place where I can go to that could,

132
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.990
I could have a big impact.

133
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:49.991
I feel that it's India and the reason for that is 450 million people moving from

134
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.210
villages,
migrating to cities only to find,

135
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:54.590
there's no way that they can go in there,

136
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:57.050
go and live in slums and mostly work in a landfill site.

137
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.760
And I want to stop them from going there.

138
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:03.590
So how do I give them the resources that they need in a way that at the

139
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:06.260
beginning they're living there replenish lifestyle,

140
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:09.980
which is positive impact on planet earth from,
from Gecko,

141
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.490
but how do I connect them up in their rural sort of super remote areas and give

142
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:20.570
them the resources that they need to be able to live a lifestyle that is

143
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:22.580
appropriate for the environment.

144
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.390
A while ago you might've heard of the one planet living lifestyle,
right?

145
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.540
And that's very similar to the way that I'm trying to explore this.

146
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.900
I took some students around the world through a university that I found in 2015

147
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.720
and I started to explore India's 100 smart cities is this huge project that the

148
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:43.910
Indian government has undertaken.
But with the 100 smart cities,

149
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:47.090
it doesn't mean that you got smart citizens.
So when the university asked me,

150
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:51.770
would you explore what a smart city is?
I said,
no,
I don't want to.

151
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.980
I don't believe that you can design a smart city with without designing smart

152
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:59.100
citizens.
It's like the building is smart,
but we're not.

153
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.140
It's like the city is smart,
but we're not.
So the emphasis is on the technology,

154
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.250
not us.
It's not the fact that my consciousness has improved and now I'm,

155
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.440
you know,
really aware of what my building is doing.

156
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.020
I have no intuitive capacity with the building.

157
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.150
I have no relationship with the building.

158
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.420
I am a node inside the building or the city.

159
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.140
I have nothing to do with the city.
The city corrects itself.

160
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.610
The city manages itself.

161
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.090
The city is designed so that it makes its decisions without me.

162
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.960
But I'm the one who's a member of the city and society and community and this

163
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:32.010
company,
let's say,

164
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.460
so what do I have to give as an individual citizen and how is my data being used

165
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.910
to then make those decisions and do I have ownership of that?

166
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.300
I mean these are big questions I think we can't really answer in one session,

167
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:49.890
but one of the questions I really wanted to ask was what is smart citizenship?

168
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.150
If you had an opportunity to design a city,
how would you design it?

169
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.200
If you had an opportunity to live in a particular place,
where would you live?

170
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.480
Why?
Why would you live there?

171
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.010
If you had an opportunity to go further into where your data was going to be

172
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:09.720
used,
picked up,
and then analyze and sold,
shouldn't you get a dividend on that?

173
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.600
And these are sort of broader questions that I've been asking through these

174
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:12.991
courses,

175
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:17.760
but I really wanted to get students to take them out of the university

176
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:21.960
experience and put them into physical spaces where the physical space was

177
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:24.540
teaching them the lesson that I wanted to teach them.
Right?

178
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.540
Instead of giving them a,
uh,
you know,
a lecturer of something.

179
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.680
So one of the things that I ended up doing was taking my students to be Tan.

180
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.440
Or at first they were like,
ma'am,
you're going to take us to Bhutan.

181
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.860
And I was like,
yeah,
I'd like to take you to Bhutan.
They were like,

182
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.050
but it's next to our country.
Why do we have to go there?

183
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:43.230
Why don't you take us to London?
And I said,
let me take you there.

184
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.240
And then we'll explore what Tan really is.
And they were complaining too.

185
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.610
We got to Bhutan and in the end,

186
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:54.660
even though I took them to Masdar city so they can explore Masdar city,

187
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:58.110
I took them to Dubai,
I brought them here in the end,

188
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:00.900
in that one trip I asked them what was your best experience?
And they said,

189
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.600
Tom was.
And I said,
why you didn't want to go there?

190
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.940
And now all of a sudden that's like one of your favorite places.

191
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:08.760
How can they said,
you know,
when we first arrived there,

192
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.150
the one thing that we explored was the fact that they had such beautiful,

193
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:15.870
clean water.
Some of these students had never seen such clean,

194
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.930
natural water in rivers because a lot of that included,
uh,

195
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.520
many of them had never seen a place that sequestered more carbon than they made

196
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.510
because they live next door to it.
But it's just,
it's,
it's like unbelievable.

197
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.900
They run out as soon as I arrived and we all arrived into Baton Rouge Paro

198
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.250
airport,
we're in a bus,
we're going along to like tempo.

199
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.460
The bus stops for some reason,
I'm like snoozing off.

200
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.360
All the kids run off and I'm like,
what's happened?

201
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.570
And I come outside and they're taking selfies with the clear water and I'm

202
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:48.840
thinking,
why are you taking a selfie with the river?
And that's the point.

203
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.320
It was a fact that they had lived such clean air that when I go back to

204
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.510
[inaudible],
which was one of the top two polluted cities in India,

205
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.220
they realize that other things were possible,
right?
The,

206
00:11:59.221 --> 00:12:03.160
I took them equally to Japan and in Japan they realize that what 32 different

207
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:08.080
types of recycling and you've got like clear streets.
I mean who cleans them up?

208
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.660
Well it's the community.
Does the community clears up the streets man.

209
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.630
And I'm like,
yeah,
it's called rent high secondhand.

210
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.780
Every month everyone comes up with a broomstick and they will clean it up and

211
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:19.990
you go to like a Japanese school,
the kids come out once,
you know,
a half an hour,

212
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.500
one hour during the day and then we'll come and clean up the whole school are

213
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:24.910
the pay to do that?
He said no,

214
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.250
you know that they don't have maids and so on to clean it up.
But no,

215
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.690
that was a joke for Dubai.
Um,

216
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.350
sorry.
So then I really wanted,

217
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.770
I sort of explored the research angle of it,

218
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.890
but another thing I really wanted to do was to take some of these students on a

219
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:45.431
longer journey.

220
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:50.431
So I took about six different research projects or related to recycling because

221
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:52.030
I strongly sense that our relationship,

222
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:56.710
not just with the physical environment affecting our brain and changing our

223
00:12:56.711 --> 00:13:01.640
chemistry,
but also if we got them to study the,

224
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.630
the way that,
I don't know if you'd been to India,
if you have your,

225
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.510
you'll understand and agree with me,

226
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:09.910
is that you walk down the street and you're just got piles of rubbish everywhere

227
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.600
and the informal and no one cleans them up and if they do get cleaned up,

228
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.100
they're put in a informal landfill site and you look at that and you think,

229
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:21.970
well you know what kind of normal is this?

230
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.250
What kind of normal is this?
This is the norm.

231
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.060
Meaning every time I walk out that's a blind spot that doesn't exist.

232
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:31.690
What you're talking about,
I can't see anymore because that's become my normal.

233
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.990
And it's interesting because if you were to clean it up for about 30 days,

234
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:38.460
let's say you'd make an imprint of a clean spot and now if there was any
rubbish,

235
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.670
like someone's put some rubbish there.

236
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.140
And it's really interesting how habits are formed through the visual

237
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.060
relationship that we have with cities.

238
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.740
So I wanted to explore that with some of my students and I did that and informal

239
00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:54.700
sector of ways and how,
where it goes,
there was a whole black market of waste,

240
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:56.500
which we picked up on and documented.

241
00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.520
But then what I wanted to do was give them an opportunity and also a lot of the

242
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:05.521
people that lived in and about an opportunity to explore what it meant to be

243
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:10.960
inspired by a fellow Indian,
no,
not a Florida.
No,
not someone that you could say,

244
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:12.340
well they went to Harvard University,

245
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.800
but somebody that could have been a neighbor down the street.

246
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.110
And it was like,
wow,

247
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:23.680
how do I find people that could inspire them and that they could explore what it

248
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:27.130
meant to be an Indian living in today's India.

249
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.040
But those who are actually challenging the same things that they were living

250
00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:31.930
through,
but ignoring.
And that was a blind spot.

251
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.020
So I picked some incredible people.
I don't know if you remember,

252
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.430
there was a documentary recently where the ad will spoons,
you know,

253
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:42.020
like national geographic did like the ad spoons and you know,

254
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.240
I many be like single use plastics that we use.
But this guy came along said,

255
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.450
forget throwing in a more way,
let's make them edible.

256
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.630
And so we created these lento based,
um,
you know,

257
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.760
spoons and things so that people could actually eat with.
And so I,
you know,

258
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.330
we invited him over to be one of the speakers and I kind of wanted a ted style,

259
00:14:59.480 --> 00:14:59.691
you know,

260
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.320
inspirational 20 minutes that you can explore what have I done with some of the

261
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:04.430
biggest challenges of India.

262
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.230
And that was the first talk series that we created in January,

263
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.380
followed by,
uh,
make a fast.
So,
you know,

264
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:16.130
we really want you to go into the grassroots innovation and bring that out.

265
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.900
So really,
um,

266
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.760
one of my inspirations from childhood has been Sir David Attenborough.

267
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.770
I don't know if you remember,
if you make from England,

268
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:27.580
you might remember his voice and it was the,
you know,

269
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.700
he's documenting the way that people live,
planet earth.
You know it,

270
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:35.420
he'll talk about like the story and the narrative behind the way that this

271
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.540
animal is doing this and look at the way that he is and the reason why he's

272
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:42.230
doing it.
And,
and it was this beautiful narrative,
planet earth.

273
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.110
But I really,
I,

274
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.050
I completely get what he's saying here and that is that no one will protect what

275
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:52.010
they don't care about and no one will care about what they have never

276
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.670
experienced.
So how do we create this physical experiences?

277
00:15:55.671 --> 00:16:00.050
Because I think an education and an expert says not just in the head,
right?

278
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.420
If it were,
then I'll just give you,
you know,

279
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:06.440
some kind of augmented reality or virtual reality and you live there and I'm

280
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:10.280
sure you'll get some physical repercussions of that relationship too.

281
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.670
So one of the things that we ended up doing in Goa this year was to question,

282
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.390
where can your height waist?
Is it that on earth?
You can put it,

283
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:25.310
I put it on your desk and the lady says,
no,
kind of put it in your room.
I mean,

284
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:27.860
you're the one who bought it.
You keep it.
Not my responsibility.

285
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.830
Why are you getting it?
Giving it to me?
No,
I'm not going to keep it in my room.

286
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:32.060
Why not?
It's yours.

287
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.900
So if you were to live with your waste for one week in your room,

288
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.380
in your bedroom,
like turn around,
where would you go?

289
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.680
But how long could you live with your own waste?
Right.

290
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.160
And it's interesting because if I were to put all of my ways and a mountain,

291
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.460
right,
I don't know how big that mountain would be and I,
I've started to realize,

292
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.150
oh my God,
where is that going?
So where are we hiding our waste?

293
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.980
And so that is a question.

294
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.940
We then put a whole installation together and the Indian government was really

295
00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:01.910
impressed with it.
They asked us,
can we make it a permanent installation?

296
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:06.890
So they gave us a,
a shipping container and then we painted it all black.

297
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:11.810
We put these incredible UV sort of,
uh,
using black lights,
sort of paints.

298
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:15.920
And uh,
and then we took them on a mini journey around this installation.

299
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.780
And the point of it was,
what is a seahorse doing,
holding a straw?

300
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.640
It's was like,
why are the plastics in the ocean?
Who does he belong to?

301
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.600
And then as you go through,
there's like a very kitty's,
you know,

302
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:33.270
kitty friendly and adult friendly sort of dialogue that we create with people as

303
00:17:33.271 --> 00:17:34.790
they're going through the installation.

304
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.690
Got to a point at the back where they had all of these beautiful,
um,
you know,

305
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.370
a jellyfish and they're just jellyfish,
right?
And you're looking at the bad,
wow.

306
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:46.360
The kids are like,
they're jellyfish and like,
are you sure the jellyfish,

307
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.640
the jellyfish?
And then I'm like,
wrong.
And like you,

308
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:54.420
this turtle has no idea that that is not a jellyfish.
It's a plastic bag.

309
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.680
And so it was really this opportunity that I had to question the plastics,

310
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:00.850
but through the lifestyles that we're living,
and I,

311
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.710
I think just on the right hand side of this picture,
you'll get to see like this,

312
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.670
the shrine that I put together for all of the different kinds of plastics that

313
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:11.340
anyone could have had.
So then turned to them and said,
oh,

314
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.140
is this your plastic bag?
I don't know.
Could it be,
could it be mine?
You know,

315
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.190
is that your store?

316
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.240
And then to sort of explore this dialogue of plastics and plastic diet,

317
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.770
it's like a plastic footprint.

318
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.650
And then the other thing that I really wanted to explore through this

319
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.530
installation was microplastics.
We talk about,
you know,

320
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:32.070
plastics being in the ecosystem,
but are we consuming that plastic too?

321
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.750
And there is research in so many different countries now,
India as well.

322
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.730
That's shocking and scares me.

323
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.010
So what he said was that scientists cannot find a single sample of water around

324
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:52.110
the world that doesn't have plastic inside it.

325
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.620
Now what's really interesting and most of our water bodies are completely

326
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:58.230
connected in most of our water bodies.

327
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.740
A lot of that plastic comes together and that's where we've got these big,

328
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.640
like Ellen Macarthur has traveled around the world and found out that there's

329
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:08.430
huge garbage patches,
which are the size of,
you know,

330
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.970
countries like there's one the size of France floating about and there's no sun

331
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:15.870
that goes through to photosynthesize.
Um,
you know,
the,
the algae.

332
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.550
But what's really fascinating for me is that microplastic that breakdown our

333
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:22.330
founder night,
the underwater,

334
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.640
but they're also found in the animals now also found in us.

335
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.630
What's that stage where the plastic that we're putting out in the world comes

336
00:19:30.631 --> 00:19:32.690
back and hits us into our stomachs.

337
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.910
I wonder if there is a way that now we can actually start analyzing how many

338
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:36.990
plastics exist in us.

339
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.110
There's a bit of a grim story I suppose and the Times of India picked up on it

340
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:40.944
and said that,
you know,

341
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.430
there's some things that we should be able to sort of communicate through an

342
00:19:44.431 --> 00:19:49.170
installation.
The Hindustan waste plant is put that installation on their ground.

343
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.010
So if any of you are ever going to go or you are welcome to go and visit it,

344
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.530
but the point of the insulation wasn't,
Oh my God,

345
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:58.080
plastics are taking over the world.
It was,

346
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.500
what are the three things that you can do now that you walk out of here that can

347
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:03.010
have a huge impact for planet earth.

348
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.350
One of them say no to plastic bags like single use plastic bags with straws.

349
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.070
Right.
Get it.
Get your own store and just like when you're about to audio food,

350
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:13.790
and I've got preferences,
I don't like onions,
let's say.
Then you,

351
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.280
you tell people don't hear you say a order that pizza without onions please.

352
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.680
In the same way ordered my drink without a plastic straw.

353
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.500
And now that I've started doing that,

354
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:24.090
and I remember there was a cafe down the street from the installation,

355
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.030
people would look at me and say,
you don't want a straw.
I said,
do you know what?

356
00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:30.920
Do me a favor.
Don't give anyone this week a straw,
but keep them there.

357
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.820
Keep the stores there,
but don't give it to them.
If they ask for it,

358
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.840
they know where to find it.

359
00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:39.780
So that's like one step that you could take that reduces the amount of plastic.

360
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.710
But also instead of having multiple plastic bottles for water,

361
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.190
how about if you had one refillable water right?

362
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.890
And one of those big containers that you can actually just refill instead of

363
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:54.010
having plastic bottles and every single day,
I don't know how much,

364
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.020
how many of these plastic bottles we seem to be consuming.

365
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.770
So at the point of it wasn't how awful are we guilt tripping them,

366
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:01.360
but actually getting them to a point of saying,

367
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:04.870
well what can I do now that I can cancel it tangibly take that away.

368
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.580
So now moving into this whole idea of dialogue,

369
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.070
a lot of the communication that we've been given is a,

370
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.920
I find traumatizing makes me feel awful.

371
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.520
Or it just want to like climb underneath the blanket and cry.

372
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.620
But what do we do to have this conversation?
How do we get there?

373
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.120
This is like,
imagine if every,

374
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:33.150
every single person on planet earth could have a replenish lifestyle could

375
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:38.710
actually benefit planet earth in some way.
So it's a dual thing.

376
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.060
Number one is how do we have that dialogue?
I mean,

377
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.360
I don't know if any of you have been recipients of trolling online,

378
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:50.500
but I have and it feels horrible.
You know,
it's like,
why are you doing this?

379
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:54.520
And you know,
never had me and you got an opinion on who I am as a person.

380
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.440
But that kind of dialogue and the relationship that we have with one another I

381
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:01.540
think is really important.
It's a margin.

382
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:03.380
If like we're sitting at dinner and three of you,

383
00:22:03.381 --> 00:22:06.250
you've got your phones out and your mom sitting there and saying,

384
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:07.300
well put your phones away.

385
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.950
Most of the conversation we should have had at the beginning to then get to a

386
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:16.060
point where at dinner agreed negotiations over here,

387
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:20.320
we're compromising on this table.
We're not going to have phones.
Fine,
cool.

388
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.860
Do it before the after,
but not at the dinner table.

389
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.180
Now that you've had this conversation,
that is like the foundation,

390
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.860
the process that you're going to use for that dialogue.

391
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.670
That is important for a lot of the technology that is coming into our lives.

392
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.230
So in the same way,
a lot of like 4.0 um,

393
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.510
so many different kinds of technologies are actually on market.

394
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.110
But is there a point where we need to learn how to best dialogue with each other

395
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.310
to form some social parameters,
some kind of,
you know,

396
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.690
conversations,

397
00:22:52.691 --> 00:22:57.220
nonviolent communication that can actually get us on par with where we need to

398
00:22:57.221 --> 00:23:01.420
go next and how do we have that conversation.
So,
um,

399
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.340
I tried to say the beginning of this year,

400
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.370
I came together with Dx labs based in San Francisco.

401
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:07.780
They work with singularity as well.

402
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.530
And one of the things that I really wanted to do was write an article,

403
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.150
a story about what would happen if you lived with a neuro link,
if you,

404
00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:21.130
if you,
let's say where I'm completely online with brain.

405
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.500
I mean a lot of that technology has,
has,

406
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:26.620
has come into some sort of research laboratories and,
and I,

407
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.850
I kind of imagined what it would feel like to have a brain machine interface,

408
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.480
but instead of getting to the point where having opinions for some reasons,

409
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:37.840
stories,
like really cool stories like psych,

410
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:42.640
find stories and videos and movies can allow us to ask those questions in a safe

411
00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:44.860
space.
So I started to,

412
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.120
to write and on a medium I wrote this post replenish the convergence of AI and

413
00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:54.020
ecology.
And there's two parts and I'd love to know what you thought about it.

414
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:58.970
But what was for me really intriguing is that there comes a point where

415
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.280
technology and nature merge the margin.
You know,
you might,

416
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.870
you might know meow meow who's got like a biometric scanner in his arm.

417
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.430
And then he sort of uploads the data.

418
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.020
So we're coming to that point of quantified self.
I've got a fitbit fitbit on me.

419
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.710
You know,

420
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.060
we're getting to that point where we're merging with tech and at that point,

421
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.430
at what point at,
yeah,

422
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.470
where do we become the technology that we're also introducing into our lives?

423
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.430
And it's a really interesting question for me because imagine if the whole of

424
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:32.930
our brain was uploaded onto the internet and that brain could then be analyzed

425
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.310
and your thoughts analyze and whatever kind of interesting behaviors we had

426
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.340
could in some way even be controlled or manipulated.

427
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.960
But if we had an opportunity to actually enhance that and put that forward,

428
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.270
we can have a dialogue about it.
Where would we,
where would that dialogue go?

429
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.950
But also about the sort of the automation,
I think of life,

430
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.680
the automation of a lot of the challenges that we've got.

431
00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.190
Where do we get to a point where that automation becomes with or without the

432
00:25:00.621 --> 00:25:03.890
direction that we're giving it?
Here's,
uh,

433
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.200
some of the research that we did on the whole brain,

434
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.380
but also like where would we put that technology and having conversations about

435
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:09.770
it.

436
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:14.270
And it's been really interesting to explore this technology through the lens of

437
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:16.850
an individual who would say,
I would never have something like that done.

438
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.850
But to explore it through a story is much easier.

439
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.610
And so to have that conversation,
even though it's not real,

440
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.990
it's almost easier for people to sort of interact with.
So we talked about,

441
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.960
you know,
uh,
industry 4.0 and entering the market,

442
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:34.190
but are also when it comes to the sustainable development goals that the United

443
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.210
Nations had launched was how much is this industry worth?

444
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.560
Should we really bother about it?
And the wife was actually put,
uh,

445
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:44.480
some two point 5 trillion on it.

446
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.170
I think the next step is really to understand where we can go with that.

447
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.190
If you had two point $5 trillion of a budget towards this,

448
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.880
where would we direct our research?
What kind of businesses would we create?

449
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.620
What kind of cities would we design?

450
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.810
So some of the work that I've been doing here has been in,

451
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.080
I mentioned like the,
the golf benchmark on energy.

452
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.600
What that then led to was uh,

453
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:15.650
an article I think in the Gulf with the national that was too cold for comfort,

454
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.340
actual physical buildings being way too cold and people getting ill from them.

455
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.110
And that was where the National Bank of Abu Dhabi,

456
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:24.980
some of the work that I've done and trying to explore whether it should be a top

457
00:26:24.981 --> 00:26:26.390
down or a bottom up approach,

458
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.800
where are the smart cities taking us and where do we have an opportunity to be

459
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:35.300
part of that.
There was a project that I did with the premier of South Australia,

460
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.660
a jai row and it was really about understanding what does carbon negative mean

461
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.730
or carbon neutral made and where can we push the boundaries of that.
So it's,

462
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.840
it's interesting because

463
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.850
whoever we are are based on the experiences that we've had.

464
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.600
But when we start to combine our knowledge and experiences,

465
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.430
we almost actualize a community of knowledge,
like a collaboration.

466
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.110
But it's like going beyond that.
That's really interesting to understand.
Like,

467
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:07.470
how do we get to a point where we can really explore all of our learnings

468
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:10.320
together through this?
And,
and with that,
our fears,

469
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.270
and this really goes back to a very interesting project in the UK,

470
00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:18.640
which a friend of mine has got,
his name is Simon Gosling.
Um,

471
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.940
and he's exploring what smart means.

472
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:24.990
So he brings people into this future home and explores the dialogues that is

473
00:27:24.991 --> 00:27:28.590
having with them.
So if you're ever in London,
I'd love to introduce you to him.

474
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.750
And this is a very small project that I've got with about 300 villages

475
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:38.520
surrounding Suta,
which is one of the fastest growing cities in India.

476
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.750
But as you can see,
one of the big projects of India is,
uh,
others gum,

477
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.440
which is about that kind of ideal village and exploring what that means,

478
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:47.390
even though,
you know,

479
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.830
you walk down the street and you've got these piles and piles of rubbish.

480
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:54.150
So how do we take this whole replenish philosophy and plug it into the rural

481
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:59.010
sector and actually help people to transition to that kind of a lifestyle.

482
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.410
Um,
another thing that I did recently was in Brazil where we had,

483
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.390
we celebrated a whole week of zero waste and one of the most exciting things

484
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:11.391
that I saw was an actual supermarket that is 96% and it's a massive supermarket

485
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.290
Asif market that is 96% zero waste.
And you know,
we,

486
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.320
we developed and designed some ideas for Lisbon being a zero waste city.

487
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.570
But I think we're at that almost at that point where a lot of cities and a lot

488
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:32.571
of companies are taking on much more practical levels of appreciating and

489
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:35.280
translating this kind of philosophy.

490
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.430
So you can find out more about me on our newsletter.

491
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.450
I normally kind of post any new bits or a new piece of information that I

492
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:43.640
collect.
Um,

493
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.340
the next steps for me really are consolidating about 10 years worth of travel

494
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.220
and understanding what,
what is next.

495
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.670
Like if we were to introduce this whole economic paradigm,

496
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:59.610
like the world replenish index and you had at the back of your bottles and

497
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:01.950
everything that you consumed or replenish indicator,

498
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:05.730
would you live a replenish diet?
Like,
and,

499
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.380
and how much of that would be your lifestyle?
You know,
how,
let's say I'm Vegan,

500
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.290
right?
But I'm Vegan in my diet,
not my lifestyle.

501
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.130
How would I translate the Vegan to the lifestyle as well?

502
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.930
How do I translate this lifestyle into something that is appropriate for planet

503
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.240
earth?
Some exploring these things.

504
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:28.440
I was really grateful to have shared some of my work with you.
Uh,

505
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:31.500
but also some of the challenges and the questions that are leading me in the

506
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:32.580
vision that I've got for it.

507
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.870
I really hope that in maybe 10 to 20 years time,

508
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:42.110
we can look back and say that the planet that we live on is an ecosystem that

509
00:29:42.191 --> 00:29:43.024
we're part of,

510
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.160
but it's an ecosystem that were together with that we can work together on

511
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.600
creating a replenish earth or replenishing lifestyle from.

512
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.860
I think there's this,
these ideas almost of like,
you know,

513
00:29:56.861 --> 00:30:00.940
moving away from the challenges of living in a life,
a lifestyle like this,
but,

514
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.860
and maybe it's going backwards,
you know,

515
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:05.980
going to live in a village in India is not necessarily the challenge,

516
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.070
but exploring those things in the cities.
And the buildings and the,

517
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.360
the companies that we live and work in.
So thank you very much for your time.

518
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.730
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

519
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:26.110
<v 1>the floor is yours.
Any questions please?
Yes.
Hi.</v>

520
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.090
<v 3>Thank you.
Thank you for coming.</v>

521
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.890
Very inspiring story and project to working on.
Thank you.

522
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.200
My question is it all of this I've learned,

523
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:38.740
this is a fascinating challenge because from one side,

524
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.790
our actions as an individual was individually impact,

525
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.080
negatively land,
earth,

526
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.400
but we don't treat the benefits unless we act collectively either at the local

527
00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:53.380
level or at the country level or even at an earth,

528
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.560
which makes our action.
The in fact,

529
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.140
the mold from the option that we do as individual and breaking the special with

530
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.160
this vicious cycle of us doing good actions and seeing the benefit is very

531
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:12.550
critical now that are a lot of government action from a regulation point of
view,

532
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:17.300
which I did around effective or not subject to what it takes and the economy.
Oh,

533
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:22.250
great.
Comics and technology clearly has some,
um,

534
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.570
uh,
efficiency promise for companies.

535
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.880
But I know what you mentioned about raping,

536
00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:32.881
get to an individual lesson and having the index on every water or an FD

537
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.903
broader.

538
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.020
So my question for you is that when we see a gallery or an organic label

539
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.150
[inaudible] for individually path of,

540
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.680
when we see a labor,

541
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.140
we cannot relate the two hour individually when being,

542
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.110
unless everyone has sign up for it.

543
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:58.950
How do you think are the most interesting ideas and the most effective one in

544
00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:04.390
relating more this index or seminar labors to individually when the intangible

545
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.180
<v 1>that's such a,</v>

546
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.200
it's such an interesting way of seeing it and I'm really grateful that you

547
00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:15.310
brought this to our attention because I think that individual,
almost like a,

548
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:16.660
you know,
per capita income,

549
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:19.810
who cares about per capita income apart from the fact that I'm part of this

550
00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:23.800
economy,
right?
Per capita income.
It's got nothing to do with me personally.

551
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:28.570
It's what the government is actually assigning to the wellbeing financially of

552
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:30.250
this member who lives in this country.

553
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.620
So this is a very interesting concept because now it identifies who I am as an

554
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:39.380
individual,
right?
The fact that I'm a Vegan,
it's got nothing to do with else.

555
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:40.214
And this,
if we're going to go,

556
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.100
I'd tell everybody they should stop eating meat because it hasn't a negative

557
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:47.840
impact on the environment.
But I could have a lifestyle that is completely wrong.

558
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.720
And that's really interesting because now with data,

559
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.410
just like you would do with your smart phone data and what you're consuming on

560
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:58.760
an individual level,
imagine if that data backed up who you were as a person.

561
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.760
China's introducing already this social indexing,
right?

562
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.240
Imagine if each person had some kind of even account that could bring them

563
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:11.660
credit for doing certain things.

564
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.580
And it may be that turned into money like a monetary taxation,
right?

565
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:20.570
That you didn't have to pay because,
hey,
I,
you don't need to collect my rubbish.

566
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.800
I don't have any.

567
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:26.780
So now like it turns this whole idea of civic,
right?

568
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.760
This whole community communal.
If,
if I,
let's say in China for example,

569
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:36.200
that,
um,
the hospital that is all about preventative health,

570
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.010
right?

571
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:41.270
It's not about how many chemicals and you know medicines can I have now that

572
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:45.020
I've got ill,
but it's how do I stop you from getting ill in the first place?

573
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.750
I think that's the kind of approach that we need to take for planet earth.

574
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.760
How do we stop her getting ill in the first place and how in on an individual

575
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:57.440
scale can we incentivize individuals that we are part of that global ecosystem.

576
00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.200
This is the biggest challenge because if you can crack that,

577
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.560
you cracked it all cause on that individual level you need to know how much

578
00:34:06.201 --> 00:34:09.640
you've done.
I'm selfish,
you know,
if I've,

579
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.120
if I spent more money on creating maybe a leed platinum building or whatever

580
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:18.530
rating system per five,
I want to get some benefit from that.

581
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.900
And that might be an ego thing,
right?

582
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:23.240
But it depends on the consciousness of the individual.
Perhaps.

583
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.370
I don't need you to tell me that I've done well.

584
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:29.240
So it depends on the person and the community at the time of how that

585
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:31.250
incentivization scheme could work.

586
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.200
But I could totally see that some kind of economic benefits,

587
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:39.860
tariffs,
quotas that you could meet.
The could actually would use,

588
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.490
not just the global sort of parameters,
but a local parameter.

589
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.490
Imagine in the UK we've got like the Bristol pound,

590
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.760
you know we've got currency in a certain locale.

591
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.380
Now that I've got the purchase path,

592
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.600
the Bristol pound and the British pound or equal,

593
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:57.110
they are equally used in Bristol.

594
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.230
But the fact that I've now got to local currency means that my current who

595
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:02.480
remains within Bristol because it can't be used in London.

596
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:07.160
So it's like a localization of a global issue.

597
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.730
I don't know if that really answered your question.

598
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:12.620
I wasn't meaning to answer the question,

599
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:16.220
but add a few more thoughts to it because I don't think anyone's got the answer.

600
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.153
<v 4>Yes,</v>

601
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.180
<v 1>I am not at the moment.
I'm trying.
So for example,
I don't eat meat.</v>

602
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.490
I don't eat fish.
That's one thing that I'm trying to do.

603
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.600
The second thing is I don't buy anything anymore.
I borrow things instead.

604
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.270
So instead of buying more things,
like if you go into my home,

605
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:50.010
I've got all these box,
I don't know what to do with them.

606
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.940
And so what I'm doing is like giving those books away,
trying to understand like,

607
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.120
okay,
if I want to acquire knowledge,
how best do I do that?

608
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:01.410
So I'm picking different aspects of my lifestyle and exploring what I can do.

609
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.430
So for example,
with replenishing,
I'm finding ways that I can sequester.

610
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.540
Where can I perhaps not have a straw?
So through my behavior,

611
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.830
I'm trying to figure out how I can live a much more negative carbon negative

612
00:36:13.831 --> 00:36:16.050
lifestyle.
But also what are the metrics?

613
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:20.610
Like if you look at some of the carbon sequestration metrics,
it's like,
Oh,

614
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:23.510
if we put,
if we plant another five trees and we're going to get the no,

615
00:36:23.511 --> 00:36:26.100
we're not because our twin five praise that you've taken down,

616
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:27.510
or a full fledglings,

617
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.950
the completely grown and the sequestering capacity is not the same as like a

618
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:32.784
sapling.

619
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.150
And these are some of the kinds of questions that I'm asking not only myself,

620
00:36:36.151 --> 00:36:39.720
but exploring through new products are on the market.
And exploring,
Hey,

621
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.260
these are the alternatives.
So through my own learnings,

622
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:47.400
I'm posting a lot of that through our Facebook group so that when I'm learning

623
00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:49.170
something I'm like,
wow,
that's really cool.

624
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:53.040
I don't expect to be carbon neutral or negative today.

625
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.280
I expect to be there transitioning to it with a mindful step by step process.

626
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.770
It's like you know from now from one step to the other,

627
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:03.480
you're probably not going to become a nonsmoker,

628
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.330
but you're probably going to take measures to sort of reduce the amount of

629
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.310
impact of certain chemicals that you might have or you might go,
you know,

630
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.610
towards a natural tobacco.

631
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:15.780
Let's say that there are different measures that you can take for it.

632
00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.170
<v 4>Where's she from?</v>

633
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.590
And I think you or your cause is probably one of the noblest answers to the why.

634
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.890
I'll see most scenic areas.
Thanks for sharing.
Thank you.

635
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.990
Alan Musk and his work.
He knows two things and I think they're completing.

636
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:39.880
One is trying to make life on the blend better with solar power and solar

637
00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:44.230
powered cars and on the other end trying to start a colony in Mars,

638
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.130
sort of a safety net for encased land.
They didn't work.

639
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.770
What do you think of that safety net?

640
00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.820
<v 1>I find it really interesting.</v>

641
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.970
So he was in Adelaide at the same time that I was there,

642
00:37:54.971 --> 00:37:56.590
but it was promoting this whole,
you know,

643
00:37:56.591 --> 00:38:00.010
cause we had a huge blackout in South Australia because of that.

644
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.020
Through a little Twitter sort of understanding.

645
00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.860
There was this huge pot at that came about and being,
and I think that these,

646
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.760
I'm going to call them hairy ambitious goals,
right?

647
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.290
Going carbon negative or neutral is a hairy,

648
00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:14.020
ambitious goal and we've got it all pig.
Like you know,

649
00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.950
plug in different bits of knowledge and information to understand what the whole

650
00:38:17.951 --> 00:38:18.784
elephant looks like.

651
00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.030
It's like I'm blind but I can feel like the eyelashes of the,
of the elephant.

652
00:38:22.031 --> 00:38:25.570
So it's brick coming together and knowing that is what the elephant is.

653
00:38:25.571 --> 00:38:29.080
That's one on his mission to Mars.
I think,
you know,

654
00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.120
I can take it like are you trying to run away?
You know,
like the,

655
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.000
you know that movie,
uh,
what's the name of that movie?

656
00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:39.880
Would that robot that lives on planet earth and he's like packaging up like the

657
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:43.810
waist and put them,
imagine if like Wally,

658
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:46.960
we 50 years time we're getting to a point where,
you know,

659
00:38:46.961 --> 00:38:49.270
we are living the [inaudible] lifestyle,

660
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.710
getting fat on some sort of hovering device and just like pinging each other on

661
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:57.520
the whatever Facebook,
you know,
a device we're going to be using.

662
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:02.740
And I think we can either take it that way or we could look at it as a hairy

663
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:05.710
goal.
Are we going to get somewhere?

664
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.360
If we were to redirect our attention to something that we could actually do and

665
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:13.510
if we could actually do that,
what then can we actually do here?

666
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.050
And I think there is maybe a,
um,

667
00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.400
a small number of crazy people I think is one of them,

668
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.290
but crazy in a good way.

669
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.790
It's like saying that is a challenge that I didn't think we can do or can we?

670
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.020
And I think more than anything,
I take that as a learning that it,
my God,

671
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.000
if you can get to Mars,
what can't we do here?

672
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.840
And perhaps his whole Mars mission is like,

673
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.820
I'm going to put the money towards it because I can afford it.
He says,

674
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.110
but it's not to do that.

675
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:43.990
It's to bring our attention to the fact that if we were to spend time and money

676
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:48.940
on making a better,
we probably wouldn't want to go there or maybe we would want,

677
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:51.400
we'd want to go and explore it.
Just like you know,
going to the,

678
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.150
going to the moon was like,
we're going to go to the moon in 10 years time.

679
00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:57.730
We want to get to the moon as the fact that we had 10 years' time.

680
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.650
It was a confined time period.

681
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:04.000
It was a huge task and that many people had to come together to to achieve that.

682
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.500
It's like Steve Jobs 10 years ago brings out this platform called the iPhone.

683
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.790
No one's ever heard of a smart phone before.
It's like what?

684
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.320
But he didn't do it alone.

685
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.210
He created something that came from an ecosystem of all of this military in

686
00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:20.290
academic research that has gone into making the iPhone possible and I think this

687
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:23.300
is where someone like Elon Musk is who liked me.

688
00:40:23.301 --> 00:40:26.080
He travels around the world and doesn't really have a home because planet earth

689
00:40:26.081 --> 00:40:31.081
is home and it's like how do you create some kind of association to these kinds

690
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:35.440
of challenges that we globally need to be aware of.
I remember this conversation,

691
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:38.440
I've kind of taking a bit of a tangent,
but I hope you'll appreciate it.

692
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.300
I sat next to the Garden Nanda,
we were having a cup of tea and she says,
Tia,

693
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.900
I didn't really care what happens in China,
what sustainability,
and I said,

694
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.060
you don't care about what happens in China.
I want you to go home,

695
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:54.070
turn everything around.
Having look at the maiden and tell me how,

696
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:56.620
what percentage of your things come from where?
She said,

697
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.240
I did that 60% I said,
do you or do you not have,

698
00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:04.090
even if it's just economic,
do you or do you not have a relationship with China?

699
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:08.790
Then
does your demand for these things,
whether you like it or not,

700
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:09.900
and there are no alternatives,

701
00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:13.020
perhaps have something to do with what happens in China.

702
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.060
And I think this is what it is.

703
00:41:15.061 --> 00:41:19.440
How can we make it visible but not make people feel guilty from it?

704
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.670
And that's the challenge.

705
00:41:20.671 --> 00:41:25.671
How do we positively reinforce with alternatives and fun innovations and cool

706
00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:31.320
ways of doing it?
And I think maybe he's a bit bonkers.
Who am I to judge?

707
00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.930
<v 4>Thanks
so on.
The</v>

708
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.470
humans are like a selfless,

709
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.180
<v 1>oh the selfish gene by Richard Dawkins.
Here we go.</v>

710
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.740
<v 4>We were willing to be addicted to things rather where I think doing good and if</v>

711
00:41:51.741 --> 00:41:54.980
it makes me feel good to throw away a plastic spoon,

712
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I don't have to wash it there.
How are you going to,

713
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.540
once people have tasted the goodness right now,

714
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.730
how are you going to get them away from?

715
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.800
If they might argue that I'm not really in my life,

716
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:14.470
I'm going to see the consequences of what I'm doing?
That's a really good point.

717
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.550
<v 1>I say one thing definitely.
Who seeded that idea in your head?</v>

718
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.790
<v 4>Personal experience.
It</v>

719
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.820
<v 1>could be personal experience,
but it could be anyone,
right?
At any stage,</v>

720
00:42:26.821 --> 00:42:31.821
somebody in society or through a subconscious messaging has gotten us,

721
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.230
me included,
to believe something that is the case.
There is no status quo.

722
00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.120
Therefore everything can be questioned the way that we live.
For example,

723
00:42:42.121 --> 00:42:46.380
I learned this when I was in Japan.
I remember coming from England,
22 years old,

724
00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.810
just finished my university degree,
arrive into Japan.
They say,

725
00:42:48.811 --> 00:42:53.580
this is wrong in England.
Okay?
I'm taking one example.
In England,

726
00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:55.560
when you sitting next to somebody that you don't know at the bus stop,

727
00:42:55.561 --> 00:42:58.890
you start talking about the weather,
so you'd normally talk about how shit it is.

728
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.290
You're like,
oh,
the weather's really bad,
isn't it?
And somebody tells you.

729
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:04.270
I was like,
yeah,
God.
It's been raining all day,

730
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.560
but could be good as well because what does really good today?
Oh,
oh,
it's lovely,

731
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.640
but second excuse to have a chat with somebody.
Well,

732
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:15.600
I went to Japan and I started to use the negative to open up dialogue and it

733
00:43:15.601 --> 00:43:20.220
didn't work.
I was like,
Whoa,
I'm not being negative.
It's just some.

734
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.270
And then I realized the way that I do things isn't necessarily right in another

735
00:43:24.271 --> 00:43:27.870
culture,
another place of the world,
and another conversation.
It doesn't,

736
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:31.200
just because one way is right doesn't mean another way as well too.

737
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:37.670
And I think that's a very interesting psychological waiting or anchoring that

738
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.850
we've all been exposed to.
If you go back to,

739
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.070
I think it was a 1950s and sixties,

740
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.610
Edward Bernays was one of the most incredible PR agents at the time.

741
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.560
What he did,
Marlboro Smoking Company,
uh,
went to him and said,

742
00:43:52.561 --> 00:43:54.630
we don't have any women's smokers.
What do we do about it?

743
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.220
He went and did some research.

744
00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.810
He found out that women felt a certain way about smoking and putting this stick

745
00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:02.700
into the mouth was something that they didn't want to do.

746
00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.190
So then he explored how the relationship and the,

747
00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:12.360
and the sort of branding behind it,
right,
but explored what did it mean for them,

748
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:17.810
explored the meaning and how we could shift that meaning and made an incredible

749
00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:18.744
difference.

750
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.260
He hired 10 beautiful women the beginning of a march for female freedom,

751
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.910
gave them all cigarettes,
lit them up,
call the press,

752
00:44:26.911 --> 00:44:28.050
took some photographs and boom.

753
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.940
Did that one event have a huge impact on the that females were smoking

754
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:35.760
cigarettes for.
It's really interesting for me,

755
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:39.690
but the way that we influence people and it's psychological messaging that we

756
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:41.220
give them,
whether it's commercials,

757
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.040
whether it's data that we analyze and and show.

758
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.590
I think a lot of that intention has been set by someone or something,

759
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.590
mostly for reasons of their own causes.
Right.

760
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.310
I'm going to try and sell you a Cocacola Cola can,
no matter what I can do,

761
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.570
even if I'm stepping on a Pepsi can
in an advert.

762
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.560
But I know and you know that it's got like huge amounts of sugar and a chemical

763
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:09.060
that stops my mouth exploring that there is too much sugar in my mouth.

764
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.290
Is that fair or not fair?
Well it's not,
uh,
it's FDA approved.
Okay,
fine.

765
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:17.790
So it's really interesting how a lot of that research now at all of our

766
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:21.840
experimentation has allowed to us maybe becoming more conscious about certain

767
00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:24.090
things or not.
And I don't think anything is written.

768
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.510
I think we have an opportunity to explore everything.

769
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.690
Like a teacher that I used to have in one of my classes when I was younger,

770
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.050
she used to say,
well that's just the way that it is.
And I'm saying,
well,

771
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.560
I don't think so.
What's up inside me tells me it's not that way.

772
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.500
But she would often say,
well that's just the way that it is.
So it's,

773
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:46.230
it's interesting if you were to explore another way of being another language,

774
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.400
another narrative,
another identity.
And you had no holes barred,

775
00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.683
<v 4>who would you be?</v>

776
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.930
<v 1>Hmm.
Anyone,
sorry.
Sorry.</v>

777
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.070
Um,
what did the time go?

778
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.730
I was a very interested in the index.

779
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:12.460
You wearing that when you talk to a,
I don't know,

780
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.300
or um,

781
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.500
or even anyone in ecosystem that this,

782
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.370
that a country in the world that a,
this is interested in doing these.

783
00:46:24.371 --> 00:46:29.330
Is it something that was completely of going to happen and we're going to be

784
00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:31.550
done also not wanting this to happen

785
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.070
all of a sudden just school.
So what's the state of this?

786
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.680
It's a really good question.
So Bhutan this year launched the Gnh business.

787
00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:48.350
Butan introduced the Gross National Happiness index in the 1970s and wanted to

788
00:46:48.351 --> 00:46:52.250
understand what if the economy wasn't about money,
but it was about wellbeing.

789
00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.700
And so they started to explore this whole wellbeing.
And in 19,

790
00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:00.680
I think it was 19 seventy's own woods is when every three years,

791
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.030
all of this data was collected to show what was the state of wellbeing and their

792
00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:08.540
country.
And then what they did was to explore.

793
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:12.140
I happen this report and I think you may be aware that many other countries

794
00:47:12.141 --> 00:47:13.820
around the world have been looking at wellbeing,

795
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:16.100
a British government being one of them.

796
00:47:16.101 --> 00:47:19.670
The UAE has been talking about wellbeing as well.
Happiness ministers.

797
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:23.000
Very interesting sort of understanding appreciation of wellbeing.

798
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:27.740
Another thing that they've recently launched last year,
a couple of years ago,

799
00:47:27.741 --> 00:47:31.900
they did the gross national seven conference or set the conference this year it

800
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:33.550
was the seventh and they said,

801
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:38.500
what if businesses were also aligned with this?
And I said,
okay,

802
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:41.830
well you get to be introducing this to businesses already and probably taking a

803
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:42.940
top down approach.

804
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:47.050
They took 40 different businesses and ask them whether they were approaching

805
00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.940
their businesses with the kind of wellbeing index within the context of the

806
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:54.790
products and services and the employees that work that kind of like the

807
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:57.160
organizational structure.

808
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.390
And when this came out,

809
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.380
one of the things that I suggested to the Bhutanese primaries but also their

810
00:48:05.381 --> 00:48:08.720
team at the center of Brittany studies was you're doing the wellbeing.

811
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:10.840
Why don't you also do the environmental side of it too?

812
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.060
So if you were to like be Kobes analyze the whole business and the impact that

813
00:48:16.061 --> 00:48:18.490
it had on the environment as well as the wellbeing,

814
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.370
what kind of a metric would you have?
You'd be the first in the world to do it.

815
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.900
So we're exploring that together.
It's funny actually,
you know,
um,

816
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:30.130
at the beginning of the year when I was writing the convergence of AI and

817
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.460
ecology piece,
I watch all of the Black Mirror series.

818
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.590
I don't know if you've come across this so much fun.
I loved it.
Um,

819
00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:41.820
and one of the things that I came across was if I could write a piece for the

820
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:46.360
future,
like 40 years,
maybe even 30 or 10 years of how this could be,

821
00:48:46.361 --> 00:48:47.080
I want to get crazy.

822
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.650
And I wrote that it then became the preliminary piece for the,

823
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:55.570
for the medium article.
But one of the things that I wrote was in two years time,

824
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:58.480
the,
and I wrote it as opposed to looking back.
So,
uh,

825
00:48:58.481 --> 00:49:02.800
two years ago this suggestion was made and then this was implant,
uh,
you know,

826
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:05.620
implemented at the government level in Bhutan.

827
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.560
And it's interesting how that is happening now.
And I wonder if,

828
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:12.640
because that intention was there that something like this is actually manifested

829
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.360
a very interesting relationship with intuition and manifestation,

830
00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:20.410
but many different countries around the world from a government level or trying

831
00:49:20.411 --> 00:49:23.110
to introduce this like in Goa,
uh,

832
00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:28.111
with the installation they suggested 2019 what about if we had a festival on

833
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:29.374
zero waste?

834
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.390
Funny because the festival that we had this art installation for a year ago,

835
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:38.620
I suggested how about if we have our festival and zero waste festival and they

836
00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:38.831
said,

837
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:43.831
well why don't you do it first and then we'll see how from the evaluation we

838
00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:45.340
could do it.

839
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.900
And it's funny that the government is now suggesting completely unrelated,

840
00:49:48.901 --> 00:49:51.520
but government is suggesting we have like a zero waste festival.

841
00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:55.210
But I think they're all like pockets of people coming together and doing very

842
00:49:55.211 --> 00:49:58.810
interesting things.
But for the,
for the world replenish index,
um,

843
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.890
at MIT last year in December I launched something called the replenish business

844
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:07.510
canvas.
And I wanted to suggest that if every single startup not,

845
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:11.200
you know,
sort my company,
come to the end of it,
and now I've got the money,

846
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:12.520
I'll put some money towards CSR,

847
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.230
right at the beginning when you're formulating your company,

848
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.790
you could say that this company is going to be a zero waste company and where am

849
00:50:21.791 --> 00:50:25.090
I going to get my military materials from?
So at writer inception,

850
00:50:25.091 --> 00:50:26.830
you could introduce this whole idea,

851
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.370
what kind of businesses would we have in the future?
And you know,
I'm surprised,

852
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:32.960
but even at Harvard and Mit,

853
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:36.290
both of their MBA programs as well as Oxford site business school,

854
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:40.250
do not have enough case studies of businesses that have done extremely well in

855
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:41.084
this field.

856
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.410
So that's one of the projects within the world replenish index to build on the

857
00:50:45.411 --> 00:50:50.330
case studies of business model innovation of where businesses have done it.

858
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:54.920
I've made it,
so it's a lot of work and I need a lot of help.

859
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.440
Um,
maybe some of you will help me.
Yeah.

860
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.720
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
