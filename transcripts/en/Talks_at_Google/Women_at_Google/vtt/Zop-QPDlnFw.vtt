1
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.070
Well,
thank you all very much for coming.
Um,

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.390
I wrote this little book for the Aup series,
very short introductions.

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.750
And since then I've got very interested in the presence of stories in the

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.210
current times of dislocation and migration.
So there's an actual,
um,

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.490
angle to this talk which follows on from the definitions and discussion in the

6
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:33.990
book,
but is not quite exactly the same.
Um,
this,
this is a wonderful work.

7
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.430
You probably know her,
she's a,

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.590
she does these cutout sculptures from older books and um,

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
it seems to be this captured brilliantly the idea of the secrecy of the story,

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.660
the secrecy of the intimacy,

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.550
the hidden knowledge deep in the forest and the idea of the illumination that

12
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.570
the story might bring
one of the,
there are many,

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.230
many ways to approach a definition of fairytale,

14
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.040
but one of the interesting aspects of it is that it's frequently associated with

15
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:02.970
women's voices.

16
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.700
Now this may be to some extent derogatory because Plato,
for example,

17
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:12.090
as early as Plato,
he says,
oh,
those are just old wives tales.
So,

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.730
so the old wife,
the idea of the old wives' tale,

19
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:17.430
which is exactly what it is in Greek,
is a sense,

20
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.060
a story that is kind of what we call now fake news.
You know,
it's a kind of,

21
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.880
it's a sort of nostrum full of superstition and ignorance.
So very,

22
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:30.060
very early on there's this si the Stegall derogatory aspect and that may have

23
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:34.440
led to the association of such material fairytales,
fables.

24
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:39.230
It's a vast body of work that I'm going to stick to a fairytale.
Um,
this,

25
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.450
um,
it might lead to this assists association and attributing them,
you know,

26
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.400
we don't do it.
We Authority figures.
Don't do it.
There's old women do it.

27
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.360
But that's probably not the case.
It's probably also true that these were,

28
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.110
this was a body of stories circulating on the,
in,
in the,

29
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.380
in family and private circuits.

30
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.150
Because one characteristic of fairytales is that it's not associated with

31
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:06.990
literate elites.
Now,
that doesn't mean that it wasn't written down.

32
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.460
A lot of them are written down and I'll show you some very famous collectors.

33
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.810
But on the whole,

34
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.530
you didn't have to be somebody with an education to be able to pass on a version

35
00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:19.384
of Cinderella.

36
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.730
And that means that it is actually the body of imaginative discovery and

37
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.910
creation that links us all together.

38
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.760
That numerous cultural variations,

39
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.270
many different aspects of societies are reflected.

40
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.410
If you are in a polygamous society,
you have stuck fairy tales about polygamy,

41
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.880
if you're in et cetera.

42
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.780
There's monsters take on the shape of local fairs and so forth.

43
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.230
But basically the structures are a form of language.

44
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.740
They are what I have called and Esperanto of the imagination.

45
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.480
We can talk to somebody from Finland or from Australia through the language of

46
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.314
fairytale.

47
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.400
One of the earliest fairytales written down is cupid and psyche,

48
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.960
which is a beauty and the beast story.

49
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.010
And it's interesting to be set up in the middle of a remarkable novel,

50
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.440
which some of you will know.
Um,
I pull Aaos is the golden asks,

51
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.910
which is about the transformation of Lucy as the hero into a donkey.

52
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.110
And as a donkey,
he experiences much stuff,
many sufferings,

53
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.230
the brutality of people,
but also a lot of comedy.

54
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.430
And then it ends with a religious initiation.
But in the middle of this story,

55
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.020
a young woman is abducted on her wedding night by bandits,

56
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.940
and she's taken to a cave.

57
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.900
Her husband is seized by the bandits and taken elsewhere and she fears for his

58
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.470
life,
quite rightfully.
Um,
and she's taken,
she's called character,

59
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.460
and she's taken by the bandage to their cave cave,
their lair,

60
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.670
and she's given into the keeping of a disreputable old woman at the disreputable

61
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.750
a woman when she's weeping and weeping because she has lost her husband and

62
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:59.920
she's been raped and abducted.
She,
um,
the old woman says,

63
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.010
let me tell you a story to make you feel a little better.

64
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.890
And this is absolutely to the heart.
I mean,

65
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.070
this is very early version of a fairytale in print.
This is,

66
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.080
goes to the heart of the,

67
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.790
of the characteristic defiance of the fairytale.

68
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.470
It's not exactly optimism.
The,
the happy ending is never elaborated.

69
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.540
The story of Crow quilting.

70
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:26.140
I'm kindness of infanticide and starvation and so forth.

71
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:30.430
And maltreatment will unfold fully occupying the story.

72
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.600
And then at the end it will be a promise that this will be changed.
So,

73
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.580
so it's an act of defiance more than an expression of how hope can take place.

74
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.220
It was that spirit,

75
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.180
that spirit of what Walter Benyamin called cunning and high spirits,
um,

76
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.570
flows through the conventional fairytale,
the traditional idea.

77
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:53.404
We have a fairytale,

78
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.820
I mean it differs it from a myth and myth will not necessarily come to a

79
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:00.670
conclusion that is hopeful or this defiant.

80
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.140
It will often be tragic and it differs from a ballot.
The ballot,

81
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.030
like the one you were hearing when you came in,

82
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.210
which is a very famous with numerous variations,

83
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:13.680
both verbal variations and musical variations that um,

84
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.380
there's no called binary in the Scottish tradition and that one is called the

85
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.200
two sisters.
Emily Portman was singing it.

86
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:24.800
And that's a story of two sisters who arrivals for the same man and one sister

87
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.653
kills the other one.

88
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.270
And then when the sister has she murders after she was murdered her,

89
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:35.440
she buries her,
her in the murder of a river bank.

90
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.510
And then someone coming by sees a bone sticking out of the,
of the mod,

91
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.160
thinks it's an animal burn and takes it out.
And it's either a pipe,
yeah,

92
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:49.690
that makes it into a pipe or he makes it into a harp from her breastbone.

93
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.760
And then he goes to play this minstrel.
This,
this shepherd who's found this,

94
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.530
this,
um,
it's made this instrument for himself,

95
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.340
goes to the king's hall and starts trying to play.

96
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.750
And the musical instrument will only play the song of the murder.

97
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.700
So when it's,
when,
when he pipes on it,
there's this pipe sings,

98
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.280
I was your sister,
you killed me.

99
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.120
And if it's a breast bone that's been strong for a harp,

100
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.280
the harp sings,

101
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.580
you have strongly my hair on your hub and then tells the story of her murder.

102
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.100
So there are,
so that is an example of a story that has,
you know,

103
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.580
no happy resolution.
It's just a sad,

104
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.620
except there's a revenge on the merger that otherwise it's not at all a happy

105
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:42.890
story.
Um,
but it is,
it belongs to fairytale.

106
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.270
In one sense.
It's supernatural.
And it's the idea of the eloquent bone,

107
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:51.920
which of course it's very central to the idea of the oral voice.

108
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.210
So that there are numerous examples in high literature,
um,

109
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.180
of this idea of the circle of storytellers.
And very frequently,
as I said,

110
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:03.014
female.

111
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.050
So here Boccaccio they're fleeing the plague and the women dominate the

112
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.590
storytelling scene.

113
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:14.360
So there you have a in Boccaccio who have a tremendous collection of wonderful,

114
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:19.361
inventive stories that have that again attributed to two women's passing on to

115
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:23.540
the traditions of exchanges between women.

116
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.640
Um,

117
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.320
the first famous collection that we all know that we all know because it

118
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:33.320
contains blue,
the Ed,
it contains Red Riding Hood.
It contains sleeping,

119
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:37.040
beauty is sharp,
the whole.
So here you have the example of what,

120
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.990
what very characteristic pattern,

121
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.110
which is that a man comes along who was highly educated.

122
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:46.520
He was a very high court official under Luke at herbs.
And He,
um,

123
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.710
he collected stories.
He said there were just so near to,

124
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.860
they were just a little trifles.

125
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:56.000
There were absurdities and Pertti collected them from his grandmother and his

126
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:59.690
servants.
And then he wrote them in these very arrogant,
very,

127
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.960
very arrogant French,
ironic,
a delightful,

128
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.100
sophisticated stories which have been retold and retold many,

129
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:09.080
many times in a different tone of voice.

130
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.360
He's much more feline and savvy and sort of knowing them then where we produce

131
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:19.220
these stories for children.
He had a contemporary,
oh,
so and so he,

132
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:22.130
and he signed the book mother goose.

133
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.920
So there you have an example of someone who is a,
you know,

134
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.990
a worldly Kocher taking on the identity of a poor old woman and a slightly

135
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:36.130
absurd figure.
Mother goose.
I'm numb,
no Hawaiian French.
Um,

136
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.070
and try and translate it translated into English culture almost directly.

137
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:43.520
We have still have mother goose collections,
mother goose books,

138
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:49.130
though he had a contemporary who was interestingly rather vanished as a name

139
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.020
from the history.

140
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.920
So mathy Catherine du Bois was a contemporary of pedals as I,

141
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.350
and she wrote many,
many,
many,

142
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:03.290
many of fairytales turned into British pantomimes,
um,
like the golden goose.
Um,

143
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.590
the,
the,
the,
um,
the,

144
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.820
trying to remember the one yellow dwarf these wall turned into Victorian

145
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.830
pantomimes and theater and film our chief conductors of this form of literature

146
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.470
at the same time.

147
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.730
And this is often forgotten because we think of unfortunately we are formed to

148
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:28.380
think of the Islamic world and the Christian world as kind of,

149
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.730
you know,
clove and apart somehow existing in separate spheres.

150
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:35.610
This was not at all the case.
They were deeply entangled.

151
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.000
And one of the ways they became very deeply entangled and our fairytale

152
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:43.020
tradition was interwoven with the um,

153
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.410
eastern oriental and Middle Eastern Fairytale tradition was through the Arabian

154
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.970
nights.
And then the immediate medieval year,

155
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.090
it was published in French first is the first print edition of this immense

156
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:59.091
collection of incredibly brilliant and elaborate stories of fantastic,

157
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.900
um,
rate range of range of human experiences,

158
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:08.220
which I'll tell you in a second about,
but um,
but that is,
you know,

159
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.660
it takes place as a storytelling seen in bed.
So,
the,

160
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.690
so the solution is killing all the women because he in his country because he

161
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:20.760
believes that all women are perfidious,
treacherous.

162
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.880
Adulterous is how you know him.

163
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.260
So he's decided to murder the mall and Shaharazad who's the daughter of his

164
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:31.830
vizier,
actually volunteers to,
um,

165
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.880
marry him on knowing that she's under threat,

166
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.360
that the following morning he will have her head cut off or show he'll have,

167
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:42.690
are strangled.
But she holds him by telling him stories.

168
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:48.110
And in the Arabian nights you have a clear picture of how stories were

169
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.880
associated with this.

170
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.360
Not only with this idea that you can make you feel a little better like the

171
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:58.560
bride and the cave,
but that you actually,
you could save your life.

172
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.290
And I think that that might seem preposterous,

173
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.530
but I think in our kind of very disruptive times and turbulent and hostile

174
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.893
times,

175
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.930
the function of stories matters more and more because they have this part

176
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:17.070
actually to impinge on reality and to,
and to change reality.

177
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.990
That the,
the frameworks of narrative through which we work,
uh,

178
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.980
more important than we've collapsed allowed.

179
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:30.010
It's not a frivolous side [inaudible] belong to the side,

180
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.460
um,
activity.
It's very central to human thought.
I mean I feel,

181
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:35.980
you know,

182
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.570
I'm speaking to an audience who knows this extraordinary well because the

183
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:43.760
Internet is,
it's in some sense an immaterial,
um,

184
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.510
expression of this network of stories and we're seeing a lot of the consequences

185
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.620
of people being frightened of that par.
And My,

186
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.650
my kind mission as a writer is to harness that par four for the ends of Justice

187
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:03.010
and equality and understanding and deeper intelligence and so forth rather than

188
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.120
for disinformation and propaganda and other uses,

189
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:09.520
which at the moment are gaining ground.

190
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.550
They don't necessarily need to gain ground,
but they are gaining ground.
Um,

191
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.770
there are three quotations which I just liked quickly to,
to mention to you.

192
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:22.570
One is Ursula Gwynn who unfortunately died as you know,
last year.
She says,

193
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:27.280
resistance and change often beginning art very often out.

194
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.240
She was,

195
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.620
she was addressing an audience of writers very often in our art,

196
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.800
the art of words as if she's making the same point.

197
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.600
There's a Harris out the storage.
Herzog is making that you can influence.

198
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:45.100
And shape the experience in reality through the power of words.

199
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.080
She never has.
Art tells many,

200
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:52.081
many varied stories across the gamut of very terrifying situations to the

201
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.080
Samsung.

202
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.700
And the ultimate aim is that he should see the error of his ways,

203
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.760
that he should see that there were other ways of responding to an adultery.

204
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.290
Then cutting off heads were women.

205
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:13.740
So the story eventually goes in full arc of 2001 nights,

206
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.720
uh,
to the resolution whereby he is a changed man.
Um,

207
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.650
unfortunately we know from the world that this has not happened because when I

208
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:26.620
was reading the Arabian nights very intensively,
I am,

209
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.520
it was the beginning of the war in Syria.
And,
um,
it was clear,
you know,
I sat,

210
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.310
it kept coming up in my mind as I,

211
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.900
as I read about the sultan who was so extreme and violent.
And,
um,

212
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.630
of course we know that have a muddy stories.

213
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:45.040
We tell us he doesn't change his views.
So there is a problem.

214
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.370
But the second quotation I wanted to mention too was Hannah Arendt,

215
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.690
who wrote an excellent book,
the human condition after the Second World War.

216
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.760
Stories are a form of action.

217
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.710
The way we insert ourselves into the human world.
And that the did,

218
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:07.540
she went on the ability to produce stories is the way we become historical.

219
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:13.060
She says produced stories,
but actually you can modify that to retail stories.

220
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.690
The way we take our traditions and refashioned them,
um,

221
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.720
makes a history.
It makes the history in which we are living.
And the third,

222
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.410
the third is,
is,
um,
it's from water venue mean in which he,

223
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.430
he,
he stresses that this,

224
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.850
these individual acts of telling stories are part of the community.

225
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:35.110
They're part of a collectivity.

226
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.490
And he to writing at the end of the Second World War,
um,

227
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.800
said every morning brings us the news of the globe.

228
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.920
And yet we are poor in noteworthy stories.

229
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.180
And he went on saying,
calling for the eye for more,

230
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:54.380
more speculative fiction that would build an experience in this,

231
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:58.280
in this sort of mayhem of the aftermath of the war.
Um,

232
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.790
folk art and the worldview of the child demand to be seen as collectivist ways

233
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:04.964
of thinking.

234
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.840
And I was very interested that you have such an emphasis on play in your

235
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:10.790
reception area.
Um,

236
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.330
because it seems to me that that connects quite both of anyone was very,

237
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:17.510
very interested in play and wrote wonderful things,

238
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:21.790
wonderful stories for the radio,
for children.
And this,
this,
this,

239
00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:26.540
there is a connection there that there is something about the fairytale that is

240
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:28.940
connected to the idea of the imagination at play.

241
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.440
You're not tied to the objective representation of reality.

242
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.240
You are speculative and we move freely with,

243
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.280
within this Esperanto of fantasy to in order to build possible possible

244
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.430
alternative worlds.
Okay.
So,
um,
the,
uh,

245
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:47.931
that's,

246
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:52.700
this is the Arabian nights were disseminated throughout the world and hundreds

247
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:57.701
of different versions and variations and this and been in the English and

248
00:15:58.371 --> 00:15:58.700
French.

249
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.390
And then finally in Arabic they came into print in Arabic in the 19th century.

250
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:07.710
So,
um,
these are just a box you'll see there.
The Grimm brothers,
um,

251
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.380
they were the major collectors of the other famous stories that,
you know,
um,

252
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.240
Hansel and Gretel.
Um,
anyway,
we'll,
we'll look at them at the moment.
So,

253
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.180
um,
and they've dominated the scene and they brought,

254
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.190
but they did the cells invoke female or a female sources and when they came into

255
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:29.240
English,
so this is their,
one of their principle sources.
Very,
very nice.

256
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.410
A portrait about the younger brother who didn't collect stories but was an

257
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:34.940
artist of that,

258
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.890
one of their principle sources of fairytales.
She knew very many of them.

259
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.170
Then,
um,
when they were translated into English,
they interestingly,

260
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.420
the English were anxious about the cruelty.

261
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:53.230
So George Cruickshank who was a cartoonist and a current campaign,

262
00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:55.700
or actually he was a teetotaler.
And so when he,

263
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.630
when he rewrote translated Cinderella in the grim version,

264
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.930
he had the fountains at the wedding flow with lemonade because he wanted to make

265
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.920
sure that he was chair campaigning.
I got drunk from listen in England.

266
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.520
But the emphasis in England try to shift it to comedy.

267
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.070
And you can see that in this front of space,
they sort of the,

268
00:17:17.071 --> 00:17:20.890
the stories become Julia and more,
more kind of cheerful and,

269
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.160
and more absurd that there's a,
there's a desire to pull away,

270
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.010
which has not come back actually versed.

271
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.300
We now in our back with cruelty and violence.

272
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.810
People now acknowledge strongly that that's,
uh,
that's,
uh,

273
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.920
various various intrinsic part of the fairytale tradition.
Um,

274
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:41.240
the Cinderella the Grimm brothers collected is the one where he's ugly.

275
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:45.590
Sister's cut off their heels and cut off the toes to fit into the glass slipper.

276
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.400
And the prince realizes that it's not the right bride because there's blood in

277
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:53.670
the shoe was very bloody.
And then at the end,

278
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.900
the enchanted birds pick out the eyes of the sisters at the wedding Cinderellas

279
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.920
wedding.
So they're both maimed and their feet and blinded in their own.

280
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.440
Um,
very happy.
They're happy ending,

281
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.950
very happy ending that,
that the,
that has an interesting um,
um,

282
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.040
little Coda,
which is that they collected it from the poor house in Marburg.

283
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:18.050
There were students at marble.

284
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.010
They began when they were very young collecting stories.

285
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:23.670
So there were students at Marburg University and they heard that there was a old

286
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:25.110
woman in the arms house.

287
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:29.970
I in the poor house who knew a lot of stories and they asked to see her and to

288
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.610
collect her stories and she didn't want to see them.
She refused.

289
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.960
So they paired the daughter of the Arms House director,

290
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.960
they gave her a little,
I mean,
not the tiny,

291
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:43.110
which was with go and an asset to how,
you know,

292
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.840
you go in and ask her to tell you a story and then you come up,

293
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.790
tell it to us and we'll write it down.

294
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.440
And the little girl did this and this is the Cinderella she told.

295
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.750
And My,
my feeling,

296
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.550
my interpretation of this is that the old woman in the arms house was passing on

297
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:01.800
a female secret of very,

298
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.620
very cruel version of revenge amongst swimming.

299
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:10.250
And she didn't want the fine gentleman from the university to know this kind of

300
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:14.520
story.
It was a,
it was a kind of promise between women,

301
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.660
between generations of women,
you know,
that if you're,
if you're badly treated,

302
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.600
you will escape and there will be a wonderful revenge.
And,
um,

303
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.620
so it's an interesting example.
We didn't have many actual scenes of that car.

304
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:32.010
We don't know the exact circumstances of a lot of collecting.

305
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:35.970
And there's a lot of,
of course massaging and changing of the sources.

306
00:19:35.971 --> 00:19:40.080
Even the grims pretended to be setting it down verbatim,
but they couldn't,

307
00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:44.970
they kept rewriting them cause we have the drafts.
Okay.
So one of the,
um,
there,

308
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.700
there are many definitions of fairytales that I can't go into here.

309
00:19:47.701 --> 00:19:50.460
One of them is obviously the president.
There's a presence of the supernatural.

310
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.650
Now that's a very important and you know,
defining characteristic,

311
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:57.090
the enchantment of the supernatural.

312
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.740
But there is a way in which the supernatural is there because reality can't be

313
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:03.210
tolerated.
It can't be born.

314
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:08.211
It is on so on bearable because the real heart of fairytale content is

315
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:12.580
suffering.
It's a domain of pain.
Um,

316
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.900
you have then every kind of human aberration crime

317
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.160
ordeal are,

318
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.400
are represented that in spite of their supernatural clothing,

319
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:29.520
the enchantments,
the improbabilities,

320
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.990
the actually very close to real experience.

321
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.880
So for example,
this donkey skin,
I don't know if any of you know it,

322
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:43.470
it's the one that's most least reproduced from [inaudible] collection because

323
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:47.070
it's about father,
daughter incest.
And so in the story,

324
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.320
her father wants to marry her after the death of her mother because she looks

325
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:53.890
just like her mother and he's promised never to marry again unless somebody was

326
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:57.060
as good as her mother.
So he,
so he asked to marry her.

327
00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.850
She doesn't want to marry her Farber.
And there's a lot of magic to help her.

328
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.740
And the One and part of the magic is that she's given a kind of magic donkey

329
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:09.340
skin.
Um,
and this is her in that disguise.

330
00:21:09.341 --> 00:21:12.730
And then she takes the job as a scallion in the kitchen.
She flees her father.

331
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.350
And interestingly,
the story in its this rather lighthearted,

332
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.350
they're written by people.

333
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.290
The story upholds the girl against her father.

334
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.530
So here you have a story of filial disobedience.

335
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.670
She refuses to marry her father as he asks her to do that,

336
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:34.090
is that the story is fully not,
not currently,

337
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.500
is overtly upholding.
The story is on her side.

338
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.400
She's every,
that it is the wrong thing for him to ask.

339
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.690
So this story,
if you imagine it being passed on,

340
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.950
is a way in which the customs of the tribe are being communicated without

341
00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:55.000
actually telling a story of child abuse.
I mean,
this is,
it's very fanciful.

342
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:59.370
It feels they can,
it's once upon a time,
far away in a great palace,
a king,

343
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.760
you know,
et cetera.
So it sort of distanced by the act of literature,

344
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.170
literary imagination,
but at the same time,
it's carries this seed.

345
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.940
They're very important seed.
I mean,

346
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:14.230
if you could imagine how different it would be if the child abuse stories were

347
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:17.290
told in this way,
we would understand.
I mean,
it's in a way,

348
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.950
or lack of them that has made cook recall some of the difficulties that we're

349
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:22.720
experiencing today.
Children,

350
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.640
if they were bought up with lots of fairytales about Harvey Weinstein in

351
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:32.300
disguise as a king,
they would have more of a understanding.
Um,

352
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:38.070
instead of being constantly promoted by the tabloids into being beautiful for,

353
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.100
to please and so forth.
So it's,
um,
it's,
uh,

354
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.870
this is a great loss start of,
um,
I mean it's,

355
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.640
it's coming back.
It's coming back,

356
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:52.710
but it's to some extent the lost art of communication.
Um,

357
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.720
it was made into a wonderful film in 1970 a badge academia with Katherine's,

358
00:22:56.721 --> 00:22:57.640
a nerve in the row.

359
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:02.050
And I wanted to put this in not only to remind you what a great film this is,

360
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:07.300
but also that film is probably one of the ways that most of you have encountered

361
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:12.000
fairytales.
It's the chief channel of communication for four,

362
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.610
four s even,
even for children,
they're not really read fairytale so much.
Uh,

363
00:23:16.611 --> 00:23:20.680
seeing them because of this being this language of Esperanto,

364
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.450
Esperanto language,

365
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.120
the big blockbuster studios love it because it can actually communicate across

366
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:30.400
cultures.
Okay.
So,
um,

367
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.030
Cinderella is about stepmothers the same pos CEP,

368
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:39.970
CEP mother role is in some languages the same as the mother in law,

369
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.760
same word.
So bell may have in French means stepmother and mother-in-law.

370
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.820
That's quite common in civil societies.

371
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.170
So the situation that Cinderella is in of being turned into a so skivi and

372
00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:55.460
abused and not given food very,
very widespread in many,

373
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:57.470
many cultures that the,

374
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.860
the either the unwanted child of an earlier marriage or the daughter in law is

375
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.600
turned into a servant.

376
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.660
So this again in the heart of this fanciful tear them enchantment lie is a very

377
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.600
true,
a true representation.
Um,

378
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.530
we're very imprinted by the film tradition.

379
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.290
Um,
and I'm sure many of you,

380
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.610
probably all of you have seen snow white and he's incredibly early.

381
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.390
I think 1937.
It's a,
it's,
I mean he,
he,

382
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.840
he used the medium early on.
Um,

383
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.620
and there's another here,
there's another couch is a couch,

384
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.000
which is that this evil stepmother figure we can perhaps you could ask me about

385
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:44.810
it later cause they weren't blinker now and has become an architect and

386
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:47.580
archetypes.
And here the reality,
uh,

387
00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:51.180
flips over in the sense that a lot of stepmothers today from there aren't very

388
00:24:51.181 --> 00:24:55.610
many,
many because of easier divorce,
um,
are um,

389
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.820
much I really very well meaning and long to be loved by their stepchildren and

390
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:02.720
don't know,
treat them at all.

391
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.810
But the children have all seen Disney and,

392
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.870
and so there you have the kind of,

393
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.000
the reflection of reality in the store is from a different era impinging and

394
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:15.291
passing on,

395
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:20.291
reflecting on the reality of experience in the present with it with a dangerous

396
00:25:20.961 --> 00:25:21.710
effect.
So this,

397
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.710
and this means that the fairy tales need constantly to be rewritten and re re

398
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.280
reworked the maleficent,

399
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.590
the sleeping beauty that was recently done,

400
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.630
did a very interesting reworking,
which we can talk about again,
data.

401
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.050
This was a pub,
a superb,
smooth white,

402
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.510
which took on a Disney directly.

403
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.430
It didn't do anything kind of Glib like reverse the step stepmother figure,

404
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.850
but it crit made snow white herself so interesting and so appealing and so

405
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:57.620
beautiful,
but it didn't have a happy ending.

406
00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.360
The film does not have a happy ending.

407
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.750
So it's an example of how the new reworkings and re recreation's of classic

408
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:10.331
fairytales actually often edge them into myth and edge them into tragedy.

409
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.480
Hansel and Gretel,
probably one of the most famous stories in the world,
um,

410
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:20.600
is about child abandonment due to starvation.
And that is a very,

411
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:25.460
very common um,
predicament.
And not only in the past,

412
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.850
quite a lot of the refugees arriving in Europe,

413
00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.910
I've are exactly in the situation.
They're not as,

414
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:34.100
not exactly infanticide in the story.

415
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:38.870
It says that we will leave them to die.
That actually what happened in the past,

416
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.440
in the early modern period and probably before that and it's happening now and

417
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:47.160
some of the war torn areas is that families are saying,
leave.

418
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.740
We're going to let you leave.
We're going to put you on the boat.

419
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.780
You'll probably read many of these refugee stories.

420
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.270
We take you to the front here.
You're nine years old,

421
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:55.061
we take you to the front sheet,

422
00:26:55.061 --> 00:26:58.410
we're going to leave you there because they will come and they will help you.

423
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.880
So there's this sort of modern version of infanticide,

424
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:06.690
which is we're just sending children into a place to a place where they might be

425
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:10.630
safer and have something to eat and have something some worse.

426
00:27:10.631 --> 00:27:15.300
They don't have what in the place they are.
Um,
uh,
there's a wonderful,

427
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:18.040
wonderful illustrations that David Hockney did.
Um,

428
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.190
the children being cooked for supper,
again,
aspect of famine,
famine,

429
00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:24.240
being Italian,

430
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:29.241
being one of the dominant spurs to the sufferings reflected in fairytales.

431
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:35.020
Um,
Angela Carter wants to at a very famous thing,
she said,
um,

432
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.110
she said,
I'm a fairytale.

433
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.400
The definition of a fairytale is a story in which one king goes to another king

434
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.210
to borrow a cup of sugar
farming.

435
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.840
Only the kings have sugar.
So,
um,
some kings have sugar.

436
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.020
So this I'm here,
he's being mischievous with Rapunzel.

437
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.960
Rapunzel is a story about a woman who,

438
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.870
a childless woman who takes the new baby of the couple who live next door.

439
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.610
And again,
this is some,
this is actually a story which I wrote a short,

440
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.580
I was inspired to write a short story from the point of view of the witch

441
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.770
because,
um,

442
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.640
it seemed to me that it was very much about childlessness and adoption.

443
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.230
We,
she adopts Ripon,

444
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.620
she adopts Rapunzel and then she wants to keep her really safe.

445
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.000
And then the prince comes by and you'll probably know the story and climbs up

446
00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:31.740
her hair.
And then one day she says to the old witch who looks after her,

447
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:37.070
she says,
you know,
why am I close getting a little tight?
And the old witch,

448
00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.340
you know,
loses her temper,

449
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:43.380
realizes that someone has been get again and uh,

450
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:48.120
and that Rapunzel is having a baby and she beats her and abuser.

451
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.340
So it cuts off her hair at that,
of course,
was cleaned up.

452
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.080
Originally it was the grims couldn't bear the fact that a Rapunzel was pregnant.

453
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:02.310
So then they just had,
um,
have be say something completely different,

454
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:07.020
which makes a nonsense of the story that the story is about as a protection of a

455
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:09.330
woman who didn't have a child.
And has adopted a child.

456
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:13.470
And that seemed to me to be incredibly record recognizable as a contemporary

457
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:18.270
experience.
So that's when other,
that's one of the images rack.

458
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:23.070
And one we had them tastic tradition of,
of um,
illustrators in this country,

459
00:29:23.071 --> 00:29:27.470
including Arthur Rackham,
water,
Korean,
another one,
um,
the,

460
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.230
the body,
the beauty and the beast corpus of stories,

461
00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:35.380
which comes down from cupid and psyche pretty directly,
um,
are,

462
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:41.060
is the vehicle of an enormous number of explorations of the state of marriage to

463
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.500
a brute.
So the,

464
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:48.070
and the hope that it's held art in beauty and the beast is that with love and

465
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:53.050
time,
the brute will turn into a wonderful and lovable husband.

466
00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.720
The story as we know it best of all,

467
00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.760
which is this version was written by our governors here in England,

468
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.970
in French.
She was a French governess for her charges,

469
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:06.730
who all in arranged marriages.
So it's,
uh,
it's,

470
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.660
it's a story that comes out of the arranged marriage in which you will,
you know,

471
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:15.040
find a stranger who you have to marry.
And um,
and it was trust.

472
00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:16.600
That is all we well,

473
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.620
but of course some versions if not all as well.

474
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.330
And there's that slight Bluebeard,
the blue bear dessert.

475
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.520
Another classic classic story that looks at the inside of a,

476
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.640
of an abusive marriage.
The um,

477
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:41.040
in the Arabian nights opens with a very interesting example of a storyteller

478
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.630
thinking about conditions in the world.
Um,

479
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:51.570
so the two kings who you see up hidden in the tree and have both found their

480
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:57.001
wives supposedly to cavorting with slaves and having sex with them in a very

481
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:01.570
raunchy and extreme fashion.
The book is quite explicit,
not for children,

482
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:03.400
but the original.
Um,

483
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.930
and so they both decided WWE world is not for them.
This is a disgusting.

484
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:10.990
They killed with their wives and then they decided the world is not for them and

485
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:15.991
they go wandering across the world and they come across [inaudible] out of the

486
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:20.270
sea comes a vast gin.

487
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.900
And on his head he's carrying a glass casket in which there is the body of a

488
00:31:27.491 --> 00:31:31.720
beautiful young girl,
naked body of a beautiful young girl.
And she again,

489
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:35.800
it turns out there's been abducted on her wedding night.
It's interesting,
these,

490
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.520
these motifs recur.
And also you'll notice the glass box,

491
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:44.110
which of course gets into Snow White.
So,
um,
so this glass coffin,

492
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.600
which she is still alive,
and he,

493
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:50.570
he lets her out and the king's climb a tree to hide from it,

494
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.490
from the scare of this gin and the gin falls asleep.

495
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.900
And when he's asleep,

496
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.760
she solicits the king's she's noticed them in the tree and she solicits the

497
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:04.090
kings and beckons them down and then orders them to make love to her.

498
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:10.180
And they say,
no,
no,
no,
absolutely.
We're not that kind of person.
And,
um,

499
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.840
and she insists,
she says,
if you don't,
I will murder.

500
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:19.000
I will raise the gym and he runs our wake him up and he will kill you.

501
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:24.460
So they agree very reluctantly.
And um,
and then,

502
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:27.190
um,
after they've both done the evil deed,

503
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.600
she takes out of her clothes,
a string of rings,

504
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:36.370
and she demands that they give her a ring as a pledge of her,

505
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:40.970
the,
the,
of what's just happened.
And,
um,
and they said no,

506
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:43.220
they weren't.
And she says,
well,
I wake up the gin.

507
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.300
So they give her the rings and when she puts them on the string in the English

508
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:51.080
version,
that makes her 98 rings so far into a hundred.

509
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.280
And in the Arabic version she's got 365.

510
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.520
So that was censored in the English translation

511
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.230
was reduced.
Um,
so,
um,

512
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.460
the interestingly one of the scholars of this story,

513
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:13.040
the obvious sort of the surface of the story is rather than the sojourner east,

514
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:14.150
you know,
here's this lascivious.

515
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.550
This is a severe as woman who demand sex and Dune as having the,

516
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:21.910
taking this revenge in this list.
You know,

517
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.840
she's sort of uncontrolled and she fulfills in the story or the worst imaginings

518
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.200
of the two kings who have seen their adulterous wives.

519
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.730
They now say we're all women are like that.

520
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:36.530
So they go back home and then that's when they start killing or women.
So it's,

521
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.850
it's presented as women's Wilders,
but actually what,

522
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.680
it's what's happened in,

523
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.270
you're going into or center of the story that is telling you what will happen if

524
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:48.860
you do wrong.

525
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.510
If you take a woman from her wedding and try to an abductor and keep her in a

526
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:57.470
glass box,
women will not obey that.

527
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.360
They will not submit.
And this is,
this is a fundamental wrong and it,

528
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.300
and you will suffer for it.
You will,
there will be a consequence.

529
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.180
So while it's put into sort of fairytale setting,

530
00:34:08.181 --> 00:34:11.900
it has actually a carnal of thinking about justice in it.

531
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:13.060
Especially if you imagine this,

532
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.790
the beginning of the story in which we're going to hear many,
many,

533
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:21.320
many stories in which at the end the king will realize that he's come to the

534
00:34:21.321 --> 00:34:25.550
false conclusions and he must mended his ways.
All right.

535
00:34:25.551 --> 00:34:30.551
One of the other important aspects of fairytales that I,

536
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:36.110
I've become increasingly interested in is,
is that portability.

537
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.940
They seem to transcend difficulties of translation.
This is a very,

538
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:45.920
very mysterious process.
I mean,
there are trade routes,
there are,

539
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.990
um,
there are traveling scholars,
there are traveling missionaries,

540
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.360
there are traveling voices that possibly translate the stories.

541
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:57.350
But at the same time,

542
00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.210
it seems more fundamental than that in that the sort of desire,

543
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.240
the human desire to make stories and transmit them and hear them overcomes

544
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:11.930
cultural barriers in a very real,
very,
very remarkable way.

545
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.760
So we have stories like the epic of Gilgamesh,

546
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.953
which is one of the,

547
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:22.990
is probably the earliest extent a store imaginative piece of literature.

548
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:27.080
We have it written down in 800 BC,
but it's much,

549
00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:31.880
much older in,
um,
in,
in a,
in actual creation.
And it's,

550
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:36.710
um,
and many,
many of its elements.
It's a fantastic book,

551
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:40.540
which was telling me she read when she was studying.
Um,

552
00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.440
it's a fantastic and exciting and wonderful,
wonderful poem,

553
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:49.070
full of deep human scenes of loss and love and exploration and power,

554
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.640
everything.
Um,
it's elements.

555
00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.080
It was only found in the mid 19th century in the desert,

556
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.410
in the library of Ashwood,
Avanti power in Nineveh.

557
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.250
So it actually was only read,
um,

558
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.680
then,
so it's like a modern book for 2000 years.
It wasn't red

559
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:21.060
burst on the scene and many things in it were recognizable because the elements

560
00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:23.910
of the story had traveled.
So,
for example,

561
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:26.580
there's one whole cycle of stories within the Arabian Nights,

562
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.410
which is very close to Gilgamesh,

563
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.990
in which the hero goes down to the bottom of the seat of a cup to pick the plant

564
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.700
of in mortality.
Um,

565
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.320
and other many other aspects and why the Victorians loved it,

566
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.670
was that it can tell you the story of the flood.
It contains the story of Noah.

567
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.640
He's got a different name,
but it's the same story.

568
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.970
And they thought because they were Christians,
they thought,
oh,

569
00:36:50.971 --> 00:36:54.090
this proves the truth of the flood because we have another source for it.

570
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.630
But actually what it proves is that stories,

571
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.740
stories circulate the past.
They'd pass.
This is,
uh,

572
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:07.770
the British Museum is full of these absolutely wonderful miniature stories,

573
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:12.090
that wonderful form,
which I would love to use myself in which you,
this is,

574
00:37:12.091 --> 00:37:15.950
you know,
you roll this on wax.
So it's the stories in sized intuition.

575
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.800
Then you read it on wax and you get the freeze like that.
Um,

576
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.180
an example of another enormous body of fairytales,
northern Scandinavian.

577
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.150
This became the ring of the limbo then was sort of Icelandic sagas Norwegian

578
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.450
Sargus got in,
became the Wagner and the ring cycle,

579
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:39.230
huge living body of myth that then gives us talky talky in as you know,

580
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:46.430
such a incredible success as a film that that New Zealand has now got.

581
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:54.050
Most of this is highest proportion of GNP comes from it's CGI industries.

582
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:59.810
That was driven by the fact that the director decided to film Tolkien in New

583
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.550
Zealand.
So that's a,

584
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.390
that's another different sort of example of the material effect of fantasy and

585
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:10.560
fairytale.
Um,
the,
the,
the crossing point,

586
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.230
the important of crossing point between East and west.

587
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.810
It was the Mediterranean and the island of Sicily,

588
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.730
which for a while was in under an Arab rule.
And then change to Norman rule,

589
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:23.850
the same Norman family that conquered Britain.
And,
um,

590
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.860
and we have one collection.

591
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.690
This is another body of fairytales that proverbial,

592
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.280
which are animal fables.

593
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:37.370
So when you say once water never makes a summer or a dog in the manger or many,

594
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.260
many other proverbial phrases that use animals as the reflect humans.

595
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:49.261
They all come from AESOP's fables and AESOP's fables have an earlier version in

596
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:51.410
India and,

597
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:56.570
and they get into this Arabic book written in Sicily in the 12th century where

598
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:02.260
he expresses it as being between women telling stories and they,

599
00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:06.670
um,
but it's,
um,
and he makes variations.

600
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:11.050
They're not the same as the engine story is no other,
the same as Aesop's fables,

601
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:16.040
but they have jackals and king jackals and lions and um,
you know,

602
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:20.590
snakes,
donkeys,
all the to carry all that vast cast of characters,

603
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:25.591
animal characters that then gets into the lion king and two into much of popular

604
00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:30.270
term.
This is the,
the ballad that I played.

605
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.630
So that's some,

606
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.650
because we played at the beginning and Angela Carter does a variation on that.

607
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.980
I thought when I was teaching at fairytales,

608
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.980
my students all wanted to know about lunch.
Ricotta,
us,

609
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.370
I don't know if you want to know about her,
but half have wonderful story.

610
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:50.610
The Earl king in the bloody chamber is based on this tour story of the two

611
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:54.790
sisters that,
um,
and the Earl king and her version.

612
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:56.110
She's put the stories together.

613
00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:01.350
The Earl king and her version turns all his victims into singing birds and then

614
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:07.860
she has to rescue them.
The narrator.
All right,
so this is the coder,

615
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:13.370
um,
this idea of stories as habitat as the place you,

616
00:40:13.371 --> 00:40:16.170
you'd dwell,
the place that you create,
where you dwell,

617
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:21.570
the way you furnish your imagination and use it to apprehend and engage with the

618
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:26.200
world through the,
through the narratives that you have,

619
00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:30.940
a structure and that this could form,
could form a sanctuary.

620
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:36.040
There was one very nice example of it in this,
this man's book.

621
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:39.610
He was a,
became a very prominent,
the tree critique in Germany,

622
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:43.960
but he was in the Po,
in the ghetto in Warsaw,
um,
as a young man.

623
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:46.660
And he just got married and he and his wife fled,

624
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.230
managed to get out of the ghetto before the massacres.

625
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.680
And they were hidden by two Protestant Germans in their cellar,

626
00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:01.150
the Protestant,
the Protestants were out of work.
It was very about times.

627
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.630
It's very difficult to eat,
um,
during the war.
And they'd,

628
00:41:04.631 --> 00:41:09.010
but they didn't shelter the,
to Jews for reasons of benevolence.

629
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.680
They shuttered them because they enslaved them.

630
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.260
They made them roll cigarettes for the contraband of traffic in cigarettes.

631
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.510
So they would in the dark and the seller,
um,
and very much at the mercy,

632
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.060
very frightened.

633
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.700
Any moment there would be denounced that it would not in the end be worth the

634
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:32.410
while of their shelters to keep them and feed them in return for what they got

635
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:34.840
for their,
and I'm the,

636
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.170
one day the woman came down and she said,
I'm so bored I could scream.

637
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.080
And this man in his twenties,

638
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.200
Marcel decided that he would tell her a story and he ransacked his mind to

639
00:41:48.311 --> 00:41:51.590
everything he'd ever read.
Every film you've ever seen,

640
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.420
every opera plots he'd ever heard about,
every,
every sort of nursery rhyme,

641
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:01.310
absolutely everything.
And the,
the,
the atmosphere completely changed.

642
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:04.850
They became very dependent on hearing more stories.
And,
um,

643
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.570
and then by the end of the war,
they were,
I mean,
they will not denounced.

644
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:13.990
They were,
the end of the war came and made great hardship and the um,

645
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.410
and though they would not exactly sort of best of friends,

646
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:23.300
they were definitely on terms that were different from the terms that the

647
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:28.301
Germans and the Jewish victims had been on before.

648
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.660
He told them the plot of Aida was this most extraordinary,

649
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.590
not an example of them.
I think he must've been very good at it,
um,

650
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.490
because it's not always,
it must be very good at remembering too.
Um,

651
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.080
so I think that the,

652
00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:47.840
the concept of sanctuary was a legal,
Alice is a lawyer.

653
00:42:47.841 --> 00:42:50.990
I didn't know if she knows about the deagle 30,000 years.

654
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:54.260
There was a concept of sanctuary in this country.
You could,

655
00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:55.730
until Henry the eighth abolished it,

656
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.090
you could establish a place that was a safe place.

657
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:03.680
It was not an armed place.
It had no fence or,
or lock.

658
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:08.990
It was simply a symbolic place that was created by the decree of words.

659
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:15.100
So you see the place was designated by custom tradition and language as the

660
00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:18.680
sanctuary.
So this is an example.
It's still exist.

661
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.980
And you'll notice that it has on it this monstrous face.

662
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:30.310
And they frequently sanctuaries sanctuary places such as still survive if that's

663
00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:31.970
another one that doesn't have a monster,

664
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:36.440
but they often have like the door knockers of sanctuary buildings have a

665
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:41.150
monstrous face on them.
And I think the connections is another one in Norridge.

666
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:44.810
And this is a famous one in Durham.
And um,

667
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.200
and I think the connection is that it connects to the fundamental recognition

668
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:56.080
that the patent patent words have what's technically called performative par.

669
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.580
They will institute,

670
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:02.810
they can institute something like a safe place.

671
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:08.090
And I think that's forms that that presents an analogy for what stories can do.

672
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:13.330
They can demarcate a space in which you are free to do certain things like

673
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:16.970
imagine delicious revenge is or,
um,

674
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.830
or reparations or redress that you are still held safely within it.

675
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.580
It's not going to be,
it's not going to endanger you.
This speech,

676
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.630
the speech of imagination is not quite the same as direct communication.

677
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:34.631
And the other thing is that words have efficacy as in institute reality.

678
00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.720
This is something that obviously this is partly magical thinking and a lot of

679
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:41.100
people descend from it,

680
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:46.310
but it's something that I have sort of pretty much come to acknowledge and

681
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.270
accept and even support,
um,
throughout my work,

682
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:55.680
which began with looking at religious symbols,
which certainly have this par.
And,

683
00:44:55.681 --> 00:45:00.090
um,
and now we're looking at secular,
secular storytelling.
So we s I started,

684
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.020
this is the end.
I started a project in Sicily with the,
with the,

685
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:05.950
with the,
um,

686
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.770
refugees there because Sicily is this crossing point right here is a map of the,

687
00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:11.290
from the sixth,

688
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.120
17th century sharing consistency right in the middle of the Mediterranean.
Um,

689
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:19.020
they all,
they all arrive there 600,000 and the last two years.

690
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.610
And one of the problems of the,
uh,
you know,

691
00:45:23.611 --> 00:45:26.700
we were talking about traveling stories and how they leap cultural barriers,

692
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.820
but actually how do we tell a story of someone who doesn't know your language?

693
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.080
So we wanted to just to find a way of creating stories for imagination,

694
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:41.940
not their own stories,
not their testimony.
There are different kinds of story.

695
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.780
Two stories.
They might remember themselves from that amount,
from the cup,

696
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:47.250
from their culture stories.

697
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:50.850
They want to invent themselves now and how are we going to do it.

698
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.370
And of course the city has a tremendous tradition of puppetry.

699
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:58.790
And so the w there are many languages beyond language that are communicative.

700
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.470
So there's puppetry,
there's music,
there's um,
a gesture dance.

701
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.490
And so we've working with puppets.
Um,
this is the puppet theater,

702
00:46:08.491 --> 00:46:12.390
traditional puppet theater in Palermo.
Here they are learning and the puppets,

703
00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:17.400
the only you they took to it,
they really loved it.
We do dancing,

704
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:23.190
ask them how they dance in their countries.
Um,
we do group group,

705
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.430
um,
this,
this is sort of word game as it comes around to you.

706
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.590
The ball as you throw the ball and make this web you,

707
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:34.470
you say a word and I would as part of the story or I mean you give a structure

708
00:46:34.471 --> 00:46:38.820
ahead of time and then,
and that works also rather well.
Um,

709
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:44.130
and um,
so he has a group session on sound making sounds.

710
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.530
And this was,
this is part of the Gilgamesh workshop.

711
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.330
So here they're making the sounds of the city of work,
um,

712
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.660
as a sort of chorus.
So they did bird songs and you know,

713
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:58.440
animal sounds and not exactly a traffic signs because they wouldn't have been so

714
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:01.380
much traffic in the end.
But,
um,
um,

715
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:06.690
and here is I think Gilgamesh,
that's his visor.

716
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.630
Yes.
That's the sort of beginning of the Gilgamesh puppet.

717
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.700
And here they are doing an animation.

718
00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:14.240
We took an animator with us and they really loved this.

719
00:47:14.241 --> 00:47:17.880
This isn't to do animation on your phone and they really,

720
00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:21.900
really liked doing that.
Here are three of the characters.
Um,
if,
you know,

721
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:27.100
if you know the epic,
that story,
the innkeeper,
the tavern keeper on the road,
um,

722
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.010
I think we inky do in the middle.
That's the plan to mortality.

723
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.650
We made it with balloons and here's,

724
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.490
here's another Gilgamesh or different Gilgamesh.
Um,

725
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.550
and so we got a very good write up in the local paper,

726
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.880
which we were very pleased with.
So,
um,

727
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.400
so this was an idea of taking,

728
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.760
really of conforming to my ideas about the transmission and the freedom of the

729
00:47:52.241 --> 00:47:57.220
language of stories and trying to adapt it to a present day,

730
00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.940
a crisis of young people arriving.

731
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:05.890
I'm hoping to make a better world for themselves and for us too.
Thank you.

732
00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.950
It's also for the question,
um,

733
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:23.220
you talked about the Cinderella story and how that was given to a young girl by

734
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:27.640
a woman.
Um,
and so obviously we received the stories quite differently.

735
00:48:27.641 --> 00:48:29.980
Now we see them on mass one film.

736
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.240
How does that change the way we received a story when we're not getting it?

737
00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:36.910
Women's women or father to son?
Well,

738
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.140
there has been a returner shear to women's presence in the fairytale

739
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.620
transmission.
Um,

740
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:47.170
I mean the maleficent was produced by Angelina Jolie and the scriptures I think

741
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:50.260
by Linda Woolverton who did beauty and the beast as well.

742
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.040
So there's been a recognition within the industry that actually,

743
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:58.540
and it's not just for,
you know,
reasons of the women are coming up.

744
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.020
It's actually the women being identified with the genre and wishing to rewrite

745
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:06.010
it themselves in order to,
in order to transform it.
I mean,

746
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:07.430
I was pleased with it.

747
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:12.630
I have some men in the audience because normally when I speak about fairytales,

748
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:14.470
it's almost always women.

749
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.870
There's a very strong feeling for the relationship,

750
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.920
the fairytales and women knows Paul is it,
it's one of the main,

751
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:29.190
the tree bodies of work in which women feature prominently meet the characters,

752
00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.740
the prince characters,

753
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:36.600
often various sort of not very colorful and her mother dim.

754
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.150
So there's more interest in the women's characters.
Even the,

755
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.490
even the malignant women,
it was a real,

756
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.980
in the same way as in Greek myths to this,

757
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.770
women are attracted to the Greek myths because they're full of women,

758
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.920
full of full of different scenarios around women.

759
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.200
I mean the deer is a great favorite now with women directors and actors.
So,

760
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.720
um,
so,
but your other,

761
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.720
the other aspect of his lip sort of in a sense less.

762
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.650
There's positive and it says it's also a problem with the web.

763
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:10.740
And that is that there's a sort of homogenization because you're not speaking in

764
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.900
particular to a group of speaking more widely.

765
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:17.900
So you need to please kind of too many people,
um,

766
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:22.360
or to please a particular group with art actually troubling them.
So that's,

767
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:27.200
I mean there's a,
the,
the audience,
the mass audience is,

768
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:30.680
it creates,
um,
yes,
a difference of specificity.

769
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.420
There's this visitor out of variant,
a donkey,
donkey skin variant,

770
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.050
and which actually puts this choses quite clearly,
which is,

771
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.280
it was collected by an anthropologist from a very poor part of Spain as from my

772
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:47.420
daughter and in the donkey skin.
That version,

773
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:49.400
she doesn't wear a donkey skin.

774
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:52.900
She wears a Pelican skin and he couldn't,

775
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.130
he couldn't understand why this heroin is,
it has guys as a Pelican

776
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.530
because there are absolutely no Pelicans in Spain.
And then he,

777
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.600
when he went there to do is wait.
I mean,

778
00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:09.350
he realized that the endemic illness in the area,
it was goiter.

779
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:15.580
So in the story she is loved in spite of being a donkey looking or wearing a

780
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.440
smelly,
horrible,
filthy donkey skin.

781
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.210
The prince recognizes her true beauty underneath her disguise.

782
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:29.050
And in Extremadura this Pelican does guys to go is also recognizing the story

783
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:34.760
for her beauty and goodness beneath her doll helicon skin,

784
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:37.610
which of course is standing in for the illness of goiter

785
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.440
in that particular area.

786
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.830
It wouldn't work if you put it in a film because it wouldn't make the same s

787
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:47.060
particular sense.

788
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.250
I think you began to touch on it just now already,

789
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:54.320
but how is the kind of myths and legends,

790
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.500
are they seen as separate to fairy tales?

791
00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:01.460
Are they seen as sort of the male power,
the more domestic,

792
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:04.130
very tailored shoes?
How did they get there are,
yes.

793
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:08.720
I mean one of the main difference there obviously overlaps.
And as I said,

794
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:11.900
I think that there's a tendency now trend,

795
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.950
the fairytale mode is moved,
becoming more mythical.

796
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.200
But um,
the,
the,

797
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:22.610
one of the main differences is that the characters in fairytales are humans with

798
00:52:22.611 --> 00:52:25.730
some magic.
They're not gods.
So,
so,

799
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:31.220
and the other is that while there were some people in different cultures who

800
00:52:31.221 --> 00:52:36.050
believe in some of the supernatural elements in fairytales on the whole,

801
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:38.060
they are not connected to official religion.

802
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.720
I mean that's a fairly,
it's a rule of thumb.
I mean the gin are in the Koran,

803
00:52:44.721 --> 00:52:47.180
so the gin are actually,
it should be believed,

804
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.790
whereas the Ferris are not in the Bible.

805
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.820
So we didn't have to believe in them according to doctrine.

806
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.230
But there have been communities that certainly believed in fairies and still do

807
00:52:57.231 --> 00:53:01.240
probably.
But,
um,
I mean I think there are quite a lot like,

808
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.420
which is sort of coming back.
People believe in them.
So it's,
um,
you know,

809
00:53:05.421 --> 00:53:09.940
there are aspects that are connected to real belief,
but on the whole,

810
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:13.100
the fairytale,
it is a space of unbelief.

811
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:16.070
It's a space of imagination.
It does not,

812
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:19.880
you're not requested to consent to it structures.

813
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:25.560
That's pretty different.
I mean,
we,
with myths,
with Greek myths,

814
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:30.050
we don't consent to the Olympians anymore,
but we do,
um,

815
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.790
where they did in the past.

816
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:38.130
<v 2>I,
I if I understood you right,
I think you said earlier that we were,</v>

817
00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:41.980
we had for a period lost the ability to tell a fairy tales or to create new

818
00:53:41.981 --> 00:53:43.870
fairytales,
but it was coming back.

819
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.640
I was just wondering if you could tell us why you thought that was.
Yeah.

820
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:48.100
<v 0>Well,
the one is,</v>

821
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:52.170
it's very complicated and difficult to understand because the romantics were

822
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:54.330
very interested in fairytales.
I mean the,

823
00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:00.080
the lyrical ballads was with encourage contains it's poems there route because

824
00:54:01.091 --> 00:54:06.060
we had collected some of the oral traditions that in Scotland and so forth.

825
00:54:06.061 --> 00:54:06.910
So,
um,

826
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:11.130
if you think of a famous poem like I build done some EFC in which the night is

827
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:15.300
purely loitering and meets a ferry by via lake who kisses him and takes him into

828
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.620
a world.
I mean,
this is a fairytale.

829
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:23.210
So that's actually the same time the fairytales began falling down the ladder of

830
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.650
esteem and became associated with children.

831
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:33.630
It was partly an effect of the market because we,

832
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.340
there was a rise in Chuuk child,

833
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:39.600
children who could read the rise of the bourgeoisie in Victorian England meant

834
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.860
more children could read.

835
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:45.540
And there was a market and some of those beautiful books that were made were

836
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:47.490
made for children in each children who could,

837
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.360
parents could afford these nice books.
So it,

838
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:52.800
but that put it into a kind of niche.

839
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:57.830
And in that niche was the romantic idea that the imagination was the property of

840
00:54:58.261 --> 00:55:00.660
the child.
You know,
when was with wrote,

841
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.960
not an entire forgetfulness and not in that nakedness,

842
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.580
but trailing clouds of glory.

843
00:55:05.581 --> 00:55:09.870
Do we come to a child as a sort of marvelous creatures,

844
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.310
full of connections to other worlds and imagination.

845
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:19.230
But that made it childish.
And also we were very strongly then,

846
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:20.220
uh,

847
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:25.220
sort of encouraged or enjoined not to yield a fantasy and imagination that we as

848
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:30.090
adults should be rational and we should be objective and we should assess

849
00:55:30.091 --> 00:55:31.230
evidence.
You know,

850
00:55:31.231 --> 00:55:35.790
all this stuff about Fernandez and things was nonsense and it's any fit for

851
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:36.624
children.

852
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:41.780
So it fell under a huge kind of cloud of incomprehension because you don't have

853
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:47.760
to think of this as it's,
it's a,
it's a way of thinking,

854
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:48.480
you know,

855
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.370
thinking with the imagination is we're thinking it's not to be dismissed.

856
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.700
It's probably essential.
It's probably inevitable.

857
00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:00.360
There's also essential because you can't really,

858
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:03.300
you have to model thought.
I mean,

859
00:56:03.301 --> 00:56:07.260
they've now discovered with lots of cognitive studies that the imagination is

860
00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:10.470
not separate from reason in the brain.
The,
the,

861
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:14.640
the synopsys same synopsys far.
If I say to you,

862
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:19.110
lady,
you know,
um,
um,

863
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.520
what is the wonderful line?

864
00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.320
A Unicorn sat under a juniper tree.
If I say a lady,

865
00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.960
a lady with a unicorn sat under a juniper tree,

866
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.870
you bring it up in your mind's eye and you,

867
00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.180
when you're doing that is the same as if I say to you,

868
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.860
I met your mother last week.

869
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.230
Your mother comes up in your mind's eye and you assemble it with me,

870
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.910
your mind.
Then you're using the same faculties.
There's the thought,
same place.

871
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.900
Fars so,
so,
so thinking models,

872
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:54.370
models,
thought using imaginative pars,

873
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:57.763
they're looking,

874
00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.560
<v 2>I think that's really interesting.</v>

875
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.910
So you think maybe the invention of childhood in the Georgian than Victorian

876
00:57:04.911 --> 00:57:05.900
periods,
mother,

877
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:09.560
we can pop Cobham at compartmentalize different kinds of stories as belonging to

878
00:57:09.561 --> 00:57:11.780
different kinds of imaginative domains.
But,

879
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:14.030
but why then a fairy for is coming back?

880
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.090
Is it something to do with adults reclaiming childhood for themselves?

881
00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.840
<v 0>Well,
there is a lot of,
I mean there's been a lot of very,</v>

882
00:57:20.841 --> 00:57:24.740
very powerful work on play.
I mean,
when it cooked root,
you know,

883
00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.900
very powerfully on the important,

884
00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.960
I mean the development of children and the capacity to play in order for them to

885
00:57:32.061 --> 00:57:36.880
become fully achieved adults has been,

886
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:40.900
has been a cornerstone of Piaget of winter coat of,

887
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:43.420
of about a new client.
Um,

888
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:46.640
and I don't think people who've ever turned out at all,
no.

889
00:57:46.641 --> 00:57:51.260
Adam Phillips has written about this very important day.
I mean,
and do I think,

890
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:51.741
you know,

891
00:57:51.741 --> 00:57:56.741
you have this ethos here because in order to sync the sync up the projects that,

892
00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:00.440
you know,
Muse,
new thinking requires play.

893
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:05.870
You can't just stick to what's already known.
So it's that some,

894
00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:10.970
so I think there's been a,
yes,
there's been a recuperation,

895
00:58:10.971 --> 00:58:13.040
the re re evaluation,

896
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.690
evaluation of fantasy and imagination.
They're slightly different.

897
00:58:17.691 --> 00:58:22.280
But nevertheless,
it's the to a contiguous contingent.
And,
um,

898
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.940
and uh,
but the attendant dangers,
I mean,

899
00:58:25.941 --> 00:58:29.600
the people who insist on objectivity and so forth,
um,

900
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:34.450
you know,
they have identified a danger,
which is we can't live in Italian

901
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:40.790
imagination.
There's one exact thing just protested.
But

902
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:46.280
I mean,
just the great task of our time is to have,
is to how to

903
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:54.760
spa people to question what's the imagine and what they think,

904
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.450
but not by using only the tea,

905
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.410
the realistic of objective verification.

906
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.620
Because that will just trap us in what we already know.

907
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.920
Thank you very much.
