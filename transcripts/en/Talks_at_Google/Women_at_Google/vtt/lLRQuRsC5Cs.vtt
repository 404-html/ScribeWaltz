11
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.880
<v 2>Okay.
First.
Hi everyone.</v>

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.140
It's great to be here and thank you for this whole event.

13
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.230
Um,
well,
uh,
I was born in Long Beach,
actually.
I wasn't born at the corner.
Uh,

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.390
I never lived in Long Beach.
I actually,

15
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.440
my parents were moving around California and they,
they're both Mexican,

16
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:02.500
but they both had their immigration papers and,

17
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.410
but they finally settled into Hawaiian or they just,
they always,

18
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:09.580
they grew up there and uh,
well practically.
Yeah.

19
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:13.540
And uh,
they decided that that was the best place to be.
Um,

20
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.130
and I kind of grew up,
I'm a very much a border life,
you know,
I mean,

21
00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:21.610
every time one of our,
one of my brothers or sisters were going to be born,

22
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:26.020
we'd cross of,
they'd have their kid and go back to you want to.

23
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.130
And um,
problems propels me.
I'm on,
you know,

24
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.330
<v 3>so,
uh,</v>

25
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.620
<v 2>Ruben decline on,
but it's very much a border life,
very much.
Um,
bilingual.</v>

26
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.530
I grew up watching American television.
That's how I learned English.

27
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.930
I never studied in the u s uh,
I did,
uh,

28
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.130
do like a junior college when I finished high school because I kind of wanted to

29
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:54.750
study a career in music.

30
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.950
But in Tukwila the music school wasn't really that developed yet.

31
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.830
So I decided to,
you know,
try to,
you know,
start getting my,

32
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.750
um,
what,
what is called [inaudible],
like [inaudible] like the classes.

33
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.980
Yeah,
like the points to get to,
yeah,
the credits.
And uh,

34
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
I was in the middle of that when I went to Mexico City to visit and I just kind

35
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.750
of fell in love with the city.
I found.
I was like,
I don't want to,

36
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.860
I don't want to leave this place.
It just completely blew my mind.
I mean,

37
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.420
I'd been in big cities.
I mean,

38
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.750
I not really that kind of big cities I had been like in,
I dunno,

39
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.160
like Los Angeles or San Francisco,

40
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.953
<v 3>you know,</v>

41
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.110
<v 2>but when I got to Mexico City,
it's like part of me completed itself.</v>

42
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.080
I was like always in the Guana thinking about Mexico.

43
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:46.050
My Dad was so much about Mexico.
We were always talking about Mexico.

44
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:50.520
But the [inaudible],
uh,
was not,
you know,
it was,
it was a mix.

45
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.410
It wasn't exactly Mexican.
It wasn't exactly us.
So,
um,

46
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.040
when I,
when I,
when I saw Mexico City,
I've,
I decided I had to live there,

47
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.340
of course.
And so I went back to the Quanah,
picked up my stuff and just,

48
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.180
I've been there 20 years.
That's the personal side.
Um,

49
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.900
musically I was,
uh,
I started,
uh,

50
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.390
studying classical piano when I was eight.

51
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.520
My parents thought it would be good for us to not watch too much TV.
So,
you know,

52
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.570
they had a studying piano and,
uh,
all kinds of lessons,
belay,

53
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.720
belay at painting,
whatever,
whatever came to their minds.

54
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.950
And I was terrible at everything.

55
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.570
And for some reason I came out being really good at music.
So,
uh,

56
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.550
so,
you know,
I,
I,
I started studying,
um,

57
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.910
I studied classical,
like what's he say,

58
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.310
blessing to be the wireless particular classes,
uh,

59
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.230
for like eight years.
And then,
um,

60
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.840
I started playing in bands when I was in high school.

61
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:53.260
A friend of mine invited me to a band as a keyboard player.
And,
uh,

62
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.450
I discovered,
you know,
improvisation and singing and just kind of,

63
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.420
you know,
it was,
it was a completely different path.

64
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.260
And the important thing for me there was that I'd discovered songwriting.

65
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.440
And that was basically what made me shift my path completely.

66
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.670
And I started doing songwriting after that.
And also at the same time,

67
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:19.360
I started doing music,
music for theater.

68
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.250
So it was instrumental and it was also songs.
And so I kept on developing that.

69
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:29.170
And then,
um,
by the time I was,
um,
what,
like 22,

70
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.780
that's when I went to Mexico City.
Um,

71
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.030
I was still kind of searching for what I wanted.

72
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.090
I kept on putting bands together because I always thought I had to be in a band

73
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.950
and it didn't,
it never worked out.

74
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.440
I always like did a lot of writing with a few different people.
And when I,

75
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.460
when I got to Mexico City,

76
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:48.880
I actually put posters up trying to get a band together that way.

77
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.710
We did it before,
like Internet,

78
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.940
<v 3>you modern people would know about that.
I did like</v>

79
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.360
<v 2>prison record stores and stuff like that and I put a band together and it didn't</v>

80
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:03.860
work out either.
But in one of those shows I met,
uh,
uh,
two,

81
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.410
three of the guys from [inaudible],

82
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.970
which was really important for me because I started going out with one of them

83
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.430
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

84
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.210
<v 2>so it was fairly important for him because,
um,</v>

85
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.370
she's someone who really influenced me in saying like,

86
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:22.040
why do you want to keep putting bands together?
It just do your thing.

87
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:24.560
You have these great songs I can in your drawer,

88
00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:27.560
but you keep putting bands together and making other songs and it's just like,

89
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.310
and I always dreamed of getting an accordion.
It was always like my dream.

90
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:34.380
And he was like,
he pushed me into like,
just get you a cornea,

91
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.870
need a drum machine and leave me alone.

92
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.950
<v 3>So</v>

93
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.490
<v 2>I got,</v>

94
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.540
so I started doing shows by myself with just piano accordion and a drum machine.

95
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.290
I started opening for a bunch of bands in Mexico City and I actually did a,

96
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.990
like an eight track demo,
which was a big deal then.
And uh,

97
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.080
a lot of people started like,
uh,

98
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.400
giving it to friends and it kind of became a walk.
I walk,
I like,
oh,

99
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:02.450
there's this girl,
she plays accordion and she's sayings.
And um,

100
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.040
and that way I started,
I started playing with a few musician friends and uh,

101
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.350
woo in those shows.
I Dunno,
things started happening really quickly.

102
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:15.140
All of a sudden,
nothing happened for ages for a long time.

103
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:19.520
But then all of a sudden people started showing up to my shows and record labels

104
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.650
started showing up to Michelle,
the people from record labels,

105
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.390
like three different record labels were interested.
They,

106
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.460
they'd heard the demo and um,
and you know,
one thing,

107
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.080
<v 3>do another and here we are now.
Okay.</v>

108
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.440
I got signed.
I,
I,
I uh,
yeah,

109
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.600
<v 2>and that was a long time ago.
That was almost what,
like a long time ago.</v>

110
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.080
It must've been like an I got signed I think in like [inaudible] 95,

111
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.640
96 or something.
And then after that it's been like,

112
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.410
I mean I put two albums that were not so well known outside of Mexico,

113
00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:57.330
which were our key in one Bento and,
but I was touring a lot anyway and,

114
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.830
but I really want it to tour more.

115
00:06:58.831 --> 00:07:01.560
I felt like I was just kind of touring around Mexico,

116
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:03.180
but it was really hard for me to leave.

117
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.370
And also I had this sort of revelation between my second and my third album.

118
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:11.340
I had like a year where I had this sort of crisis,

119
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.150
like what kind of songwriter do I really want to be?
Do I really want to be this,

120
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.110
um,
very experimental sort of song writer?

121
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.960
Do I want to or do I want to express and communicate more with people?

122
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.320
And that was like a year of,
you know,

123
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.550
thinking and writing and having this super crisis and what do I want?

124
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:30.460
Because uh,

125
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.830
my second album had been a really critically acclaimed but very difficult album

126
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.510
in every sense.
Recording.
It was difficult.
I'm touring with,
with difficult,

127
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:41.610
it was just like really?
And I was like,

128
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.500
maybe I'm taking the wrong sort of path.

129
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:48.600
Maybe I'd want something else as a song writer,

130
00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:53.601
I wanted to do songs that were more con that connected differently with people,

131
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.631
you know,

132
00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:59.631
not like one day I remember being on the stage and sort of playing my super

133
00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:03.420
complicated and wonderful songs and somebody and I just felt like people would

134
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:04.550
just kind of staring at me like,

135
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.980
<v 3>who is this Marcia?
And I just kind of wanted,</v>

136
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.920
<v 2>you know,
I want to connect.
That's what music is about.
Communication.</v>

137
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:16.370
And that's what I wanted.
And so that took a lot of,
you know,

138
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.190
self analyzing and I never believed in analysis.

139
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:23.840
So actually I had did my own self analysis and that's how I,
you know,

140
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:25.160
I started writing c,

141
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:27.530
which was my third album and that was kind of a breakthrough.

142
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.490
I think that was the first time that I actually,
uh,
went,
uh,

143
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.480
into the radio that I started actually sounding in the radio that people were

144
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:39.170
like,
uh,
people thought,
a lot of people think that's my first album,

145
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.920
but that's my third album.
Okay.
So,
uh,
you know,
after that,

146
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.860
a lot of things have happened,
but that was our,
that was already a while ago.

147
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:48.680
That was in 2003.
So it's been a while

148
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.600
<v 3>perfect on it.</v>

149
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.840
And I think you're doing a fantastic job just connecting with people with your

150
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:55.980
music.
You can feel it when you,
when

151
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.730
<v 0>you hear your songs.
Um,
and one of the themes that I'm hearing in,
in,</v>

152
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:03.950
in your career is this sense of,
of,
um,

153
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.670
just being persistent,
right?
Like,

154
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:09.540
even if things were not happening at the beginning,
even if,

155
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.190
if there was a dry fail,
try again.
Um,

156
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.740
and then if the,
the it actually happened,
I mean,

157
00:09:17.741 --> 00:09:20.610
it became a very big success for you.

158
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.070
Can you tell us a little bit about how,

159
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.360
how you were thinking about this process of I need to get up,
try again,

160
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:31.230
try something different.
Really find myself going to even self analysis.

161
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.250
<v 2>Amen.
Well,
then what happens,</v>

162
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:39.390
I think is that I really enjoy the process of things.
I don't believe in,

163
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.310
you know,
this is what I have to be by this time.
This is what I really love,

164
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:49.050
the process of how you become who you are in,
in,
in every sense.

165
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:53.340
Even now that I've already put out like seven or eight albums that I've been

166
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:54.570
touring forever,
that I,

167
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.890
I enjoy what I do also because I enjoy every bit of what I do,

168
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:01.860
every different part,
what it means to do what I do,

169
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:03.930
which is every time I finished the tour,

170
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:07.890
I dedicate myself like four months to just writing.
I didn't do anything else.
Um,

171
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.210
and then when I'm touring,
I just really enjoy the tour itself.
I enjoy the shows.

172
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.840
I enjoy like that connection with people.
Um,

173
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.190
I think the important thing is that it's not only the thing about,
uh,

174
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.970
how you get to where you want to get to,
but it's just like the whole,

175
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.540
the whole learning experience in the whole learning process,

176
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:30.060
which I think is really a constant thing.

177
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.940
It's not something that starts and ends when you get what you want.

178
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.130
You are always sort of learning from what you,

179
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:37.050
even when you get what you want me to start learning,

180
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.610
you still wonder if that was the right thing and you,
you know,
you keep going.

181
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:46.440
And I think what I really like to do is just ask questions all the time about

182
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:50.520
what I really want.
And I'm very curious about,
um,

183
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.340
about songwriting and I'm still curious about it.

184
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:55.650
I've gotten about getting into the studio and see what happens.

185
00:10:55.651 --> 00:11:00.540
And it's not just,
you know,
oh no,
it's like a sort of like a routine thing.

186
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.890
I still feel the same,
uh,
nerves,
the same,

187
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.230
um,
intensity of,
of,

188
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:12.430
of trying a new song and just putting it together and then arranging it and then

189
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.830
going to the studio and in producing it,
it's just all like,
uh,

190
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.470
it's still sort of new in a way for me.
You know,

191
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.280
if when I started actually doing it,
I don't feel like I know the steps in.

192
00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:26.130
I really prefer it that way because,
um,
I dunno.

193
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:30.060
I always think that it's better to forget what you learn and keep learning.

194
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.800
Even if you have to relearn.
It's actually better.
It's a better feeling.

195
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:36.420
And I've always let my,

196
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.520
let myself be guided by my intuition more than what I know,

197
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.270
you know,
more than what I've learned.
It's more like what is my,
you know,

198
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.850
sort of instinct telling me to do at this moment.

199
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.770
I know and that's something I ask myself all the time.

200
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.990
<v 0>That sounds great then I think it's great.</v>

201
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.120
And as part of all this on just redefining yourself,
just keep asking questions.

202
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.740
It sounds that along the way there were also some opportunities and some

203
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:07.150
challenges that you might have faced being Mexican American and then just trying

204
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:09.460
to break into an international market.

205
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.710
Can you tell us how you were thinking about that process of,
of,
oh wait,

206
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.300
maybe this is becoming something big or do I want to go that way?

207
00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:21.310
Do I want to hold the date?
How do I want to,
to,

208
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.990
to think about myself in the future if there is no,
not a lot of,
I mean,

209
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.940
a point a and I want to get to point B.

210
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:32.530
It's more a self reflection along the way.
How did this process happen to you?

211
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:38.120
<v 2>Well,
um,
when,
when I think about the whole,
uh,</v>

212
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.670
my career in the sense of maybe when I found myself,
uh,

213
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.030
people ask me a lot of why,
why I don't sing in English,
for example.

214
00:12:47.031 --> 00:12:48.890
I think the language has been,
um,

215
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.470
something that's been very important for me because,
um,

216
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.010
even though I grew up in a,
in a border city,
even if I'm bilingual,

217
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.150
I'm writing in Spanish to me is much more natural.

218
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.010
I mean I've never tried running an English really.

219
00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:02.930
And it's not something that I know that now it's,

220
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.260
I see a lot of artists who find it more natural.
And I think it's great,

221
00:13:06.261 --> 00:13:10.430
especially when you're live in the u s who speak Spanish,
you speak English.

222
00:13:10.431 --> 00:13:15.170
But my mom always spoke to me in Spanish,
you know,
and,
and my boyfriends,

223
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.320
everything,
every,
my emotional life has been constructed in a telecon,

224
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.710
Sweden.
Hispaniola so for me,
writing has to do with my own language.

225
00:13:24.711 --> 00:13:26.690
So at one point,
yeah,
they started asking me like,

226
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.960
are you going to do like a crossover?
And I'm like,

227
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.740
I would like people to cross over to my side language,
you know,

228
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.690
this is what I celebrate when I write a song.
And I think part of the,

229
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.670
the search for me,

230
00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:45.500
because I'm influenced by a lot of books in English and obviously musicians in

231
00:13:45.501 --> 00:13:49.720
English and the English language is very present in my life at least.
And,

232
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.290
but when I sit down to write,

233
00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:55.160
it's more connected with my emotions or Spanish is much more connected to my

234
00:13:55.161 --> 00:13:57.860
emotions.
So,
so I find it a lot more natural.

235
00:13:57.861 --> 00:14:02.660
I think that's the only place where I found like,
uh,
uh,
at one point,

236
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.850
um,
when I put out my fourth album with money style,

237
00:14:05.851 --> 00:14:09.330
it's just started getting super big and it started like,
yeah,
we're going to,

238
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.140
it's starting to grow louder.
We want to do more of Europe,

239
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.930
we want to go to Germany and we want to do,
go to Italy.

240
00:14:14.931 --> 00:14:19.850
And when it started just kind of like growing a lot.
And at one point,
um,

241
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.300
you know,
things started coming up like,
oh,
you know,
to sound in Germany,

242
00:14:23.301 --> 00:14:25.390
you have to do this,
you have to have somebody else to,

243
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:28.550
an arrangement for the song and you have to do this.
If you want to,
you know,

244
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:32.060
sound in Portugal,
you have to do a duet with this artists you've never even met.

245
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.630
You don't even know and you have to do it.
And I was like,
you know what?

246
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:38.840
Let's just let it flow.
You know,
let's let it be natural.

247
00:14:38.841 --> 00:14:42.540
If it's not going to happen,
it's not going to happen.
Maybe I needed a,

248
00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:45.380
an extra bit of ambition that I didn't really have because I,

249
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.750
I kind of enjoyed when I was doing and I was like,

250
00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:50.930
if people want to listen to what I do the way I do it,
it's,

251
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.760
but I don't want to like sort of invent something that I'm not to sound in

252
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.000
radio.
And you know,
somewhere else we rental,

253
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:03.170
he did go to Germany to do a tour and it was great and we eventually did go to

254
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.230
Italy to determine,
you know,
it eventually things happened,

255
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:10.100
but it didn't happen like at the point where everybody wanted them to happen.

256
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:13.910
Like,
yes,
now is the moment where Europe is going to be taken,
you know?

257
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:15.910
<v 0>Huh.</v>

258
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.880
<v 2>No,
I mean,
let's just kind of let it flow and let's,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

259
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:23.060
I just don't think that,
that I,
I really needed that.

260
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.240
And I don't call myself not ambitious because I am,

261
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:28.910
I mean the fact that I'm doing music and then I'm still doing it now means that,

262
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.470
I guess I do.
And I think we all need a little bit of ambition in our lives.

263
00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:36.680
You know,
to do anything,
anything at all.
It's like,
you know,

264
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:38.420
you wake up in the morning and you say,

265
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:42.320
I want to get up and do something that requires some sort of ambition,
you know,

266
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.870
and sort of growing and learning and all that.

267
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.490
But at one point you wonder like how far you want to take things.

268
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:53.650
And I was like,
this is all that I am.
I can't be more than I am.

269
00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:57.590
I can invent somebody that I'm not.
So,
you know,
this is as far as I'll go.

270
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.990
And then we'll see what happens.
Of course.
And

271
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.071
<v 0>I think the,</v>

272
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:04.320
the organic growth that you were mentioning that without making a lot of

273
00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:08.610
sacrifices actually makes your music and you as,
as an artist,

274
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.440
very authentic brewery.
You know,

275
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.080
and just taking a quick look around the group here,

276
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.870
I know the majority of the posterior cord Latinos,

277
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.400
Lamar Habla Espanol problem and Oh,
but I even see,
for instance,

278
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.350
people from Germany here in the auditorium,
which is really,
really fantastic.

279
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.270
Um,
and as part of,
of all these cultural interaction.
Yeah.

280
00:16:30.271 --> 00:16:34.260
It's funny that you mentioned Germany,
um,
as fourth of these,
these,
um,

281
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:39.180
multicultural interaction of understanding what specific to every market,

282
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.900
what needs to be adjusted so that you can be successful as Latinos,

283
00:16:45.031 --> 00:16:46.500
many of us know the,
the,
the,

284
00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:50.550
the big challenges that we see just going international,

285
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.760
being successful.
They,
they sometimes the stereotypes and all that.

286
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.630
And I think we're,
we're all very conscious about that.
Um,

287
00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.310
so rather than asking you about those challenges,

288
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:02.340
how allowed to ask you about the opportunities,

289
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.360
what do you see as an opportunity for,
for being Latino yet?
For instance,

290
00:17:06.361 --> 00:17:10.410
I seen your career,
there were a lot of partnerships along the way.

291
00:17:10.411 --> 00:17:14.640
People who also being Latinos,
they,
they,
they help you along the way.
They,

292
00:17:14.641 --> 00:17:18.590
maybe they,
they duck you,
hey,
we should do this or we should do,

293
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.640
I dunno for him up and simple like that.

294
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.450
Can you talk a little bit more about that positive side that you see us

295
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.480
something very special and unique of the Latino culture?

296
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.060
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
the family.
I think that,
uh,
Latin America has,
uh,</v>

297
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.550
we're all connected not only through our language but also culturally.

298
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:43.260
We are all,
we're all have this,
we're all very complex countries.
You know,
we've,

299
00:17:43.261 --> 00:17:48.261
we've had very complex histories and we're racially very diverse in,

300
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.140
in,
in a different sense than how it is here in the United States.

301
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:54.030
You know what I mean?
In Mexico.

302
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.560
[inaudible] in a lot of the countries,
most countries in Latin America,

303
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.500
we're very much a mixed cultures.
And,

304
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.010
and we grew up with a sort of a richness and also with a sort of,
uh,

305
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:11.060
with all this like great history and terrible history of conquest.

306
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:14.820
But also that is what made us,
we are right.
So,
uh,

307
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:20.510
I do think that we have that in common and culturally that makes us very,

308
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:26.040
I think each one has their own identity and very proud identities.

309
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.630
And I mean for,
for example,
in Mexico,
I think that we are,

310
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:31.261
I mean,

311
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:36.261
I think Mexico is just like a brilliant and amazing and surprising country even

312
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:37.560
with all our problems.

313
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:40.410
And I speak of Mexico in particular because I don't like to speak so much,

314
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.930
just so generally at the same time,

315
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:45.570
we're very corrupt and we have a lot of problems and allowed.

316
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.410
That's where a lot of people just have the need to leave and try out,
you know,

317
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.370
like tried to make things happen for them in a different place.
Um,

318
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.990
because there's also like a lot of poverty,
a lot of,
uh,
violence.

319
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:01.170
There's many things that make,
uh,
our,

320
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.790
our country are very,
um,
mixed place.
Um,

321
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.350
it's beautiful.
It's,
uh,
I haven't been able to leave and I don't want to leave.

322
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:12.540
The other day somebody was asking me,
why don't you come here?
You know,

323
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:16.530
like to the u s it's just,
you have,
because I have a two nationalities,
right?

324
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:17.470
So it's like,
you know,

325
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.520
<v 0>but,</v>

326
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.530
<v 2>uh,
I'm in love with that city.</v>

327
00:19:23.531 --> 00:19:26.790
I want to educate my daughter in that country and I want to,
or,
you know,

328
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.640
I want her to be proud of her country,
you know?
And,

329
00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:33.420
and it's a beautiful place.
It's beautiful.
And,

330
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.180
and it's also heartbreaking sometimes to see a lot of the things that are

331
00:19:37.181 --> 00:19:37.810
happening.

332
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.110
And I've written a lot about that in some of my songs and it's always present

333
00:19:41.111 --> 00:19:43.650
because it's sort of like a different,
uh,

334
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.360
pain that you feel maybe in a different,
uh,

335
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.890
love that also you feel for that place,
for the people that we are.

336
00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:53.950
And I think that's something that a lot of people share in different countries

337
00:19:53.951 --> 00:19:58.951
in Latin America that you have this sort of love and fear and at the same time

338
00:19:59.411 --> 00:20:00.280
hope you know,

339
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.900
all the things coming together and working out for everybody of course.

340
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.410
<v 0>And being from Mexico City,
I might be slightly biased,
but yeah,
I agree with you.</v>

341
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:13.820
It's a fantastic city to live in and everybody should go and LBC time.
Um,

342
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.650
but,
but it's also,
there's one thing that you touched on that I think it's,

343
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.340
it's very specific to two Mexican direct sample,

344
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.510
but it also happens or happened in other Latin American countries.

345
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.830
There is these,
these CD,

346
00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:33.770
these countries certainly not perfect.

347
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.450
It's far from it.
We,
we know the,
the,
the huge problems.

348
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.360
But there are in,
in society,
in government,
in,
in,
in,

349
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.650
in every aspect of everyday life.
However,

350
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.890
that doesn't mean you don't love the country.

351
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:51.580
That doesn't mean you don't absolutely love the cedia.
Unlike returning there,

352
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:54.150
unlike stablish in your entire life there.

353
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.130
And I think that's what sets many Latin American cultures support.

354
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.740
There is this law,
their seas familiar feeling of everywhere we go.

355
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.570
These cast,
um,

356
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.370
modify the rain away shaped the way you do.

357
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.950
Do the music that what you think about your career and everything,
um,

358
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.490
as compared to any other international artists you might know?

359
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.810
<v 2>Um,
I'm not sure.
I mean I can't really compare myself with other artists.</v>

360
00:21:23.811 --> 00:21:27.980
I mean I can say,
oh,
I did it like this when they did it like that.
It's uh,

361
00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.040
I think everybody is,
um,

362
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.150
everybody's music has to do with their identity in one way or another.

363
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.520
No matter what style you make,
it's personal.
It's always personal.

364
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.790
So it's always about who you are,
where you're from,
what's your,

365
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.030
what's your history like what you like to look at in your own country or another

366
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.940
countries,
you know.
Um,
for me,
making music has to do with my route.

367
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.450
And that's not,
not only in the obvious sense,

368
00:21:53.451 --> 00:21:55.900
which is like folklore and Mexican,
uh,
from Lord.

369
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.150
It's also a in every sense culturally.
Um,

370
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.510
the way that I think has to do with the fact that I'm from Tijuana but I went to

371
00:22:02.511 --> 00:22:05.600
Mexico.
All my decisions have been based on the fact that I am who I am.

372
00:22:05.601 --> 00:22:09.470
And I think that music is made that way.
Everything our art is made that way.

373
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.720
It's personal.
So it,

374
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.770
you're kind of telling your own story and your music and I can use it,

375
00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:19.340
for example,
in a song I'll put in the super Nathaniel accordion,

376
00:22:19.341 --> 00:22:22.610
but I also like to put in like something like a super,

377
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.090
a synthesizer and mix it up.

378
00:22:26.091 --> 00:22:28.130
And because that's the person that I am,
you know,

379
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:31.400
maybe it sounds kind of schizophrenia when you talk about it conceptually,

380
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.280
but for me it works.
You know,
I don't,

381
00:22:34.281 --> 00:22:38.150
I don't find it to be shot and in the song and it works.

382
00:22:38.151 --> 00:22:42.140
And I think that has to do with the fact that I'm from Tijuana and I grew up

383
00:22:42.141 --> 00:22:42.681
listening to,

384
00:22:42.681 --> 00:22:47.300
I mean my mom would sing dealers and latte on her way to school every morning.

385
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.260
Tracy.
It's kind of funny,

386
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.650
but she did every morning he should do,
could be clear.

387
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.260
So,
you know,
it's not so bad,
you know,

388
00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:04.600
it's not so far away from my telling him that I mixed that,
you know,

389
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.170
and an accordion and a really like a melodic sort of idea.

390
00:23:10.171 --> 00:23:13.770
And I find the festivity of the accordion,
uh,

391
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.890
has to do with my character,
you know?
And,

392
00:23:15.891 --> 00:23:20.610
and also the seriousness of a piano or this year is,
is I kind of,

393
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.490
and I think that we're all telling our own stories.

394
00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:27.420
You know what I'm kind of telling my stories in my songs and every story that I

395
00:23:27.421 --> 00:23:31.890
tell in my lyrics are also musically the why did I decide to dress up?

396
00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:36.450
The song has to do with who I am.
So,
yes,
I think that definitely,
um,

397
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:41.690
Mexico and also us and also the Quanta and also my family and whatever it is

398
00:23:42.781 --> 00:23:44.020
that I'm feeling at that moment.

399
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:46.610
It has to do with what I'm doing when I'm writing course.

400
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.800
<v 0>It is the accordion your favorite instrument?</v>

401
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:55.380
<v 2>Well,
actually,
um,
we'll keep this a secret,
but my favorite,</v>

402
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.760
my favorite instrument is a piano.
I'm,
I'm actually,
I always say that I'm a,

403
00:23:59.761 --> 00:24:01.760
I'm a,
um,

404
00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:06.860
I'm a [inaudible] and a pianist dressed up as an accordion player because I'm

405
00:24:07.891 --> 00:24:12.600
actually a pianist.
I write in the piano.
Um,
actually when I write songs now,

406
00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:15.000
I used to do it differently but it's always been changing.

407
00:24:15.001 --> 00:24:18.750
But now I sit down at the piano with nothing but my phone.

408
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.880
And I do my,
and I write songs on piano and maybe I'll use a drum machine,

409
00:24:23.881 --> 00:24:25.170
but it's mostly just piano.

410
00:24:25.171 --> 00:24:30.171
And after that I'll start building the song up and sometimes I'll use accordion,

411
00:24:30.631 --> 00:24:33.660
sometimes I won't.
It's more like a for ranging.

412
00:24:33.661 --> 00:24:37.590
I love arranging and also I love to play it in,
in the stage because it's so fun.

413
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.960
You know,
it's like you bring up the accordion is like,
yeah,

414
00:24:39.961 --> 00:24:41.420
it's like bringing up in like a last over something.

415
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.070
<v 0>It's really fun.</v>

416
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.280
<v 2>Uh,
it,
it,
it's,
I think that's what the shows are about.</v>

417
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:53.150
It's about fun and also just kind of making it like all different kinds of

418
00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:53.990
feelings,
you know,

419
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:57.300
you go and I think definitely the accordion bring sort of like a festive in,

420
00:24:57.301 --> 00:25:01.880
in sort of a common alegria joy,
a joyous feeling for me,
you know?

421
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.600
<v 0>Perfect.
And don't worry,
we'll keep this a secret.
Okay.
Thanks.</v>

422
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.430
Disregarding the fact that he's,

423
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.000
this is going to be posted in talks at Google and the youtube channel.

424
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.430
Other than that,
it's a secret between you and me,
um,

425
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.860
with,
with this duality that,

426
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.450
that you're talking about and I think it reflects on a lot of the music that you

427
00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:27.500
do right there.
It's the seriousness of the,
of the piano,

428
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:29.810
but then bringing out the accordion and as you mentioned,

429
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:31.360
is like bringing the last or two to,

430
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.290
to somebody who plays the seriousness of classic piano music.
Um,

431
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.000
is that how you always see things?
He is that,

432
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.750
do we try to mix all of these different elements?

433
00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:47.870
He what works better in every single case and then just do it.

434
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:51.740
Is that a conscious process or is it yours?
However it's coming for you.

435
00:25:51.741 --> 00:25:53.450
And what do you feel in the moment?

436
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.310
<v 2>Well,
we come,
we come back to the,
to the idea that I said before,
it's,</v>

437
00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.750
it's intuition.
I keep letting intuition and sort of guide me.

438
00:26:01.751 --> 00:26:04.510
I don't like,
I'm not conceptual in that sense.

439
00:26:04.511 --> 00:26:09.040
It's not like it started writing a song and think this has to be this sort of

440
00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:12.820
song and it has to finish sounding like this.
I never really know.
It's very,

441
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.930
it's very organic.
I started serving,
I always say it's like knitting,
breading,

442
00:26:16.931 --> 00:26:17.741
a song,
you know,

443
00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:20.960
you put the verse and you kind of bring it onto something else and you,

444
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.780
it's sort of like a live process.
You don't really know what's going to happen.

445
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.700
And it happens when I'm writing a song,

446
00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:29.570
I know it also happens when I'm arranging it.

447
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:33.700
It's sort of a live thing you do.
It's,
and that's,

448
00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.050
I think that's the magic of it.

449
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.250
And that's why I keep on doing it because it's so,
um,
it's,

450
00:26:39.251 --> 00:26:42.970
come on,
you don't know what's going to happen,
you know,
and I'm predictable.

451
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.650
So I think that's,
that's what I really like about it.
I don't,

452
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.160
I don't think that after,
I mean I now I know that I can run,

453
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.040
I can sit down and write a song because I used to be like very doubtful.

454
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:57.720
I'm always,
I was a skeptic in every sense of it took me years to,
to,
you know,

455
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:01.620
kind of figuring out why people are going to my shows.
It took me years to say,

456
00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:02.610
yeah,
okay,
yeah,

457
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:07.611
I put some albums out and I've never really believed the whole thing.

458
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:11.130
You know?
It's always like,
yeah,
this is who I am.
But it doesn't mean that,

459
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.150
you know,
nothing is going to happen.
And then,
and I'd always say like,
well,

460
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:18.210
I'm not sure if when I sit down I'm going to actually come up with a song.

461
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.043
But now,
you know,

462
00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.710
after this time I know that I am going to come up with a song because I like it

463
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:25.320
and I'm going to sit there until I do.
And I'm very like,

464
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.060
and also that I'm very disciplined.
I mean when I sit down to write,
it's like,
um,

465
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.920
I do like I do the nine to five.
Excellent.
And that's what I do.
I mean,
I,

466
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.340
I stopped the tour.
I don't,
um,

467
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.490
I don't like trying to write when I'm traveling.
When I'm traveling,

468
00:27:41.491 --> 00:27:45.570
I like to read,
I read all the time.
Um,
but when I,

469
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.830
when I'm writing,
it's like nine to five thing.
I've stopped for lunch.
But I,

470
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.130
and also having a daughter,

471
00:27:51.131 --> 00:27:53.760
it makes me more disciplined in that sense because you used to be,

472
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:57.360
when I was going to write an album,
I could take like,
you know,

473
00:27:57.361 --> 00:28:00.420
the the day and sort of just read and then go to the piano.

474
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:03.720
But now I know that I have those hours.
And for her it's also easier to fit,

475
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.960
you know,
to say,
okay,
you're done at this time and we can just hang out.
And,

476
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.920
and for me it's like I can disconnect and just be where I am.
Yeah,

477
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.360
<v 0>of course.
It's funny that you mentioned that because at least for me,</v>

478
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:19.620
from an external point of view of Nora musician or a songwriter,
not an artist,

479
00:28:19.621 --> 00:28:22.440
certainly even though I played piano,
but that's about it.

480
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.200
For a lot of people outside these,
the,
these artist environment,

481
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.510
it sounds like it's a matter of inspiration.

482
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:34.560
Like you're basically walking down life and then inspiration comes and you're

483
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:38.620
like,
I need a piece of paper and then start writing down.
Uh,

484
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.310
but it turns out that's not the case with you,
that,
that you do the,
the,

485
00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:46.770
the formal IC down and then at some point ideas are going to come.

486
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.490
Is that typical for everybody who,
who grinds songs?

487
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:52.110
Is that specific to Kalita

488
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.650
<v 2>how's that?
I think everybody's different too,
right?</v>

489
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.530
I don't know how other people write songs.
Um,

490
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.680
I've never had that miracle.
You know,
that,
that idea that,
you know,

491
00:29:03.681 --> 00:29:06.110
will just come to my head and I have a song in my head,

492
00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:08.600
let me sit down and write it.
No,
I have to,
I have to,

493
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.970
I have to kind of search for it.
And,
uh,
I like it that way because it's,
um,

494
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.920
at first you're kind of fearful of when you sit down and you see the blank

495
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.860
notebook because also I don't even have lyrics when I sit down.
I don't,

496
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.360
I read everything together.

497
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.590
I maybe I'll have like one line or something and I'll start working with that.

498
00:29:24.591 --> 00:29:28.640
But usually,
um,
it all comes up together.
I mean,

499
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.760
I'll just kind of like,
I started with,

500
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:36.070
I started with one line and that'll bring me onto the rest of it.

501
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.940
It's,
and so,
um,
I think other people,

502
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:43.600
I mean,
I'm sure there are people who ride on tour,

503
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:48.730
people who like to wait for the songs to come,
you know?
But I really,

504
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.360
I liked the fact that I can sit down and,
you know,

505
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:54.730
find something because also if nothing comes up,

506
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:57.640
I'll just keep on playing the piano.
And,
which is something that I really enjoy.

507
00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.550
It's a different thing.
And also,
uh,
it's like,

508
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:03.010
I don't like to feel like I'm searching for the song.
I'm just like,

509
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:07.660
I'm going to play,
let it come,
you know,
and that kind of thing.
So,
uh,
but yeah,

510
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:08.410
really,
I really,

511
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.070
it's just that I've always been very much in love with the piano and playing the

512
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:14.200
piano is also kind of therapeutic for me.

513
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:17.620
I mean it's Kinda sit down and improvise all the time.
I,
I mean,
I do,

514
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.680
I do read notes and I do some exercises to warm up my hands and kind of like,

515
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.520
but,
um,
but also just kind of like to improvise.

516
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.960
Perfect.
And I want to be conscious of the time.
I think we,
we have them,

517
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:35.780
we might open the floor to,
to a couple of questions from the other cities,

518
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.920
but that's fine with you.
Um,
just a quick question before that.

519
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:40.320
What's your favorite [inaudible]

520
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.410
I don't have a favorite.
Couldn't get the song.
It's crazy.
Um,

521
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.430
when I finished my album,
I'm serious on that.
You're looking at me like,

522
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.160
oh my gosh,
she's crazy.
No,
I'm,
I'm curious.
Um,

523
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.910
I,
whenever I bet I finished an album that I've,
I mean when I'm writing,

524
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:02.830
maybe I'll have a favorite,
like for a day or two.

525
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.920
And then I come up with another one,
which is my favorite and then that,
um,

526
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.410
but when I finished an album,
I actually,

527
00:31:10.411 --> 00:31:13.980
when I'm done with the whole writing process in producing it and I'll listen to

528
00:31:13.981 --> 00:31:15.540
it obsessively,
I'll be all day,

529
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:17.880
like wondering if that's the right way to structure it,

530
00:31:17.881 --> 00:31:21.270
if that's the right way to do it and blah,
blah,
blah.
And when I'm done with it,

531
00:31:21.271 --> 00:31:24.540
it's like,
okay,
I'm done.
That's it.
I never listened to it again.

532
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.200
I might listen to a song when I'm,
I'm trying to,
uh,

533
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.180
to bring it back for a show or,
you know,
and,

534
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.310
but I'm very,
very lazy about listening to my own song.
No answer.

535
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.150
This is like looking into a mirror,
you know,
you're look into a mirror.
Yeah.

536
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:44.270
You use it,
you know,
you weren't makeup,
whatever.
You comb your hair,

537
00:31:44.271 --> 00:31:47.840
you shave or whatever,
and then that's it.
There's no surprises there.

538
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.900
And for me listening to music has to do with,
wow,

539
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.390
how do they come up with that or oh,
you know,

540
00:31:53.391 --> 00:31:57.440
just being like moved by somebody by their story,

541
00:31:57.441 --> 00:31:59.960
by what's happening to you at that moment.

542
00:31:59.961 --> 00:32:02.840
And that happens to me with other people's music,
not with mine.

543
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.100
It's okay.
Perfectly.

544
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.900
Let's open it up for audience questions.

545
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.310
<v 4>Um,
um,
I always a thing.
So</v>

546
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.550
yeah,
I always say is,
uh,
before uh,
clean and Mexican.

547
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.910
I am from the corner and I am the same as you.

548
00:32:22.911 --> 00:32:25.700
I was born in the u s but I grew up in,
in Mexico.

549
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.750
And my comment or question is related to that.
Um,

550
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:34.520
I have the feeling that,
um,
for many of,

551
00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.910
or people that come from Latin American countries,

552
00:32:37.911 --> 00:32:41.000
people focus the negative part.
And it's true.

553
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:44.330
We are not blind to what's going on,
but there's so many things,

554
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:47.690
positives about every place in this planet that,

555
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.320
that I always find it a little bit sad.
I don't get offended because I know,
but,

556
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:57.250
but um,
can you share with us something that you really liked from Tijuana?

557
00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.740
Like I can tell you that,
that nothing beats a concert in Tijuana.

558
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.780
Like broken espanol in Tijuana is the best thing in the world.
Yeah,

559
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.060
<v 2>no,
definitely.
I think,
um,</v>

560
00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.840
I think the corners is very unique place.
That's,

561
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.590
that's what it has that you don't realize it when you're growing up there,

562
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.170
but how different it is from any other city,
either in the US or in Mexico.

563
00:33:17.171 --> 00:33:21.130
It has nothing to do with also not even with any other border city.

564
00:33:21.131 --> 00:33:23.240
I love border cities and that's something that I,

565
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.800
whenever I'm in a board of surgery,
I feel like I can understand,
you know,

566
00:33:26.801 --> 00:33:30.310
the idea of living between two countries always.
Um,

567
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.620
but I think definitely the one is very special border because it's part of the

568
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:37.230
California.
Well,
I mean come on and you know,
the,

569
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.910
the coast is beautiful and the food,

570
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.560
the food is definitely amazing.
So yeah,
I would,
I would,

571
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.920
I really love having grown up there.
I think,
I don't think I could,

572
00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.610
I could possibly choose any other city because also when I got to Mexico City,

573
00:33:51.611 --> 00:33:55.270
people found me to be a bit of a marsh and being no tenure because North tenured

574
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.080
and people from the north of the country,
we're very direct.
We're dislike.

575
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.320
This is what I'm thinking.
And it comes out like that.

576
00:34:02.321 --> 00:34:04.330
And in Mexico City I always,

577
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.010
I had a hard time getting adapted to the way that people are.
They're very,

578
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.270
so they go around,
they don't say what they're thinking and we're all like,

579
00:34:13.271 --> 00:34:18.220
nothing is,
are like,
yeah,
just say it.
You know?
So yeah,
definitely.
I think,

580
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:18.491
yeah.

581
00:34:18.491 --> 00:34:23.491
And I think that the public in the corner just like crazy and grades and I

582
00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:26.890
always like,
and my family lives there actually,

583
00:34:26.891 --> 00:34:29.860
they're still live between the quantum San Diego.
Part of them live in San Diego,

584
00:34:29.861 --> 00:34:33.440
part of them.
Some of them go to school and the coin and live in Tijuana.

585
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:37.630
Others work in San Diego and live in coin.
It's kind of like,
you know,
both sides.

586
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.250
Um,
actually this is like way that I would like to 10,
that comment,

587
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:45.910
which is a friend of mine came with me to decline or one day to visit and she

588
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.910
hadn't been there before and I was like,
you can't do the cornea have to come.

589
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:51.850
And she came and she didn't bring her passport and I'm like,

590
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.480
you came without your passport.
I mean,
what?
She's like,

591
00:34:55.481 --> 00:34:57.130
I thought we would come to the quantum like,
yeah,

592
00:34:57.131 --> 00:35:00.880
but coming to the white Annise all the crossing to San Diego.
So I'm like,

593
00:35:00.881 --> 00:35:04.000
you're going to,
you're going to get to know like half the city now.
It's like,

594
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:04.421
you know,

595
00:35:04.421 --> 00:35:07.070
it's sort of like the whole experience kind of goes together with [inaudible],

596
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.890
you know?
So yeah,
that was,
yeah,
it was kind of mad,

597
00:35:11.891 --> 00:35:14.350
but I was like,
sorry,
I didn't explain.
I thought you knew.

598
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.920
<v 4>Um,
I also,
I'm a big fun and,</v>

599
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.240
uh,
I'm not from Tijuana,
but I live in Santa Anna and I'm from Mexico City.

600
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:31.160
So I relate to many of the things you said.
Um,
I have two questions.

601
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:35.360
One is that you said before that you want to educate your,

602
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.740
your child in city.

603
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.970
<v 2>I would like to know why.
And,
uh,
also,
uh,</v>

604
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.700
if you can share some of your favorite music,

605
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.630
if not a favorite Julietta song,
a favorite,

606
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.330
some of your favorites for other artists.
Well,
I,

607
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.830
I think the education part is because I love,
uh,

608
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.690
I love her growing up in Mexico City.
I think it's just a city that has so much.

609
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.280
Um,
we live in Culiacan,
which is a part of the city that I love.

610
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:08.610
And,
um,
she's very,
uh,

611
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.000
sometimes she asked him why,
why we don't live in the beach,

612
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.080
which is kind of a really a big conflict,
you know,

613
00:36:14.081 --> 00:36:17.490
and she's only five and that kind of look at her like,
what?

614
00:36:17.491 --> 00:36:20.130
But we live in Mexico City.
There's no place better than this,
you know?

615
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:23.310
And she's like,
no,
there's no dolphins here.

616
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:27.310
And we do have a bit of,
I'm sure it's going to come up again,
you know,

617
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:31.590
but I just kind of really,
I liked the school where she's at.
I actually,
she's,

618
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.570
she's studying in a bilingual school,

619
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:38.571
which I kind of like that because I'm bilingual and I can relate to her being

620
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:43.590
bilingual.
Um,
although she,
right now,
she,
San Diego,
I've loved English.

621
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.120
She started like,
you know,
I'll,
I'll talk to her in English being all like,
Hey,

622
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:51.420
let's,
let's practice English.
And she'll be like,
see Mama.
Okay.

623
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.530
But I just,
I dunno,
I dunno how to explain it.

624
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:59.850
It's this feeling that I love Mexico City and I love Mexican culture in every

625
00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:02.130
sense.
And I like her being bilingual.

626
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:04.640
And eventually I think we'll probably come to San Diego,
you know?

627
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.530
And we spent a lot of times and they with my parents because they live there.

628
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:12.390
But,
um,
I just like Mexico City,
you know,
I like the,

629
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.760
I like her being in,
growing up in a big city,

630
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:16.340
but that's just because I love big cities.

631
00:37:16.341 --> 00:37:19.290
And maybe when she grows up she'll be like,
I want to go to and say no,

632
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.430
I don't know.
I don't know why I grew up in Mexico City.
Like you.
Yes.

633
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.270
Yeah.
And what was the other question?

634
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.183
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

635
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:39.370
<v 2>Oh yeah.
Of course a woof,
don't get me started.
Okay.</v>

636
00:37:39.371 --> 00:37:41.530
No music.
I've been listening a lot to,

637
00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:45.790
there's a band from Argentina who's called the Skyler's explored a Lotis.

638
00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:50.650
It's very beautiful.
Um,
he's a,
he's actually a guy,
not a girl,
but,
um,
he's,

639
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.760
he's kind of,
and the,
it's pretty beautiful.
He's,
he's,

640
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.560
he's pretty amazing.
Um,
there's also,
uh,
I don't know if you know,
having a minute.

641
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:04.580
She's from Tila and she's beautiful.
Also kept bay also from [inaudible].

642
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:09.430
I'm from Mexico.
I'm sure everybody knows Carla Morrison,

643
00:38:09.431 --> 00:38:11.420
but I love her and I love her new album and we're,

644
00:38:11.421 --> 00:38:15.970
we're in when she's beautiful and talented.
Um,

645
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.100
who else?
Oh,
there's a band from Mexico called sent out who's,
they're not new,

646
00:38:21.101 --> 00:38:24.280
new,
but I know a lot of people don't know them and I really recommend them,
like,

647
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:29.320
oh,
why is pretty great.
So those are some bands,

648
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.790
um,
books.
Uh,
what's it's,

649
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:35.530
is that recently I've been pretty much into the second war,

650
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:39.190
which is kind of not so,
you know,
but there is one,
I mean,

651
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.910
if anybody's into that and if not,
I really think you should read this book.

652
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.300
It's a,
it's not actually new,
but,
um,

653
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.940
I just barely read it this year and I'm pretty amazed by it.

654
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:53.050
It's called life and fate by Vasily Grossman.
Um,

655
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.200
he basically,
he was during,
he was in the,
it's,

656
00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:02.240
it's all about the styling row Kamala between Russia,

657
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:07.120
the Russians and the Germans.
And um,
he was there the whole time.

658
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:09.520
So it's,
he's sort of like,

659
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.510
they'll just panoramic view of every single different situation that can

660
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:16.450
possibly,
that was affected by people during the war,

661
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:20.800
which is pretty amazing and it's beautiful.
And I'm serious.
I was,

662
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.010
that was probably like one of the books that I've read lately that kind of,

663
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.950
it took me a while to get a,
like when I was done with it,

664
00:39:26.951 --> 00:39:31.870
I just had this feeling of loss of not being a,
being done with it.
You know,

665
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:35.350
it was,
it was no faith.
It'd be that either.

666
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:38.170
Stino must pretty great.

667
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.910
<v 6>We have for,
okay.</v>

668
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.690
I think we're out of time on a very tight schedule today because we're going to

669
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:47.524
do a,

670
00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.560
hi,
I'm from Purdue.
I'm very excited to be here.
Uh,

671
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:03.850
I have been at Google for three weeks,
so when my asked me like,
hello,
like,

672
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:07.610
and I was like,
I'm going to see,
uh,

673
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.210
you mentioned that you have studied music since you were little backhoe.

674
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:15.340
How was the process for you to like,

675
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:20.050
decided that Nielsen was going to be your career?
You know,
like for a lot of us,

676
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:21.580
like we have very traditional,

677
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:26.910
like may years and music is a really hard industry in terms of a spool rates.

678
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:31.660
Right?
Uh,
and before you became famous,

679
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:35.530
like how do you decide that?
Like if you using know,
if you were,

680
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.930
be able to support yourself the next month,

681
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.890
<v 2>you know?
Um,
well actually when I,</v>

682
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.390
when I decided that I was going to make music was totally impractical,

683
00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:46.410
I was actually like,

684
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.240
<v 6>well,
I was 10 years old and I,
and I decided</v>

685
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.900
<v 2>that that was going to be what,
that was my vocation.
That's what I wanted to do.</v>

686
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:54.430
I had no idea at that moment.

687
00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:57.910
I thought I wanted to go to conservatory and studied classical music and beer.

688
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.830
I want it to be an orchestra director and later changed completely.
But,

689
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.490
um,
that's when I decided that was totally like,

690
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.050
I ha I had no idea what's going to happen,

691
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.460
what was going to happen with my life and what way it was going to go or

692
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:16.780
anything.
I just kind of,
I knew it wasn't,
uh,
something like a position.

693
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:20.290
It was just sort of like something that came from my body,
you know,

694
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:21.520
like this is what I am.

695
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:27.100
And that was sort of like a realization about who I was,
about my identity.

696
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.250
And as a personal,
personal thing,
I'm a twin.

697
00:41:30.251 --> 00:41:33.710
So it was very important for me to realize that because being a twin,

698
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:37.400
you're always always trying to find your identity and who you are and your

699
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:42.050
individuality.
And I think music helped me being who I am and every sentence.

700
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:45.110
And I think also that,
you know,
just kind of my sister's a photographer,

701
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:49.070
which is kind of funny.
She's like visual and I'm like musical,
which is,

702
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.960
we both found who we were and that's how the relationship alive and the,

703
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:56.950
what was the other question?
Sorry.
Oh No.
Like,
uh,

704
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.320
how did you decide these to be your major?
In terms of your career,

705
00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:05.390
it doesn't like three major.
Well,
also,
that was funny because,

706
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:08.240
um,
I had no idea what I was going to do.
I mean,

707
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.680
when I was my idea of going to the university,
I,
I,

708
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:15.470
I want to study ethnomusicology,
which is not at all what I'm doing now.

709
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.430
So I guess it was just like the idea of going to the university and to study

710
00:42:19.431 --> 00:42:21.020
music.
That was like an idea that I had.

711
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.040
Then I went to Mexico City and I started teaching English when I'd never studied

712
00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:26.510
grammar.
It's kind of funny,
but yeah.

713
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.130
<v 3>Um,
it's not so funny.
Never do that.</v>

714
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.960
But,
um,
I needed,
you know,
I need a job.

715
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.490
<v 2>My accident was pretty,
you know,
oh,
you're,
you know,</v>

716
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:38.950
you're practically California.
Yeah.

717
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.830
<v 3>Yeah.
So,
yeah,
just kind of</v>

718
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.690
<v 2>taught English and you know,
that's what I did for the first year.
And then I,</v>

719
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:50.510
I did,
uh,
my first musical job was to do music for theater,
for a play.

720
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.280
And so,
uh,
that was my first job.
But yeah,
I,
it was,

721
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.430
it was hard in the beginning because my parents were pretty much like,
oh,

722
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:01.250
you're leaving to Mexico City.
Great.
I'm not going to help you.
And it was like,

723
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:06.230
okay,
okay,
okay,
I'll do this.
I can do this.
I got this.
And Yeah,
the,

724
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.520
the first year was pretty tough,
but yeah.
Um,
and you know,

725
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:12.470
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I mean,

726
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.950
maybe eventually I could have given up and I kinda said,

727
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.910
and actually at one point I did,
I was about to give up.
I,
I,
I came,

728
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.930
all my family pitched into for a ticket for me to come spend Christmas with
them,

729
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:28.280
which was kind of sweet except my dad,
of course,
he was still mad,
but,

730
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.970
um,
but I've had this conversation with my mom and I said,
mom,

731
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.190
I don't think I can do this.
I mean,
I'm going to go back.

732
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.930
I don't know how I'm going to pay the rent.
I,
this is like a struggle.
I'm alone.

733
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.440
I don't really know anybody.
This is too much for me.
And my mom was like,

734
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:47.470
don't come back.
I mean you've had,
every time I say that,
I kind of want to cry.

735
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.800
She's like,
set up [inaudible] they don't come back.
I mean,

736
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.030
I've never told you this,

737
00:43:53.031 --> 00:43:58.010
but my dream in life was to be a singer and I never did it.
And you're doing it.

738
00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.930
I'm like,
hmm.

739
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.350
<v 3>I mean,
I haven't done anything,
but for me that was like</v>

740
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:06.550
<v 2>the best person she could have given me and then they pitched in to get to to</v>

741
00:44:06.551 --> 00:44:07.690
help me pay the rent that month.

742
00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.183
<v 3>Pretty cool.</v>

743

745
