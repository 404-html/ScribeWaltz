00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.383
Hello.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.600
My Name's Sarah and I'm here to talk to you about octomom baby and how Germans

3
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:16.650
race or kids for software lives.
Um,
I'm really happy to be here at Google,

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.230
but before we start,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.930
I know who I'm talking to him.
So first of all,

6
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.260
how many of you are here are parents and it's okay if you're not.
Oh,

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.460
a lot good in the right place.
Um,
how many of you have school age kids?

8
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.990
So ages six to 12?
Well,
quite a few.
Uh,

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.100
so let me ask you this.
If you have kids aged six to 12,

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.320
or you had them older,
think back to that time.

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.150
How many of you let them walk places by themselves to their friend's house,

12
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.750
to the park?
I see my allies back there.

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.700
Um,
or just school.
So just a couple.
Uh,
as you know,

14
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:58.080
you're probably your very typical American parents.
The rest of you,
uh,

15
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.110
the dominant style of American parenting today is high on supervision and not

16
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:05.790
just physical supervision.
And I don't know about you,

17
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:10.791
but I have this snippy thing back in my hometown called power loop where I can

18
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:15.120
watch the grades as they come in in real time.
Well,

19
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.840
that's a lot of supervision and we have the best intentions,
right?

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.930
We want our kids to be safe,
we want them to succeed,

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.360
but we exercise so much control and trying to make those two things happen that

22
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.230
we've actually become more controlling than German parents.

23
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.820
Which sounds like an odd thing to say because when we think of Germans,

24
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:40.230
what do we think?
Strict people write.
Very exacting people rule following.

25
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.820
I had all of those ideas in my head when I moved to Germany,

26
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.420
but very quickly I learned that what I thought was not exactly correct.

27
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.890
When I first moved to Germany,

28
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:57.240
my daughter was two and a half and we lived there for six and a half years.
Um,

29
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.590
one of the first things I noticed was how Germans interact or don't interact

30
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950
with their kids on the playground.
Um,

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200
one story that I tell often because it was so shocking to me was I was at the

32
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:10.530
playground with my young daughters.

33
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.710
She's still about two or three and another kid,

34
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.390
he was eight or nine and climbed on the outside of a playground structure and it

35
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:19.224
was really high.

36
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.240
And he's dangling there by one hand and there's good 10 feet below him to the

37
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:28.860
sand.
And I stand up and go walk to home,
which means,
you know,
attention,

38
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.220
watch out kids,
mom,
you know,

39
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:36.390
I'm looking at all the other adults at the edge of the park,
drinking coffee,

40
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.980
not worried at all.
By the time I turned back,
the kid drops down,

41
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.300
looks at me like I'm crazy and runs away.
And I thought,

42
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.530
there's something going on here that I don't quite understand.

43
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.800
And I found myself having many of those kinds of experiences in Berlin where I'm

44
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:56.670
the one,
you know,

45
00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:00.790
an Octoni running up to the kids or thinking I've got to watch them on every

46
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.520
playground.
And I started to think,

47
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.390
why am I still afraid or better yet,

48
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.540
why are the Germans not afraid?

49
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.390
So I'm not going to talk too much about what's wrong with American parenting

50
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.250
because I'm sure we've heard it.
All right.

51
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.220
Some people call it helicopter parenting.

52
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.800
Some people call it over parenting.

53
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.990
I think the most precise term that I've heard this from psychologist Peter Gray

54
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.140
and he calls it protective directive currency and I would add that I think it's

55
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:38.980
primarily based on a fear.
We're afraid for our can safety,

56
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.730
so we protect and a lot of that protection involves restricting.

57
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.980
You can't walk alone.
You kept play alone,

58
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.470
you can't do anything that's vaguely dangerous.

59
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.270
The direction part comes in our fear for their future success or failure.

60
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.820
So we direct all their academic grades,
we watched the rates really closely,

61
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.990
and if they start to flounder and we get on the kid or we get on the teacher,

62
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.920
we have a meeting with the principal and we make sure they fill out their

63
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:10.921
academic resume with plenty of extracurricular sports or violin or learning a

64
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:11.944
language.

65
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.210
And that style of parenting doesn't leave a lot of room for the kids to make

66
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.280
choices or mistakes.
Right.

67
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.670
And taken to its extremes.

68
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.810
Some American parents protect and direct through adolescence and into young

69
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:29.644
adulthood.

70
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.790
And that doesn't leave a lot of opportunity for the kid to become an independent

71
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:34.624
adult.

72
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.920
But one place that they don't do this isn't Germany.

73
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.520
Oh I forgot this,
I'm bored of me.

74
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.810
But those of you who are parents who will feel our parents here,

75
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.740
um,
I don't think of raising kids as a side issue.

76
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.120
This is something that,
uh,
is important for all of us.

77
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.260
And it sounds cliche,
but children are literally the future,
right?

78
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.260
When we get older,
they're going to be ones running the economy,

79
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.610
making the decisions,

80
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.880
hopefully founding the next innovative idea that changes our lives.

81
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.070
Right?
And so with them,

82
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.710
bigger perspective than mine and your own personal perspective,

83
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.980
I'd like you to consider these two lists.
So,

84
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.981
which is more important to you for children to learn obedience or self reliance

85
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.300
if you had to choose between the two?
Respect for elders or independence,

86
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.630
being well behaved or being considerate.

87
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.230
Good manners or curiosity.

88
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.750
I'll give you a moment just to think about it.

89
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.230
Well,
some of you may have seen this list before.
It's not mine.

90
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.770
It's a list of that researchers use to determine how authoritarian you are.

91
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.960
So if you chose the first column,
obedience,
respect for elders,

92
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.390
we chose more of those things.
You're more authoritarian and your worldview.

93
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.430
If you chose the second column,
self reliance and dependence,
curiosity,

94
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.140
you're less authoritarian.

95
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.240
Now I'm going to take a wild guess because when I'm here at Google in Seattle,

96
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.980
most of you probably took self-reliance,
independence,
that column.

97
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.810
That's great.
And those are all very American values.
However,

98
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.050
if you pair it in that dominant director protecting style that I just mentioned,

99
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.920
you're actually reinforcing the first column because in order to do that,

100
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:39.710
you're asking for a lot of obedience from your kids.

101
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.960
A lot of respect for elders and good behavior instead of their own initiative.

102
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.900
So as I said before,
the one place they don't do this,

103
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.030
this first column is Germany.

104
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.120
And while I had that stereotype of Germans as being the strict overbearing

105
00:06:59.121 --> 00:06:59.840
parents,

106
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.840
that's true in the 1940s things have changed a lot in Germany since then.

107
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.690
And in fact World War Two prompted a big reaction against that kind of

108
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:15.440
parenting.
And really against everything the Nazis stand,
right?

109
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.760
The generation that came after them who are growing up in the 1960s really

110
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:22.580
rebelled against their parents.
And it was going on here too.

111
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.150
But the Germans really had some things to rebel against,
of course,

112
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.960
including how their parents raised their kids.

113
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.780
So there was even an anti authoritarian movement and some people opened up

114
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.830
daycare centers that had absolutely no rules at all.

115
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.130
And I've seen some videos of those daycare centers and they're pretty wild and

116
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.730
things have come back that up a bit from them.

117
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.970
German parents are much more moderate than that extreme.
However,

118
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.100
you'd be really hard pressed to find many German educators or parents who would

119
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:01.340
advocate for a strict and controlling way of dealing with kids.

120
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.560
And some evidence to that fact is around 2000 they banned corporal punishment,

121
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.190
which means it is illegal to Spank your child in Germany.

122
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.590
And when you think about it,

123
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:16.190
that's perhaps the most authoritarian thing you can do to a child is use your

124
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:19.880
physical power over them to try to force them to do what you want to do.

125
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.440
So while they may be anti authoritarian,

126
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.900
German society is anything but a wild bunch of people just running around in

127
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:32.330
chaos.
Right?
So how do they do it?

128
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.420
How do they manage to raise kids who are not only independent but responsible?

129
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.840
The good news is that you do less,
not more.

130
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.510
The bad news is that doing less can be really,
really hard.
Uh,

131
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:49.820
whenever I talked to German parents and say,
you know,

132
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.810
how can you let your kids walk to school or,
or take the subway by themselves?

133
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.630
They say,
you know,
I'm afraid to,
I hate it,

134
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.340
but I have to because if I'm always with them and I'm always hovering over them,

135
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.370
we'll never have a chance to learn independence.

136
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.210
So they don't just throw their kids out there,
give them a subway ticket and say,

137
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:15.060
find your way or you know,
go find school.

138
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.530
They spent a lot of time preparing their kids to take on each new stuff of

139
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:20.490
responsibility.

140
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.900
And one example of this is walking to school in first grade.

141
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.340
I walked my daughter to school every day about 900 yards through busy city

142
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:32.280
streets of Berlin.
There's about 3.5 million people there.

143
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.540
And at the end of first grade they had a little course or teacher dead on

144
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:44.010
traffic safety and they showed her that Zebo Stripe in outside the school.

145
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:47.670
What's your like the crosswalks and basically the whole area around the school.

146
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.560
And after that I was supposed to let her try to walk to school on her own.

147
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.350
And I thought,
hmm,
she's seven and I'm American.

148
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.260
We are not doing that.

149
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.800
And so ashamed to admit I walked her every day through most second grade and

150
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:11.160
punt of third while all her for other friends were walking to school by

151
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:15.120
themselves.
And one day she finally said to me,
you know,
mom,

152
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.980
I can do this.
And I said,
well,
you know the traffic and you know,

153
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:23.190
there's the CD guys who hang out in the quarter and the afternoon and I don't

154
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:25.470
like that.
And she said,
mom,

155
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.180
all my friends do it and they're fine now.

156
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.940
I hate the all my friends thing.
However,

157
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.440
she did have a point while I was walking my daughter to school every day.

158
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.630
Her best friend was biking from much further away and she everyday she would

159
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:47.631
cross a really busy street frankfurter la and she still does as I know,

160
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.550
and she has not yet been hit by a car.

161
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.400
So there is some evidence there.

162
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.020
And then I did eventually let my daughter go and walk to school and when I did

163
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:03.000
it was transformative,
not just for her but for me,
for her.

164
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.740
All of a sudden it was easier to go to school in the morning.
She got herself up,

165
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:13.050
got dressed me to snap,
packed her bag,
so proud,
said goodbye to mom at the door.

166
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.060
And for me it was like,
oh,
this is really my job.

167
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:18.991
You know,

168
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:22.350
I thought my job is to make you completely safe and to make sure that you

169
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:23.184
succeed.

170
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.540
But really my job is to teach you how to do things and then let go.

171
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:35.270
So the German method is to prepare their kids instead of trying to keep them

172
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:40.080
100% safe,
but to prepare them to manage risks themselves.

173
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.850
Because if we really admitted to ourselves,

174
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:45.780
there is no way that we can make the world a hundred percent safe for our kids.

175
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.360
It's just not the nature of the world.

176
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.200
The best thing that we can do for them is give them the skills they need to

177
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:55.060
manage risk on their own.

178
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.830
And one way Germans do this from an early age.
It's your playgrounds.

179
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.340
Oh,
here we go.
And not this playground.

180
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.470
This playground isn't a typical American playground.
Looks familiar.

181
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.140
I could probably find this in any city.
In America,
it's plastic,
it's short.

182
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.030
The slides are plastic,
so they're not very fast.

183
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.360
There is not a whole lot of risk to be had here except for maybe a three year

184
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:26.020
old or a four year old after that.
It's not even very interesting.

185
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.600
This is a more typical German playground.
And I say typical,

186
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:36.160
but I have never seen one German playground that was exactly the same as
another,

187
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.740
which you can't say about American playgrounds unfortunately.

188
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.650
But some of the typical elements they have are tall towers and they're much

189
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:49.651
taller than ours and they have different ways of getting to those towers that

190
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.860
are sometimes a little dangerous.
So if you've,

191
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.000
here's an example that's my daughter up there and you can see from the height

192
00:12:58.001 --> 00:13:03.001
that it's at least twice as tall as she is and she's on a log with just rope to

193
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:06.910
hang on.
So there's a lot of chance to fall there.

194
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.690
So he's learning right there how to manage some risks.

195
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.610
And not only are they more dangerous or more risky,

196
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.130
they're more fun.
I mean,
what's more fun?

197
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.100
This or this?

198
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.790
Oh,
this one's actually in Bavaria.

199
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:29.140
Friend sent it to me and that kid is up kind of high.

200
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.680
Uh,
just this is more of a side view of it up.

201
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.150
These climbing rope triangles,
triangles are fairly common.

202
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:41.440
And if you see at the end that tail,
this whole thing is sort of like a snake.

203
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.630
That tail is a slide,

204
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.430
so the reward for climbing up there as you get to go down that really fun slide,

205
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.550
which might be a little scary now,

206
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.090
I was lucky enough that in our neighborhood we had something called the

207
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.030
Glockenspiel plots and that's the can right there.

208
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.350
Now this dragon has since been torn down and then they built another one,

209
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.410
but it is not only high,
it has scary look to it.

210
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.440
It's got this big red teeth and the kids can actually climb up into those teeth.

211
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.730
You can also hang out in this bullet right here and there are two enormous

212
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:21.760
slides that go down the side metal,
so they're fast.

213
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.590
My daughter was terrified of this thing.
She would not go near it.

214
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:28.780
Of course she was really small.

215
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.960
That was her when we first arrived in Berlin.

216
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.390
And this is the area in front of the Dragon,

217
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.540
which has some swings and some other things that you can climb.

218
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.110
And for years she would only play around the dragon the most she would do with

219
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:47.650
it when we go up the back and down and up and down.

220
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.440
And that was it.
So flash forward two years,

221
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:53.300
I've got a new baby boy now,

222
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:58.100
and I'm watching him a lot more than I'm watching her.
And I hear Mama,

223
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:02.260
Mama,
Mama,
and I'm like,
Ugh,
she's hurt herself.
I was watching your,

224
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.703
oh my gosh.

225
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.840
Then I look up and she's in the Keith and then she comes down the slide and when

226
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:12.110
she stands on,
you can just see it.
You know,

227
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.780
she had conquered her fear.

228
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.930
I didn't make her do it all by herself.

229
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.280
And I think that's really important step for a child to take,

230
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:23.320
even when they're five,

231
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.770
is to face something that they're afraid of and to overcome it themselves and in

232
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:31.280
their own way.
And she was working up to that point,
I think for a long time.

233
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.353
Um,

234
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.830
and I'm a little afraid that American kids don't get a chance to conquer dragon

235
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.390
very much anymore,
at least outside of a video game.
Uh,
this picture is,

236
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.790
was taken actually several years after that because you'll see there's another

237
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:51.680
little face up there and that's her brother.
So I guess if you have a,

238
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:54.950
for older sister,
he get pushed to do things a little bit faster.

239
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.403
Um,

240
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.470
but another really important way that Germans prepare their kids is through,

241
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.340
uh,
using dangerous implements them that we normally don't.

242
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.070
And there's none that is more stark of an example than fire.

243
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:19.190
What are we taught about fire when we're kids don't play with it.

244
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.600
Don't play with matches.

245
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.350
You ever seen a lighter who told an adult that is not for kids?

246
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.400
That's not the prevailing wisdom in Germany.
And in fact,

247
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:32.660
my daughter came home from first grade one day and she said,
mom,

248
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.870
I'd like to light some candles because she had learned how to like matches in

249
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:42.720
school.
And that was quite shocking for me.
But she had the note for,

250
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.730
from her teacher.

251
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.600
And the idea behind this is that Germans think it's safer to teach a kid how do

252
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:53.240
you,
something that's potentially dangerous than to prohibit it.

253
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.020
Because when you prohibit,
and there's a great amount of children,

254
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:58.370
especially when it comes to fire,

255
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.640
who will try it in secret and of course in secret is dangerous because it's

256
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:07.460
secret and because they have no capability in it,

257
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.940
you actually have to know how to hold a match.
A lot of young kids,

258
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:14.930
we'll hold it like this and the fire burns their fingers and then they drop it.

259
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.660
Then maybe something catches on fire,
right?

260
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.080
And their first thought if it's prohibited is I'm going to get in trouble and

261
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.070
then they run or they hide.

262
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.340
And that's how a lot of child started fires happen.

263
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.210
Now there is a man,
uh,
in kind,

264
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:36.890
Karl von who is a pioneer in this area and he teaches kids who are even younger

265
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.970
than seven,

266
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.260
how to light matches and candles and not only how to light matches and candles,

267
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:45.200
but how to make bonfires,

268
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.570
oh no kind carve on.

269
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:52.571
He's kind of an interesting character because he used to be a fire artist and he

270
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:58.041
wants burned the Berlin Wall and the 1980s he has since got a second career as a

271
00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:00.330
fire safety instructor.

272
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.640
And his idea of fires safety is to teach very young kids.

273
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:09.450
He just four or five and six.
This is a kito which is like a daycare center.

274
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.640
How to deal with fire.

275
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.850
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

276
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.080
<v 0>What I love about this video is so much is not only do you see these small kids</v>

277
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.540
making fire,
but you see the sawing things using,
going to ax,

278
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.460
um,
cutting food and cooking it.

279
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.710
And I think it really challenges our notion of that kids are incapable and that

280
00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:32.740
they need everything done for them.
And with a little instruction.

281
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.140
They seem to manage quite well.
No.
Um,

282
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.930
these kind of workshops are not everywhere in Germany.

283
00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:42.470
They're more common in Berlin and Brandon Bird.

284
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.560
But before you think Kinda kinda carve on is a completely crazy man.

285
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.460
He has the backing of insurance agencies,

286
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.650
child safety organizations,
and the Berlin fire bow.
Uh,

287
00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.860
so do you fire department.

288
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.910
And when I think back to when I saw a firefighter come to my elementary school,

289
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.910
they stood in the front of the classroom and they told me not to play with

290
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.810
matches and how to stop,
drop and roll,
which are all good things,

291
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.720
but never did I make a fire with a fire firearm,

292
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.480
which might be quite a quite an experience.

293
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.770
So the German way of dealing with fires,

294
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:19.710
almost the complete opposite of ours.
However,

295
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:24.450
I have found no evidence that child's started fires or have any greater number

296
00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:27.660
in Germany than they are here where we have a lot of prohibition.

297
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.250
So that begs the question then,
if we're prohibiting it and it's not working,

298
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:37.110
then why are we doing it?
And what is,
what is the lost through that prohibition?

299
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.740
And I think if you saw those kids in that video,

300
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.380
they were incredibly engaged,
right?

301
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.320
Kids are very fascinated with fire and some people even think we're

302
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:50.110
evolutionally wired,
be fascinated by fire,

303
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:52.090
cause needs to depend upon it for so long.

304
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.400
But this is also an opportunity for learning,
really intense learning for them.

305
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.880
And that's another subject that we are very concerned about.
Raid.

306
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.650
We all want to know what makes children succeed.
Oh,

307
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:09.740
here in the U s we have pushed down a lot of,
um,

308
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.540
conceptual learning into kindergarten and preschool and we do worksheets and

309
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:18.550
flashcards with kids.
In fact,

310
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:23.551
Americans are famous for trying to Kush learning earlier and earlier this

311
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.780
psychologist Sean pujay once called it the American question back in the 1970s.

312
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:33.550
And that question was,
can we do it faster?
How can we do it earlier?

313
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.330
And he would answer that question,
why do you want you to do that earlier?

314
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.340
And I have to say,
I'm,
uh,
back in the US,
before we left Germany,

315
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.230
I had this brilliant little daughter who could speak at a really early age and I

316
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:49.340
thought she said,
genius,
I got to help her.

317
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.520
And I started to teach her how to spell it,

318
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.060
taught her to spell her name while we were swinging and she had your back and

319
00:21:55.061 --> 00:22:00.050
forth and she'd say,
s o,
p.
H hey,
so fair.
And I said,

320
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.790
wow,
that's great.
I'll try something else.
Okay,
so painless,
no money.

321
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.870
And she was saying s,
O,
p,
h,
I,
Hey.

322
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.590
So we may be able to get young kids to repeat back to us a lot of things

323
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:18.880
including math facts,
um,
and you may even be able to get them to read,

324
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.320
which by the way,

325
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.580
has very little evidence that it gives them an advantage later on.
In fact,

326
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:28.060
there was a study that showed compared earlier leaders and you know,

327
00:22:28.061 --> 00:22:31.480
four or five with later readers,
more than traditional seven or eight.

328
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.280
By the time both sets got to be 11,
the late readers had caught up.

329
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.020
So again,
it doesn't give them an advantage.
Why are we doing it?

330
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.580
And more importantly,

331
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.970
what are they missing while we are trying to cram reading and math at an early,

332
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:52.120
early age.
And I would argue that they're missing play.

333
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.490
Play is so essential.
All mammals do it,
including us.

334
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.200
And it's kind of the primary way that we learn.
Um,
and kindergarten,

335
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:06.230
which was invented in Germany,
it at least there,
um,

336
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.870
for declared liberal had the idea that child learning would take place in a kind

337
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:15.280
of Eden,
thus the gosh in kindergarten.
Um,

338
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.120
and that play was essential and they've had some changes in kindergarten,

339
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:24.450
but they are back to that model and all they do in preschool and kindergarten is

340
00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:30.460
play.
And when the ambitious American and me got nervous about that,

341
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:35.140
they would tell me we leave.
They are learning,
they're learning social skills,

342
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.300
they're learning how to be creative,
how to be leaders,
how to have self control.

343
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.660
And a lot of like kindergarten therapy practice,

344
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:46.970
what's called this situation on or what used to be known here as the

345
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:51.971
observational approach and features what stuff back and watch what was going on

346
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:54.740
with the kids.
And this was one example.

347
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:58.220
Every year in the golf at our teacher,

348
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.480
they would have a lot of chestnuts come down from the trees and the kids love

349
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:06.050
them.
It would cram their pockets full of them,
take them home,

350
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:10.820
take them in the inside rooms rather than fight it.
I said,

351
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.140
God,
get all of them that you can and they bring them in to play with them.

352
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.910
Now I'm sure there's some math skills going on here,
but they're not very formal.

353
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:20.960
Um,

354
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.200
the other kinds of things that they would do is they would do projects with the

355
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:27.890
kids but only projects the kids chose themselves.

356
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.380
So they would have a little meeting and they'd say,
okay,

357
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:34.460
what should I next project?
He and kids would throw out ideas and they vote,

358
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:36.470
vote on them,
how democratic.
Right.

359
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.900
And then they have the kids throw out all the questions they have about that

360
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:43.430
particular idea.
Like for instance,

361
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:46.820
they did a body project one year and so people wanted to know,

362
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.320
kids wanted to know what,
how do the IC,
how did the ears hear the heartbeats?

363
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.450
Um,
what's nice skeleton look like?
And so after that,
for over a period of weeks,

364
00:24:56.451 --> 00:25:00.530
they would investigate it.
They'd get books,
they'd watched videos,

365
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.850
they bring in an expert,
like a doctor or going on a field trip to the museum.

366
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.710
And through that process you're learning how to engage their here acidy and

367
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:11.270
they're alert,
they're really learning how to learn it.

368
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:17.230
And this whole emphasis on play and self directed learning goes on through

369
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.920
elementary school.
So like so third or fourth grade.

370
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.450
And if that worries,
you consider that German teenagers,

371
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:27.710
by the time they're 15,

372
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.780
do much better on the international piece of tests than Americans.
That's math,

373
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:33.950
science and reading.

374
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.760
So maybe our emphasis on academics so early might be misplaced and that maybe

375
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.460
the kids need more of a foundation of this kind of exploration.
Oh,

376
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.360
the last method of preparation I just wanted to touch on briefly is information.

377
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.660
Germans are much more open with difficult topics with their kids than we are.

378
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.410
And these are things like sex,
religion,

379
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:08.830
that all of which my daughter had projects on in school by the time of third

380
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:14.390
grade.
And of course for Germany,
the darker parts in history is a huge topic.

381
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.730
But just to give you one example,
um,
for sex education in Germany,

382
00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:24.290
it's mandatory.
You cannot opt your child out of it for any reason.

383
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.130
Not even religion,

384
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.480
because they believe that the kids have a right to know how their body works,

385
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.630
which I don't know how you take that,

386
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.720
but when I looked at the statistics and the end teenagers in Germany are no more

387
00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:39.890
sexually active than American teenagers.

388
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.640
In fact that statistics are almost identical.
The big difference,

389
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:47.400
however,
are another very important statistics.

390
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.310
Germans have a much lower rate of teen pregnancy.

391
00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.710
I'm much slower rate of teen abortion and a much lower rate of HIV incidents.

392
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:01.310
So no matter what my morality is around sex and my kids having it at a certain

393
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:06.861
point and information is powerful and it has a power to help them protect

394
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:10.620
themselves.
Okay,
so then the big question,

395
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.480
how do we do any of us here?
We have a very different culture,
right?

396
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.570
Um,
and I,

397
00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:21.900
I have to admit there are some things that happened in German society that our

398
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.990
society based and making changes in our school system or our preschool system or

399
00:27:27.841 --> 00:27:31.890
even getting a more exciting playground on the street would retake a lot of

400
00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:33.540
effort,
my group of people,
right?

401
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.680
But there are several things that we can do as parents and as citizens.

402
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.160
Um,
and the,
one of the first ones is what we talked about in the beginning.

403
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.830
Letting your kids learn to navigate their own world.
A child of,

404
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.840
you know,
seven,
eight or nine is very capable of taking themselves to a place,

405
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.990
especially one that they go too often,
like a friend's house,

406
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.250
the school or the playground.
And it makes you nervous.

407
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.110
Try it out the Durban way,
go with them.
A lot of times she's some traffic.

408
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.970
Talk to them about strangers,

409
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.720
possibly approaching them though you should emphasize it doesn't happen very

410
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:15.360
often and if it still makes you nervous,

411
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.770
find them a buddy because two kids walking down the street feels a lot safer

412
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.360
than a wine.
And it's also helps their siblings involved.
I think,

413
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.420
um,
another thing that we can do as parents,
uh,

414
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:33.590
it's to make time in every day at the kids to get to decide what to do with it.

415
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.390
And because we have a longer school day now and homework and then

416
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.950
extracurricular activities,
some kids can go from,
you know,

417
00:28:43.951 --> 00:28:45.900
first thing in the morning,
the evening,

418
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.140
never being able to decide what they want to do.

419
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.460
So for us,
you know,
when,
when I do this with my kids,

420
00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:58.200
that usually means tying and it's very important for them.

421
00:28:58.201 --> 00:29:01.830
I think to play every day as it is to get outside,

422
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:05.490
which was also a German value that said something that's too hard to do either

423
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:08.310
do,
it does require a push a little bit.
Um,

424
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.720
and another idea is to give them some life tasks.

425
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.770
Even at a young age.
My daughter does her own laundry,

426
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.820
which means I put a band in her roof,
she puts,
she fills it.

427
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.120
Well that's all she does the laundry and has clean clothes.

428
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.110
I really liked this one because it has very natural consequences.

429
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.840
I don't have to Nag and she doesn't do her laundry,

430
00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:34.590
she doesn't have clean clothes.
And for a while she didn't care.

431
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.540
But now she really,
really does.
And it gets done.

432
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.670
And other things like are waking yourself up in the morning.
Uh,

433
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:48.250
cooking also had very natural consequences and they tend to be very engaged,

434
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.630
especially if you couch it as teaching you how to take care of yourself.

435
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.250
It's not necessarily a chore.
And it was a bit of a step towards independence.

436
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.900
And if we teach our kids these,

437
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.790
these smaller things now at this age they go get to have a growing sense of

438
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.410
capability and as they get older we can give them more and more responsibility

439
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:13.150
so that it's not such a shock when they become 18.
I don't know about you,

440
00:30:13.151 --> 00:30:17.260
but I did know some people in college who had never done laundry would never

441
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.560
made a pot of rice and that's they're missing out a lot.

442
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:25.480
They have to catch up really fast.
Um,
and last but not least because the,

443
00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.580
the idea I brought up here about being more open with their kids about difficult

444
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:34.690
topics,
they can handle it.

445
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.350
When I want to tell you what a short story about world war two in Germany,

446
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.660
you can't avoid the topic of World War Two and the Holocaust if you live in

447
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:50.590
Berlin,
especially because it's everywhere.
Your kids are going to ask you.

448
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.810
But I'll see these little gold sparkles Stein in the street,

449
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.480
but a memorialize people who are taking off the dye and concentration counts.

450
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:04.120
And whenever I asked my German friends,
the adults about World War II,

451
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.523
they would tell me,

452
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.420
I cannot remember a time when I didn't know what my country had done.

453
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.950
And that really affected me because if they couldn't remember when they didn't

454
00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:16.690
know,
they must've been five,

455
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.420
maybe six when they learned about the one of the biggest crimes in modern

456
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:26.710
history that their old culture had done.
That's a really heavy issue.

457
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.040
And those kids were about as old as those kids you saw making the fire and using

458
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:32.974
the act.

459
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.530
So I think our kids are more capable than we realize or that we give them credit

460
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:40.480
for.
They're more capable of doing,

461
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:45.690
handling physical freedom and handling tough intellectual and emotional

462
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:49.570
subjects.
And I think if that's the idea,

463
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:51.910
I'd like to end the presentation with your,

464
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.710
I think if we as parents can get a handle on our fears like the Germans to and

465
00:31:56.711 --> 00:32:00.580
step back and give her kids the space they need and they can grow up to be

466
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.820
independent Self Hawaiian adults.
Thank you.

467
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.940
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

468
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.560
<v 2>hi.
Hi.</v>

469
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.840
Do you have any advice for parents who would like to give their kids more

470
00:32:14.841 --> 00:32:19.841
freedom but are concerned about things like the kids getting taken by CPS has

471
00:32:20.841 --> 00:32:22.280
happened to that couple in Maryland,

472
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.480
<v 0>right?
Absolutely.
I mean we do have that problem.
Um,</v>

473
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.720
Germans have that sense of community in that sense that if their kid gets in

474
00:32:30.721 --> 00:32:34.510
trouble that people will help them.
And here we,
we've come to a,

475
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:37.920
a part in society where people will tend to call the police on you.

476
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.370
The best advice I can give you is to try to know your community and talk to your

477
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:44.570
community.
Uh,

478
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.720
that means talking to your neighbors and the fellow parents and let them know

479
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:50.180
what you're doing.
You know,
I'm going to,

480
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.130
my kid really would like to try walking to school.

481
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:53.330
I'm going to let them do it tomorrow.

482
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:55.610
And you can get them in on it through busy body and be like,

483
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.790
could you look out your window,
make sure they're okay.
You know,

484
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:03.791
I think if we start to draw people in to be proactively helpful instead of

485
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.890
negative and perhaps we can start to build that here.

486
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

487
00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.350
<v 3>How did you get your daughter to start caring about not wearing dirty?</v>

488
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.030
<v 0>It was actually pretty natural.
You know,
there was a little bit of rebellion,</v>

489
00:33:22.031 --> 00:33:24.400
I don't care for a bit.
And then you know,

490
00:33:24.401 --> 00:33:28.840
her favorite shirt wasn't washed and it just kind of happened.
Yeah.

491
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.070
<v 2>So I've actually been thinking about a lot of positions for a long time.</v>

492
00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:39.120
I have a three and a half year old and I've been trying to introduce her to,
uh,

493
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.010
to take is that I as an overprotected kid wasn't able to do until much later,

494
00:33:44.011 --> 00:33:46.790
but I think too much.
You can.
Um,
what I'm,

495
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.650
what I've been trying to figure out is like kind of have what ages did you,

496
00:33:49.651 --> 00:33:54.000
what NDAs and feels like a lot of the resources,
especially on the Internet

497
00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.470
in America for,
for determining,
uh,

498
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.220
when is reasonable safe time ways that five or six require,
um,
yeah.

499
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.900
And
like you,

500
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.010
can you recommend any resources for figuring out how much earlier than sort of

501
00:34:11.011 --> 00:34:15.900
the American,
uh,
very conservative norms,
different things he moved?

502
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.120
<v 0>Well,
I,</v>

503
00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:22.120
I'm really reluctant to say that any specific age is good for a specific task.

504
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.090
It's really important to see when your kid is ready for it.

505
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.920
And often they'll tell you,
you can,

506
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.710
you can suggest some things and they'll be like,
ah,
no way.

507
00:34:29.711 --> 00:34:33.070
And I don't recommend forcing a kid who's reluctant,
you know,

508
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.890
like if you wanted to start with,
you know,

509
00:34:35.891 --> 00:34:39.010
cutting up potatoes together and they don't want to touch the knife,

510
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.173
I would wait.

511
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.260
They'll come back and I'll tell you a short story about my son in the first time

512
00:34:44.261 --> 00:34:45.820
he wanted to walk to school,

513
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.960
he was six and we were in America and um,

514
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.250
he actually wanted to walk home.

515
00:34:51.251 --> 00:34:53.770
I had driven that day and he had no interest in and get in the car.

516
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.330
And that first time he ran in the hallway and he was scared.

517
00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.240
He didn't really tell me he was scared,
but you know,
I kind of knew.

518
00:35:01.241 --> 00:35:04.030
And then he didn't ask again for two or three weeks.

519
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.660
Then when he did it the second time,
that's when it clicked for him.

520
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.200
And today he walks all the time.
So I,
you know,

521
00:35:11.201 --> 00:35:14.890
I would think suggesting some things to your kids and see if they're into it and

522
00:35:14.891 --> 00:35:19.660
then if they go for it,
yeah.
But if they don't,
you know,
back off,
um,

523
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.650
walking to school and the Germans do it at about seven and eight,

524
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.510
the thins do it at four and five,
you know,
so it's,

525
00:35:27.511 --> 00:35:29.560
it's kind of a cultural thing as well.

526
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:35.430
<v 3>Do you have any thoughts,
observations,
and how Germans teach responsibility?</v>

527
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.211
So for example,

528
00:35:36.211 --> 00:35:39.030
you told them or you give an example of kindergarten and just play all day,

529
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.280
but did they get taught like cleaning up?
It's not a very natural consequence,

530
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.340
unlike dirty clothes.
So I'm just wondering what their thoughts are.
Observations.

531
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:48.430
Sure.
The Francis,

532
00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.670
<v 0>it was fairly free form.</v>

533
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.330
The kindergarten went to head very few walls that the kids didn't make

534
00:35:55.331 --> 00:35:58.720
themselves.
Um,
so they actually would sit the kids around and go,

535
00:35:58.721 --> 00:36:02.210
what should be the rules for our keynote?
And one kid will say,

536
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.140
don't cry lumber furniture.
And she said,
why don't you do that?
Just like,

537
00:36:05.141 --> 00:36:09.520
I don't want your dirty feet on it or don't,
you know,
don't hit other kids.

538
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.340
And that's a really natural one.
Why?
Because it hurts.

539
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.470
The second answer is always the most powerful.

540
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:17.050
Other kids won't want to play with you.

541
00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.520
So they learn some responsibility just through the interaction with each other.

542
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.760
Now if you're thinking our parental interactions with them,

543
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.270
all of this responsibility is for sendable,
right?
This freedom.

544
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.340
So if they are being allowed to walk to school and instead,
uh,

545
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.760
on the way home they stop at a friend's house and you say,
okay,

546
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:40.810
maybe we need to take a break from it for awhile.
And I think kids in that sense,

547
00:36:40.811 --> 00:36:41.640
they,
they,

548
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.220
they get a little bit of a freedom and then the accountability for it so that

549
00:36:45.221 --> 00:36:48.310
when they're older and they're not just going out there and going crazy,

550
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:55.300
the most amount of [inaudible] as for food,

551
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.880
if I left him,
but what the need is,

552
00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:04.850
like if I have vegetables and fruits on a speaker and he said and done,

553
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.870
and then later in the evening ask for something else.
Yeah,
it's like that.

554
00:37:08.871 --> 00:37:12.310
So I don't know how to balance that.
Giving you come,

555
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.240
did you give such control responsibility to finish up?

556
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.760
Food is a hard one,

557
00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.290
but I've heard that if you think about the food you hate most in life,

558
00:37:24.291 --> 00:37:27.290
like for me,
I'm really not a big fan of Brussel sprouts.

559
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.060
Not for any particular reason,

560
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.620
but you're first because I remember being forced teeth on and they have that

561
00:37:33.621 --> 00:37:37.130
connotation on it forever.
Um,

562
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.490
so I would urge you not to force them to eat anything.

563
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:45.110
I'm always a big fan of continuing to offer.
You know,

564
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.200
I put it,
you only put out on the table what you want him to eat,

565
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.420
but then it gets to choose from that.

566
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.920
And of course the suites are only for treats and not for all the time.

567
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.870
Um,
the Germans do this a little bit just through the way they do school lunches.

568
00:37:59.871 --> 00:38:03.410
Nobody brings their own lunch.
So they have two choices,

569
00:38:03.411 --> 00:38:07.580
usually a vegetarian and a non vegetarian.
And if you don't like it,

570
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:11.450
you go hungry.
So kids tend to eat if they're hungry.

571
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.420
<v 3>Oh,
thank you for the,
Thomas is actually a nice,
um,
uh,
my question is,</v>

572
00:38:16.421 --> 00:38:21.130
so if you look at,
sure,
I'm here in the US.
Right.
So,
um,
just for example,

573
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:24.480
there was a movie you sent you called kidnap a Halle Berry.
Yeah.

574
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.363
Basically he's had,

575
00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.270
it wasn't important enough for taking their eyes off for k per second and the

576
00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:32.290
kid got cannot.
And then like my foot touch,
try dropping and all that stuff.
Um,

577
00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.300
com.
My question is,
so if I,

578
00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:38.590
if I see him will be like that I'm miss reluctance to let my kid walk to school

579
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.040
or I don't even play on the playground unsupervised for a second.
Right.

580
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:46.660
So how do you reconcile,
um,
but an environment like that?
Because I,

581
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.730
I'm assuming like in Germany,
they have a lot more control over the media.
Uh,

582
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.520
or he's,
that's the perception that I have been here.
Um,

583
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.140
but they can prevent things like stop,
like movies,

584
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:58.480
like this truck coming out and say,
Hey,
I know you've be like,
don't,

585
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.200
don't throw things.
Like they're not going to let them know,

586
00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.190
rejected gets box on their own.
So how do we consult?

587
00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.770
<v 0>I see it is a different immediate environment.</v>

588
00:39:06.771 --> 00:39:09.860
I don't know that they control it so much.
Um,

589
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.710
but there would not be as much interest in that kind of movies.

590
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.780
We like to scare ourselves a lot here.

591
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:19.340
What I really wish would happen in Armenia is that whatever they tell us,

592
00:39:19.341 --> 00:39:23.000
one of the real stories of a kid being kidnapped,
but they put it in context.

593
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.860
And as a formal journalist,

594
00:39:24.861 --> 00:39:27.560
I wish we could require this because you're always supposed to put things in

595
00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:28.394
context.

596
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.960
A little more than a hundred kids get kidnapped by strangers every year.

597
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:37.820
Absolutely.
Every story is horrific,
right?
It's everybody's parents nightmare.

598
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.030
We have 77 million kids in this country.

599
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.390
Something happened to a hundred kids is an aberration,

600
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:48.680
not a thing that happens every day.
And if we knew that,

601
00:39:48.681 --> 00:39:52.760
if we keep thinking about that,
um,
I think we might change our behavior.

602
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.330
And one other short story,
if I may,
um,
the farmer,

603
00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.890
a common scenario of a kid being sexually abused is by someone they know.

604
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.570
And it's usually a man.

605
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.450
And that man wants to have a relationship with your child.

606
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.340
Now the child that has been very constrained and told to a bay adults and

607
00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:12.050
respect their elders all the time,

608
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.670
it's much easier prey to a person like that than a kid who has been raised to be

609
00:40:16.671 --> 00:40:19.310
independent,
is able to say no to adults.

610
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.580
So there's a really strong argument right there for making your kid more

611
00:40:22.581 --> 00:40:25.540
independent,
actually protects them.
Okay.

612
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.700
I come from a different perspective.
Uh,
and then,

613
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:35.980
um,
so as you can see,
I'm from Germany,
I'm going move to here.

614
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:36.850
Um,

615
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:41.850
it's a splits us dummy here does not wear the Nike if you have kids.

616
00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:44.960
Have these values propagated.
Yeah.
Yeah.

617
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.030
So how do you four old on an enzyme?
Well,

618
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:54.990
how do you propose up to the school system and this kind of educational waiting

619
00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:01.150
works together?
Because for all kids it's
interesting.

620
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.040
So off things like as a pledge of allegiance,
I'm elementary school.

621
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.840
This was pretty scary for my prospector.
Uh,
uh,

622
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.540
that is this bad.
Are you on a secondary approach?

623
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.340
Is like being on time,
uh,
having all your work done.
And uh,

624
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.880
well I'll just comfortable,
I look,

625
00:41:21.881 --> 00:41:26.260
your mentioned is that doesn't look really go wild was the startup education.

626
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.310
No,
I've handled it a couple different ways.

627
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.200
I've had teachers who are receptive it and schools that are,
you know,
I,

628
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.940
I tell them my kids are allowed to go home.

629
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:41.000
Sometimes I have to write a note because we're very litigious culture.

630
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.770
Say they have my permission to do these things and sometimes I get a little

631
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:48.770
passive aggressive.
Um,
I have a teacher,

632
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.980
kids do not need to do homework in elementary school.

633
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.600
I will say that there are no grades,
especially till third grade.
Um,

634
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:02.000
and there's no proof that doing homework help in elementary school.

635
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.860
And I've had arguments with teachers about this and other times I've just said

636
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:10.940
to my son,
don't do it and you don't have to do the homework.

637
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.480
And if you want to do it and you want to bring me the little piece of paper that

638
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:17.990
I'm supposed to sign,
which is really interesting.
Transfer of responsibility,

639
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.850
you can't.
And the moment he does that,
he'll probably have passed some bar,

640
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:27.610
but I don't let them make me control him,
if that makes sense.
Yeah.

641
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.770
Any other questions?
Do you have any theories on how American culture,

642
00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.060
yeah,
unfortunately I only have theories.
Um,

643
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.220
a lot of it is the media and those scary stories and scary movies.

644
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:46.100
I mean we have a show,
I think it's called law and order,

645
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:51.101
special victims unit where every week a child is in some horrific situation.

646
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.290
And it,
it gives the impression that this happens often.
Um,

647
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.630
I also think that we have very competitive culture and always have.

648
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.850
So we are so worried about our kids' success that we think we need to start them

649
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:06.770
on that treadmill early.

650
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:11.890
And it's actually had some very bad results because if you're a kid and you're

651
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.190
working really hard and kindergarten,
first grade so that you can,
you know,

652
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:18.710
work really hard in middle school and high school so you can get into a good

653
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:21.740
college and work really hard to get a good job so you can work really hard.

654
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.360
That can be very depressing.
And anxiety producing that,
you know,

655
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:31.340
where is the moment for enjoyment and the meaning of life really,

656
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:31.831
you know,
as a,

657
00:43:31.831 --> 00:43:36.831
just to constantly compete and be the best and make money or is there something

658
00:43:36.861 --> 00:43:39.230
else there?
That's the value.
And I think if,

659
00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.800
if we change our view on that and how we communicate with our kids,

660
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:46.760
it could help them out a lot.
Okay.

661
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.920
Should we break at this point?

662
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.110
What's in the book?
Um,
some of the stories I told here,
it's a research memoir.

663
00:43:57.111 --> 00:44:01.010
So it's part,
partly my stories and experiences and it's Harley.

664
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:03.770
I talked a lot of experts on what studies as well.

665
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:07.490
And I would say it's part manifesto cause I'm trying to make an argument that we

666
00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:09.380
should give our kids more independence.

667
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:17.410
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
