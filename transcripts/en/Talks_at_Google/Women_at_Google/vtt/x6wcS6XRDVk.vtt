Today at Google.

2
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:12.381
We are delighted to welcome Lathop Paul Nippon and Deepa Prahalad.

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.820
Um,
Dr uh,

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.680
Paulownia pawn is a professor of medicine at Stanford where for the last 20

5
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.101
years,

6
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:28.101
shits has studied and worked on cardiovascular disease and diabetes and South

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.310
Asians.
Uh,

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.460
Miss Lod comes from a management consulting background specializing in emerging

9
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:40.110
markets and is now on the board of a rocky world where she focuses on growth and

10
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.640
design.
And she wrote a book titled Predictable Men,
it predictable magic,

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.360
which attempts to unite strategy and design thinking.

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.040
They are here today to discuss today to discuss their work at a rodeo world,

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.740
a global health nonprofit organization,

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.150
working to prevent noncommunicable diseases,
eg diabetes,

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.470
heart disease,

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.560
cancer and chronic lung diseases through health education and lifestyle change.

17
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.910
Please join me in welcoming to Google Lofa Pony,
pawn and deeper Prahalad.

18
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.250
<v 2>Thank you for coming out today.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself.</v>

20
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:31.400
My name's Lotta Pony up and I'm currently a professor of medicine at Stanford.

21
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:35.360
I spend most of my time doing research and heart disease and diabetes.

22
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.660
I do work on electronic health records,
mortality records,

23
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.390
and I do clinical trials in type two diabetes,

24
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:45.860
trying to promote physical activity in people with type two diabetes.
Um,

25
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.300
and I teach first year medical student population health.

26
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:52.790
So that's how to take care of large groups of people.

27
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.220
And I also see patients in Stanford's,
um,

28
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.300
executive medicine program and we're trying to start a genetic and

29
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:06.020
pharmacogenetic testing program there to bring evidence based,
uh,

30
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.220
genetic testing.
Um,
so I want to,

31
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:12.600
before we start today,
um,

32
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.850
have us think a little bit about diabetes and um,

33
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.440
and I'm going to be presenting some statistics on diabetes around the world,
but,

34
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.780
um,
if you could think for a moment why,

35
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.190
why you think diabetes is increasing so much and prevalence.

36
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.443
Um,

37
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.250
now you probably have heard in the papers that diabetes is increasing and I

38
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:36.650
wonder if anyone in the audience has any thoughts on that.

39
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.800
Maybe what brought you here today?
If you have a family member

40
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.530
with diabetes,

41
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.713
<v 1>American Diet,</v>

42
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.870
<v 2>Standard American diet,
any more color to that?</v>

43
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.340
What is the standard American Diet?

44
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.320
<v 2>Too much sugar and fat.
And in fact,</v>

46
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:00.730
one of my colleagues at Stanford recently wrote a paper that was published in

47
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:05.731
Jama showing that both low fat and low carb diets when healthy promoted weight

48
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.680
loss.
So that kind of put an end to the low carb,

49
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.200
low fat debate.
I hope.

50
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.950
I think we will continue to debate about that because people feel that certain

51
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.520
diets work for them more than,
uh,
more than another.
But,
um,

52
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.260
it did show in the end that a calorie is a calorie and having the appropriate

53
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:30.820
amount of calories for your body size is,
um,
helpful for,

54
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.900
um,
maintaining a healthy weight and preventing chronic diseases in general.

55
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.660
Okay.
So let's talk about,
uh,
the global epidemic of diabetes.
And particularly,

56
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.590
you know,
what we're trying to do in preventing this epidemic.

57
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:49.591
So this is a graph of a diabetes cases in the u s so you can see the u s and

58
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.210
around the world and in the u s so you can see in the u s in Green,

59
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.400
they're 37 million cases of diabetes.

60
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.670
And the black part on the side shows you what percentage is undiagnosed.

61
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.380
So you can see in different areas of the world,

62
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.550
there are different proportions of undiagnosed diabetes.

63
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.430
Um,
and um,

64
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.870
and I hope that you and the audience have gotten tested for diabetes,

65
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.930
but can anyone tell me how we test for diabetes,

66
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.430
insulin and blood sugar?
Great answers.
So that's the absolute correct answer.

67
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.430
So we try to check your blood sugar.
So we check,
um,

68
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.400
either a fasting number in the morning of your blood,
uh,

69
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.010
blood sugar or what we call a glycosylated hemoglobin,

70
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:42.640
hemoglobin a one c because as we have more glucose in our bodies,

71
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.630
it attaches onto our hemoglobin and we can measure those levels.

72
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.500
And then another way that we can do it is through an oral glucose tolerance
test.

73
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.880
So,
um,
and that's sort of drinking a,
um,

74
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.470
a glucose load and then checking your glucose after two hours to see how your

75
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:01.090
body processes glucose.

76
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.070
So all of these things you can imagine are a little hard to do because they

77
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.920
involve blood tests in resource limited settings.

78
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.330
So I hope in partnership with technology companies like Google that we'll be

79
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:18.240
able to improve the diagnosis of diabetes and um,

80
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.580
be able to do it without expensive blood tests going forward.
So,

81
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.890
so you can see in the world,

82
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:28.030
382 million people are living with diabetes and about half of those are

83
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:32.200
diagnosed under diagnosed and half are undiagnosed.

84
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.210
Okay.
So the top 10 countries by number of diabetes cases.

85
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.750
So the top countries are China and India.

86
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.490
The prevalence of diabetes is about the same,

87
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.230
so about 10%.

88
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.440
It ranges in these countries from 7% to 14% depending on if you're urban or

89
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:58.040
rural.
And,
um,
what your familial risk factors are.

90
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.870
And the reason that the number of cases are so high in China and India is

91
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.470
because the absolute number of people are so high,
right?
In China,
India,

92
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:09.230
they're our largest countries in the world.
And then,

93
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:13.360
so you can see the u s is um,
is third there and a,

94
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:15.200
a distant third.
And,
um,

95
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.950
the number of cases of diabetes in the u s are increasing as well.

96
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.010
And the greatest projected increase our is in the western Pacific.

97
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:29.270
So China,
Korea,
Japan,
Vietnam,
Indonesia,

98
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.500
and Australia,

99
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.760
the number of cases are projected to increase by about 50%.

100
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.000
<v 2>And this is just a,
um,
a,</v>

102
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.030
a graph showing the economic,
um,
background of these countries.

103
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.750
So high income is yellow,
upper middle is orange,

104
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.070
lower middle is pink,
and low income is red.

105
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.400
And so you can see there again that the proportion of undiagnosed changes

106
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.480
depending on the economic background and situation of those countries,

107
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.530
um,
with a really high proportion undiagnosed,

108
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.860
again in India and China and the high income countries having,

109
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.450
um,
a little bit less undiagnosed,

110
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:20.110
but still a significant proportion even in the u s we have a significant

111
00:07:20.111 --> 00:07:22.880
proportion of undiagnosed diabetes,
um,

112
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.540
simply because people aren't going in and getting tested.

113
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:29.170
And it does take some effort to go ahead and get tested for type two diabetes.

114
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.700
And Asia represents about 60% of the diabetic populations worldwide.

115
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.910
Okay.
So,
um,

116
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.540
we are focusing today particularly on South Asia and this is um,

117
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.790
um,
doctor Prahalad who will speak after me is the,
um,

118
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.340
the purpose of the nonprofit reducing diabetes in um,

119
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.220
South Asia,
which has a particularly high prevalence of diabetes.

120
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:58.640
So this is a map of South Asia.
We commonly think of India,
um,

121
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.550
representing South Asia and it is a major part of the subcontinent and 90% of

122
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:05.950
the South Asians in California are from India,

123
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.340
but also South Asians are from Pakistan and Nepal,

124
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:12.220
Butan and Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as well.

125
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.570
And this is a map from the bay of the bay area of the census in this area.

126
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.680
And what percent of people are Asian,
Indian by county?
So,
um,

127
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.170
so you can see there,
um,

128
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.110
particularly around Alameda and the Fremont area particularly,

129
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:33.700
it's about 10% Asian Indians.
A one out of 10 people are South Asian.

130
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.850
And in Santa Clara where we are are now about one out of 15 people are Asian

131
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:41.164
Indian.

132
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.130
So this is a study I did earlier in my career and looking at mortality records

133
00:08:47.131 --> 00:08:51.780
of California and looking at coronary heart disease,
um,

134
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.220
because diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease and diabetes is so much

135
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:58.900
higher in South Asians,
um,

136
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.570
particularly among young Indian men.
So 25 to 44,

137
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.080
their risk of heart disease is almost three times as high.

138
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:11.640
So you that tall red bar compared to the total population which is in green,

139
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.410
the non Hispanic white population in orange,
the Hispanic population and blue,

140
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.101
um,

141
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:21.240
the African American or black population and Brown and then Chinese population

142
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:23.850
of blue and a Japanese population in yellow there.

143
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:27.570
And the Indian population is in red.
And,
um,

144
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.960
what got me into the business that I'm in is that my father died of a heart

145
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:34.770
attack at 39.
I grew up in Michigan and lived there at the time,

146
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.090
but he represented that three times higher risk in the young men,

147
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:44.010
25 to 44.
So I encourage you if,
if you know of anyone,

148
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.480
um,
in this,
uh,
race,
ethnic group,
um,

149
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.190
there are particularly high risk for heart disease.

150
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.660
And should be tested for diabetes and other risk factors for heart disease.

151
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.130
So,
um,

152
00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:01.130
this is another study that I did using data from Palo Alto Medical Foundation.

153
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:02.940
So we collected race,

154
00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:06.900
ethnic information at Palo Alto medical foundation because it is so highly

155
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:07.950
prevalently Asian.

156
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.360
So the bay area's about 30% Asian and it has good representation of all of these

157
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:15.200
Asian subgroups.
Um,
and you want to hear,

158
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.190
get their care from Palo Alto Medical Foundation particularly?
No,

159
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.770
it's a great place.
It's a,
it's a good place to get care.
Um,
so,
um,

160
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.000
so you can see that all Asians in general have higher odds.

161
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:31.320
So this is the likelihood of having diabetes among that group compared to non

162
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:35.280
Hispanic whites about double the risk.
So men are on the left,

163
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:39.750
women are on the right in all the arrows and the statistically significant,

164
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.930
um,
numbers are in bold there.

165
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.800
So you can see that among the Asian subgroups when you aggregate them,

166
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.780
there is a higher risk of diabetes.
And when you desegregate the Asian subgroups,

167
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.280
some groups have much higher risk than other groups,

168
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.330
namely Asian Indians and Filipinos in this case have three to four times the

169
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:01.320
risk.
And other Asian groups also have higher risk like Chinese,

170
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.020
Japanese and Korean.

171
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.700
And these are all age adjusted as well.
Um,
given the,
the,
um,

172
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.800
slightly younger age substructure of Asians in the u s okay.

173
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:18.760
So why,
why do Asians and perhaps uh,
um,

174
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.160
Asian Indians in particular have more risk of diabetes?

175
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.000
So this is a paper that was published in Lancet,
um,

176
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.180
by two of the people that I consider my mentors,

177
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:32.890
yogic and Yedgan and they're an Indian weddings.

178
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.870
You can see the Saris and the background and um,

179
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.650
yet nick is the Non Hispanic White reach researcher on your left.

180
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.070
And yogic is the Indian researcher on your right.

181
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:49.230
And you can see that they have an identical BMI body mass index of 22.3,

182
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.950
but their body fat,
and sorry,
it's covered there by um,

183
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.900
the notation,

184
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.240
the slide advancer but it's three times as high for the Indian researcher.

185
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.480
It's about 9% versus 27%.

186
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.230
So at an identical level of body mass index,
there's more fat.

187
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.530
And so next to them they have dexa scan.
So these are um,

188
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.830
scans that we normally do for bone,

189
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:17.620
but you can also see fat and muscle in those scans.

190
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.860
And in a Dexa scan muscle is more white.

191
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:23.830
So you can see the non Hispanic white researcher has more muscle.

192
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:27.670
You can see it particularly around the thighs in the abdominal area,

193
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:32.650
whereas the Indian researcher does is more sort of dark on that Dexa scan.

194
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:37.420
So that's indicative of more fat.
So Asians,

195
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.560
um,
based on data like this and other work that I'll show you,

196
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.600
the WHO recommended a lower body mass index cut point for Asians.

197
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:51.460
So it's 23 and lower.
And for non Hispanics,
whites it's 25 and lower.

198
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.930
And um,

199
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.930
so this is a study that I did showing that at similar levels of body mass index,

200
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.670
there's higher risk of something called Metabolic Syndrome,

201
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:08.380
which is pre diabetes.
It's combination of triglycerides,
low HDL,

202
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:11.380
which is the good cholesterol,
High Glucose,
um,

203
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.460
obesity as well as blood pressure,
greater than one 30,
over 85.

204
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.490
So you can see on the x axis,

205
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.540
on the horizontal axis is the body mass indices.

206
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.830
And on the y axis is the probability of having metabolic syndrome.

207
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.160
And Asian Indians are on the red curve and Nice Fanuc whites or are on the blue

208
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:36.670
curve.
And you can see that at every level of body mass index,

209
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.290
the Asian Indians have higher probability of having this prediabetes.

210
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.270
So,

211
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.270
and it is very difficult to have a BMI of 23 at this moment I stand in front of

212
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:50.020
you with a Bmi of 23,

213
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.100
but sometimes on Mondays after a weekend of lots of parties,
my,

214
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.120
I gained three pounds and I'm a very short person and my Bmi is 24.

215
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.360
So it's very hard to maintain that BMI of 23 but I have to do it because I have

216
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:07.390
to practice what I preach.
So,
so you can see here,

217
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:11.110
and this is also from Palo Alto Medical Foundation,
um,
the,

218
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.740
the range of um,

219
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.360
body mass index for non Hispanic whites on the left and Asian Indians on the

220
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:21.050
right for women on the left and men on the right.
And you can see that,
um,

221
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.230
a BMI of 25 and higher,

222
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:27.220
so 50% of women in the Palo Alto Medical Foundation,

223
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.810
electronic health record database.

224
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:30.610
So there's about a million people in that database.

225
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.850
50% of non Hispanic women were an at risk BMI and about 60% of Asian Indian

226
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:39.910
women had a BMI of 23 and higher.

227
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.750
So we have a long way to go to get people at the appropriate level of weight.

228
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.030
And um,

229
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.070
for men it was eight out of 10 non Hispanic white men were not at the

230
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.310
appropriate or optimal weight and nine out of 10 Asian Indian men.

231
00:14:55.311 --> 00:15:00.260
So when I was at Palo Alto Medical Foundation had a specific clinic for South

232
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.520
Asians and um,
nine out of 10 of the people that I saw,
you know,

233
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:09.521
we had to do work to get them down to a lower level of body weight.

234
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.350
So when you go to see your doctor,

235
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.290
your doctor might use your clinical data,

236
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:19.490
including your gender and your HDL or good cholesterol and your total

237
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:20.324
cholesterol,

238
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.410
and whether your blood pressure is high or low or whether or not you smoke to

239
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:27.350
estimate your risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

240
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:29.690
This is called an Asmr CVD risk calculator.

241
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.460
So one thing that I want us to be aware of is that these risk calculators are

242
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:36.320
mainly based on non Hispanic,

243
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:41.321
white European populations and they mate might underestimate the risk in some

244
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.880
groups such as South Asians.
I also do work in desegregating Hispanic subgroups.

245
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:51.050
So Puerto Ricans and Cubans can also be underestimated.
So,

246
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.390
so you should be aware that um,
our,

247
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.610
our current risk calculators may not be accurate in all groups and we should be

248
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:02.180
aware of what data was used to create those risks.
Predictions.

249
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:04.130
And I hope that with um,

250
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.450
aggregating larger and larger data sets that we'll be able to,
um,

251
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.230
improve our risk prediction.
Okay.
So what can we do?
And,

252
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.970
um,
doctor [inaudible] who will speak after me will speak a little bit more about

253
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:21.740
the nonprofit and what they are doing specifically.
But,
um,
you know,

254
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:25.230
we heard that it's sort of the western lifestyle and,
um,

255
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.720
you sort of hit it right on the head with a red meat sugars sitting at a

256
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:32.860
computer.
I'm smoking,
um,

257
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.610
refined grains,
traffic,
alcohol,
you know,

258
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:41.400
sort of all of these things that are,
um,
uh,

259
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.150
contributing to the diabetes epidemic.
Um,
but what,
you know,

260
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.160
one thing that I want to sort of point out in a point that I make is that in

261
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.960
rural areas that have agrarian lifestyles,
diabetes rates are actually quite low,

262
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.820
right?
But substance subsistence farming isn't a great way to live for a lot of

263
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:04.730
reasons,
but diabetes is not very high.

264
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.020
So people tend to have a lot of physical activity,
not a lot of calories,

265
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:10.090
not a lot of,
uh,

266
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.660
transfats or saturated fats and diabetes rates are low.

267
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.760
But then when they go to more of an urban lifestyle with eating big MACs and

268
00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:22.550
fries.
So high,
high fat diets,
as you mentioned,

269
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.210
these rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease can go up.

270
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.900
But then we get to live maybe in an area like we do in the bay area where we

271
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:37.001
have access to exercise like soul cycle and orange theory and um,

272
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.480
Palatino and also access to great food like sprouts.

273
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.920
And,
um,
I dunno,
I think there must be 10 different salad places here.

274
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.200
And so when we improve our socioeconomic status in this country,

275
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:56.190
we can also lower diabetes rates.

276
00:17:56.191 --> 00:18:01.191
So in the U s people with higher socioeconomic status have lower diabetes rates

277
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.950
and this is changing and developing countries.
But in general,

278
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.610
people with lower socioeconomic status and developing countries had lower rates

279
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.300
of diabetes.
And this is called the epidemiologic transition.

280
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:16.680
When you go to higher socioeconomic status and you have in developing countries

281
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:18.360
and have higher rates of chronic disease.

282
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:21.150
But we're seeing that flip it a little bit now as well.

283
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.330
But how can we avoid this lifestyle transition?

284
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.400
How can we in developing countries,
you know,

285
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.330
go from this agrarian lifestyle to one in which,
um,

286
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:37.670
we can translate to more higher ses in higher income countries,

287
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:42.930
lifestyles.
So I think there's many ways to do this.
And,

288
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.230
um,
and doctor brought a lot,
we'll talk a little bit more about these,

289
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:49.770
but there's,
and this is from a paper I wrote for the American Heart Association,

290
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.550
um,
looking at the,
um,
uh,

291
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.920
it was called the community guide about how communities can improve rates of

292
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:59.100
diabetes.
So there's many axes on,
um,

293
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.480
legal community as well as risk factors in early diagnoses.

294
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.350
So one of the things that we did for diet was banned trans fats.

295
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:12.120
So many countries have banned trans fats and that has helped a,

296
00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:15.240
has been bent the curve in terms of lowering diabetes rates,

297
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.510
also the sedentary lifestyle.
And I think Google has been wonderful in,
um,

298
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.570
you know,
providing all the wonderful bikes outside and,
and other,
um,

299
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.270
healthy,
um,
encouraging healthy habits.
I saw lots of fruit available outside,

300
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.210
um,
and uh,

301
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.950
trying to decrease even sitting at a computer.
So getting up and taking breaks.

302
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.510
I ask my patients to do that a lot.

303
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.070
I will go a long way towards preventing diabetes and other chronic disease,

304
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.910
tobacco.
So we don't have tobacco advertising on in our,

305
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:51.930
on our TV stations for our kids to see in the u s but this is something that

306
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:56.280
could be implemented in developing countries and unfortunately developing

307
00:19:56.281 --> 00:20:01.260
countries are the place of the tobacco countries or companies are going to

308
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:03.690
advertise more and get more smokers.

309
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:08.520
So that's something that hopefully we can prevent going forward and um,

310
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.750
you know,
treatment of high blood pressure and lipids.

311
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.760
So guidelines on how to screen for this.

312
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:17.610
I talked a little bit about that as well as um,

313
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.250
early recognition of symptomatic disease,
um,

314
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.020
perhaps with screening with a coronary artery calcium and other newer biomarkers

315
00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:25.854
that are coming out.

316
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:31.310
So I think we've come a long way in the u s I think that we have learned lessons

317
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:35.970
here that would be great to transmit to other developing countries.

318
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.110
And I'm looking forward to hearing more about how we can do that.

319
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.103
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.270
<v 3>thank you.
It's an honor to be here.
And I have,</v>

321
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:58.540
<v 4>I'm just going to prison.
Uh,
how did they,</v>

322
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.433
what

323
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.563
<v 1>s</v>

324
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.960
<v 3>okay.
There we go.
Thank you everybody for coming.</v>

325
00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:17.840
And I would like to just spend a little bit of time.
I think Dr Lotta plenty.

326
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.870
Putin has done a fantastic job of talking about some of the unique challenges

327
00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:26.730
from a medical standpoint and as a nonprofit we really had this additional

328
00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:29.430
challenge of saying we have this information,

329
00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:33.330
but how do we make it actionable and how do we create awareness?

330
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.010
Because I think we all know in emerging markets the awareness is an issue.

331
00:21:38.011 --> 00:21:42.900
The education levels and a lot of people who are in rural areas,

332
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.990
um,
you know,
culturally they're even terms that said,
you know,

333
00:21:45.991 --> 00:21:50.590
diabetes is a rich person's disease.
So the awareness that this could happen,
um,

334
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:55.110
at all is not there in many cases.
And we also,
um,

335
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.560
really said when we looked around at our community here,

336
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.850
there really isn't a single family that hasn't been touched by one of these

337
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.960
diseases in some manner.
And so that's how I got involved.

338
00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:08.610
I don't have a clinical background,

339
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.960
but we really are trying to use design and innovation to help drive awareness

340
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:17.640
and,
um,
some kind of actionable steps in this process.

341
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.603
<v 4>MMM.</v>

342
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.690
<v 3>So what we really did is we have a nonprofit called Arogya world.
Uh,</v>

343
00:22:24.691 --> 00:22:29.400
Rokia is a Sanskrit word that means health to live a life without disease.

344
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.210
And we really said,
um,
you know,

345
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:36.260
let's see how we can do some kind of actionable chorus to change the course of

346
00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:38.491
chronic disease.

347
00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:42.810
And we really settled on three fundamental pillars of awareness,

348
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.690
action,
really providing people tools,

349
00:22:45.691 --> 00:22:50.640
not just information and creating alliances with people who had information that

350
00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:52.870
we could bring to a new audience.
Um,

351
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.950
currently we've reached about three and 3.7 million people and we have plans to

352
00:22:58.441 --> 00:23:02.970
double our outreach by 2020.
And,
um,
I think,

353
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.360
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this because I think it was especially a

354
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.720
well covered,
you know,
66% of the deaths in the world,
um,

355
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.900
are from noncommunicable diseases.

356
00:23:12.901 --> 00:23:16.920
And these are 80% of the deaths in developing countries.

357
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.980
And the economic impact of that is absolutely devastating.

358
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:26.520
And this is really kind of the challenge in emerging markets as you have a lot

359
00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:31.110
of what I would call this good bad news where a lot of this is because of

360
00:23:31.111 --> 00:23:35.400
increased life expectancy from dealing fairly well with infectious disease.

361
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.380
So now people are living long enough,

362
00:23:37.381 --> 00:23:41.070
but because of the demographics you have this challenge where you're dealing

363
00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:45.590
with malnutrition and diabetes and heart disease at the same time,
uh,

364
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:49.400
which makes it extremely difficult to get information across.

365
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:54.401
And we know ultimately that three behavior changes can really change the course

366
00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:59.900
of chronic disease,
healthy eating,
exercise and avoiding a diabetes.

367
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.180
And the gains from that are quite significant.

368
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:07.181
We can actually prevent 80% of diabetes and heart disease and 40% of cancers

369
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.400
that is provided,
the information is available and acted upon.
Um,

370
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.940
and so that's what we have tried to address.

371
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.970
And I think where we realized how important this is is because despite all the

372
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:24.920
economic growth that people are excited about,

373
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.220
this can actually cripple any economic gains made in many emerging countries.

374
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:35.480
We have,
you know,
50% of the population that dies from chronic disease,

375
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.650
20% of the population has at least one of these heart disease,

376
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:44.150
diabetes or some type of cancer.
And Indians also get this,

377
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:47.960
these diseases much earlier,
um,
in their prime working life.

378
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:52.961
So you can see the statistics of four point 8 trillion in lost economic output

379
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.930
by 2030 is significant.
And if people don't have that themselves,

380
00:24:57.931 --> 00:25:01.040
there tend to be very concerned because they tend to be caregivers for their

381
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:04.910
parents.
Uh,
young professionals of both genders,
um,

382
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.800
tend to take on that responsibility.

383
00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:11.801
So it's an issue even for people who are not suffering from one of these.

384
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.860
And what we realized when we did,
I think the first,
um,

385
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.440
10,000 women survey is that this economic impact is particularly severe for

386
00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:28.430
women.
Women have been the focus of a lot of development efforts.

387
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.490
And what we did was take 10 countries around the world and we surveyed a

388
00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:36.740
thousand women and said,
what is the impact in your lives?

389
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:41.030
And what we're finding is that I'm,
you know,
50% of people,

390
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.860
women are saying,
yes,

391
00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:47.861
we are having to be the primary care giver for even one person with an NCD that

392
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:51.290
can cut family income by half.

393
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.570
And it also means that about 25% of people who were in our survey were saying

394
00:25:56.571 --> 00:26:00.290
that they have been forced to leave the workforce for extended periods.

395
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.430
So we decided to say,
all right,
how do we empower women?

396
00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:09.430
And that was a fine line because I think many efforts today in wellness,
um,

397
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.580
while they're focus is women they end tend to overwhelm and place a lot of extra

398
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:17.810
burden solely on one person who may be overburdened.
Um,

399
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:18.740
in any case,

400
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.820
and we said we need to design something that's flexible,

401
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:27.110
lean and can be adapted.
Because India is a very rapidly changing environment.

402
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:31.310
The types of phones that people have where they could receive messages,

403
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.790
where they can understand what their risk factors are changing.

404
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.240
And many of the rural areas,

405
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.990
what has happened is that they are very exciting targets for multinational

406
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:46.680
companies.
What can be offered cheaply,
however,
is not the sprout stuff.

407
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.030
It's the junk food that stays in a,

408
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:54.450
it has a very long shelf life and it doesn't wear out easily.

409
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.870
And what's happening is that those are the first things that are offered cause

410
00:26:57.871 --> 00:27:01.320
kind of an entry point to a new group of consumers.

411
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:03.060
And there isn't a lot of awareness.

412
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:07.580
People tend to like those because they're in small sample sizes and um,

413
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.980
because they're seen as very hygienic.
So it's a huge problem.

414
00:27:10.981 --> 00:27:15.300
And this is the first generation in many cases in some of those areas that can

415
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:18.960
afford to give these kids,
um,
treats that they never had.

416
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.170
So we knew we had to really have a low cost scalable and user friendly,

417
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:26.580
um,
way to do this.

418
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:31.110
And what we settled on is what I call our doorstep health model,

419
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.910
where we basically say the best way to help women and families is to make sure

420
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:39.010
that they are not the sole person.
Uh,

421
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.400
they are trying to take charge of their family's health.
We know that beer,

422
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.253
the drivers,

423
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.610
but we have a school program where children in seventh and eighth grade get a

424
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:52.611
set of really interesting game based exercises where they have the awareness

425
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:56.640
created and an early stage.
We have a workplace initiative.

426
00:27:56.641 --> 00:28:01.320
Many employers are really interested in making sure that their employees get

427
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:03.060
this information early on.

428
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.110
And for many people who are out in very disparate areas,

429
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:12.111
we have a m health messages that come over and they are very simple action based

430
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:16.410
messages.
We don't give anybody statistics about diabetes.

431
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.980
We tell them concrete things they can do,
you know,
reduce,
um,
the,

432
00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:23.130
your intake of these grains have.

433
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:27.750
So we've created a very friendly voice that is geared toward inspiring people to

434
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:31.640
take action
and quickly.
Um,

435
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.630
we have actually a list of our,
um,
genesis we've created.

436
00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.590
Um,
our newest thing is an initiative called [inaudible],

437
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.940
which is basically similar to the u s government's my plate where we've taken

438
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:49.380
nutritional guidelines and tried to create an icon based system so people

439
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:52.740
actually understand visually what these guidelines mean.

440
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.190
And what we have found,
um,

441
00:28:56.191 --> 00:29:00.990
in terms of our focus is really seeing that we want to use technology to spread

442
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:03.750
awareness,
but we're not going to become a technology company.

443
00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:08.520
That's not our focus.
We're not trying to create tons of,
of cool,

444
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.350
um,
you know,
add ons to our text messages or even our app in the workplace.

445
00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:15.450
What we're really trying to do in the workplace,

446
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.930
we will have an APP that allows people to measure and record.

447
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.790
But for the text message program,

448
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:25.140
what we've really done is give people very simple messages and we've tried to

449
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:29.070
motivate them.
We didn't want to have the voice of a clinician.

450
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.360
We all love and respect our doctors and we get the most expensive ones that we

451
00:29:33.361 --> 00:29:36.450
can afford,
but we don't want to talk to them every day.

452
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.780
Nor do we want to be gentle,
you know,

453
00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:44.290
have gentle reminders from friends and family about what we should eat when

454
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:49.240
we're overeating.
And so,
um,
having that encouragement was really important.

455
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.460
What we also realized after we had text messages going out for many months in

456
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:56.890
different languages is of course like anything else,

457
00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:01.260
it becomes easier to tune out.
So we partnered with a company called was the,

458
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.800
that does periodic voice messages as well,

459
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:08.260
where you actually get a phone call,
every boy,
you know,

460
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:12.760
a math message of encouragement,
you get a story from somebody else to say,
oh,

461
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:17.410
this is what I tried,
here's a recipe here was my success story.

462
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.120
And so we are really designed to inspire action and we have this self

463
00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:27.250
reinforcing model of workplace school and um,

464
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.170
text messages so that we make sure that we,
um,

465
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.830
have the same thing coming in from various places.

466
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.060
And what we were very encouraged to find in our very first survey when we

467
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:45.061
reached a million customers is that for an m health initiative,

468
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:50.590
we actually were able to achieve a 15% impact based on our surveys.

469
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:55.180
Just highly unusual.
Nokia was our initial partner in sending out,

470
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.063
um,

471
00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:01.410
these messages and people reported 15% of people reported for behavior changes

472
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.320
in the workplace context over time.

473
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:10.120
What we would like to do is really do some kind of clinical measurement for

474
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:11.200
people who opt in.

475
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.760
And we had very good response from the younger generation,

476
00:31:15.761 --> 00:31:17.600
which was the most encouraging.
Um,

477
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:22.610
we had a lot of students reporting that they had no idea about diabetes.

478
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:26.500
He had kind of heard a little bit about junk food.
Um,

479
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.100
but a lot of teachers said that these simple activities really brought the

480
00:31:30.101 --> 00:31:32.320
message home.
So in seventh grade,

481
00:31:32.321 --> 00:31:35.800
what we do is we have children take part in activities,

482
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:39.190
but in eighth grade they do a two year curriculum with us.

483
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.450
In eighth grade they bring their parents and families and to also receive this

484
00:31:43.451 --> 00:31:48.130
information and get concrete tips and people said that was incredibly helpful.

485
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.100
We've partnered with some of the leading NGOs in India,

486
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:55.930
like a Gasteia and we basically give them training materials and expand our

487
00:31:55.931 --> 00:31:57.040
reach that way.

488
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.910
One of the really exciting things we're doing is this a initiative called

489
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.990
[inaudible],
which we are doing for both north and south Indian food.

490
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.410
The nutrition guidelines in India are very complicated,

491
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:15.010
even for highly educated people to understand when they say,
you know,

492
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:18.910
we need 250 grams of a rice or we need this,

493
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.840
what does that actually mean?
So we've created an icon based,

494
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.340
a pictorial model.

495
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:29.341
We are also working to overtime physically create a plate and serving spoons of

496
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:34.450
appropriate sizes so people are able to quickly and easily comply.

497
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:34.751
Um,

498
00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:39.751
so a lot of our focuses exactly on that is really re creating a of ease of

499
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:44.480
compliance.
Um,
and then our school program,

500
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:47.270
we also were able to achieve a 14% impact.

501
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:52.270
And what we really had was simple things relating this battle to snakes and

502
00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:53.230
ladders.
You know,

503
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.830
this is just such a fundamentally different issue for India because the entire

504
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:01.730
health system has been really geared toward infectious disease where you do need

505
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:04.880
to have these limited interventions where you have to convince someone to take a

506
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:06.530
vaccine or something.

507
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:10.670
But lifestyle diseases are different in the system is not set up for that.

508
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:15.530
So we found that these very easy visual ways of communicating and giving people

509
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:17.900
the idea of what the impact of obesity can be,

510
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:21.230
where a backpack and and try to do a race,
um,

511
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.320
with all these extra pounds on you.

512
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:28.130
Those are the kinds of things that make it real and tend to have a really

513
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:30.320
experiential component that stays.

514
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.980
And we have also signed up a lot of leading Indian corporates,
you know,

515
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.390
and organizations like the Indian railways,

516
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:42.500
which is the largest employer in the world and with 1.3 million employees,

517
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.030
reliance,
Wipro,
um,

518
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.650
many of these companies to say here,

519
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:52.490
here is a simple downloadable app,

520
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.690
the get the text messages and now we have worked with them and we have partnered

521
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:02.290
with activity tracking companies and created an APP so that we can be a one stop

522
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:05.600
shop not only for diabetes but for overall wellness.

523
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.880
And we are testing and measuring the impact of that going forward.

524
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.500
And we're covering about 2.3 million employees currently and we're expecting

525
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:16.820
that to increase.

526
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.690
And what we knew also is that anything that we designed,

527
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.170
we know that both the tools,
the information,

528
00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:28.880
the guidelines around all of these diseases are evolving very rapidly.

529
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:31.580
So we didn't want to be too rigid in our design.

530
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.330
We just saw this exciting news about,
you know,
Google having an AI.
Um,

531
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.260
I scan if it can detect your cardiac risk.

532
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:43.150
We know that we've been able to limit the pinpricks with,
um,

533
00:34:43.151 --> 00:34:45.470
some of the diabetes measuring devices.

534
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.790
Even our understanding of what healthy eating is continues to evolve.

535
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:55.060
So we realized that kind of positioning ourselves as experts wasn't the way to

536
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:56.480
gain longterm credibility.

537
00:34:56.481 --> 00:35:01.190
What we wanted to be was somebody who was a friend and partner along the
journey,

538
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.780
um,
and able to create,
um,

539
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.460
a conversation to have information exchange.

540
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.780
We also want to always be able to learn from the people we're trying to serve.

541
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:14.240
So,
for example,
in our schools program,

542
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:19.370
what we learned is we gave people information about a healthy breakfast and we

543
00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:21.230
realize,
you know,
there's a component of,
you know,

544
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:25.250
10 to 15% of people who maybe don't get a breakfast before they come to school

545
00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:30.251
and their primary meal during the day is actually,

546
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.270
um,
at their school.
So we said,

547
00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:37.271
how do we then revise and rethink and help families understand what can still

548
00:35:37.651 --> 00:35:38.340
do?

549
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.060
And we realized that this two way information flow is going to be critical for

550
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:43.380
us going forward.

551
00:35:43.381 --> 00:35:48.381
And that's how we have structured all of our programs have continuously getting

552
00:35:48.631 --> 00:35:52.860
feedback as well as giving suggestions.
We are very excited.

553
00:35:52.861 --> 00:35:57.750
We've been able to reach this kind of impact only because we've had amazingly

554
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:02.430
committed,
um,
uh,
partners who have helped us really expand in schools,

555
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.670
workplaces.
This is a very small number,
um,

556
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:12.570
of them.
And what we got as we learned a lot is people saying,

557
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:16.890
we need this information in the u s what you've learned and the cost at which

558
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:21.420
you're able to deliver impact really could make a difference in the US and

559
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:24.350
Europe.
In other emerging markets.
And we agree.
Uh,

560
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:29.190
so what we are trying to do is actually take what we've learned and expand our

561
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:29.761
reach here.

562
00:36:29.761 --> 00:36:34.350
We're experimenting with an Indel American Center here in Chicago and trying to

563
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:39.351
see how we can best adjust some of our programs to audiences in different parts

564
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.420
of the world because there's,
you know,
different access in a different awareness.

565
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:50.690
We started at California working group last year and as far as going forward,

566
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:52.470
um,

567
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:57.210
how would we like to expand our reach is really getting feedback,

568
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.370
having people get involved,

569
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.780
never wants to turn down a donation where@aguildworld.org.
Um,

570
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.160
but what we really want to do is have people share information with us and how

571
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:12.000
they were able to create those lifestyle changes for themselves,

572
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:12.834
for their family.

573
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.070
Because we really believe now we have a channel to distribute that information

574
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.930
far and wide,
um,
and help us really spread the word and have an impact.

575
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.570
And I think the cost at which we were able to reach people is,
you know,

576
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.310
pretty amazing given other alternatives,

577
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:32.540
were able to create outreach for 50 cents.
Um,

578
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:37.170
we can actually create impact and behavior change m based on our surveys for

579
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:38.880
about $6 and 50 cents,

580
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.200
which is highly unusual in this type of an effort.

581
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:48.410
So we're really proud of what we've done so far and happy to take any questions,

582
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.060
um,
and uh,
get your feedback as well.
Thank you.

583
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.950
<v 0>I have a question.
Okay.
So you,</v>

584
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.510
you showed the picture of the Google,
uh,
scan,
I think it was an eye.

585
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.980
Um,
and I guess that's one example of,
of something Google's doing,
um,

586
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.560
in this,
on this front.
Um,
is there anything else,

587
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.693
um,

588
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.020
that you admire that Google is doing or that you would like to perhaps partner

589
00:38:24.021 --> 00:38:26.630
with Google on or,
or,
um,

590
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.860
some technologies that Google is working on that you think might be able to
help,

591
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.080
uh,
Rokia on its mission?

592
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.000
<v 3>Well,
I think one thing if you want,</v>

593
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.060
one thing that we have seen some interest from in our workplace,

594
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.120
um,
offerings is really saying,
you know,

595
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:47.530
young employees in India for example,
even if they are not personally affected,

596
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:51.940
the burden of caring for parents is something that really looms large for a lot

597
00:38:51.941 --> 00:38:54.700
of people at a very young age.
Um,

598
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:59.560
and kind of the social contract culturally is that children really take care of

599
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:04.330
their parents in their old age and because they get that's disease so much

600
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:05.164
younger,

601
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.010
really helping young employees understand how to care for their parents is one

602
00:39:09.011 --> 00:39:13.480
thing we've seen even in the u s now because so many people where activity

603
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:16.720
trackers,
they're able to integrate some of that information.

604
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:20.320
And the city planning India is at a stage where now you're seeing,

605
00:39:20.321 --> 00:39:25.321
okay there to prevent this migration from rural areas to urban areas and all the

606
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:29.350
consequences that entails.
Um,

607
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.950
people are able to use that data from activity trackers to do smarter planning.

608
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:37.480
They're probably four to 500 cities in India that are saying we need to create

609
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:40.510
infrastructure so people stay where they are.

610
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:45.110
So understanding how does that work,
what does that mean?
Um,

611
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.500
that's one of those really interesting things.

612
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:51.520
And I know the tech companies and the Pharma had been really involved in trying

613
00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:55.360
to create new diagnostics and new ways to monitor.

614
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.660
So anything that lets people do that at a lower cost,

615
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:02.740
we'll make this disproportionate impact,
I think in countries like India.

616
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

617
00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:08.810
<v 2>So I agree.
And to build on that,
you know,
for my patients,
I would love,</v>

618
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.300
you know,

619
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.610
some type of noninvasive glucose monitoring because I think it is really hard

620
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:17.930
currently have to prick your finger and put it on a little piece of paper and

621
00:40:17.931 --> 00:40:22.040
stick it in the machine and,
and see what the number is.
And,
um,
so,

622
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.260
so some way,
um,
and I've,

623
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.640
and worked with some companies that are using light technology,
um,

624
00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:32.740
to perhaps look at the wave lengths on hemoglobin to see what the glycosylation

625
00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:38.840
of the hemoglobin is to,
um,
you know,
detect the glucose levels.

626
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.700
So noninvasive glucose monitoring as well as continuous glucose monitoring.

627
00:40:43.701 --> 00:40:48.110
So what,
um,
my,
my patients are so surprised by,
you know,

628
00:40:48.111 --> 00:40:50.750
when they eat,
if they prick their finger,

629
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.720
their glucose is higher and sort of really connecting,
you know,

630
00:40:53.721 --> 00:40:57.290
what you're putting in your body and what's happening to your glucose and what

631
00:40:57.291 --> 00:41:02.291
is happening longterm to your heart disease risk is,

632
00:41:02.661 --> 00:41:06.110
I think,
you know,
would be great to connect the dots for our patients.

633
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.173
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:18.000
<v 5>I think,
um,
the,
the,
um,
his,
uh,
data that you showed at the beginning,</v>

635
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:22.770
it's mostly very broad.
Um,
and um,
it's,
it's,

636
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:27.440
it's really like,
I guess it's,
uh,
quite ipidot yellow Chico.

637
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:29.340
Sorry,
what?
Yes.
Epidemiological.
Yeah.

638
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.030
But I feel like there's actually more detailed available,
for instance,

639
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.580
a plant based diets if you look at the Adventist studies and so on.
Yes.
Um,

640
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.010
so I feel like it could be a little bit more aggressive maybe about,
uh,

641
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.800
promoting very particular things,
um,
to,
to say,
well,
you know,

642
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.440
you say you see you've cut out the cheese,

643
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:51.710
maybe it not so big a problem in India,
but like I'm,
I'm from Germany,

644
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:54.710
so I was eating a lot of cheese.
So basically,
you know,
cut off the cheese.

645
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.180
How about the other thing,
you know,

646
00:41:56.181 --> 00:42:01.040
basically you go from avoiding a meet and you avoid first,
you know,

647
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.790
but,
but you also look at all the opportunities that it actually increases your

648
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.660
quality of life because,
uh,
it's not just about losing the weight.

649
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:12.500
I think that basically the,
the,
uh,
the thing is a little bit,
uh,

650
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.963
the gist of,

651
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.700
I think what you have in your health information is supposed to be like a,

652
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:19.970
you low lowering your weight so you reduce your risk of diabetes.

653
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:24.710
But there's a whole host of other side effects which I positive basically by a

654
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.550
particular diet changes and also of course exercise that comes with it.

655
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.820
<v 2>Absolutely.
I completely agree with you.</v>

656
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:34.340
And to restate a little bit is sort of like,

657
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:39.341
there was some broad strokes about diabetes rates and sort of an ecological,

658
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.130
uh,

659
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:45.130
sort of a argument that increased die of diabetes is caused by increased obesity

660
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:50.000
in general.
And so with,
with,
when I talk to patients,
I talk about sort of,

661
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:54.590
um,
you know,
kind of rough tuning and fine tuning.

662
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:59.900
So one third of the people in this country or at normal weight,

663
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:04.580
one third,
one third are overweight and one third is obese.

664
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.970
So in that one third,
that is normal weight.

665
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.470
I agree that fine tuning is very needed.
So you know,

666
00:43:12.471 --> 00:43:15.070
looking exactly at a 24 hour food recalls.

667
00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:16.520
So that's what we do with our patients,

668
00:43:16.521 --> 00:43:20.420
like seeing what they ate in the last 24 hours and seeing where there can be

669
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:24.920
more protein and a substitution for more of a whole grain than a refined grain.

670
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.770
And some of these interventions that are culturally specific,

671
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:32.720
like the my Thawley,
right,
I did a study where we interviewed,
um,

672
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:36.230
South Asian patients and they would go see a nutritionist and,

673
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.150
and the patient said,
oh,

674
00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:41.330
they told me not to eat burgers and fries and cheese and they never ate those

675
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.230
things anyway,
right.

676
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:47.470
So nobody ever told them about typography and doll and the doll is mostly a

677
00:43:47.511 --> 00:43:49.940
carbohydrate and if you want protein,
you know,

678
00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:54.710
might have to look at other sources.
And,
um,
and that's been a,
um,

679
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.980
you know,
I do studies on physical activity actually in,

680
00:43:57.981 --> 00:43:59.630
in those normal weight diabetics.

681
00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:04.070
Like is it better for them to do strength training or a robotic training?

682
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:07.040
So we have a study where we're randomizing people to strength training only

683
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.450
aerobic training only or a combination of both.
So I agree there's,

684
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:15.200
there's plenty of room for fine tuning both diet and exercise that should be

685
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:19.220
done on an individual level.
Um,
so I agree with you.

686
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.490
<v 3>Um,
and I think from the nonprofit side,</v>

687
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.300
we were just concerned that what is the basic level of awareness just isn't

688
00:44:25.301 --> 00:44:26.140
there at all.

689
00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:31.141
Because historically it has been a luxury to eat sweets and everything.

690
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.560
So even if you look at the terminology and some Indian languages,

691
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:36.300
diabetes is the king's disease.

692
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.080
<v 5>What sort of message?
Also,
right?
Like,
I mean,
here it's blueberries,</v>

693
00:44:39.081 --> 00:44:41.970
maybe it's mangoes or something that's an India that people really liked it.

694
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:46.640
That is what most,
yeah,
they're very sweet,
right?
But it tastes good.

695
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:47.960
It tastes good and they're healthy.
So,

696
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.600
<v 3>so that,</v>

697
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.900
that's the text message program as we really tell people what they should do

698
00:44:52.901 --> 00:44:56.050
instead,
we don't give them any statistical data at all.

699
00:44:56.051 --> 00:45:00.610
What we do is these changes would help you,
would help your family.
Um,
you know,

700
00:45:00.611 --> 00:45:04.660
but that's the rub is that a lot of these things that are quite healthy have

701
00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:08.650
become expensive.
And that's what we're always trying to balance.

702
00:45:08.651 --> 00:45:12.490
And that's true with as well here among,
um,
you know,
lower income groups.

703
00:45:12.491 --> 00:45:15.370
So that's always some,
the challenge of,
you know,

704
00:45:15.371 --> 00:45:18.130
you can give people information that's not actionable.

705
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.200
So we're always trying to refine.

706
00:45:20.201 --> 00:45:24.490
And so we have a very different messages in the workplace program,
for example,

707
00:45:24.491 --> 00:45:27.660
versus what goes out to a more general population,

708
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.300
<v 0>sort of how can you continue to eat like a popper</v>

709
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.440
<v 3>can afford?
That's difficult.</v>

710
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.430
<v 0>Thank you.
Thanks.
All right,</v>

711
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:42.420
well thank you Dr. Paul upon Dr Prahalad.

712
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.650
Thank you everyone for coming.
