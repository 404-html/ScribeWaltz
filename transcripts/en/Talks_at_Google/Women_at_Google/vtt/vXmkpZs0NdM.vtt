1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.310
Yeah,
my name is mile.
It's so lovely to meet you all.

2
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:11.670
It's so lovely to see so many faces.
Herrick Google for me today,

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.170
it was a little bit nervous about this talk.

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:17.550
So I'm really grateful for a great turnout.
So yeah,

5
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.720
I'm an author and I'm a speaker and I help women primarily heal their

6
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:26.550
relationships with food so they can go on and lead fulfilled and enriched lives

7
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.510
without waiting to lose weight first.
Um,

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.000
and it's mainly women that I help and I believe it's mainly women that struggle

9
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.260
with their relationship with food because we tend to be more sensitive to being

10
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:41.850
led by our emotions.
In general.
We tend to be more intuitive,

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.350
um,
on a whole that's generalizing obviously.
Um,

12
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.330
but you might not even realize that you're in a relationship with food unless

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.350
you are in a really unhealthy one that is taking over your life in some way.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.680
Um,
but actually your relationship with food is just as old as you are.

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.270
So if you are 30 years old,

16
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:04.440
your relationship with food is also 30 years old and your relationship with food

17
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:08.370
is really made up of all of your beliefs,
stories,

18
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.800
memories around food,
food,

19
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.630
and your weight and your body that you've had your whole life really could have

20
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.660
been something that someone said to you one day that triggered a feeling or an

21
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:21.000
emotion could have been something that you read,

22
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.240
could have been the latest Diet magazine you picked up.

23
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.580
And all of this constitutes this,
this huge relationship with food that you have.

24
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.590
And it probably doesn't come as a surprise to you to realize that the reason

25
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:38.010
that I got into doing this work and helping women with their relationship with

26
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:42.300
food and making peace with food was because I was in a really unhealthy,

27
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.960
quite abusive relationship with food for a long period of my life.

28
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.650
So I'll tell you a bit about my story first.

29
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.660
So I grew up never really having any issues around food or my weight.

30
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
Um,
my mum was quite healthy,
you know,
let us have the odd treat.

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.750
Um,
the household was very healthy.
My mom never criticized her body,

32
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.090
so I knew that she never dieted.

33
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:11.091
She was very much at peace and I was quite confident kid really loved my life,

34
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.970
was really happy at school,
had friends within the sports teams,

35
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.870
felt like my teachers liked me and I,

36
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.060
I really just was very carefree and I remember walking across the playground

37
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.890
once and you know like the girls at school,

38
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.950
like how bitchy that was,
you guys remember?

39
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.360
It felt like it was very catty kind of atmosphere.

40
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.050
And I walked across the playground and a girl from one of the years above me

41
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.890
said,
not directly to me but just loud enough that I could hear.
She said,

42
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.190
oh that girl now she loves herself.

43
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.190
And I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach.

44
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.350
I felt like that is like the worst thing that anyone could have ever said to me

45
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.790
or about me.
I love myself.
I was like,
how dare that girl that loves herself,

46
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.680
like no one wants to be that person.

47
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.280
And at that age you really just want to fit in.

48
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.420
You don't want to be too loud or too big.
Cause you just want to fit in.

49
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.650
And I remembered at that point,
remember that I remember to think to myself,

50
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.940
I am not going to be the guy that loves herself.
Anyway,

51
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.970
I was determined to be an actress and I left school and went to college at 16 to

52
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.040
be,
to do performing arts.
And when I got that,

53
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.070
it was kind of like this really harsh industry where it was really competitive.

54
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.150
Um,
and you're basically spending like eight hours a day in front of the mirror,

55
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.090
kind of being taught to look for flaws and imperfections.

56
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:44.950
It's a very perfectionist,
um,
industry.
And I was,

57
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.400
or ID and natural,
you know,
high achiever,
perfectionist,

58
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.770
which I'm sure probably some of you are in here.

59
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.870
And all the guys around me at college were pinching themselves in the mirror

60
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.340
going on these diets.
And I just really wanted to fit in.

61
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.590
So I basically started dieting as a way to fit in with the girls around me

62
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.420
because I didn't want to be the goal that loved herself.

63
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.360
I didn't want to be the one that was too confident and didn't need to do any of

64
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:11.194
that.

65
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.380
So I basically started dieting as a way to fit in and it was in that era of the

66
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.390
size zero thing it was,

67
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:23.350
there was no Kim Kardashian and there was no big booties and squats in any of

68
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:25.450
this.
Not that it is nowadays.

69
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:29.650
It was like that kind of size zero thing was really glamorized and it was a

70
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:33.730
really unhealthy environment for,
for teenage girls and for women to be in.

71
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.870
And I remember going on the special k diet,

72
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.800
does anyone remember the special k diet?
And you want to do it?
Oh my God,

73
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.780
don't read fall.
Yeah.

74
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:48.781
So basically the special k diet for anyone that doesn't know was a way to lose a

75
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:50.500
dress size in two weeks.

76
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.700
And basically you've got a bowl of special k for breakfast,

77
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.350
a bowl of special k for lunch,

78
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.500
and then you've got to have whatever you wanted for dinner magic.
Right?

79
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.220
Except it wasn't a bowl of special k,
it was like a handful.
Right.

80
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:05.350
It was like the smallest handful you could imagine.

81
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.880
And so I remember like measuring out this bowl of special k every morning and it

82
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:14.320
was literally like the smallest boy you could imagine and special k obviously

83
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:18.190
geniuses because they realize that if women were going to believe that special k

84
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:19.840
was their diet food,

85
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.410
then they were going to end up overeating and bingeing on special k,

86
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.820
which is exactly what happened before.

87
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.700
I knew I was getting through boxes and boxes and boxes of special k.

88
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.570
So me being a perfectionist and getting into diet culture at a very young age,

89
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.320
I,

90
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.580
it wasn't long before I took it to the extreme and developed a full blown eating

91
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:42.690
disorder.
I lost a lot of weight very fast.
Um,

92
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.020
I restricted myself so much that at one point I couldn't even remember the last

93
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:51.580
time I had a proper solid meal.
I was completely spaced out.

94
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:55.480
I went to a really dark place,
isolated all my friends and family.

95
00:05:55.481 --> 00:06:00.480
But for some reason I felt like I was in control.
I felt like I was,
um,

96
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.600
making a success of this.

97
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.530
I thought that I was doing really well at this and I do believe that an eating

98
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:10.580
disorder is a form of addiction and that is absolutely how it felt.

99
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.210
So what happened next was I got offered this TV job is acting job,

100
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.320
which sounded like the most exciting thing ever to me cause I was 18 and you

101
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.250
know the thought of,
you know,

102
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:25.820
most of my friends were going off to drama school and Uni and taking gap years

103
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:29.770
and I just been offered this TV job straight out the gate and it should have

104
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.620
been a dream come true.
I took my whole life up to Liverpool,

105
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.730
moved out of my parents' house.
I suddenly had this flat,
I had money,

106
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.390
I was going out to these parties and I was getting to act every day on set.

107
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.230
It should have been the dream.
But you know when,

108
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.450
I'm sure you've heard this story before,

109
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.380
everything should have been great and it looked on the outside like it was

110
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:54.620
really glamorous.
But on the inside it was not.

111
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.400
It was that empty sinking feeling of all my God,
this is not it.

112
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.880
And my eating swung from barely eating anything to suddenly excessive bingeing.

113
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.090
And I'm talking like inhaling food.

114
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.780
Like I'd never seen food before in my whole life.

115
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.990
I was like inhaling it like it was oxygen and I felt such guilt and shame over

116
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:21.950
this and for gaining weight so fast again that I would then it swung into

117
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:26.951
bulemia and I would be making myself sick or overexercising taking all kinds of

118
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.080
illegal fat burners off the Internet and just really punishing myself so much

119
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:35.990
and then swearing to start the next diet the next Monday morning.

120
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.570
And my producer actually called me up to the office once and she sat me down and

121
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:46.130
said to me,
Mel,
we really need to talk about something.
You know,

122
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.450
your weight.
It's all over the place,
you know,
on screen,
you know,

123
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.410
one episode you're this size,
the next episode of this size,
the next episode,

124
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:57.800
you're back to this size.
Like continuity,
you know,

125
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:00.050
doesn't really know what to do with you in the wardrobe department.

126
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:04.340
I've got all these different sizes for you.
Um,
do you need to talk to someone?

127
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.480
And I thought I'd been doing a really great job of keeping it secret but

128
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:09.141
obviously not.

129
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:13.760
And it was so embarrassing to feel like everyone knew and I was completely

130
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.720
crushed.
And that night I went home,
run back to my flat,

131
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.960
got down,
sat on the couch and picks up the phone.

132
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.240
Hey yeah,
it's Mel.
I got an audit.

133
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:30.200
Three large pizzas please,
Yap stuff crest.

134
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.960
And when the delivery guy came,

135
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.890
I opened the door and he started laughing at me and he was like,

136
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.540
there's three beats is all for you lady.

137
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.630
You know when someone's like joking but not so I closed the door,

138
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.160
sat down with these pizzas and one by one at demolished every single one of them

139
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:53.180
until I was in so much physical pain,
I couldn't move.

140
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.830
I'd never felt so full and yet so empty at the same time.

141
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.820
And then I would of course swear to start this brand new diet and fix myself the

142
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.670
next day because diets are what would fix this right now.

143
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:12.720
You mightn't have never experienced an eating disorder or disordered eating,

144
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.710
but a lot of these addictive patterns show up in much more,

145
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.390
much more subtle ways.

146
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.780
How many of you guys have ever gotten home from like a really stressful day and

147
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:23.340
before you've even taken your shoes off,

148
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.330
you're like in the fridge looking for answers,
looking for that fix of something.

149
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.410
And I believe when we do those,
it's not the food that's the problem.

150
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:35.430
It's a symptom of a much deeper problem that we need to get to the bottom of and

151
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:37.200
heal.
You see,

152
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:41.340
if your relationship with food was a relationship with a partner,

153
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.460
what kind of relationship would that be?
For me,

154
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:48.450
it was a very abusive relationship,
not a loving one,
not a healthy one.

155
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.250
Maybe your relationship with food is really stale and really boring.

156
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.840
Maybe it's like really strict during the week and then it's just this crazy

157
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:00.330
party or binge on the weekend.

158
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.850
Maybe it is,
um,
really monotonous.

159
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:09.300
The same thing all the time.
Maybe it needs a bit of spicing up.

160
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.390
You see,
food isn't just nourishment anymore for us,
it isn't just fuel we make,

161
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:17.220
it means so many other things.

162
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.480
It's the closest thing to us that feels like a substitute for love.

163
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.760
So it's really easy to turn to it,

164
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:26.850
to control that when we feel out of control of our lives,

165
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.530
it's the easiest thing to turn to it when we're feeling emotional or when we're

166
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:36.330
feeling any kind of uncomfortable or painful feeling that we just don't want to

167
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:37.410
feel.
We want to escape.

168
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.090
And US humans are wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain.

169
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:45.810
So it's something that we're all doing all the time and it's not necessarily a

170
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:50.280
bad thing.
You know,
seeking pleasure and using food as comfort,
as reward,

171
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.060
as love.
It might have saved us a lot of pain and heartache,

172
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.380
but actually what it does is it doesn't actually take away the pain.

173
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:00.780
It just numbs it and delays it for later on.

174
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.650
And then we develop these unhealthy relationships with food and try and go on

175
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:05.880
diets.
Trying to fix them.

176
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.850
So if you imagine like an iceberg and the tip of the iceberg is the only part

177
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:12.990
that's above the surface,

178
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.910
the tip of the iceberg is like what you're actually eating day to day,

179
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.310
like what you're actually putting in your mouth.

180
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.370
But the whole iceberg underneath the surface,

181
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.290
that is your entire relationship with food.
The psychology of like why you eat,

182
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.380
how you eat,
who you are as an eater,

183
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.010
what your identity is around food,
all of those beliefs,

184
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.330
all of those memories and all of your relationships,
your career,

185
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.760
how fulfilled you feel in your life.

186
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.230
Because all of that dictates what you end up eating and your behaviors around

187
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:51.210
food.
So I kept thinking,
you know,
the perfect diet will fix this.

188
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.000
You know,
I just need to find the perfect,
when I found the perfect diet,

189
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.590
then I'll be healed.
You know,
I'm sure that,
you know,

190
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.140
my food combining is all off or I'm sure that I'm just having too many carbs
for,

191
00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:04.480
I'm sure that I'm having too much fruit or too many good fights or whatever it

192
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.520
might be.
I'm sure that I'll find the perfect diet.

193
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.750
And then what happened was my dad was given four months to live and he was

194
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:14.800
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

195
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.500
And obviously this completely shattered me and completely shook my world.

196
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.040
And he started reading books on cancer.

197
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.890
You very intellectual and read so many books.

198
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.670
And he started reading about cancer,
knowing that he was dying.
Um,

199
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.500
and I started doing the same and because I was already obsessed with food books

200
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:39.340
that stood out to me where cancer prevention,
lifestyle diet,

201
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.820
and before I knew it,

202
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.830
I had been engulfed in some books that told me that veganism was the best way to

203
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:51.790
reduce your cancer risk.
So I was like,
oh my God,
this is it.

204
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.270
I found the perfect diet.
This has gotta be it.
This is my answer.

205
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.870
And I felt so much guilt and shame that I had found what I thought was the holy

206
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:05.941
grail too late to be able to save my dad because my dad was on these.

207
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.630
Um,
you know,
my dad couldn't even keep food down at that point.
So I,

208
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.060
so often he died.
I thought,
I've got to share this message.

209
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:16.090
I've got to go out into the world and tell everyone about veganism.

210
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.740
And because I was a perfectionist and because I still had disordered eating,

211
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.950
I didn't do this by Harvey.
I didn't just go vegan.
I went gluten free,

212
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.030
I went in fat free,
I went sugar free,
I cut out caffeine,
no alcohol.

213
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.210
I pretty much cut everything out until I was just eating fruit and veggies.

214
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.260
And even then I was worried my eating too many fruits because it's sugar,

215
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:36.094
isn't it?

216
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.900
So I still had this really negative relationship with food and I didn't even

217
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:45.901
realize until one day I discovered that I was bingeing on a tub of almond butter

218
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.973
and dates.

219
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.940
And I realized that I was still restricting by going on juice cleanses.

220
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.320
And I thought,
yeah,
I haven't actually fixed anything here,
have I?

221
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.080
My eating disorder just has another face.

222
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.710
And this is actually something that I see is really common,
um,

223
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.860
at the moment in the wellness industry is we take things a step too far instead

224
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:11.710
of finding peace with ourselves and peace with food.

225
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.180
So I realized this and me and my then partner,

226
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:21.181
we're having talks about getting pregnant and trying for a baby and the thought

227
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:23.540
of this was so un,

228
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.600
like such a new thought for me and it completely shook me because I remember

229
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:33.370
looking in the mirror at my body,
this body that I had spent years at war with.

230
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.320
I'm thinking,
okay,
if I'm going to grow a human in here,

231
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.770
something has to change because if I have to grow a human baby and here I know

232
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:49.720
that I can't keep treating my body the way that I am.
I can't restrict,

233
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:53.240
I can't be bingeing,
I can't be using food in these,
you know,

234
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.830
abusive ways.

235
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.540
I need to find a peaceful place with myself and with my body and with food

236
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.900
because I can't grow a human baby on juice cleanses and fruits and vegetables.

237
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.430
I can't grow a human baby if I'm bingeing on the weekend and then starving

238
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:13.580
myself in the week.
And then I thought,
okay,

239
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.660
if I wouldn't do that for a human,
for a child that's imaginary,

240
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.150
why would I not do that for myself?

241
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.050
Why have I not been doing that for myself all these years?

242
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.330
And I thought to myself,
you know,
you're not ready.
You're not ready for trial.

243
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.540
Do you need to focus on loving and nourishing your body without child first?

244
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.440
And if you can do that for a year,
then maybe we'll talk about it.

245
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.400
And so I went on this journey of self love and I chucked where my scales and I

246
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.790
basically started inspecting my relationship with food.

247
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.440
One belief at a time.

248
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.640
Every time I felt a fear or anxiety come up around a certain food,

249
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.900
I would question it and go,
where did this come from?
Is this truth?

250
00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:02.140
Is this a story or belief that I want to keep believing and want to keep playing

251
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:03.950
out in my life?

252
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.280
Because at that time my head was so full of all of this overwhelming information

253
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.550
about nutrition and about which diet is the best.

254
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.190
And I was hearing this person talking about veganism,

255
00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:19.640
this person talk about Paleo,
this person talking about quitting sugar,

256
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.200
this person talking about the Duke and diet five too intimate investing,

257
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.980
all this stuff.
And I was like,
Oh my God,
my brain is just full.

258
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:29.660
I just need to let it all go.

259
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.350
And it was just the most liberating thing ever.

260
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.910
So I want to just do a little exercise with you guys if you don't mind.
Um,

261
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.400
and it's about beliefs and it's about these kinds of diet,

262
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:44.260
culture beliefs that we take on as truth and then,
um,

263
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.400
express ourselves with.
So I just want to raise your,

264
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.980
I just want to raise a show of hands.
Um,

265
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.920
if any of these beliefs ring true for you or if you have ever believed any of

266
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:56.270
these to be true,

267
00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.290
and there's absolutely no judgment by there because I believe all of them and

268
00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:04.610
more so,
have you ever believed that food is the enemy?

269
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.570
Have you believe that fat and food will make you fat?

270
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:15.160
Have you believed that you should count your calories and Monday to Friday,

271
00:17:15.161 --> 00:17:16.840
but on the weekends,
calories don't count.

272
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.490
How many have you believed that sugar is evil?

273
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.980
Cubs are terrible.
That one comes from the Atkins Diet.
I think.
Um,

274
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.850
how many of you guys have believed that if you have one bad food in the day,

275
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.490
you may as well write off the rest of the day because it doesn't matter,
right?

276
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.900
Just start again on Monday.

277
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.770
How many of you believe that diets have to start on Monday?
There's no other day,

278
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.103
right?

279
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:51.530
So now if you had a little girl or a boy and they came up to you and they said,

280
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:58.710
mom,
diets have to start on Monday or mum,
this food is bad.

281
00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.603
And if I eat it,

282
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.400
I can just see all the rest of the bad foods and then start again tomorrow.

283
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.330
Or if they came up to you and they said,
Finn,

284
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:09.870
people are automatically happier people.
That's another one.

285
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.070
Would you believe that is healthy for your child?
Would you want that for them?

286
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:20.400
Would you?
But we,
but we accept that for ourselves all the time.

287
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.600
So my moment of transformation came when I thought about having a child and

288
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.960
suddenly my picture became bigger than just myself.

289
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.980
Because when you are like really consumed with food and diets and weight loss,

290
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.690
it's a really tunnel vision way to live.
You don't see the big picture,

291
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.600
you just think your,
your all,

292
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:46.200
you're only here to lose weight and get down to a number and then your life can

293
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:47.220
magically begin.

294
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.430
How many of you guys have believed that if you get to a certain number on the

295
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:50.970
scale,

296
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.850
suddenly you'll be happy and confident and free and all your dreams will come

297
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:56.670
true?
Yeah.

298
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.690
I kept doing that and I got down and down and down and down and never happened.

299
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.160
I was like,
where is this feeling?
When or where?
All the rainbows and butterflies,

300
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:08.070
I thought I was supposed to feel amazing at this number and I don't.

301
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.020
I still feel empty.
And it was because I hadn't really addressed the problem,

302
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:14.880
which was I didn't love myself.

303
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.060
So what that girl said to me on the playground,

304
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.130
that is what I needed to do more than anything was to actually love myself.

305
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.150
And what I've discovered is when you make peace with food and go on that
journey,

306
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.080
you're actually making peace with yourself because healing your relationship

307
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:34.890
with food is healing your relationship with yourself because your relationship

308
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:37.800
with food is a reflection of your relationship with you.

309
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.690
So these addictive tendencies that we have,

310
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.440
they are not something that we should be condemning at all,

311
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.270
rather these addictive tendencies.
And that could be,
you know,
emotional eating.

312
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:53.820
That could be like glass of wine at the end of a stressful day.

313
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:56.970
That could be feeling anxious,
refreshing Instagram,

314
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.510
which is something that I noticed that I do stuff for sure.
Um,

315
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.610
they're not something that we should be condemning,

316
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.470
but they are like our teachers shining a light on where we maybe need to look at

317
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.720
where our souls are actually hungry for something deeper than what we're trying

318
00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:13.770
to fill it up with.

319
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.290
So at the time of this kind of moment of realization for me,

320
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:24.380
I was in a relationship that I didn't really feel able to fully be myself and

321
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.680
looks great on the outside,
but it didn't feel like me.

322
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.030
I was in a job that again looks quite glamorous on the outside,

323
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:38.330
but I didn't feel like it was me and I was living in a city that didn't inspire

324
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:44.640
me and all the friends that I had in my life didn't feel like real deep

325
00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:45.474
friendships.

326
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.780
So I would say that I was living a life that did not feel completely fulfilled.

327
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.800
So I was turning to food and these outside sources to try and fill myself up

328
00:20:56.801 --> 00:21:01.090
from the outside in instead of filling myself up from the inside out.

329
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.630
And when I went on this journey of self love,

330
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:08.380
what I discovered was it wasn't just about me healing my relationship with food.

331
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:12.430
It was actually about me transforming my life because then I developed such a

332
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:14.710
sense of self love and self worth.

333
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.820
But I had the confidence to do things like leave my relationship,

334
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.830
changed my life,
and then I went on to help other women do the same.

335
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.670
So then I wrote my book,
I started working with clients,

336
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.850
I wrote my online program,
started running retreats,

337
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.300
and it was all because I decided to take back my life when it came to food and

338
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:37.660
love and accept myself.

339
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.210
And around that time my ex's sister said to me,

340
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.910
well,
I feel sorry for you because you're just not satisfied with a normal life,

341
00:21:48.911 --> 00:21:53.200
I you.
And I was like,
I'm not sure if that's an insult or a compliment,

342
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:56.980
but yeah,
you know,
I guess you're right.
I'm not satisfied with a normal life.

343
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.620
She said,
you're always hungry for more.
And I was like,
God damn,
you are right.

344
00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.890
I am.
And I don't think that's a bad thing.

345
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.010
And I don't think I was ungrateful for what I had.

346
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.190
But I think if you think that your life,

347
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:14.950
if you feel like your life is not filling you up,

348
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.730
if you feel like you're living in a life that you should be really grateful for

349
00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.960
and everyone else says,
oh,

350
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:23.590
you should be so lucky and grateful but you don't feel like it's yours,

351
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.460
you feel like there's more out there for you,
then that is your job.

352
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.790
That is your mission to follow that voice.
That is your mission,

353
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:32.160
to follow that call link.

354
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.550
So our addictions are not something that we should be condemning.

355
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:38.380
They are teachers and they can help us.

356
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.500
They can help guiders in the direction of where we're supposed to go.

357
00:22:41.501 --> 00:22:45.370
For example,
if we can get curious about them and observe them,

358
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.510
they can teach us things about our life,
where we are maybe out of alignment.

359
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.090
So maybe for example,

360
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:57.091
you get home from a really stressful day at work and you know on the way home

361
00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.340
you find yourself in the news agents grabbing like a chocolate bar.

362
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.300
So maybe that's not that you've got terrible willpower.

363
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.830
Maybe that is actually the root of that is stress at work.

364
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.990
So maybe that is I need to set more boundaries around work or I need to distress

365
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:18.160
or I need to meditate in the mornings,
or I need to decide,

366
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:21.400
make a decision that I'm not going to work with this kind of project or this

367
00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:25.320
kind of,
or this person.
Or maybe it's a change of job on a bigger level.

368
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.940
Maybe it's you're hungry for change in your life.

369
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.550
Maybe if you notice that when that guy doesn't call you back or that guy doesn't

370
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:37.360
text you back,
um,
it makes you want to Benji,
all of a sudden,

371
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.360
maybe that's not because you were just greedy.

372
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.100
Maybe that's because actually what you're really hungry for on a deeper level is

373
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.540
love,
intimacy,
connection.

374
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.910
So maybe that is actually a sign that you need to give yourself more love that

375
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:56.780
you need to give yourself more time,
more intimacy with you,

376
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:59.240
and work on the relationship you have with yourself,

377
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.600
which is obviously the most important relationship of our whole lives.

378
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.160
I was walking home from a class the other day and I think it was like a 45

379
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:07.994
minute walk.

380
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:12.560
And I then Google for this because I literally have no idea how to walk anywhere

381
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:15.290
in London without Google maps.
I'm completely reliant on it.

382
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:20.860
And I came out of this class and I had to get home and my battery was on 1%

383
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.720
and I started walking home and I literally had no idea where I was going apart

384
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:28.610
from with these maps,
with the maps on,

385
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.800
and then my phone died and I instantly felt that feeling of disconnection.

386
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.910
And then I noticed my mind go,
oh,
go to Pratt and get a chocolate bar.

387
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.090
And I was like,
oh my God,
it's happening to me right now.

388
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:44.570
I just wrote a book on this.
Okay,
practice what you preach,

389
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.740
but just let your food,
okay,

390
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.490
this is teaching me that I feel disconnected when my phone dies.
Right?

391
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.600
This is teaching me to find a deeper connection offline.

392
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:58.910
So this is teaching me that I need to find a deeper connection with myself with

393
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:02.120
a higher power.
Get into nature,
you know,
meditate.

394
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:06.320
More things that I do to feel connected are journaling,
getting into nature,

395
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.680
going to the park with a book,
um,
or praying.

396
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.450
And so I had a little taste of my own lessons there,

397
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.160
which I found really interesting.

398
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.180
So what is really cool is addictions are not necessarily,

399
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.950
um,
bad.
It's really about a lack of connection or fulfillment that creates them.

400
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.430
So there was a study done on rats in the 70s you might have heard of them and

401
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.010
basically two rats were put,
sorry,

402
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:40.910
one right was alone in a cage with two bottles of water.

403
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.810
One was just water and one was water laced with cocaine.

404
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.230
And every time they run this experiment,
which was about addiction,

405
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.070
every time they ran this experiment,
the rats would choose the drugs,

406
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:57.290
get addicted,
and eventually die.
But professor Bruce Alexander came along.

407
00:25:57.291 --> 00:25:59.380
So this experiment and thought to himself,
hmm,

408
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.300
well the rat is alone in a cage,

409
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.550
but rats are social creatures just like humans.
And they thrive off interaction,

410
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.980
interaction,
and connection with other rats.

411
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.760
So he thought if a human was alone in a cage,

412
00:26:13.761 --> 00:26:17.300
wouldn't the human choose the drugs if they were offered just for something to

413
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:21.260
do?
So basically he decided to build this rat park,

414
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:25.520
which was like a haven for rats.
They had all their rat friends,

415
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:28.760
they had rat games,
they had like rat food,

416
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:30.860
they had rap love island on TV,

417
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:33.380
like they were living their best lives with these rats.

418
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.110
And then they put in these two bottles of water again,

419
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.500
the one with the water and the one with the water laced with cocaine.

420
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.940
Can you guess what happened?
They rejected the drugs completely.

421
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.680
They chose just the water and he concluded that this was because they were

422
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:54.090
living fulfilled lives.
They felt connected.
They didn't feel isolated,

423
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.920
they had a purpose in their lives.
So I think this is just fascinating,

424
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:03.030
and we can link this back to food or alcohol or anything else that we use as a

425
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:04.800
drug to numb our pain often.

426
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:09.150
So what this means is when you're feeling a lack of connection or a lack of

427
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:11.010
fulfillment somewhere in your life,

428
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.160
you pharma susceptible to those addictive tendencies.

429
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:19.310
You're far more easily led to go and grab that chocolate bar or go and have that

430
00:27:19.861 --> 00:27:24.720
glass of wine or don't order that takeaway or whatever it might be.

431
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.380
And we all do this,
right?
It's,
we all do this,

432
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:32.400
but it's just really interesting to become aware of that and just observe it and

433
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:35.970
hopefully you can then heal what it is that you're really hungry for.

434
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.260
These companies,
these,
you know,
food product companies often use this,

435
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:41.640
does that to their advantage as well.

436
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:46.440
So they use our emotional attachments to food,
to market to us,
um,

437
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:51.360
in quite subtle ways.
But when you are aware of it,
it really becomes obvious.

438
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:56.070
For example,
have a break,
have a kit Kat basically saying,

439
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.460
your life's really tough.
You deserve a break.
Go and take the,

440
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.230
take a break and reward yourself with our kit Kat or Coca Cola.
Life tastes good.

441
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:10.140
Go and celebrate your life by drinking our carbonated sugary pop drunk or

442
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:12.030
Pringles.
Once you pop,

443
00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:16.890
you can't stop basically normalizing it to eat a whole tub in one setting,
right?

444
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.410
Or maybe the worst corporate of the mall,

445
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.210
Mcdonald's or your kid's misbehaving again,
swing by and get them a happy meal.

446
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.150
That'll put a smile on their face because it's a happy meal.
Right?

447
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.880
So before we even six years old,

448
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:32.130
we've already got this imprinted onto our brains.

449
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:36.870
That food is there to handle our emotions,
to make us happy,
to numb our pain,

450
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.600
which I just find really interesting.

451
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.450
So I want to do a little exercise with you guys.

452
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.810
I would like you to get into paths.
Just partner up

453
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:52.610
and be shy and I just want you to share with your partner what that kind of one

454
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:56.100
goto emotional food is for.

455
00:28:56.101 --> 00:29:00.690
You might be like crisps or chocolate or ice cream,

456
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.100
chips,
cheese,
whatever it might be.
What is that like?
Go to food.

457
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.190
Okay,
everyone done?
Everyone done?

458
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.420
Okay.
Everyone finished
guys?

459
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.780
Just one food,
one food.
Everyone's like,
I like this.
Like chocolate.
Like Chris.

460
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:27.990
It's like ice cream pizza.
Okay.

461
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.570
So now by the way,

462
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.310
my goto emotional food when I was really an emotional eater was always pick a

463
00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:38.970
mix.
You know the sweets that you choose and put in a bag.
That was my thing.

464
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.960
I'm talking like I would go to the cinema and spend like extortion amounts on

465
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:47.650
pick and mix and not even care about seeing the film.
Okay.
So next part,

466
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:48.250
the exercise.

467
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:53.250
I want you to think about what is the earliest memory of you having that food?

468
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.300
What is the earliest memory of you having that food and share it with your

469
00:29:58.301 --> 00:29:59.134
partner.

470
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.660
<v 1>Okay.
Everyone done?</v>

471
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.100
Everyone done?
Okay.

472
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.240
<v 0>Next I want you to just identify what is the emotion associated with that</v>

473
00:30:17.911 --> 00:30:21.270
memory.
What is the feeling of that memory?

474
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.840
And share it with your partner,
not now,

475
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.650
but the feeling associated in that environment,
in that memory.

476
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.360
So share it with your partner.

477
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.130
<v 1>Everyone got that?
Okay.</v>

478
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.670
Okay.
So,
um,
so

479
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:45.820
<v 0>I'll share mine.</v>

480
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:50.970
So my earliest memory of pick them eggs was my mom and dad pick him up from

481
00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:56.140
school on a Friday.
Um,
and if I was really good,

482
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.110
then I would get pounds to spend on picnics.

483
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.950
And so that was like my favorite time of the all of the whole week.

484
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.400
And I really look forward to that because I was just so excited to get that

485
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:07.234
pound.

486
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.510
And so the feeling associated for me with that memory was reward and validation

487
00:31:12.611 --> 00:31:15.220
for being good and it's a treat.

488
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.620
So in my adult life,

489
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.750
what I noticed that I started doing was anytime that I felt like I'd been good

490
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.920
or deserved a reward or a treat,
I would go get that,
pick a mix.

491
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.170
Um,
my partner Rick,

492
00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:34.171
here's a goto emotional food was always Natala and he used to come home with a

493
00:31:34.991 --> 00:31:37.450
jar of Nutella when he'd had a bad day and I'd be like,

494
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.720
do we need to talk about this?
Um,

495
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.120
but his earliest memory of Nutella was eating it on pancakes with his mum.

496
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.620
And so he,
uh,
associated that with love and connection.

497
00:31:47.621 --> 00:31:50.620
So when he felt like he needed love and connection,

498
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.100
he would go get that in a teller because food feels like love.
Right.

499
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.790
So does anyone want to share?
What does,
why?
Just a couple of people.

500
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.850
<v 1>Anyone?
Yeah.
Mine was my continues.
Uh Huh.</v>

501
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:12.140
<v 0>Mine was my countries.
I remember eating it at home with my mom.</v>

502
00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:15.470
My brother and my sister.
Just like having a good time,

503
00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:18.500
like just the happy memory.
Yeah.
Yeah.

504
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.080
So then if you in your adult life,

505
00:32:21.081 --> 00:32:24.440
then if you feel like you need to go to a happy place,
that is the,

506
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.040
the is the happy place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Thank you for sharing.

507
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.360
Anyone else want to share?

508
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:40.160
Everyone say shy.
Anyone else?
One more?
I can share mine.
Okay.

509
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:45.270
Think you,
yeah.

510
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:51.110
Mine was Sushi and I kind of discovered it when I was doing a year abroad in New

511
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.710
Orleans and when I was 20 and it was just a really happier and have many fun and

512
00:32:55.711 --> 00:32:58.740
carefree and I ended up eating it every day and it would give my cure for

513
00:32:58.741 --> 00:33:03.030
everything.
Hangovers.
Yeah.
Yes.
It just became this finny.
Yup.

514
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:08.340
Jovie full food symbolize like joy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

515
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.710
That's a really fun,
awesome.
Thank you for sharing.

516
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.900
Another really common thing is,
yeah,
if we weren't allowed it at home as kids,

517
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.320
then when we grow up in West said and the adults and free and liberated,

518
00:33:19.321 --> 00:33:21.920
we're like,
oh my God,
I can get,
I can eat it now.

519
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.640
I'm allowed to eat whatever I want.

520
00:33:23.641 --> 00:33:27.870
So it's like symbolizes this rebellion and this freedom and independence.

521
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.070
So,
um,
food is,
uh,

522
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.390
food is parallel to our life.
So,
you know,

523
00:33:36.391 --> 00:33:40.770
our relationship with food can be this kind of comfort,
this emotional tool,

524
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:45.120
but it can also be pleasure.
And I think when we get sucked into diet land,

525
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.510
we forget that we were allowed to receive pleasure and joy from food.

526
00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:53.370
It's allowed to be a completely celebrated,
celebrated tree experience.

527
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.390
And a good question to ask yourself when you're,
when you're turning to food is,

528
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.170
am I using this to celebrate or am I using it to escape?

529
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.990
Because often we're actually trying to push down a feeling.
Um,
so yeah,

530
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.990
our relationship with food is a reflection of our relationship with life,

531
00:34:09.991 --> 00:34:13.260
which means you know that saying like how you do one thing is how you do

532
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.580
everything.
So it's kind of like how you do food is often how you do life.

533
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.400
So if you are a perfectionist around your food,

534
00:34:20.401 --> 00:34:22.500
you're probably also a perfectionist in your life.

535
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.510
If you are controlling around food,
you're probably also controlling in life.

536
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.310
And who's like an all or nothing person.
Anyone here like totally all or nothing.

537
00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.740
So if you're all or nothing with food,

538
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:39.330
you've probably all also all or nothing in your life and your relationships and

539
00:34:39.331 --> 00:34:40.710
your job or projects.

540
00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.730
And who here would can say that they are a fast eater?

541
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.300
Everyone.
Yeah.
This doesn't surprise me.
Right?

542
00:34:48.301 --> 00:34:49.680
Cause you guys are like high achievers.

543
00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:53.310
So if you're a fast eater you're probably also going through your life quite

544
00:34:53.311 --> 00:34:54.120
fast,

545
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.650
which is why it's difficult to get people to slow down there eating because it's

546
00:34:58.651 --> 00:35:01.020
basically like saying slow down your life pace.

547
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.050
Do you also drive your car quite fast if you drive?

548
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.440
Did you go through your life quite fast in other areas?
Yeah.

549
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.580
So what this means is when we are able to heal our stuff with food,

550
00:35:11.581 --> 00:35:12.900
we can also heal our life.

551
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:17.700
And if we're able to enjoy a more intuitive way of eating,

552
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:22.470
it means we're more likely to enjoy an intuitive way of living.

553
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.700
So I always say intuitive eating paves the way for intuitive living.

554
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.720
When I was able to learn how to really listen to my body,

555
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.750
I was also able to learn how to listen to my gut.

556
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.540
I was able to learn how to listen to my intuition.

557
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.150
I realized that the two went hand in hand.

558
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.020
So a lot of people think that when they're going to listen to their body,

559
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.590
they think that their body is just telling them to eat all kinds of junk and

560
00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:47.550
it's simply not the case.

561
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:51.900
So I want to explain to you guys just to finish the difference between your real

562
00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:54.810
hunger and your emotional cravings.

563
00:35:55.410 --> 00:36:00.180
So real hunger comes on very gradually,
slowly,
and you feel it here,
right?

564
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:05.100
You feel it in the stomach and it gives you the time and that patience to go,

565
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:09.000
what am I hungry for?
What am I going to choose to nourish my body?

566
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.220
Whereas an emotional craving is actually a psychological need and it comes on

567
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:17.400
very fast in the mind.
And it's that urge.

568
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.240
It's that impulse and it usually fixates on one particular kind of food.

569
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.920
So it comes on really fast.
And if you don't check yourself,

570
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.620
you kind of like glaze over when you become this Zombie state.

571
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:30.660
And before you know it you've eaten something and you don't even know how you

572
00:36:30.661 --> 00:36:34.530
got there.
If we were doing that with drugs,
it'd be a pretty big problem,
right?

573
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:36.210
But we do that with food a lot.

574
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.290
So when we have those psychological cravings,

575
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.260
what we're actually craving is something deeper,
usually love,

576
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:48.090
usually connection and all of those things that we can,
that we are craving,

577
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.720
we can give to ourselves.
We can never truly get it,
Matt,

578
00:36:51.721 --> 00:36:54.480
to get those needs met from someone else,

579
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.080
a food or drink a substance,
um,
social media,

580
00:36:58.081 --> 00:36:59.850
all of these kind of external things.

581
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.590
It's a way in which we tried to fill ourselves up from the outside in rather

582
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:09.591
than filling ourselves up from the inside out and fulfillment and living a truly

583
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.320
full up life.
So thank you.

584
00:37:13.321 --> 00:37:17.850
I hope this has given you some food for thought and that you will be able to

585
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:21.420
hopefully bring a little bit more awareness to your relationship with food and

586
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:23.130
use it to your advantage.
Thank you.

587
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.270
Do we have ton of time for Q and.
A,

588
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.850
you have to speak into this because we're recording this for youtube.

589
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.530
Does anyone have questions?
Thank you so much.
Um,
I think speaking for all of us,

590
00:37:36.531 --> 00:37:38.480
we all really enjoyed that.
Um,

591
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.420
I've got a question and I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to answer it,

592
00:37:41.421 --> 00:37:44.840
but it's to do with the whole sort of body positive intuitive eating movement

593
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.340
mean.
A lot of my friends,

594
00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:50.690
we have a lot of intolerances which really hinders our ability to eat freely.

595
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.460
And I often feel like that's not,
um,

596
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:57.080
taken into consideration into the body positive and intuitive eating movement.

597
00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.040
Yeah.
And I would just like,
just like to hear your thoughts on it really.
Yeah.

598
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.060
You know,
gluten free,
dairy free,
things like that.
Sure,
sure.
Thank you so much.

599
00:38:05.061 --> 00:38:06.260
So first of all,

600
00:38:06.261 --> 00:38:10.970
I would like to offer that the body positive movement is diff is a separate

601
00:38:10.971 --> 00:38:15.740
thing from intuitive eating and you can do one without the other and vice versa.

602
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.290
Um,
so I would say that,

603
00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.760
I mean the body positive movement is a movement in itself and the people that

604
00:38:22.761 --> 00:38:26.780
kind of started that have their own definition of what that is and what they

605
00:38:26.781 --> 00:38:27.614
stand for.

606
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.970
But you can decide that for you to be positive for your body,

607
00:38:31.971 --> 00:38:35.800
for you to show your body love means to not have things that don't agree with
it.

608
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.270
So for example,

609
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:41.320
like I consider myself to be body positive because I do positive things for my

610
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:43.000
body.
Did you know what I mean?

611
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.480
Although I'm not a part necessarily of that movement and the real,

612
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:50.710
the roots of it obviously were different from,
from what,
where I'm sad.

613
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.053
Um,

614
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.120
but if doing a positive thing for your body is not having certain foods that

615
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:00.100
don't agree with it,
then that's absolutely great.

616
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.580
I don't think intuitive eating is about,
you know,

617
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.830
just eating rubbish all the time.

618
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.710
I think it's about noticing what feels good and what doesn't.

619
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.220
And that's definitely something that I've learned along my journey because I

620
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:15.550
thought that going into intuitive eating would mean that I would just gain loads

621
00:39:15.551 --> 00:39:18.550
of weight and would just sit around eating,
you know,

622
00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:20.500
donuts and ice cream and all kinds of,
you know,

623
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.860
cereal for dinner and all this kind of stuff.
And it's not what happened.

624
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:27.430
I think initially there might be like a boomerang phase where you're just like,

625
00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.560
oh my God,
freedom.
But then after that,

626
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:32.500
what happens is you start to recognize what feels good and what doesn't.

627
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.910
And you start to notice that actually it feels really good to have this amount

628
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:39.670
of vegetables and it feels really good to have me or to not have meat.

629
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.940
And it feels really good to have gluten auto not have gluten.

630
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.080
And it's really about you taking your power back around food and not thinking

631
00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:48.610
that it has to look a certain way.

632
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.500
It's about you becoming the boss of your own body.
Thank you so much.
That was it.

633
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.610
Yeah.
Cool.

634
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:02.200
Hi.
Yes,
thank you so much for the talk,
um,
as well as to know a little bit more.

635
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:05.350
And if you're comfortable sharing,
but just your transition between,

636
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.050
you talked about your veganism,
your perfectionism to kind of,

637
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:11.750
to the state that you are now and um,
if you've,
I've heard that,
you know,

638
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.300
kind of all we all know like you know,

639
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:16.540
the path to whatever's kind of looks like this and yeah.

640
00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.920
You had a few of these debts are and how you overcame those and how you also got

641
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:22.630
to the state that you're in now.
Sure.

642
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.660
Do you mean like from disordered or being in tall you are present.

643
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.960
Yeah,
sure.

644
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:33.940
So it was definitely like a bumpy road to begin with because when you are so

645
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:37.900
ingrained,
ingrained in that diet culture,

646
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.260
you feel like it's like a lot of your identity is wrapped up in it.

647
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.010
So I didn't really know who I was without a diet cause it consumed so much of my

648
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:49.900
life.
So getting myself that freedom to break free from that felt like I was

649
00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:53.410
rediscovering who I was and almost like creating a new identity for myself

650
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.800
because it had taken up so much head space that when I got rid of that I was

651
00:40:56.801 --> 00:41:00.250
like,
oh my God,
I don't know what to do with myself anymore.
Cause it was like,

652
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.470
it was like a full time job for me dieting.

653
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.830
So coming out of that was definitely a bumpy road,

654
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:10.120
but I just kept focusing on,
I'm getting my life back here.

655
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.950
So even though to begin with,
I gained way.
I also gained my life back,

656
00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:18.160
which was so much more important to me.
Um,
but yeah,

657
00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:22.360
I definitely had to figure out all of these different beliefs and stories that I

658
00:41:22.361 --> 00:41:26.230
was telling myself around different diets and food and the people that I

659
00:41:26.231 --> 00:41:26.680
followed.

660
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.380
I had to unfollow a lot of people that were just kind of projecting their

661
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:32.770
beliefs out onto social media.
And I was like,
that's not helpful for me.

662
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.220
For where I'm at right now.

663
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:38.150
I just need to be able to make my own intuitive decisions around food rather

664
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:41.870
than listening to every single expert that's got a different opinion on food.

665
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.530
I just needed to like block all that out to just come home to my body.

666
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:50.040
And that really helped me.
But for sure it was a bumpy road.
And,
um,
yeah,
I did,

667
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.140
I realized along that road that veganism wasn't for me anymore.
And you know,

668
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.810
me deciding to be a Vegan,

669
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.350
my intention behind that wasn't as it should have been.

670
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.440
It was because I thought it was the perfect diet and because I thought it would

671
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:08.240
heal me and make me lose weight as opposed to what actually feels good.

672
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:11.700
And I have a lot of friends that are Vegan,
but they do it for much more,
um,

673
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.760
ethical reasons.
But personally for me,

674
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:18.050
I feel good when I have a bit of animal products in my lifestyle.
Um,

675
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.550
and I don't think anyone should be shamed for that.
Cool.
Well,
thanks again.
