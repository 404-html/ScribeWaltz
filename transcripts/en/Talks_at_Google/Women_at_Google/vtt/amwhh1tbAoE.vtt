1
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.190
Thanks so much everyone for coming.
I'm Lauren Miller,

2
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:13.080
I fellow Googler and I feel honored and blessed to be standing here today

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.700
introducing two personal heroes of mine in sharing their billion minds with my

4
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.250
Google family.
As many of you know,

5
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:23.460
I was diagnosed exactly one year ago with breast cancer.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.000
Unfortunately labeled no evidence of disease is past July

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.800
<v 1>after
after</v>

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.710
<v 2>my diagnosis I received an outpouring of love and support from many Googlers,</v>

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.020
quite a few in Google Chicago.
So thank you.

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.270
And unfortunately I received too many notes saying that they had faced a similar

11
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:46.460
diagnosis as myself,
not long before me.

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.420
So we have quite a big Google family here that is facing this issue.

13
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.520
Am I good health today?

14
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.810
And the good health of many Googlers could be attributed directly to individuals

15
00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:58.100
who are pioneering,

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.180
driving change and innovating in the breast cancer landscape in particular,

17
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:06.740
the two that you'll hear from today.
So Francisco is amazing.

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.570
She is a 25 year breast cancer survivor and the president of the national breast

19
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.620
cancer coalition,

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.860
which is an organization not all in like Google in the sense that they're

21
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:19.820
willing to make big bets and the care first and foremost about the population

22
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:20.654
that they serve.

23
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.250
She served three terms is one of three members of President Clinton's cancer

24
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.960
council back in the 90s she co chaired the National Action Plan on breast cancer

25
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.910
and she was the first consumer to chair the integration panel of the Department

26
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.620
of Defense Peer reviewed breast cancer research program.

27
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.210
She is a member of the board of directors of translational research and oncology

28
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.650
among many other national boards and she is a world renowned thought leader and

29
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:50.030
the breast cancer landscape.
Alana Welm is also incredible.

30
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.920
She is an associate professor in the Department of oncological sciences at the

31
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.921
University of Utah and investigator at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and Co

32
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:04.340
leader of the cell response and regulation program at Huntsman Cancer Institute.

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.790
Her lab focuses on breast cancer metastasis,

34
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.130
which unfortunately has no care today.

35
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.000
And she's made groundbreaking discoveries that are widely renowned in the breast

36
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.060
cancer community and beyond her research,

37
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:21.050
develop main lead to new ways to treat and prevent breast cancer metastasis,

38
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.590
which we'll talk more about today.
So without further ado,

39
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.370
I want to give a warm Google welcome to Francisco.

40
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.313
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

41
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.770
<v 0>Thanks very much everyone.</v>

42
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.860
I'm thrilled to be here to talk to you about breast cancer or how we can end it

43
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.300
and the national breast cancer coalition.

44
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.680
So our mission is to end breast cancer and we do have a strategic approach to

45
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:56.510
achieving that mission.

46
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.260
But we all have a role to play in ending breast cancer and we have to use every

47
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.960
possible avenue to get there.
So the national breast cancer coalition,

48
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:12.460
which I have the honor of being president of,

49
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:17.461
was formed in 1991 as a coalition of groups from around the country.

50
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.440
And we have two arms.

51
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.450
We have an advocacy arm of grassroots advocacy arm that sets a legislative and

52
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:29.530
public policy agenda and then works to get it in,
acted in his law.

53
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.000
And we have a program arm that complements the public policy work.

54
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.730
And I'll talk a bit about the programs that we have.

55
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.150
And our goal really is to change all the systems in breast cancer.

56
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:47.260
We weren't formed to raise awareness.
We do not do direct services.

57
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:52.000
Many of our member organizations too,
we are really about system change.

58
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.940
And again,
our mission is to end breast cancer.

59
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.110
So I'll give you an example of the advocacy work that we do.

60
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.620
Funding for research,
expanding access to care.

61
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.390
Funding for research is as we know,

62
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:12.391
vital to ending this disease and the federal government is where the major

63
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.750
research funding comes from.

64
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.150
We do a lot of community fundraising or many of our groups do raising money for

65
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.760
research and their communities and that is important,

66
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.740
but the hundreds of millions of dollars a year in and year out that are required

67
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.741
for high level biomedical research comes from the federal government expanding

68
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:37.120
access to care.

69
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:41.680
We all know and we know we've been a part of this battle very much most recently

70
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.860
that we can find the answers to breast cancer.

71
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.960
We can know how to prevent it and how to cure it,

72
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.120
but we will not have ended breast cancer unless everyone everywhere has access

73
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:53.710
to those interventions.

74
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.920
And so a main priority then bccs to make certain that the policies are in place

75
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:02.600
that will expand access to the right healthcare.

76
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.270
We're involved in education and training.
We educate and train advocates,

77
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.510
lay advocates around the country and even around the world to understand these

78
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.280
issues and to understand the language,

79
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:20.050
the concepts and process of science so that they can collaborate so that they

80
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:25.051
can sit at the table and help decide how research funds should be spent.

81
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:29.620
And also what research should happen.
And Alana will speak bit more about that,

82
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.410
but we're about critical advocacy.

83
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.800
We're about critical analysis and analytical informed approach to what advocacy

84
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:44.260
should be,
not a knee jerk reaction to issues in breast cancer.

85
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.830
And we are very much about the importance of leadership from the lay public,

86
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.670
from educated and trained advocates with a constituency they shouldn't be

87
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:57.280
leading all efforts in breast cancer.

88
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.280
So let's talk about us progress in breast cancer because I think we all think

89
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.801
the public believes that we've made such strides in breast cancer and that we're

90
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.820
very close to figuring this out,
but the numbers tell a very different story.

91
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.630
So in 2017 in the United States alone,

92
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.840
over 300,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 2,600 men will also

93
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.830
receive that diagnosis.

94
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.220
Now we know there are two main types of breast cancer.

95
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:35.690
There's invasive breast cancer and there's something called insight to ductal

96
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:38.990
carcinoma in sight two and that really isn't cancer.

97
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.950
That's a um,

98
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.870
condition at where we have abnormal cells in breasts,

99
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.250
ducks,
and it has not invaded into tissue.

100
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.650
That is a phenomenon of mammography.
Before mammography screening,

101
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.180
we didn't know there was such a thing about dcis and dcis is a very

102
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:04.181
controversial issue in breast cancer because we really don't know if any of it

103
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:08.360
will progress to invasive breast cancer.
And if any of that invasive,

104
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:12.320
which of that invasive breast cancer will progress to become lethal.

105
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.710
And we'll talk more about that later.
But this year,

106
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.740
breast cancer will take the lives of over 40,000 women and 460 men in this

107
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:23.900
country alone,

108
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.290
and I'm going to show you a graph in a little while that will show you that

109
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:32.291
there's no change in lethal disease at diagnosis since 1978 no change in

110
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:39.791
diagnosis of lethal diagnosis and there's no acceleration in the rate of

111
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:43.580
decrease of mortality.
You may have heard that recently.

112
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.120
The number 39% reduction in mortality and breast cancer death rate.

113
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.610
Well,
that is a correct number,

114
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.200
but it is not a number that tells the whole story.
It's a relative number.

115
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.590
The decrease in mortality has been 1.9% a year for a number of years.

116
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:08.090
Now,
1.9 1.9 1.9 you add that up.

117
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:13.091
The relative decrease is about 39% but there's no acceleration in the rate of

118
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:17.360
decrease,
which there would be if we were continuing to make progress,

119
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.850
but the global progress is even worse.
Story,

120
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.400
1.6 7 million new breast cancer cases will be diagnosed in women and more than

121
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:34.421
500,000 women worldwide died of Breast Cancer in 2012 which is the most up to

122
00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:39.980
date year statistic that we have from the World Health Organization,

123
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.430
but it is estimated that in 2034 35 that number will be more than 800,000 women

124
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.570
at the current rate of progress.

125
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.590
So this is really the reality of breast cancer and I think it's important to

126
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:56.250
look at this particular graph.

127
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.540
You'll see breast cancer incidents,

128
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.570
which is the diagnosis of breast cancer and mortality across 40 plus countries.

129
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.420
The Blue Line is incidents and you will see that in developed countries that

130
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:13.170
line is very long.

131
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.740
The Red Bar is mortality and you will see across 40 countries not a significant

132
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:24.480
difference in mortality.
What does this tell us?

133
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.070
This tells us something about the limitations of technology because of the Blue

134
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.330
Line,
the Blue Bar and tells you that is how many women are diagnosed because of

135
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:37.890
screening.
So in developed countries we have mammography screening.

136
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.880
So you have many,
many,
many more women diagnosed,

137
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.180
but the number of women who are dying of breast cancer does not change across

138
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:49.260
countries very much.

139
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:54.650
So that tells us that there are significant limitations in early detection.

140
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.040
This is again the reality of breast cancer.

141
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:04.070
This is a graph that shows you since 1978 actually until actually this goes now

142
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:13.281
to 2015 there has been no change in the initial diagnosis of lethal breast

143
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:19.551
cancer and lethal breast cancer is metastatic breast cancer because if you are

144
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:24.300
diagnosed with breast cancer and it stays in your breast and won't kill you,

145
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.020
if it leaves your breast and goes to another organ,

146
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.130
then it becomes a lethal and we don't know how to cure a lethal disease.

147
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.420
So an initial diagnosis of metastatic disease,

148
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.030
that statistic hasn't changed.
Breast cancer is a political issue.

149
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.230
And what do I mean by that?
I mean by,
as I said,

150
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.530
these significant sustained funding year in and year out for research comes from

151
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:54.960
the federal government and we can influence what that number is.

152
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:59.610
And NBCC has influenced that.
How is the funding spent though?

153
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.440
Now we brought about over 3 billion new dollars through our advocacy to the

154
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:09.441
worldwide scientific community since 1992 but it's not just about money,

155
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.430
although for many individuals and organizations,

156
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:19.020
that's a goal in and of itself.
But we're also about how are those dollars spent?

157
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.660
And that's where our project lead,

158
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:24.690
which is our education program,

159
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.650
educating the lay public and science that Laura Miller,

160
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:31.050
your fellow Googler,
took this past summer.

161
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.640
Understanding language concepts and process of science so that you can sit at

162
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:36.474
the table,

163
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.890
help decide what a research agenda should look like and actually collaborate

164
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:42.670
with individual scientists and Allana.

165
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.350
We'll speak to that also in designing research,

166
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.700
access to care,
a political issue,
the,
the um,

167
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.240
Obamacare,
um,
the to care act,
the FDA,

168
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:56.800
the food and drug administrations.

169
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:01.060
Those are all political entities that we can influence.

170
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.090
And the quality of the care that you get access to.

171
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:09.330
There are many federal agencies that actually have a great deal of influence

172
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:14.461
over what that quality is and we can influence those agencies and we educate and

173
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:17.050
train people and set an agenda.

174
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.830
So that the influence is the correct influence.

175
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.180
But I want to talk a little bit about 21st century advocacy.

176
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:30.210
NBCC has had an incredible impact in breast cancer in terms of funding for

177
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:32.590
research,
access to care,

178
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.310
changing how research is done working with scientists.

179
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.910
And we've done a lot of our work through in the early days,

180
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:44.710
petitions and organizing,
collecting 2.6 million signatures,

181
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.040
standing on a street corner,
stopping people going door to door,

182
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:50.290
delivering those signatures to the president,

183
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.380
resulting in a national action plan on breast cancer.

184
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:59.190
But that doesn't work anymore because now petitions in signatures are collected

185
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.890
through technology,
through social media,

186
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.330
and now it is not that difficult to get millions of signatures on a petition.

187
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.230
And when it's not that difficult to do,
it doesn't have as much meaning.

188
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.980
So how can the technology help us in today's world in organizing a meaningful

189
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:24.331
and influential grassroots network and having our voices heard in a way that

190
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:27.340
sets us apart from the crowd?
Well,

191
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:30.850
we could certainly use your help and having that conversation and figuring that

192
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:31.684
out.

193
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.580
But I've laid out a number of statistics and a number of issues in breast cancer

194
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:41.581
to sit tell you how we really haven't made progress said as an organization.

195
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:46.951
We were very frustrated by that and in 2010 we decided to do something about it.

196
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:52.420
We were going to launch a deadline campaign that we will know how to end breast

197
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:57.421
cancer by 2020 and we developed a strategic approach to that question,

198
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:02.260
a strategic plan of action that is set out in a blueprint that you can see on

199
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:07.261
our website and I won't go into a lot of detail about that except to talk about

200
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.390
the research arm of that which is the [inaudible] project.

201
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.070
And our focus here is we looked around the world of breast cancer and said,

202
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.580
where is,
where are we in breast cancer?

203
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:22.240
What are the questions that need to be answered that aren't being addressed?

204
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.120
And there were two.
One is primary prevention,

205
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:29.200
how do we stop women and men from getting breast cancer to begin with?

206
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.270
And the second is this idea of metastasis and the spread of breast cancer

207
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.920
outside the breast.

208
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.970
We know if it's in your breasts and doesn't go anywhere,
you'll live.

209
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.640
And we know if it goes to an Oregon,
you won't.

210
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.260
So what's happening in between?
No one was really looking at that.

211
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.440
They were looking at what to do once.
It's in that Oregon,
but how does it there?

212
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:52.610
How can we stop it?

213
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.870
And so those are the two areas that we decided to focus on with the artimus

214
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:59.120
project as part of our deadline campaign.

215
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.010
The artimus project is a model for leadership.
It is advocate led,

216
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
incredible collaboration with scientists from across the country and other

217
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:11.450
countries,
different focus.

218
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:15.800
The one thing we ask of the scientists we invite and the advocates is that

219
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.120
you're innovative.
You know how to be disruptive,
you're critical thinker,

220
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.710
you are brave,

221
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:26.240
you're willing to go against the status quo and you want to come to the table

222
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:28.490
and work with patients to make a difference.

223
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.940
And so we have an infrastructure that we've created to launch and maintain the

224
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.430
artimus project.
And it has been incredibly successful,

225
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.700
but it would not be successful without someone like Alana Welm who is a

226
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:48.161
scientist who meets all of those criteria and who comes to the table willingly

227
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.900
to work with advocates to really achieve the goal of ending breast cancer.

228
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.110
And so I'll turn this over now to Alana.
Thank you.

229
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

230
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:02.980
<v 3>Hello everyone.</v>

231
00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:06.910
I would like to Echo Fran and thanking you for having us here today.

232
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.440
My job today is to tell you where we are in metastatic cancer research and in

233
00:16:12.551 --> 00:16:17.440
breast cancer research.
I want to cover,
um,
you know,
again,
a little bit more,
uh,

234
00:16:17.441 --> 00:16:19.940
on the real issues in breast cancer,
uh,

235
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.220
update you on research and therapeutic advances and then,
um,

236
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.380
really tried to convey this urgent need.

237
00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:31.381
We have a for new and innovative approaches that I think can be best served

238
00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:34.330
through community engagement in,
in research.

239
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.450
So I'll start by,
uh,
another statistic.
And,

240
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:41.650
and Fram touched on this already to some degree.

241
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.450
So breast cancer awareness has been a huge campaign over the last few decades,

242
00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:47.920
and it's been successful.

243
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:52.000
Breast Cancer Awareness is not really the issue anymore.
Uh,

244
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:56.320
we're doing more mammograms than ever.
There's more early diagnoses than ever,

245
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.970
and yet,
as Fran told you,

246
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.380
we're not making the kind of progress we need to end this disease.
Uh,

247
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.530
and so the statistic you can see on the screen here is mortality.

248
00:17:05.531 --> 00:17:10.531
This is the number of people who die per population since the mid 1970

249
00:17:10.621 --> 00:17:14.020
[inaudible] until now.
Uh,
and you can see we've made some progress.

250
00:17:14.021 --> 00:17:17.680
So there are better treatments.
Um,
there's,
uh,
you know,

251
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.320
new knowledge that has led to better outcomes,

252
00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:23.650
like a reduction of hormone replacement therapy use has,

253
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.410
has led to a decrease in breast cancer mortality.

254
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.390
But you can see on this slide two things.

255
00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:32.050
One is we still have a racial disparities in breast cancer.

256
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.280
And you can see that the rate of progress,
as Fred mentioned,
um,

257
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.550
is pretty steady.
So we're not making these big,

258
00:17:39.551 --> 00:17:42.970
monumental advances that we need to make to end this disease.

259
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.913
At the end,

260
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.210
we still have more than 40,000 deaths per year just in this country.

261
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.700
That means just in the U s there'll be five desks to breast cancer just in the

262
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:55.260
time that we're in this room together.

263
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.730
So we really have an urgent need to make substantial progress.

264
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.100
Now,
why is it that we haven't made progress?

265
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:06.270
So part of my job here today is to try to convey to you the the complexity of

266
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:08.190
breast cancer and why it's so difficult.

267
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.470
So the reality is that 90% or more of deaths from breast cancer,
again,

268
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:17.640
half a million in the world every year are caused by metastasis.

269
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:22.140
That's when the disease spreads outside of the breath,
breast to other organs.
Uh,

270
00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:26.250
breast cancer likes to live in all different parts of the body.
Uh,

271
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.860
it starts in the bones,
that's the most common site,

272
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.400
but then spreads to other organs and,
and unfortunately it's incurable.

273
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.880
The trick though is that it's not so easy as catching the tumor early and

274
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.120
thereby preventing metastases,
getting it before it metastasizes.

275
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:47.390
Those 20 to 30% of breast cancers that eventually come back as metastatic

276
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:51.330
disease.
Do so probably before they're ever diagnosed.

277
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.960
Probably when the tumors developing.
So there's a biology,

278
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:59.400
there were early detection doesn't seem to be helping the,
the,
um,

279
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.210
whether or not these tumors can,
can spread and recur later.

280
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.800
Breast cancer's not a single disease.
That's another complexity.

281
00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:09.810
We think of it as,
as one disease.
Right?

282
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:12.840
But probably there's at least 15 different types of breast cancer.

283
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:14.160
Every tumor is different.

284
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.450
Breast cancer's not one of those cancer that's driven by a particular genetic

285
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:22.440
signature.
Uh,
the heterogeneity is,
is incredible.
Uh,

286
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:25.140
so that makes it very difficult.
So as I mentioned,

287
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:30.141
some of these tumors that 20 to 30% have the ability to metastasize while

288
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:32.280
they're forming before they're even diagnosed.

289
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.660
And then what happens is they hide out in the body,
typically the bones,

290
00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:40.680
but that's also an easy place for us to look.
So our data's a bit skewed.

291
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.760
They hide out undetected.
There's no evidence of disease.
Uh,

292
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:48.710
and then in some,
for some reason they can grow later.
Um,

293
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:53.880
and this can happen one year later,
three years later,
or even decades later.

294
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.200
So it's this period of,
of clinical dormancy,
uh,

295
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.200
that that really is a mystery because we can't see these cells.

296
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.860
We don't nothing about what makes them grow or what makes them not grow.

297
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.480
You know,
again,

298
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:11.481
this is only 20 to 30% of cases in which these cancers come back when they grow.

299
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.530
For some reason the disease is incurable and we don't know why.

300
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.270
We don't know why that is.
Uh,

301
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:23.271
and so we really need research that's focused on how to treat these metasticies

302
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.930
when they arise and also how to personalize therapy.
Because as I said,

303
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:32.580
every Brent's breast cancer's different.
So,
um,
I think that,
um,
the,

304
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:37.020
the ability to treat metastasis,
it has been a growing,
uh,
effort,
uh,

305
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:41.760
in the breast cancer community.
Most clinical trials that,

306
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:46.390
uh,
are,
are started,
are done in patients with metastatic disease.
Uh,

307
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.460
but we still need to make a lot more progress.

308
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.940
I wanted to talk just for a second about,
um,
you know,

309
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:56.941
sort of a state of the art in personalized therapy where we can actually now

310
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.640
take patients' tumors as they're harvested at surgery and grow those in

311
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:05.290
different model systems in the,

312
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:09.550
in the lab in order to actually test the genetics of the tumor as well as what

313
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:11.020
drugs it might respond to.

314
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.320
So this would give more personalized view of the susceptibilities of those

315
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:19.360
cancers to hopefully direct therapy.

316
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.760
The challenge is that this takes time and,
and once a tumor's metastatic,
uh,

317
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:28.600
sometimes the disease progresses too quickly to have that outcome.

318
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.070
The reason I'm telling you about this is because I wanted to give you a little

319
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:36.100
bit of a personal story,
um,
because this,

320
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.230
this just gives you a view of how metastatic breast cancer most typically

321
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:45.520
arises.
And it's too typical.
So I'm going to tell you about Mandy.

322
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:49.840
Mandy was a young woman diagnosed with breast cancer at age 29.

323
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:52.930
She had a very small tumor.
It expressed the estrogen receptor.

324
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:56.260
So it was the good kind to have because it means it could be treated with

325
00:21:56.261 --> 00:22:01.230
hormone therapy.
She had surgery,
she had radiation,
chemotherapy,
all the usual,
uh,

326
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.560
breast cancer treatment,
even though no one knew if her disease would come back.

327
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:08.470
So those are all just in case measures because again,

328
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.340
we don't know who are the 20 to 30% whose tumors might come back later.

329
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.500
She endured that therapy and she was a survivor.
Unfortunately,
three years later,

330
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:21.070
her disease did recur initially in the bones and then the lungs.
Um,

331
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.830
but now I had changed so I had lost the estrogen receptor.
Um,

332
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.770
but luckily it had turned on.
Another gene called her two,
which made it,
um,

333
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.350
susceptible to another very famous treatment called Herceptin.

334
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.120
And that worked for a little while,

335
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.600
but then disease started popping up in other places like the brain and the

336
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:40.690
ovaries and other places.
Eventually it lost the,
her two,

337
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:42.910
so that Herceptin was no longer effective.

338
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.050
The whole point of this is that the cancers are heterogeneous.

339
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:49.540
They're changing and we can't see them.

340
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:53.490
So we don't know how to treat these metastatic cases.
Um,

341
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.390
unfortunately her disease progressed before we could,
uh,
get her on any other,

342
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.340
uh,
experimental therapies.
And,
uh,
she couldn't tolerate more toxicities.

343
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:06.220
These,
these therapies can be very,
very toxic.
And unfortunately,

344
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.580
she passed away earlier this year at the age of 36.

345
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.530
So Mandy used to say to me,
I feel like I'm playing whack a mole.

346
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.780
You know,
she used to say that,
you know,
the,

347
00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:19.870
the therapies that are given are just,
you know,
that they do work,

348
00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:24.460
they're FDA approved,
but they're there,
um,
trial and error.
So,
you know,

349
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:28.180
another tumor pops up and then we treat it and then another team or pops up and

350
00:23:28.181 --> 00:23:31.730
we treat it,
but it's just like whack a mole.
And,
um,
you know,

351
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.830
said this made me start thinking about this.
And you,

352
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:35.840
you all know the whackamole game.
Um,

353
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.890
but really this is so much more complex where you have a,

354
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.030
essentially this is a picture of a three D whack-a-mole game,
uh,
where these,

355
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.770
where these molds are popping up and you're trying whack them,

356
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.810
but you have to be careful that you're not killing the,

357
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.650
the host tissue as well with these toxicities.

358
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.350
So that's something that I think is,

359
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.320
it's always a balance between finding the best therapy and trying to,
um,

360
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.750
trying to,
uh,
not have as much toxicity.
So,

361
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:06.770
um,
why are,
why haven't we made enough progress against,
um,

362
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.900
deaths from breast cancer to date?

363
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:12.830
I'd say the main focus on research has really been on that primary tumor that's

364
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:15.500
in the breast.
The reason it's easy to get,

365
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:19.370
we can't do much research in humans obviously.
Um,

366
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:23.000
and these metastases that arise in patients are typically very,

367
00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:26.900
very difficult to obtain.
Uh,
so in,
in lieu of that,

368
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:31.070
we have to try to develop sophisticated model systems like the one I told you

369
00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:34.460
about before where we grow patients' tumors in the lab to try to figure out what

370
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:39.230
drugs might work.
Um,
and,
and it's not that there has been no progress.

371
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.190
New therapies have been approved.
Uh,
we have,
uh,
you know,

372
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.020
a new CDK four,
six inhibitors and there's excitement about immunotherapy.

373
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.010
It's just that each of those therapies typically helps for a little while,

374
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.140
but then ultimately there's resistance and,
uh,
it doesn't extend life,
uh,

375
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.000
as long as,
as we would like.
So really to prevent death from breast cancer,

376
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:07.001
we have to figure out how to treat metastasis and how to prevent it from ever

377
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.130
happening in the first place.
Or as Fred mentioned,

378
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:14.630
of course prevent breast cancer from arising at all,
even in the breast.

379
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.460
So,
um,

380
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.420
there is a fair amount of excitement about immunotherapy and I get asked about

381
00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:23.090
this a lot.
So I thought I'd just give you the overview.

382
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.830
The concept here is that you could use your immune system and activate it so

383
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:30.860
that it would hunt out those cancer cells that are hiding in the body.

384
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.090
And that's really attractive because then we don't have to know anything about

385
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:37.130
what's driving those tumors,

386
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.110
what is the genetic propensity or you know,
which ones are going to grow,
where,

387
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.910
what targeted therapies should we use?
Just think of any virus that you've had,

388
00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:49.400
you can't see that,
you don't know what it is,
you know you're sick,

389
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.550
but then you can actually,
your immune system,
we'll,

390
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:56.270
we'll target that virus and kill,
kill it and you get better.

391
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.920
So immunotherapy has had an amazing advances in disease like melanoma,

392
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.690
metastatic melanoma and certain types of lung cancers.
Um,

393
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.520
it's not working very well yet in breast cancer.

394
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.190
The response rates are still pretty small,
around 10 to 20%,
uh,

395
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:16.100
with eventual progression and most of those cases.
And uh,

396
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.360
but because of the excitement,

397
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:21.950
there are thousands and thousands of clinical trials now that are testing

398
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:25.790
immunotherapies and often combining those with other therapies that already

399
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:29.120
exist.
So we really need more research.

400
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.290
It's really important that we understand the biology of how to make these

401
00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:37.380
combinations so that we're not just combining therapies,
uh,

402
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.110
essentially blindly and causing unnecessary toxicities,
uh,

403
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.300
in order for the hope to,
to have,
um,
you know,
better outcomes.

404
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.030
The attractive thing if this works though,

405
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.150
is that immunotherapy such as a vaccine for example,

406
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:54.570
could be applied to either treat metastatic disease,

407
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:59.670
prevent those metastatic cells from growing out or primary prevention.

408
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.990
So that brings me back to the artimus project that front a friend mentioned.

409
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.210
She emphasized that this really was an advocate driven initiative.

410
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.050
So this is breast cancer patients and survivors have gotten together and said,

411
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:17.600
here's the urgent issues and ask the scientists and clinicians to help,
uh,

412
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:18.900
work toward this problem.

413
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.910
I have found it just incredibly transformative actually in my science to be

414
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:27.660
involved in this project.
So I'm very happy to be involved.
Uh,

415
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.130
as French mentioned,

416
00:27:29.131 --> 00:27:33.390
there's two key areas I thought I'd just give you a little tidbit as to where

417
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:35.760
we're going in the scientific direction of those areas.

418
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.020
The first area is to prevent breast cancer from in the first place.

419
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:44.430
So primary prevention and the group has really come up with a vaccine strategy

420
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.080
to try to do that,
uh,

421
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:50.790
where we would be immunizing against six particular proteins that get turned on

422
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.070
only when cancer cell,
only when breast cells are turning into cancer.
Um,

423
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.550
the idea is that that you,

424
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.690
your immune system would be prime to recognize expression of those proteins and

425
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:05.310
kill those cancer cells before they can form a,
an actual tumor.
Initially,

426
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:07.590
this is intended for high risk individuals.

427
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:10.980
There are people who know they have a very high risk of developing breast cancer

428
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:15.330
because of the family history.
For example,
the other area,
as Fred mentioned,

429
00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:16.680
is preventing metastases.

430
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.310
If we could prevent cancers from coming back outside of the breast,

431
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.430
we would essentially prevent death from breast cancer.

432
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:28.860
So the goal here is to try to figure out how do we know who has dormant cells?

433
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:29.761
As I said,

434
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:33.870
only 20 to 30% of cases have these cells that have spread and will eventually

435
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:37.530
recur.
But we do not know how to identify who those people are.

436
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.880
We don't know how to treat something that we can't see.
We can't detect it,

437
00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:44.010
we can't measure it.
We don't know anything about it.

438
00:28:44.011 --> 00:28:46.740
So how can we possibly treat it?
Um,

439
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:51.030
the idea would be to eliminate door these dormant cells before they become

440
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.530
incurable,
after they've grown,
uh,

441
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.260
or to find ways to keep the cells dormant.
If,

442
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:01.260
if somebody lives with dormant cancer cells in their bone marrow their whole

443
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:04.980
life.
So be it that that could be a perfectly good outcome.

444
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.541
Of course,

445
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:10.860
these two efforts in the Artemis project are orchestrated alongside all the

446
00:29:10.861 --> 00:29:14.460
usual scientific and clinical research that's going on in breast cancer.

447
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.100
As Fred mentioned,
we have to take all avenues,

448
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:20.460
we have to continue to figure out how to treat breast cancer,

449
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:22.350
how to treat metastatic disease.

450
00:29:22.351 --> 00:29:27.040
But we think taking these two approaches could have major longterm impact,
uh,

451
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:27.990
in the disease.

452
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.450
So the big question then is how do we know who has the dormant cells and how do

453
00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:36.030
we treat something we can't see or measure?

454
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.770
And the challenge really is that we don't have these kinds of samples to be able

455
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:44.890
to look at.
Um,
so,
so this is where I think advocate,

456
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:49.210
engagement and community engagement can be really transformative.
Uh,

457
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.700
this is something we've been thinking a lot about in the,

458
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:56.701
in the Artemis project where we really have to reprioritize the agenda and focus

459
00:29:57.281 --> 00:29:58.810
on the urgency of the problem.

460
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.290
If we really need to understand this particular question,

461
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:07.090
we have to figure out a way to do it.
Um,
and so we have to think outside the box.

462
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:07.710
Um,

463
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.620
and I think we need to engage our whole community because we've all been touched

464
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:13.900
by breast cancer in some way or another.

465
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.770
We all are responsible for four ending this disease.

466
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.750
So in the artimus project,

467
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:24.751
one example is we identified the questions related to how to prevent metastasis,

468
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.560
who has the dormant cells that are going to grow and what do they look like so

469
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.740
that we can try to treat those,
uh,
or keep them dormant.

470
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:38.130
We worked together through a series of workshops and think tanks where we have

471
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.590
um,

472
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:43.590
breast cancer advocates and patients working directly alongside the researchers

473
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.140
and scientists and really designed approaches that we think could answer these

474
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:54.361
questions and could give us the key to what is the transformative therapy or

475
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:57.540
therapies that could prevent metastasis.
Uh,

476
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.310
and now really our job is to try to execute.

477
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:05.320
Of course that's easier said than done.
Uh,
we have an egg just as an example.

478
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:10.321
We have an idea for a really global patient advocate driven network or

479
00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:16.480
partnership where we could potentially try to engage people to acquire those

480
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.200
specimens that are needed to look at those dormant cells.

481
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:24.670
And to try to determine what might be their Achilles heel that we could target

482
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:27.760
in order to prevent them from ever-growing or,
or to kill them.

483
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.140
I think we need a unified effort.
Every one,
as I said,

484
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:35.470
is affected by breast cancer,
but we all need to be invested.

485
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.280
So there are a lot of different groups,
some focus on it,
on awareness,

486
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:43.620
some focus on early detection,
some focus on access to care or,

487
00:31:43.621 --> 00:31:46.150
or disparities in breast cancer.

488
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.970
Someone to focus just on how do we treat metastasis,

489
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:51.160
someone to focus on how do we prevent breast cancer.

490
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.270
We all need to work together so that we can have a unified effort to this

491
00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:59.710
problem.
Um,
we need to use every avenue as,
as Fran said.

492
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.480
And I also want to emphasize it's not as though we aren't making any progress.

493
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:09.340
We are learning a lot about the biology of breast cancer,
but it's incremental.

494
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:12.700
It's,
it's too slow.
We understand more about the genetics,

495
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:14.890
we understand more about the tumor micro environment,

496
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:19.690
but we really need to just all come together and try to figure out a new

497
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:22.980
approach to make this more transformative.
Um,
and,

498
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:27.250
and I think these innovative partnerships between advocates,
researchers,

499
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.880
clinicians,
and the community is really the key,
the way to go.

500
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.910
We need to think big and we need to be bold.

501
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.060
The deadline campaign is very bold.
Uh,

502
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:40.790
it was heavily criticized for being so bold,
but this is what we have to do.

503
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.770
If we don't challenge ourselves to do this,

504
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:47.240
we won't make the progress we need and people will keep dying of this disease.

505
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.710
I would say that we really need to stop thinking that we're limited by what we

506
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:53.120
can do.
Well,

507
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:57.140
I can't study those dormant cells because I can't get the samples or I don't,

508
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.130
I don't know what they look like.

509
00:32:58.131 --> 00:33:02.870
We have to start just figuring out how to do what we can't do yet and make it

510
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:06.260
possible.
So I think that being able to engage in the community and,

511
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:09.590
and put our heads together,
very innovative,
innovative people,
uh,

512
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:14.510
such as Googlers might be able to help us with that problem.
So what can you do?

513
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.750
Working with the national breast cancer coalition has been,
as I said,

514
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:21.580
transformative for me.
I'm very passionate about this work.
Um,

515
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.380
I think that the mission to end breast cancer is,

516
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.040
is spot on and this is the way to get it done.
Um,

517
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.420
I think we need to use innovation and think about how could technology help us

518
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.410
in this issue.

519
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.300
How can we organize this grassroots movement and get people involved in science

520
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.430
and,
and really tackle this problem.

521
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.400
You can get educated about breast cancer.

522
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:47.750
Fran talked about the project lead program that the NBCC a holds.

523
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:51.800
It's an excellent program and just think about how to join the collaboration

524
00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:56.000
with researchers and advocates.
Uh,
such as in,
in the artimus project,

525
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.940
whether you're a scientist or you're,
you just want to advocate for,

526
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.980
for the end of this disease.
Uh,

527
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.410
we have the website there for breast cancer deadline 20,

528
00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:06.800
20 and I think I'm prepared to take questions if there are any.

529
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.320
My question is on the prevention side.
Just,

530
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:19.430
I read a lot about environmental causes and it's really hard for me to parse out

531
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.700
what's real or what's fake fake news,
fake science.

532
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:24.170
So I'd love to hear a little bit,
um,

533
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.950
from you both on in terms of the environmental potential impacts or if you think

534
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:30.140
that's not potentially part of this.

535
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:31.360
<v 0>So,</v>

536
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:36.890
so the one thing we know environmentally that causes breast cancer is radiation.

537
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:43.810
So radiation at a certain level.
So for example,

538
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:49.230
individuals who had a type of lymphoma when they were young and had whole body

539
00:34:49.391 --> 00:34:51.940
radiation and heavy doses of radiation,

540
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:57.180
they are very likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer later in life in terms

541
00:34:57.761 --> 00:35:00.430
of the external environment chemicals.

542
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:05.200
And that we really don't have high level evidence that there is a direct

543
00:35:05.201 --> 00:35:10.201
relationship between exposure to an environmental toxin and getting breast

544
00:35:11.051 --> 00:35:12.430
cancer.
Um,

545
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.600
all of the information that we have is pretty low level evidence.

546
00:35:16.601 --> 00:35:21.601
They're weak correlations except maybe DDT was something that had some strong

547
00:35:22.121 --> 00:35:23.500
evidence.
Uh,

548
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.190
so what NBC has tried to do in the past,

549
00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:32.191
unfortunately unsuccessfully was developed public policy that we would have a,

550
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.460
um,

551
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:38.460
a grant program that would create a between institutions and community groups

552
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:45.030
across the country that together they could develop a strategic approach to

553
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:48.960
addressing these questions.
Because too often we've seen people think,

554
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:52.650
well it's pesticides and then you run down that road before you have the

555
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.560
evidence that that's actually the right road to take.

556
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.950
And so we want to be more analytical and critical about it and make sure that

557
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:03.750
we're using our resources in the right way.

558
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.400
So what do we know?
And it's not much,
but again,

559
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:13.140
there is no high level strong evidence of a direct connection between

560
00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:15.630
environmental toxins and breast cancer.

561
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:16.743
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

562
00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.090
<v 2>thank you both.
This is really interesting and motivating.
Um,</v>

563
00:36:23.091 --> 00:36:26.090
you talked about how the Internet has changed the impact of petitions and

564
00:36:26.091 --> 00:36:28.730
gathering signatures and really the,
um,
uh,

565
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.090
ability for that to be leveraged in conversation.

566
00:36:32.091 --> 00:36:35.930
Can you also talk a little bit about how the Internet has changed your ability

567
00:36:35.931 --> 00:36:40.700
to get sustained funding?
I think about gofund me and really like,
um,

568
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:45.140
raising money for individuals in their moment of need versus organizations or

569
00:36:45.141 --> 00:36:46.790
research.
Can you talk a little bit about that?

570
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.851
<v 0>Well,</v>

571
00:36:47.851 --> 00:36:52.851
we haven't figured out a way to use the Internet and social media to fund,

572
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.463
um,

573
00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:56.080
<v 1>okay.</v>

574
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.110
<v 0>Our organization and I think others would agree with this,</v>

575
00:36:59.111 --> 00:37:02.920
the people that I speak to and other groups as significantly.
I think yes,

576
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:08.250
if there's a disaster like an earthquake in Haiti or you know,

577
00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:13.260
a flood in Louisiana that people respond to the disaster and give money if there

578
00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:18.640
is an individual as you mentioned,

579
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.900
but people respond go fund me as an individual,

580
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.760
what are the and emotional appeal.

581
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:30.330
But using the Internet and social media to raise money for a complicated

582
00:37:31.001 --> 00:37:36.001
organization with a pretty complex agenda but a pretty clear mission.

583
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.150
We haven't figured out how to do that yet and I don't know anyone who has

584
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.200
outside of the ice bucket challenge.
Outside of that,

585
00:37:44.201 --> 00:37:48.460
I haven't seen or heard of anyone being successful and if you have ideas about

586
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:49.930
that,
boy would I love to hear them.

587
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.140
<v 3>I could also try to add about a research funding as well.
So,</v>

588
00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:58.160
so the kind of scale of research funding that we really need to,

589
00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.470
to do the kinds of things I'm talking about,

590
00:38:00.471 --> 00:38:02.720
which is really changed the agenda and,

591
00:38:02.721 --> 00:38:05.060
and try to do things we've never done before,

592
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.890
that kind of funding really needs to come from a larger sources like the federal

593
00:38:09.891 --> 00:38:10.840
government.
Um,

594
00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:16.150
there are organizations who do crowdsourcing campaigns.
Uh,
and,

595
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:18.500
and you know,
everything helps to some degree,

596
00:38:18.501 --> 00:38:23.501
but I think we're talking about trying to really make this a movement,

597
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.790
uh,
where,
where we can,
you know,

598
00:38:25.791 --> 00:38:29.480
kind of all come with up with a strategy that would be really big.

599
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.280
It's bigger than any one research project or another research project.
It's,

600
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.130
it's a movement that I think,
uh,
again,

601
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:41.130
<v 2>ideas of how we can use technology to stimulate this are welcome for sure.</v>

602
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:45.340
Well I think you also see,

603
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:50.341
go fund me for an individual scientist who's started say go fund me page to fund

604
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:54.460
research,
their individual research.

605
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.910
And if you don't know it all sounds good.

606
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:03.990
So if you want to be careful about what you invest in and if you want to invest

607
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:06.250
in something that's actually going to make a difference,

608
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.270
it's not an easy thing to do because you really have to understand the

609
00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:13.960
complexity of the issues in order to make that kind of decision.

610
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.980
And that's one of the things we educate and train people to do.

611
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.400
I have a couple of questions,
I'll try to separate them out.

612
00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:23.260
The first question is,
you're at Google,

613
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:27.940
we hear a lot about machine learning and the ability to manipulate genes to use

614
00:39:27.941 --> 00:39:30.030
data to identify trends and,

615
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.660
and then scale those learning's more quickly than we've done in the past.

616
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.240
And I wondered if you could comment on how,
if at all,

617
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:41.050
that's affecting your research today.
Um,
and then on the flip side of that,

618
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.750
also wanted to understand,
um,
when you,

619
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.580
when you were talking about your strategies,

620
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.650
how you think about things like Braca and how you approach individuals who

621
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:54.520
already have a predisposition or if you sort of see that as a separate strategy

622
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:58.150
that is maybe over,
over utilized.

623
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.470
Well,
I can tick the first one.
I think first.
So,
um,

624
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.090
with regard to machine learning and how that's affecting research,

625
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:10.150
I think that really it comes down to big data.
So,
um,

626
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:14.560
I think we all kind of thought that the genetics of breast cancer and many other

627
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:16.120
cancers would solve the problem.

628
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.660
We just had to sequence a lot of tumors and then we would understand,
you know,

629
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:22.870
what is the Achilles heel?
And we would develop therapies for those things.

630
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.380
And what we learned in breast cancer,
unfortunately it was very little.

631
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:31.210
What we learned is every tumor is different.
There's no,
there's not another BRC,

632
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.010
one a or B RCA to Jane.
And so,

633
00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:39.720
um,
but we still need to try to integrate it.
It what,

634
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.920
what that leads to is really bigger data.

635
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.430
And maybe we have even more of a need for machine learning because what we know

636
00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:50.431
is we have to integrate that genetic data with also tumor microenvironment data

637
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:55.660
and maybe even lifestyle data in order to really make algorithms that could

638
00:40:55.661 --> 00:41:00.190
predict not only whether the disease will spread and who needs to be treated,

639
00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:05.190
but with what,
uh,
so it's,
it's,
it's an incredibly complex challenge.
Um,

640
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.130
we do have one research project in my lab where as I mentioned,

641
00:41:09.131 --> 00:41:13.130
we try to take personalized approaches and growing patients' tumors,
uh,

642
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.380
and testing drugs.
Um,
if we can do that on a large enough scale,
I think,

643
00:41:17.381 --> 00:41:20.440
I think we're past the point of thinking that we could do that for any one

644
00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:24.010
individual because it just takes too long.
It's,
it's infeasible.

645
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.710
But if we can do this for enough tumors,

646
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:30.400
then we can use machine learning to try to figure out what are the features of

647
00:41:30.401 --> 00:41:33.920
the tumors that respond to drug a and not drug B,

648
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.280
<v 0>and then take that and apply it now to the population.</v>

649
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.470
So that's kind of where we're going with that.

650
00:41:39.471 --> 00:41:42.260
But breast cancer is so heterogeneous that it's,
it's,

651
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.400
it's been much,
much more difficult than we ever thought.

652
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:52.210
I think one of the issues is advocates we have with the focus on data and

653
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:56.240
accumulating data that someone's used.

654
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.450
People use those data prematurely.

655
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.650
So you see a trend or a pattern in a population and you decide that's a place to

656
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:11.501
intervene before we really understand if that trend is meaningful in terms of

657
00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:16.550
mortality or [inaudible] or if it's just going to add to the overdiagnosis and

658
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:19.880
overtreatment that we have now,
which is not a good thing.

659
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:24.890
And we do a lot more of that than we do good for the population.

660
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.240
And so we're very concerned about data and how it's used.
Well,

661
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:34.340
just very quickly,
one of the projects that we have is called DNA land.

662
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
And I know you all know about 23 and me and ancestry.com et cetera.

663
00:42:40.761 --> 00:42:44.660
So we're asking individuals who have had,
um,

664
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.870
sequencing done from by,
through one of those,
uh,

665
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:52.700
programs to send their data to DNA land.

666
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:55.940
An answer is short clinical questionnaire about breast cancer.

667
00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:01.130
And we're going to try to see how the data links to um,
you know,

668
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:04.820
to a risk higher risk of breast cancer,

669
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.390
but more importantly how it risks to progression of breast cancer.

670
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.800
And it's the advocates are going to control the database and we're going to make

671
00:43:12.801 --> 00:43:16.820
it available to any scientists who wanted if they meet certain criteria.

672
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:21.110
So to that extent we think data is important as a research tool.

673
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.200
But as an intervention we're pretty concerned about the abuse.

674
00:43:25.201 --> 00:43:29.150
So that information in terms of Braca one and two,

675
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.920
as an organization,
we don't focus on any one type of breast cancer.

676
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.090
We focus on all breast cancer and ending all breast cancer.

677
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.890
What we have done in the area of Braca one and two is um,

678
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.720
we work very hard to know at Brock I went into it.

679
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:47.630
So if you don't,

680
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:53.050
that is a gene that was cloned back in the 90s that puts you at higher

681
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.020
risk of getting breast cancer significantly high risk of getting breast cancer.

682
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:02.330
And it's linked to family history.

683
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.080
And so that particular gene we work with,

684
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:10.130
we work in terms of making certain that public policy that everything is done in

685
00:44:10.131 --> 00:44:14.330
that area,
that there is a connection to genetic counseling,

686
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.670
that people understand the importance of genetics,

687
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.050
that there's funding for genetic counseling.
That's it.

688
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:24.160
There are enough genetic counselors.
We work on clinical trials like um,

689
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.390
the PARP inhibitor trials.
We work on those trials.

690
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:31.260
Clinical trials is another project that we do that I didn't have time to go
into,

691
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.400
but we,

692
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.400
and we work on telling the world that if you have a genetic test and you see

693
00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:41.490
that your braca positive,
you know,

694
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:46.510
your choice right now is to cut off healthy breasts and that is not a choice

695
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:50.250
anyone should have to make in order.
So this is not a good,

696
00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:52.830
it's not like we have an answer if you have a genetic tests.

697
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:57.930
So we think to a large extent that it is a research tool and we should

698
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:01.290
understand it as such.
So it's about education,
training,

699
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:05.550
making certain public policies and working on treatment and interventions for

700
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:06.660
that population.

701
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.660
<v 4>I thank you for coming in and thank you Laura for setting this up.</v>

702
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:15.990
My question is around kind of maybe on the hills of Jen.

703
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.830
I was pretty surprised to see the very slow movement of progress to find a cure.

704
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.120
Um,
how often do you,

705
00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:28.530
all of the different breast cancer foundations and associations get together to,

706
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:31.930
obviously everybody's end goal is to save lives.
Um,

707
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.530
but is there a lot of stepping on toes?

708
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.970
I don't understand how that the organization world works when there's so many

709
00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:41.730
that are striving,
it seems to the same goal.

710
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.980
So can you explain a little bit on that?

711
00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.440
<v 0>So it's interesting.
When I was diagnosed with breast cancer,
I was 39 years old.</v>

712
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.610
It was a partner in a law firm in Philadelphia.
My son was 14 months old,

713
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.040
you know,
I sat on nonprofit boards,

714
00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:59.840
mostly do it to do with women's issues and here then I come into this whole new

715
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:04.580
world,
the nonprofit at a different level and breast cancer advocacy.

716
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:09.970
And I was stunned by the pop politics of that world and the competition and the,

717
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:18.530
you know,
what is your real mission?
What is your real gold?
I was stunned by that.

718
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:23.950
So the reason why I got involved in the beginning of NBCC was because it is a

719
00:46:24.291 --> 00:46:26.390
coalition of organizations.

720
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:31.840
Our board of directors of our policy arm is there representatives from 25

721
00:46:33.981 --> 00:46:37.430
organizations that are diverse in every way possible.

722
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.850
I mean even politically diverse and they're really diverse.

723
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:44.540
And so because we believe that if we're going to change systems,

724
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.470
we have to have the very diverse perspective that is breast cancer.

725
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:53.330
It shouldn't be what five middle class white women think should happen.

726
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.570
You know,
in breast cancer it shouldn't be.
So,

727
00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:02.020
so we do work with a coalition of very different organizations to do the system

728
00:47:02.451 --> 00:47:06.830
change type of work that we do.
In terms of funding,

729
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.500
we don't directly fund research,

730
00:47:09.501 --> 00:47:14.501
but the organizations that do do come together at least once a year with the

731
00:47:14.511 --> 00:47:19.070
government funders to look at portfolios and see what's happening.

732
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.350
But in terms of other issues,

733
00:47:21.351 --> 00:47:25.850
it's impossible to really work together because we really don't all have the

734
00:47:25.851 --> 00:47:30.520
same goal.
And some organizations,

735
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:35.520
<v 2>their goal is very narrow and very specific and it can be at odds with a broader</v>

736
00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:37.840
approach to breast cancer.

737
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:42.130
So if your goal is to make certain that everyone has a mammogram,

738
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.780
that is not our goal because we understand the significant limitations of that

739
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.340
and that is not going to end breast cancer.
So we will not work together.

740
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:55.210
Not that we choose not to,
we just don't have an opportunity to work together.

741
00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.370
But our coalition is a very diverse coalition of different organizations.

742
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:05.900
I would like to see on a,
on a much broader level,
more,
uh,

743
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.950
acknowledgement that,
you know,
it's true.
We don't all have the same goal,
uh,

744
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:13.610
immediate goal,
right?
But I think we all want to end breast cancer,

745
00:48:13.611 --> 00:48:16.040
that that's the overarching goal.

746
00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:20.750
And I think that we could use a more unified effort in that,

747
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:25.760
uh,
in that area.
And I think if we could unify around,
you know,

748
00:48:25.761 --> 00:48:28.910
just the acknowledgement that,
that we have to do better,

749
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:34.470
then I think that that,
that would be a step forward in,
in progress.
Now,

750
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:39.050
how well researched has breast cancer been studied in populations such as

751
00:48:39.051 --> 00:48:43.980
transgender women?
Intersex folks are on men who have guidance,
comas,

752
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:49.170
Stevia,
Gynecomastia,
Anacostia.
Yeah,
not well enough.

753
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:51.260
I think,
uh,
you know,

754
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.770
these are rare cases of breast cancer.
Uh,

755
00:48:55.771 --> 00:48:57.180
even male breast cancer,

756
00:48:57.181 --> 00:49:02.181
which has Fran pointed out is a more common than most people are aware is

757
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.600
understudied.
Uh,

758
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:07.800
there are certain subtypes of women's breast cancers that are under studied and

759
00:49:07.801 --> 00:49:11.820
that really is because breast cancer is not one disease.
It's many,

760
00:49:11.821 --> 00:49:14.940
many different diseases.
And so,
uh,

761
00:49:14.941 --> 00:49:17.880
we don't have good research representation in,

762
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:21.640
in these sort of small subsets in part because a,

763
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.260
there's probably not as much funding for that type of research.

764
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:29.970
And also there's not the samples available.
It would be very hard,
uh,

765
00:49:29.971 --> 00:49:33.210
to study,
uh,
even male breast cancer.
For example,

766
00:49:33.211 --> 00:49:37.470
if your institution has one case per year,

767
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.040
for example.
So it is a challenge for sure.

768
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.830
What's different in October,

769
00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.690
2017 then say October,

770
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:52.250
2015 in terms of your challenges in getting funding and unifying a coalition,

771
00:49:52.251 --> 00:49:54.140
getting the support you need from the federal government?

772
00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:56.600
<v 0>Okay.
So two things.</v>

773
00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.920
Let me ask answer a different question first about what's different.

774
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:05.950
Because I was diagnosed in 1987 if I were diagnosed today,

775
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.870
I would get the same treatment.

776
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:15.340
So not much as changed in terms of interventions and therapies.

777
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.010
In terms of what's different a year ago,

778
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:23.060
it's harder and harder and more difficult to raise money.

779
00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.060
Is that your question?
Raising funding?
Yes.

780
00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:27.200
So it's much more difficult to raise money,

781
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.920
I think in large part because of the proliferation of breast cancer groups.

782
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:37.970
So when we started the coalition 25 years ago,
they're very,

783
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:42.350
weren't very many groups.
You know,
there was one group in Pennsylvania,
they were,

784
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:47.650
now I say I wake up every day and there is at least a thousand more and some

785
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.420
people think that's wonderful.

786
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:55.950
Some people think it's not because it dilutes the message and it also dilutes

787
00:50:56.331 --> 00:51:00.770
your ability to really raise funds because it's being spread around so many

788
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:01.520
different places.

789
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.170
And so for us it's become more and more difficult to raise funding.

790
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.200
We do not take government money,
government money.

791
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:12.980
So none of our funding come from the federal government.

792
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:18.340
We lobby for government appropriations that go to the worldwide scientific

793
00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:24.281
community and we have a seat at the table in those federal programs to help

794
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:28.760
influence how the funds are spent.
But none of that money comes to us.

795
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:31.760
And I always say if it did,
we would have ended breast cancer already,

796
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.830
but it doesn't,
you know,

797
00:51:33.831 --> 00:51:37.340
we have a limitation on the amount of funds will take from drug companies.

798
00:51:37.341 --> 00:51:41.720
It's only 15% of our budget and we're very careful how that money is.
She is.

799
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.970
So it's very difficult because we had never spent time marketing ourselves.

800
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.450
We own spend time,
we know spent financial resources.

801
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:54.800
We've always just focused on our mission.
Does that answer your question?

802
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.000
<v 2>That's on the,
on the research side,</v>

803
00:51:57.001 --> 00:52:00.660
I mean funding is just getting tighter and tighter and tighter.
Um,

804
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.360
right now at the National Cancer Institute,

805
00:52:03.361 --> 00:52:08.190
it's around 10% of grants that are submitted get funded.
Uh,

806
00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:12.240
and it's not as though 90% are not worth doing.
Um,

807
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:17.550
and we have a very important breast cancer research program at the Department of

808
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.150
Defense.
Um,
it's also extremely competitive to get funding.

809
00:52:21.151 --> 00:52:26.010
And unfortunately that program is,
is really in jeopardy I think right now.
Um,

810
00:52:26.011 --> 00:52:30.150
so yeah,
it's getting,
it's getting harder and harder.
Um,
and

811
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.900
<v 0>okay,
well,
I,
I think though,
you have to ask the question what should get funded?</v>

812
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.570
It's not only 10% get funded,

813
00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.370
which of those a hundred percent of proposal,
which should get funded,

814
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:47.810
because it really may be that we have maybe too many scientists and too many

815
00:52:47.811 --> 00:52:50.570
people asking duplicative,

816
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.210
old not important questions.

817
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:58.010
So what's the strategic approach to figuring out the right amount of funding,

818
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.310
looking at it really critically and saying,

819
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:06.610
what do we need to do to when breast cancer who is doing it,

820
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:11.060
who can do it?
How much money does that take?

821
00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:14.430
And we don't ask the question that way.
How do we do

822
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:18.460
<v 2>conversations to take the risk on the out of the box thinking when yes,</v>

823
00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:22.660
it's maybe perceived as more conservative approach to invest in tried and true

824
00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.730
same questions over and over.
That's what happened.

825
00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:29.040
But where I think the con the community and advocate partnership with research

826
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:32.190
can make a huge difference,
right?
Because then,
you know,

827
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:36.930
we can set the agenda and the priorities of what is the most impactful way to

828
00:53:36.931 --> 00:53:39.690
address this disease and ended.
Um,

829
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:43.560
and maybe that's different than the way we've normally been funding research.

830
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.860
So I think that that's the kind of thing we're looking for is,

831
00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:51.861
is this kind of big thinking that that could make a big difference on not saying

832
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:56.040
we have to stop the science the way it's going,
but we have to do more.

833
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:00.340
I know we're at time,
but maybe,
I don't know if this is a quick question.
Um,

834
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:04.290
just kind of heartbroken to hear you say that the treatment hasn't really

835
00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:09.291
materialized since you were diagnosed and 89 and for any of us women who've had

836
00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:14.790
to have a mammogram or God forbid,
a needle biopsy,
you sometimes think like,

837
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.150
if a guy had to go through this,
I think this would have changed.

838
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.700
I think this all the time and I'm just wondering if the reason we haven't

839
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:28.050
experienced that the change has anything to do that this is a women's

840
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:32.640
predominantly issue or if it's really a lack of the answers.

841
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:37.760
<v 0>I think that it's a complicated disease because it's in women and we have pretty</v>

842
00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:42.840
complicated bodies and biology.
I think that yes,

843
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:47.870
for a long time women were not included in clinical trials at the NCI cause they

844
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:53.310
were more difficult to study.
There wasn't a lot of funding in breast cancer,

845
00:54:53.311 --> 00:54:55.800
but there wasn't a lot of funding in prostate cancer either.

846
00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:01.350
And we really haven't come much further in prostate cancer as we have.

847
00:55:01.351 --> 00:55:05.880
It's in its same almost as breast cancer.

848
00:55:05.881 --> 00:55:10.800
So it is a yes because it's in women for a number of reasons,

849
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:12.900
but not completely because of that.

850
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:16.650
But I do want to say one thing that there have been some new therapies,

851
00:55:16.651 --> 00:55:19.620
for example,
Herceptin,
that was a,

852
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:23.760
that's a therapy that is a targeted therapy that we were involved in the

853
00:55:23.761 --> 00:55:24.780
clinical trials for that,

854
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:30.260
that treats women who have heard to overexpress breast cancer.

855
00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:33.930
And that was about 20% of breast cancer before Herceptin.

856
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.020
That was the most aggressive breast cancer.

857
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:42.180
Now after Herceptin,
it is one of the least aggressive breast cancer.

858
00:55:42.181 --> 00:55:43.090
So it,

859
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:48.230
it has proven to be effective in the adjutant setting that's not in the

860
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:49.920
metastatic setting.

861
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:51.323
<v 1>So.</v>

862
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:55.630
<v 2>Great.
Well thank you so much all for coming.</v>

863
00:55:55.631 --> 00:56:00.220
I really appreciate it and thank you for sharing your minds with my Google
family

864
00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:03.220
<v 0>and thank you Laura for inviting us.
Thank you very much.</v>

865
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:03.620
<v 1>Sure.</v>
