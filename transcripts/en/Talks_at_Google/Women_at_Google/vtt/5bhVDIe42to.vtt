1
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.403
Anyway,

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.090
thank you for taking time away from your day to come and be here.

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:09.901
This is really cool.

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.800
I didn't know that this place existed in certainly would never have known based

5
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.200
on the clandestine outside,
um,

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.380
appearance and,
uh,
just had a wonderful time at the cafeteria.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.520
I kind of wished that I worked here.
It's really great.
Um,

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.030
so this is my book and it's about a year that I spent traveling around the world

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.860
after a very painful divorce,
which is probably redundant.
Um,
but,
uh,

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.230
you know,
everybody thinks their divorce was particularly painful and,

11
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.900
and I guess I'm no exception.
And,
uh,

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.950
I also followed my divorce with the classic post divorce rebound,

13
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.430
disastrous relationships.
So,
um,
within a year of it all settling,

14
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:54.420
I was pretty much as they would say in a time and I'm,

15
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.000
so I decided to,

16
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.880
to start all over with my life and get rid of everything.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
And I went and traveled around the world for a year and I went to these three

18
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.910
countries,
to Italy,
India and Indonesia.
And in each place,

19
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.930
I was sort of seeking one part of myself that I felt I had lost.
And,
um,

20
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.950
and I wanted to look for it against the backdrop of a culture that specializes

21
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:20.040
in that,
you know,
so Italy of course was about pleasure.
Where else would you go?

22
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.900
And India was about devotion and Indonesia specifically Bali was about trying to

23
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:29.220
figure out how you can create a life that incorporates pleasure and devotion in

24
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.820
equal measure.
And um,
the volunteers seem to have some sort of a lock on that.

25
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.090
So I,
I wanted to sort of study how they do it and um,

26
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.820
and that's the book and that's the journey and I'm just going to read one little

27
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.310
short piece of it for you today.
Um,

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.030
and then we can just have a conversation and take questions or,

29
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:48.810
or do whatever you'd like,
play telephone,
whatever.
Um,

30
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
but this is from the India section and it's,
um,
it's just,
uh,
some,

31
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:57.220
some of my thinking about my,
my own,
um,
nascent,

32
00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:02.221
spiritual explorations when I was nine years old,

33
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:06.330
going on 10,
I experienced a true metaphysical crisis.

34
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.740
Maybe this seems young for such a thing,
but I was always a precocious child.

35
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.520
It all happened over the summer between fourth and fifth grade.

36
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.450
I was going to be turning 10 years old in July and there was something about

37
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:22.890
this transition from nine to 10 from single digit to double digit.

38
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.070
That shocked me into a genuine existential panic,

39
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.100
usually reserved for people turning 50 I remember that life was passing me by so

40
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:31.890
fast.

41
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.700
It seems like only yesterday I was in kindergarten and here I was about to turn

42
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:40.620
10 soon it would be a teenager and then middle aged and elderly and then dead

43
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.120
and soon everybody else would be dead too.
My parents would die,

44
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.950
my friends would die,
my cat would die.

45
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.410
My older sister was almost in high school already.

46
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.410
I could remember her going off to first grade only moments ago.

47
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.110
It seemed in her little knee socks and now she was in high school.

48
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.540
Obviously it would not be long before she was dead.

49
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.650
What was the point of of this?

50
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.960
The strangest thing about this crisis was that nothing in particular had spurred

51
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.230
it.
No friend or relative had died giving me my first taste of mortality.

52
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.600
I had not even yet read Charlotte's web.

53
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.010
This panic I was feeling at the age of 10 was nothing less than a spontaneous

54
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.340
and full out realization of mortalities,
inevitable march,

55
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.360
and I had no spiritual vocabulary with which to help myself manage it.

56
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.540
We were Protestants and not even devout ones at that.

57
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.950
We said grace only before Christmas and Thanksgiving dinner and went to church

58
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:30.790
sporadically.

59
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.050
My Dad chose to stay home on Sunday mornings finding his devotional practice in

60
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:38.140
farming.
I sang in the choir because I liked singing.

61
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.840
My pretty sister was the angel and the Christmas pageant.

62
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.070
My mother used the church as a headquarters from which to organize good works of

63
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:48.280
volunteer service for the community,
but even in that church,

64
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.710
I don't remember there being a lot of talking about God.

65
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.630
This was new England after all,

66
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.200
and the word God tends to make us Yankees very nervous.

67
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.080
My sense of helplessness was overwhelming.

68
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.860
What I wanted to do was pull some massive emergency brake on the universe,

69
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.640
like the breaks I'd seen on the subways during our school trip to New York City.

70
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.330
I wanted to call a timeout and demand that everything just stopped until I could

71
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:11.230
understand it.

72
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.870
I suppose this urge to force the entire universe to stop in its tracks until I

73
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.900
could get a grip on my thoughts might have been the beginning of what dear

74
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.990
friends of mine have called my control issues.
Of course,

75
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.290
my efforts and worry were futile.
The closer I watch time,

76
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.100
the faster it's spawn and that summer went by so quickly that it made my head

77
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:34.420
hurt and at the end of every day I remember thinking another one gone and

78
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:35.710
bursting into tears.

79
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.020
This sadness is one of the great trials of the human experiment as far as we

80
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:41.231
know,

81
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.560
we're the only species on the planet who had been given the gift or the curse

82
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:49.240
perhaps of awareness about our own mortality.
Everything here eventually dies.

83
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.200
We're the lucky ones who get to think about this fact every day and how are you

84
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:55.930
going to cope with this information?
When I was nine,

85
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:59.470
I couldn't do a thing about it except cry later.
Over the years,

86
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:04.120
my hypersensitive awareness of time speed led me to push myself to experience

87
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:08.470
life at maximum pace.
If I were going to have such a short visit on earth,

88
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.330
I had to do everything possible to experience it.
Now,
hence all the traveling,

89
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.480
all the romances,
all the ambition,
all the pasta.

90
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.620
My sister had a friend who used to think that Catherine had two or three younger

91
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:23.470
sisters because she was always hearing stories about the sister who was in

92
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.140
Africa,
the sister who was working on a ranch in Wyoming,

93
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:29.320
the sister who was the bartender in New York,
the sister who was writing a book,

94
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.800
the sister who was getting married,
the sister who was getting divorced shortly.

95
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.920
This could not all be the same person.
Indeed.

96
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.320
If I could have split myself into many Liz Gilbert's,

97
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:41.680
I would willingly have done so in order to not miss a moment of life.

98
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.031
What am I saying?

99
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.860
I did split myself into many Liz Gilbert's all of whom simultaneously collapsed

100
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:51.700
and exhaustion on a bathroom floor in the suburbs one night around the age of 30

101
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.920
I should say here that I'm aware of.

102
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.680
Not everyone goes through this kind of metaphysical crisis.

103
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.150
Some of us are hardwired for anxiety,

104
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.690
but mortality while others just seem comfortable with the whole deal.

105
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.420
You made a lot of apathetic people in this world of course,

106
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.230
but you also meet some people who seem to be able to gracefully accept the terms

107
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.800
upon which the universe operates and who genuinely do not seem troubled by its

108
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:13.634
paradoxes.

109
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.360
I have a friend whose grandmother used to tell her there's no trouble in this

110
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:21.230
world so serious that it can't be cured with a hot bath,
a glass of Whiskey,

111
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.460
and the book of common prayer.
For some people,
that's enough for others.

112
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.320
More drastic measures are required.

113
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.550
I have a friend that I've met here at the Ashram in India named Shawn.

114
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.250
He's one of those people like me who was born with the itch,

115
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.610
the mad and relentless urge to understand the workings of existence.

116
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.270
His little parish in county.
Cork didn't seem to have any of the answers,

117
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.540
so he left the farm and the 1980s to go traveling through India,

118
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.000
looking through for inner peace through yoga.

119
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.660
A few years later he returned home to the dairy farm in Ireland.

120
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.960
He was sitting in the kitchen of the old stone house with his father,

121
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.640
a lifelong farmer and a man of few words and Sean was telling him all about his

122
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.040
spiritual discoveries in the exotic east.

123
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.840
Sean's father listened with mild interest watching the hearth and the fire

124
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.560
smoking his pipe.
He didn't speak at all until Shawn said with excitement dot.

125
00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:13.220
This meditation stuff,
it's crucial for teaching serenity.

126
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.790
It can really save your life.
It teaches you how to quiet your mind.

127
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.980
His father turned to him and said,
kindly,
I have a quiet mind already son,

128
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.600
and then resumed his gaze on the fire,
but I don't,

129
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.240
nor does Sean.
Many of us don't.

130
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.680
Many of us look into the fire and see only inferno.

131
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.130
I need to actively learn how to do what Shawn's father it seems was born knowing

132
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:39.860
how to do,
how to as well.
Whitman once wrote,

133
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:44.650
stand apart from the polling and hauling amused,
complacent,
compassion,

134
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:48.170
dating,
idle,
unitary,
both in and out of the game,

135
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.950
watching and wondering at at all.
Instead of being amused,

136
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.730
though I'm only anxious.
Instead of watching,
I'm always probing and interfering.

137
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.490
The other day in prayer,
I said to God,
look,

138
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.220
I understand that an unexamined life is not worth living,

139
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:05.990
but do you think I could someday have an unexamined?
The lunch
Buddhist?

140
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:09.590
Laura has a story about the moments that follow the Buddhist transcendence into

141
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:12.710
enlightenment.
When after 39 days of meditation,

142
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:16.100
the veil of illusion finally fell away and the true workings of the universe

143
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:17.600
where reveal to the great master.

144
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.570
He was reported to have opened his eyes and said,
immediately,

145
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.040
this cannot be taught.

146
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.880
But then he changed his mind and decided he would go into the world after all

147
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.600
and attempt to teach the practice of meditation to a small handful of students.

148
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.440
He knew there would only be a meager percentage of people who would be served by

149
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:36.770
or even interested in these teachings.
Most of humanity,

150
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:41.000
he said have eyes that are so caked shut with the dust of deception that they

151
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:43.790
will never see truth no matter who tries to show it to them.

152
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.040
A few others like Shawn's dot perhaps are so naturally clear eyed and calm

153
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:51.470
already that they need no instruction or assistance,

154
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.680
but then there are those whose eyes are just slightly caked with dust and who

155
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:59.700
might with the help of the right master be taught to see more clearly someday.

156
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.840
The Buddha decided he would become a teacher for the benefit of that minority

157
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.610
for those of little dust.

158
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.620
Ideally hope that I'm one of those mid level dust cake I people,

159
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:11.550
but I don't know.

160
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.210
I only know that I have been driven to find inner peace with methods that might

161
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:18.660
seem a bit drastic for the general populace.
For instance,

162
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:21.630
when I told one friend of mine back in New York City that I was going to India

163
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:25.680
to live in an Ashram in search for divinity.
He sighed and said,
oh,

164
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:29.700
there's a part of me that's so wishes that I wanted to do that,

165
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:34.701
but I really have no desire for it whatsoever and I don't know that I have much

166
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:35.281
choice.

167
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.880
Though I have searched frantically for contentment for so many years in so many

168
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:43.050
ways and all these acquisitions,
they run you down in the end life.

169
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.610
If you keep chasing it so hard,

170
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:49.200
we'll drive you to death time when pursued like a bandit will behave like one

171
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.610
always remaining one county or one room ahead of you changing its name and hair

172
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:54.510
color to elude.

173
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.870
You slipping out the back door of the motel just as you're banging through the

174
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:59.490
lobby with your newest search warrant,

175
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.730
leaving only a burning cigarette in the ashtray to taunt you.

176
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.120
At some point you have to stop because it won't.

177
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.720
You have to admit that you can't catch it,
that you're not supposed to catch it.

178
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.910
At some point you have to let go and sit still and allow contentment to approach

179
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:15.744
you.

180
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.130
Letting go of course as a scary enterprise for those of us who believe that the

181
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:23.100
world revolves only because it has a handle on the top of it,

182
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:26.820
which we ourselves personally turn and that if we were to drop this handle for

183
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:30.390
even one moment,
well that would be the end of the universe,

184
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.520
but try dropping it.

185
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.660
This is the message I'm getting an India sit quietly for now and seize your

186
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:39.630
relentless participation and watch what happens.

187
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.100
The birds do not crash dead out of the sky after all in mid flight,

188
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.150
the trees do not wither and die the rivers to not run red with blood.

189
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.950
Life continues to go on.

190
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.360
Even the Italian post office will keep limping along doing its own thing without

191
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:58.410
you.
Why are you so sure that your micromanagement of every moment in this whole

192
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:01.260
world is so essential?
Why don't you let it be?

193
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.540
I hear this argument and it appeals to me.
I believe in it intellectually.

194
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.374
I really do.

195
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:12.000
But then I wonder with all my restless yearning and with all my hyped up fervor

196
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:16.470
and this stupidly hungry nature of mine,
what should I do with my energy instead?

197
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.140
That answer is arriving to look for God.
Look for God.

198
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.870
Like a man with his head on fire.
Looks for water.
Thank you.

199
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.233
<v 1>MMM.</v>

200
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.220
<v 0>So does anybody have any questions?
The other thing is if,
if,</v>

201
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.040
if the microphone stepping is too complicated,
if you want to say your question,

202
00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:41.020
I guess I could repeat it into here.

203
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:46.021
Would that also work or is there some sort of super Google technological thing

204
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.120
that I don't understand because I have a really old Motorola cell phone.

205
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.900
Okay.
Um,

206
00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.090
anybody have any questions or comments about anything writing this book or other

207
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:04.240
books or anything better that,
yes.

208
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.321
Um,

209
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:14.740
the question was how did I pick the three countries and were there others that I

210
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:17.800
was considering?
Um,
I spent a,

211
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.440
I think when you go on a quest and that that is what this is,

212
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:24.910
is as Corny as that word might,
might sound,
um,
uh,
it's,
it's,
uh,

213
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:25.540
the,

214
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.960
the prospect of questing is something I believe in very much and I believe that

215
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:33.520
it's a universal human urgency that can be in as strong and some people is the

216
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:38.260
urge to procreate or protect your kin or build stuff,
you know,
um,

217
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.110
it's,
it can be pretty mighty urgency and I,

218
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:44.590
and I think you have to prepare for it,
uh,

219
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:46.390
with a lot of self study.

220
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:50.140
And so I spent months kind of writing and writing and writing in my journal and

221
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:53.170
asking myself over and over again as many different forms as possible.

222
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.820
What is it that you really,
really,
really want?
Um,

223
00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.100
because that's a kind of hard thing I think for us to admit at times.
And um,
and,

224
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.850
and then I went back and read those journals and saw what kept coming up again

225
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:06.280
and again and sort of par boil that down to that.

226
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:09.670
And it appeared that I apparently really wanted to learn how to speak Italian,

227
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.680
you know,
for no logical reason.
It showed up on every page,
you know.
So I thought,

228
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:18.160
well,
that one's pretty evident and,
and I really wanted to,
um,

229
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.650
I really wanted to focus on my meditation practice in India.

230
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:22.390
Seemed like a natural place to go for that.

231
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.900
And then also I had a very special reason to go back to valley,

232
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:29.080
which is that I'd been there a few years ago for a magazine story in this.

233
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.980
I'd had the privilege to meet this ninth generation Indonesian medicine man.

234
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.590
This is kind of amazing old Yoda like character.

235
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.000
And he had dropped this line on me that said that it was my,
um,

236
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.390
apparently it was my destiny to come back there and to teach him English and to

237
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:47.140
live with his family.
And I grabbed onto that like a life wrote,
but you know,

238
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:48.100
and um,
um,

239
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.760
he just tossed this thing out and I spent the next almost three years just

240
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:54.580
trying to figure out how to organize my life around manifesting,

241
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:58.690
met destiny and getting back there somehow.
And,
um,
and of course I did.

242
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:03.370
And of course,
you know,
he had no idea who I was when I showed up
as,

243
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:06.920
as many quests turn out.
You know,
there's always these,
you know,
the,
um,

244
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.380
that's kind of perfect,
mythological,
I'm structuring of how that should go.

245
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.260
Um,
but,
uh,
it was still amazing to,

246
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:17.140
to be around him and in the end I did end up spending a lot of time with them.

247
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.100
So,
so I was invited to Indonesia and I felt I needed to go to,

248
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.050
to India and I really just wanted to go to Italy and eat a lot of food and learn

249
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:30.310
how to speak Italian.
And it was happy coincidence that they all began with eye,

250
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.350
which is good on a journey of self discovery.
But,
um,
my friends in Indiana,

251
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:37.810
we're like,
just come here.
I don't know why you got to

252
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:44.320
my friends in Islip who were,
were not too impressed,
um,
is there,
so of course,

253
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:47.230
many other places that begin with I,
but,
uh,
anyway,
that's,

254
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.190
that seemed like the thing to do.
Thanks buddy.

255
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.023
<v 2>Else?</v>

256
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.183
<v 3>No.</v>

257
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.430
<v 0>All right.
Yeah,</v>

258
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.543
<v 2>we were talking lunch.</v>

259
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.510
<v 0>Um,
I'm writing a book about marriage,
um,</v>

260
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.980
which is kind of like George Bush writing a book about diplomacy because I

261
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:16.850
haven't exactly excelled in that.
Um,
but,
uh,

262
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.880
but I am getting remarried and so I would thought that Joan Didion one said that

263
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:24.290
she writes in order to find out how she feels about things.

264
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:27.240
And so I'm going to use that,
uh,
at that book as a way to,

265
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.440
to try to understand what indeed that peculiar institution is all about and,

266
00:15:31.441 --> 00:15:33.680
and hopefully knowing more about it,

267
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:35.690
what might make it go a little better the next time.

268
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.910
<v 2>So that's what it's about.
Yeah,</v>

269
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.423
sure.

270
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.040
How much of it?
My whole life

271
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.130
I've been sat on vacation that then,

272
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.380
<v 0>right?
Yeah.</v>

273
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.320
The question is how much of what I learned on the trip have I been able to

274
00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:07.450
incorporate back into my normal life,
including meditation.
I mean,

275
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.890
I think madness would follow anybody who tried to keep an ashram schedule and a

276
00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:14.700
normal life in northeastern United States.
Um,
so I don't know.

277
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.700
I don't harangue myself too much for the fact that I don't meditate five hours a

278
00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:22.110
day anymore or chant for two hours a day or eat really good vegetarian food and

279
00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:26.880
all that kind of stuff.
Um,
but,
uh,
something,
you know,

280
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.220
how can I explain this catharsis?

281
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.720
No Catharsis ever happened without somebody participation.
You know,

282
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.850
people talk about Cathartic experiences,
you know,

283
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:39.330
somebody has a horrible accident or a horrible heartbreak and it transforms
them.

284
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.440
But,
but not without their,
they're not without their assistance,
you know,

285
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.790
not without them showing up for it.

286
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.790
And I think travel can always seem like such a natural way for people to change

287
00:16:50.011 --> 00:16:53.310
their lives,
but it can't impose change on you.
You know,

288
00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:58.210
you can only kind of will it in and similarly,
whatever.
Beautiful.
Um,

289
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.300
so treasures of selfhood that I found on this journey,
our mind to lose any,

290
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.380
any day,
I feel like it,
you know,
and so I consider it kind of my obligation to,

291
00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:10.340
to hold onto as much of that as I can within reason.
Um,

292
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.250
I would so love to tell you that I get up every day at before dawn and meditate

293
00:17:14.251 --> 00:17:16.950
and I'm half tempted to tell you that because you know,

294
00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:19.490
how the hell would you guys ever know if it's true or not?
But,
um,

295
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.600
in fact it's not true.
Um,
but I,
but I do it more days than I don't.
Um,

296
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.810
and I think that I have for that.
I kind of base it on,

297
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.170
on my writing practice as well.
I would love to say that I write every day,

298
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.330
but I don't,
but I write more days than I don't.

299
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.370
And I think as long as in your life,

300
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:38.280
you're doing more of what's beneficial to you than not,

301
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.420
then that's probably good enough for,
for what we can do in our normal lives.

302
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.250
Thanks for your question.

303
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.393
<v 2>Yup.</v>

304
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.310
Back to you asked.
Yeah.

305
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.720
<v 0>The question is what did they think about coming back to the u s at the end of</v>

306
00:17:56.721 --> 00:18:00.170
my trip I was excited because I had the journey of writing the book to look

307
00:18:00.171 --> 00:18:04.850
forward to.
So that in itself is another kind of adventure in a way.
Um,

308
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.830
and,
and also I was just,
um,
I don't know when I,
when I was at the Ashram,

309
00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:12.560
I remember seeing people who kind of got addicted to,

310
00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:17.630
to exploration without ever coming home,
you know,
like they were,

311
00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:22.070
they were on a spiritual journey kind of their whole lives for like 25 years in

312
00:18:22.071 --> 00:18:24.620
the same Ostrom.
And they were,
and I sort of thought,

313
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.890
is that really the point of these teachings?
You know?
Um,
I mean,

314
00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:31.190
they weren't monks,
they were civilians,
but they were sort of stuck.

315
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.030
I felt in this,
in this cycle of constantly

316
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.750
seeking slash hiding.
And,
um,
and I remember this one girl at the Ash,

317
00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:44.240
I'm coming back from having flown to Chicago to see your family.

318
00:18:44.241 --> 00:18:47.620
And she came back and she was like,
you know,
she was breathing Ostrow mirror.

319
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.370
Like it was pure oxygen.
She was like,

320
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.090
I couldn't wait to get back here because the real world is so screwed up and I

321
00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:56.580
couldn't relate to anybody.
I just wanted to be here with people who understand.

322
00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:58.230
And I just thought the point of this candidate,

323
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.280
all of these teachings and all of that opposed to make reality harder for you,

324
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.150
you know,
it seems like,
um,

325
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.560
any sort of beneficial practice would be one that would make it easier for you

326
00:19:09.561 --> 00:19:11.720
to live in,
in the world.
Um,

327
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.780
and so I was excited to kind of try out my new self and in my old life and,

328
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:19.070
and see how things had changed.
And,

329
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.120
and indeed I just feel more comfortable in the world and more comfortable in my

330
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:26.360
skin than ever.
So,
so it's been lovely.
It wasn't,

331
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:28.310
it wasn't particularly jarring coming back then.
Again,

332
00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:31.940
I didn't come back to a very normal life either.
So,
um,
I,

333
00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:34.250
if I'd had to go back to my marriage and my suburban house,

334
00:19:34.251 --> 00:19:38.300
I think it wouldn't have been quite as quite as much to look forward to that.

335
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.413
<v 2>Okay.</v>

336
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.353
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

337
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.500
oh,
the question is about my last book before this,

338
00:19:56.501 --> 00:20:00.190
which is the last American man where I spent a lot of time actually with this

339
00:20:00.191 --> 00:20:01.990
guy named used is Conway,

340
00:20:01.991 --> 00:20:06.991
who is this sort of modern latter day messianic mountain man guy who lives in

341
00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:11.710
the woods in North Carolina and left home at 17 and has been living in the woods

342
00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.060
and living off the land ever since.

343
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:18.390
And has this completely deranged messianic view of himself as somebody who can

344
00:20:18.611 --> 00:20:22.030
single handedly return America to being in agric agrarian society.

345
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.360
And everybody's going to follow him into the woods and he's so captivating that

346
00:20:25.361 --> 00:20:27.920
you just might think that it was possible.
Um,

347
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.420
but he's also sort of crazy and it's in his way.
Um,

348
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.030
and the question was how did that,
how did spending,

349
00:20:34.031 --> 00:20:37.880
I think your question was how to spending time with him affect my own journey in

350
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:42.550
two ways.
One was that,
um,
did I tell him about this?
Yeah.

351
00:20:42.551 --> 00:20:45.250
I told him I was going to do this and he was,
he was very encouraging.

352
00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:49.450
He's all about,
you know,
the quest.
Um,
uh,
you know,

353
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.740
I spent a lot of time writing about men in my life.
You know,
I worked for spin,

354
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:55.670
I worked for Gq and,

355
00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.680
and my first book was a collection of short stories that seemed to be mostly

356
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:02.980
about cowboys.
And my second book was a novel about lobster fisherman.

357
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:06.640
And my third book was this like quintessential American masculine figure.

358
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:09.130
And I kind of was like,
you know,

359
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:12.880
a Jay did just need a little time off from the fellows for awhile,
you know,

360
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.190
writing about them being married to them,

361
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.570
giving them all my money in divorce settlements,
you know,
to like all,
it's just,

362
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.660
this is just,
I'm a little overwhelmed with this,
you know,
and I,

363
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:26.950
and I thought that I really wanted to spend some time,
um,
away from that energy.

364
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.040
So in one way it propelled me to want to go off on my own.

365
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.530
And the other is that,
um,

366
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.870
I was really impressed with his self honesty.
Um,
when I wrote that book,

367
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.670
He gave me absolute utter access to his life.
He handed me at one point,

368
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
this giant box filled with all his journals and childhood diaries and love

369
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:51.310
letters from girlfriends who now hated him.
And you know,

370
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:54.010
all this incredibly intimate stuff that he hadn't even looked at in years.

371
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:57.940
And he just gave it to me and said,
use any of this.
You know,

372
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:01.600
he gave me telephone numbers of people that he knew despised him and said,

373
00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:04.390
you should talk to this guy cause he hates me and he thinks I'm a fraud and you

374
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:05.950
should talk to people who think I'm a fraud.

375
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.700
And he looked at that question himself and he,
you know,
he just,

376
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.490
he just doesn't do things halfway.
And I was,

377
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.600
I was really inspired by the fact that he sort of understood,
if you're going to,

378
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.600
you know,
if you're going to do biography or if you're going to do a memoir,

379
00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:24.370
like do it,
you know,
um,
don't try to turn it into some sort of vanity piece.
And,

380
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.700
and I think that helped me find the result to just tell this story as it

381
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.030
occurred rather than trying to manipulate it or make myself look,
you know,

382
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.690
good.
And in any sort of way.

383
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.400
So that was really those that was inspired.
He was both repellent and inspiring.

384
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:45.130
And I think that's actually probably a very good general description of him

385
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.780
<v 4>in total.
Yeah.</v>

386
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.740
In writing web.
Yeah.

387
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.470
<v 0>Oh,
where do I do my writing?
I used to be a,
yeah,
the,
um,</v>

388
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:07.580
I mean I've written all over the world,
um,

389
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.170
at this point because I've done so much traveling.
But my preferred,
um,

390
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.560
I mean I've always been,
I think like we're most writers,

391
00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:18.020
I've always been seeking the kind of the perfect womb,
you know,

392
00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:19.420
in which to write and,
um,

393
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.080
and have found different versions of it for different books depending on where I

394
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:26.350
was living in,
when I was doing.
But my short story collection in my novel,

395
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:30.820
I wrote almost entirely in the New York public library reading room.
You know,

396
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:32.960
that beautiful big quiet space,
um,

397
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.190
which is a really nice place to work because you're alone,
but not alone.

398
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:37.150
You're alone in silence,

399
00:23:37.151 --> 00:23:40.300
but you're not isolated because there's people around and there's this kind of

400
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.150
river of work,
of energy of people studying.

401
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:47.120
And you would feel guilty to not be in it with them.
Um,

402
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.630
although many times I had this sort of school marm ish guard come and wrap me on

403
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:54.290
the head for falling asleep in my arm,
my,
you know,
on top of my paperwork,

404
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.560
which you're not supposed to do there.
Um,
but,
but,
but now,

405
00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:01.250
and then my last two books,
this book and the last American man I wrote,
um,

406
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.140
I mean,
when you write a book,

407
00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:05.900
there's years of sort of research and stuff and collecting and that I can do

408
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:07.760
anywhere,
but when it comes to the actual,

409
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.380
this sort of holy act of sitting down and composing a book,
um,

410
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.860
I need a lot of silence for that.
So I went to an artist's residency in Wyoming.

411
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:18.400
There's these wonderful sort of retreats that were,

412
00:24:18.401 --> 00:24:21.650
that you go and they take care of you and give you kind of a quiet place to
work.

413
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:26.120
And so I wrote those books there and now I've just bought a house and I'm hoping

414
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:30.590
that I can create a quiet enough place in there that I can actually write in my

415
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:32.540
own home for once,
which I've never been able to do.

416
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

417
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:38.100
<v 0>So,
but coffee shops would be out of the question for me if only because of the</v>

418
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:42.910
availability of muffins constantly.
It would be a big muscle.

419
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.850
Anybody else?
Is anybody a writer?

420
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.820
Secrets?
I'm always curious about that.

421
00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:58.973
Yup.

422
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.813
<v 2>Okay.</v>

423
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.693
Hi.

424
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.230
<v 0>Um,
I,
I've always,</v>

425
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.370
the question is when studying and Lippert language do take on a different

426
00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:20.540
personality,
um,
yeah,
Italian has a particular,

427
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.650
I think everybody who,

428
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:26.690
who studies Italian takes on this completely phantasm Phantasmo as,

429
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.040
that's not even a word,
but like this completely romantic.

430
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.420
I mean that in every definition of the word romantic identity,

431
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.590
where you really do think that you're in a Fellini movie and you know that

432
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.020
you're,
you're riding a moped around Rome with your dashing swore,

433
00:25:43.021 --> 00:25:43.920
the boyfriend or so,

434
00:25:43.921 --> 00:25:47.090
there's just something so incredibly sexy about that language.

435
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:50.360
And that's partially why I think I was so attracted to it because I just felt so

436
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:54.590
dead.
You know,
I'm after going through divorce and depression and,
and I would go,

437
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:58.730
I was taking Italian at the new school and I would just come home and lay in the

438
00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:01.670
bathtub and read the dictionary out loud and just put this big flow,
you know,

439
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:04.010
I'd be like in bubbles and I'd be like,
you know,

440
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.030
<v 6>Ciao.
I let the De,
you know,
um,</v>

441
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:09.440
you

442
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.750
<v 0>can't do it without waving your hands around and without.</v>

443
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.500
I'm starting to feel kind of invigorated.
There's,

444
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.960
and there's reasons why as I found out when I was researching the book,

445
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:21.980
there's reasons why Italian is such a tantalizing language.
Um,

446
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.500
it's not an accident that it's as beautiful as it is.

447
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:27.090
There were decisions that were made in Italy,
um,

448
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.370
around the 16 hundreds about what was going to be the official language out of

449
00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:33.950
all the dialects.
And there was a kind of counsel,
I mean,

450
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.020
I don't think any other language has this pedigree.

451
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.130
There was a sort of council of intellectuals who got together and basically went

452
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:44.760
around in Italy what looking for the most beautiful version of a colloquial,

453
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.410
you know,
bastardize Latin.

454
00:26:46.411 --> 00:26:50.610
And it turned out to be Florentine and the language of Dante.
And so it's,

455
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:53.430
it's a language that was sort of built by a poet and,

456
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:57.690
and I think that's why it's so appealing and it seems to be universally so.

457
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.490
And when I was in Rome studying,

458
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.110
I found out that every single person in my class who was taking Italian had come

459
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:07.980
for the same reason because they had no practical justification whatsoever to

460
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:09.870
learn this thing.
We,
like nobody's boss said,

461
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.840
you have to learn Italian so our business will thrive.
You know,

462
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:16.680
like it's just not in the sort of vocabulary of commerce,
but,

463
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:21.240
but people just felt like it would make them feel good too to have those words

464
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:24.620
and sounds coming out of their mouths and all these stiff German,
you know,

465
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.350
engineers visiting room and wanting to learn because this one guy said,

466
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:32.780
I want to have the dolce vita,
you know,
and uh,

467
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.430
I was like the Deutsche Shavita though,
you know.
Um,
but,
uh,
this is so,

468
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.070
there's just something very alluring about it.
And,
um,
and I think it helped.

469
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.500
I think it helps change my,
you know,

470
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:47.040
and I don't think it hurt either that my head as anybody who's gone through

471
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:50.550
really hard times knows you get stuck in these kind of ruts of thought.

472
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:54.060
And I don't think it hurt to actually change the language and introduce new

473
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:57.750
words into your head to try to escape the,
um,

474
00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:02.850
the constant sort of run around of the familiar repetition of destructive

475
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:07.350
sentences.
Um,
so yeah,
it definitely,

476
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.970
but nobody ever wants to miss took me for being Italian after all that never

477
00:28:13.231 --> 00:28:15.840
happened at all.
Next life.

478
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

479
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:22.030
<v 0>Next life will be Italian.
So yes.</v>

480
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.910
<v 2>What
happened?</v>

481
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.320
<v 0>I'm with which man?
From Indonesia.
Uh,</v>

482
00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:44.250
with my,
my sweetheart from Indonesia.
Yeah.
We're getting,
we're getting there.

483
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.970
We're getting married in a few weeks.
Um,
so we're in pretty close contact,

484
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:52.170
which is good.
Um,
I,
the question is what,
what,

485
00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:56.110
what would be the fourth verb?
That's a really good question.
Eat,
pray,
love.
Um,

486
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.370
well it just somehow reminded me of what my aunt Lou Ann said cause she wished

487
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:04.090
that I had stayed in Italy the whole time and just call the book,
eat.
Um,
but um,

488
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.290
you know,
actually I would say it would be repeat.
Um,
that's,

489
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:11.520
that would be the,
uh,

490
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.900
that would probably be the best way to continue to continue your life.
Um,

491
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.420
and it's nice because I just bought a,
I was just telling him a little bit,

492
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.280
or I just bought a church in New Jersey.
So,
um,

493
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.320
and over the top of the 1798 old old church and I decided to have somebody write

494
00:29:27.691 --> 00:29:30.930
in gothic letters over the top,
you know,
eat,
pray,
love.

495
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.740
Cause it seems to be a good location for it.
So,
yeah,
eat,
pray,
love,
repeat,

496
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.010
and so on and so on.

497
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.150
Or maybe remember that would be good too.

498
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.240
So thank you all so much.

499
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:51.241
I appreciate your questions and your time and good luck on all your quests and

500
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.940
enjoy your coal jobs.

501
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.110
They seem to be from the outside
and thanks for having me.
I appreciate it.
