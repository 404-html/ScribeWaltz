1
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.960
Very,
very nice to be here.
I probably met maybe 60 of you in that hallway there.

2
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.490
So already you feel like family or at least you made me feel very comfortable

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.450
that and the free food out there because I had those chips with vinegar.

4
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.030
I love the whole place.

5
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.540
I might apply for a job here with that and I bet it would be a lot less worth

6
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:28.220
than what I'm the stupid thing I'm doing now,
you know?
Um,
so um,

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.200
I've been asked to speak to you and we discussed what would be a good topic.

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.410
I always like a topic that people relate to.
All right.

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.730
And I'm assuming that we have a crowd of shark tank fans based on what I heard

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.180
that,
well,

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.150
I want to thank you for my job because we didn't have good seasons by this
point.

12
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.340
We were going to be asked in season one and two.

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.310
And so if particularly for the people who are watching early,

14
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.240
you saved our ass or I'd be out the,
okay,
now what do I do?
You know?

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.350
So it all worked out very nicely.
As you know,
I'm,

16
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.110
I'm going to talk to you about three things,
like three sections to it,

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950
only a little bit of everything.
You're going to like one of them,
right?
Uh,

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.770
I'm going to tell you my rags to riches story because the people organizing the

19
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:10.170
event wanted me to spend five,
10 minutes on that.

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.340
Then I'm going to talk about the entrepreneurs I'm working with and I've even

21
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.920
met a couple of people already today who knows.

22
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:20.460
Some of my entrepreneurs are friends with them,
so that was kind of Nice.

23
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.700
And so I won't say anything bad about them even though I was going to dish them

24
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:24.534
like crazy.

25
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.520
And then I'm gonna follow it up with like a little dessert behind the scenes

26
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:32.460
photos I dragged up from behind the scenes of shark tank.
So you know,

27
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.190
what really goes on and I call that section of it.

28
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:39.720
What are the sharks really like versus the personas we tried to put forth their,

29
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.590
well,
what would being coached to be on a show versus what we actually are.
Okay.

30
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.371
All right.

31
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.000
So I'll start with the rags to riches story as it pertains to what I wound up

32
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:49.560
doing for my life work,

33
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:52.050
which was being a real estate broker here in New York City.

34
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.570
And I really had a very,

35
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:57.810
very good luck as a child to enormously lucky breaks.

36
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:01.710
I had two good parents and anybody who's got one good parent.
As you get older,

37
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:03.120
they get better and better.
In fact,

38
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.310
I don't even know what my mother and father were as good as I'm going to tell

39
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:08.490
you they were.
But as I get older,
as we all do,

40
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.060
he started to appreciate any advantage you had as a child.

41
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.060
So I had a mom and I'll show you the picture of our family minus one child.

42
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.000
We had 10 kids.
We had six girls,
four boys.
We lived in a little town,

43
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.280
which I'm sure you've heard of Edgewater,
New Jersey,

44
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.670
right across the river when we were there,
every man in town,

45
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.790
except my father was employed by three of large,
three,

46
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.650
one of three factories there.

47
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.870
I actually thought our family was like the Kennedys,
uh,

48
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.430
because my father put a suit on every day to go to work in Trenton,
New Jersey.

49
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.930
And somehow because every other man was in our factory uniform,
except my dad,

50
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.840
I really,
I was like a snob.
Okay.

51
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.030
And my dad actually was a printing press foreman,
uh,

52
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.100
when printing was a big deal before that disappeared,
uh,

53
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.910
for many various factories all through our childhood in Trenton,
New Jersey,

54
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:01.360
typically.
Anyway,
my mother was a powerhouse in my family,
not my dad.

55
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.210
My mom was a phenomenal motivator.

56
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.510
She's probably the most organized person I've ever met in my life.

57
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.000
And I've met so many organized people.
Uh,

58
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:14.020
my mom would decide on the birth of each child exactly what she thought that

59
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.130
child's gift was.

60
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.510
So she had announced it the day she brought the baby home from holy name

61
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.510
hospital.
We were devout Catholics in our family,

62
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.340
and that's why I haven't been to church since
she overdid that one.

63
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.200
But I remember distinctly when she brought my brother,
uh,

64
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.890
Tommy home and Tommy is the,
the middle row.
Uh,

65
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.680
would it be to your left?
Okay.
With the longish hair.

66
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.350
And she had Tommy as an infant in her arms.

67
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.960
I can remember it was like it was yesterday.
And she said,

68
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:48.490
look at your brother Thomas.
He's going to be a magnificent dancer.

69
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.290
And we were like,
oh,
I remember me thinking,
Oh,
it dancer in the family.
Cool.

70
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:58.090
We don't have one of those yet.
And what did my mom base that prediction on?

71
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:02.020
She saw that Tommy had fat,
juicy legs kicking like hell.

72
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.770
And that was her prediction.
So what happened to my brother Thomas,

73
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:07.120
who now we called t,

74
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.390
she grew up to be a ballet dancer for Alvin Alley Dance Theater.

75
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.610
And he used to say when he came in to the house after he was long out of the

76
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:19.090
house and doing the ballet,
he used to say,
the truth is,
I can't really dance.

77
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:22.600
But mom somehow convinced me I could for me.

78
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.440
She said I had a wonderful imagination.
That was my function in the household.

79
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.720
Just like Tommy's function was to dance.

80
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.070
So my function was to entertain the other kids.
So if it was a rainy day,

81
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:36.520
I was the person assigned to bring the kids down in the basement and putting on

82
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.450
a Broadway show.
If it was a sunny day,
my mother would make up some kind of shit,

83
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.120
throw it at me as an idea,
like,
like,

84
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.760
why don't you go in the back yard and opened a rock store,

85
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:48.040
Barbara in and I go like a rock star.

86
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.460
When some rockstars go with your imagination,
you'll figure it out.

87
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.920
And you know what I found?

88
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:57.280
I could sell rocks as long as you stapled them and white paper and staple the

89
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:00.060
corners.
Nobody could see which rock they are getting.
People pay for that.

90
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.790
The kids.
All right.
And so our family went.

91
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.510
It was like growing up in a small town.
We had six girls in the girls room,

92
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.310
four boys in the boys' room.

93
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.250
And My mother and father produced all those kids from the living room couch.

94
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.600
My mother's other great gift where she was a phenomenal organizer.

95
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.110
We had the messiest house,
as you could imagine with that many kids.

96
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.130
We have the biggest family,

97
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.300
but we also have the cleanest house when my mother cracked her mental whip on
us.

98
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.540
Right.
And the key to her organizational skill,

99
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.680
which I later learned and building a big brokerage business was she created a

100
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.700
system that's a list,
a system for anything.

101
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:40.030
She had to do more than twice.
So for example,

102
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.200
we had to sock drawers in the kitchen in our little kitchen and she converted

103
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.290
them to,
pardon me,
bread drawers built in.
That was common then.

104
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.620
And she converted them to to sock drawers.

105
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.920
All the boys socks or the upper drawer,
all navy blue,
all one size.

106
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.510
All the girls were white,
all one size.

107
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.200
So when you get 10 kids out to school in the morning,

108
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.570
we have to do is grab any socks,

109
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:02.420
you white and go out the door as long as you remember which store.

110
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.510
And the only kid in my family that got mixed up was of course my brother Tommy.

111
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.930
He went out the white side.
No,
Tommy come back.

112
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.220
So that's how our family when usually organized,
um,

113
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.740
my mother totally iron clad control of every one of her kids.

114
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.410
And you didn't dare not walk the straight and narrow.

115
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.630
My father's job was to be my mother's 11th child and he was totally in shale.

116
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.960
He was totally in charge of other than working during the day of a printing

117
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:33.140
press foreman and we were in washing trucks for ups at night on weekends.

118
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:35.090
He did not work.
And our weekends,

119
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.330
his job was to play with his children and we couldn't have gotten a better

120
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.164
playmate.

121
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.970
My Dad had probably the mental maturity level when he was out in the yard of

122
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:48.320
maybe an eight year old and he did dangerous things with us all the time.

123
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.560
And what do you like more as a kid and something you shouldn't be doing.

124
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:55.700
And even we knew we shouldn't be doing it but he didn't.
So for example,

125
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:59.060
if it was a snowy day and we got to stay home from school and he couldn't get up

126
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:01.670
that oxen hill out of Edgewater,
what would he do?

127
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.120
He would take all of his kids and has many as he could fit in the whole

128
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.630
neighborhood,

129
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.630
put them on the long wooden ladder that ran down our side yard and he'd shove us

130
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:12.800
down the hill.
He'd hop on the last rung.

131
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.260
We'd go over that retaining wall and into oncoming traffic

132
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.930
when every other kid in town got to go to the automatic car wash and the uptown

133
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.770
above our house,
uh,
all the kids read it.
It's an automatic,

134
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:27.530
it washes it's automatic.
They had nothing on my dad.

135
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.160
We went up and the little subtle difference that made all the difference was

136
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:34.220
right before we went in.
We were wondering why did we have to wear pajamas?

137
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.220
He made us wear our pajamas,
right as we went through the car wash,
said,

138
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:42.200
quick roll down the windows.
So he had this bizarre sense of fun.

139
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.670
And ironically,
when we all get together for weddings,
Christenings,

140
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:50.630
funerals,
whatever today,
uh,
what did we talk about?

141
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:54.140
The 12 loads of wash.
My mother hung on the line every other day.

142
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.840
The three meals she put on the table every day.

143
00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:00.170
So we could all eat the clean house.
No,
we don't even mention my mother.

144
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.090
All we do is sit around and say,
Hey,

145
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:07.010
remember the time dad was at the lake and they had the Hillstone hail storm and

146
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:10.390
they told us to keep under the water and stay dry?
Ya.
Yeah.
Yeah.

147
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.670
It wasn't that fun.
My mother gets no credit and you know what I've learned?

148
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:16.370
I've learned that kids don't remember the extravagant vacations.

149
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.040
They'd all becomes a blur later on with children.

150
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:20.930
Really treasured most is something silly.

151
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.400
And so I had that wonderful role model and my dad of being ridiculous,

152
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.650
and I use that to,
to build my business.

153
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:31.760
So between my mother's ability to pick out the talent in someone and create

154
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.950
motivation to make them be their best,

155
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.300
what a gift that is to breathe in and out with a woman who did that as a matter

156
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.134
of course,

157
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:44.000
and her ability to organize any mess and my dad's ability to let it all go,

158
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:46.400
who gives a damn and have a good time.

159
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.740
I had a lot of different models to choose from and so I was really perfectly

160
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:53.630
poised to be an entrepreneur.
If you think of him,

161
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.320
I nine siblings as I mentioned at a wall,
my siblings,

162
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:02.280
only one is not self employed.
Everybody went into business for themselves.

163
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.550
I credit my father entirely with that decision because he hated every bossy ever

164
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:12.330
worked for if he came home from work at five or four o'clock instead of six

165
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.000
o'clock the usual time when we had to be in our seat at the table,

166
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.470
my mother's order,
when he came home early,
we left everything we were doing.

167
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.960
Have you dropped everything?
The hockey sticks,

168
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:26.370
everything your ran in sat your spotter like cause you knew my father had an

169
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:30.930
adventure to tell and he saunter in like John Wayne himself sit down and say to

170
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:35.040
us,
guess what kids and we'd all scream,
you were fired.

171
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.570
And then he'd go on and say,
yeah,
told Mr. Stein to go shove it up his butt.

172
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.010
But he use worse language than that.
And he said,
I quit.

173
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.840
I'm not listening to his son.

174
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.870
And of course my mother didn't know how she was gonna feed the kids,

175
00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:53.690
but my father must've interviewed well cause within two weeks he always had

176
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:57.540
another job.
So there are gaps or k onward to being older.

177
00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.600
The lucky break as a young woman,

178
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.940
I was 21 years old being a waitress at the fort lead diner right above my house.

179
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:07.670
We thought it was a rich town.
Basically.
It wasn't,
it was middle class,

180
00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:10.670
but it looked Richard when we were sitting and I was at a,

181
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.990
at a counter when Ramon Simone looked in and of course this is in him and I

182
00:10:14.991 --> 00:10:15.711
don't have a picture of him,

183
00:10:15.711 --> 00:10:20.630
but he was as drop dead gorgeous as Johnny is a depth,
depth,
depth.
Okay.

184
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.990
Anyway,
he had these aviator navy blue sunglasses on.

185
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:27.410
You couldn't see his eyes had jet black slick hair.

186
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.560
He had dark olive skin and you had a real suit on other than my father,

187
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:34.730
I had never seen a man in a suit,
but this was an expensive suit.

188
00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:39.440
I could smell it,
I could feel it.
And not that I touched it,
but you just know.

189
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:43.490
You know,
one look at him.
I knew I'd be losing my virginity within the week

190
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.300
<v 1>and it was,
and ironically</v>

191
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.620
<v 0>it wasn't like I was saving it for anybody,
it's just nobody ever asked for it.</v>

192
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:52.950
<v 1>I was</v>

193
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.680
<v 0>competing with the blonde bombshell at the next counter.</v>

194
00:10:55.681 --> 00:11:00.570
Her name was Gloria and she had a gimmick that was my first real live marketing

195
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:05.310
gimmick and her gimmick was she would balance two coffee cups on each hand and

196
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.440
she had bosoms like a shoebox before.

197
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:09.180
I think they even had that surgery actually,

198
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.650
and she would balance to warn each breast and she would hit her way through the

199
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:15.390
double doors.
And I'm telling you,

200
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:19.590
the men at the Fort Lee diner waited in line on the concrete steps for an hour

201
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:22.230
to sit at her countable while I'm washing mine for the third time.

202
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.480
Unfair competition.

203
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.450
But lucky for me only the night before,
how timing makes a difference in life.

204
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:34.740
The night before I was with my mother and she was hanging the wash and now she's

205
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.200
trying to dish out that wash as fast as she could.

206
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.350
I'm standing there whining and complaining,
mom,
it's not fair.

207
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.510
Nick really should make people,
you know,
one from me,

208
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:45.780
one five she was getting so many tips union and my mother didn't like

209
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:46.621
complaining.
You're essentially,

210
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:50.180
why don't you just maybe break your hair but nice red ribbons to match your

211
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.450
little turtleneck that you were,

212
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:54.070
cause we had red tournaments and black pinafores.
That was the costume.

213
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.050
And she said,
just stay as sweet as you are.

214
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.520
And I told her that was a stupid idea because I was 21 mothers are stupid.

215
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.670
But of course when I got to the diner I did that with the rubber bands,

216
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:07.690
the red ribbons.
And I'm telling you,
I found that men like two kinds of women,

217
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.800
the hot tamale,

218
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:13.000
like this lady or they like the great white virgin either are very,

219
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.230
very innocent.
Okay.
And that I should have went with braids and everything.

220
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.790
Ramon Simone said,
a smart girl like me should really be living in the big city.

221
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.730
I'd grown up in Edgewater,
had never set foot in New York City.

222
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.810
It was a different universe.
It was a mental universe.
We called it the city.

223
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.890
No one ever went there.

224
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.140
And so ray moved me into the Barbizon hotel for women on Lexington Avenue,

225
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:39.130
which is now a,
I think it's an exercise place of some kind.
But anyway,

226
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:42.010
it only allowed women to stay there.
Most of them spinsters.

227
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.560
No men were allowed and he paid for a week.
Well,

228
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:47.200
now my mother definitely had me pegged as a prostitute.

229
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.810
She forbid me to go,

230
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:54.370
but I was 21 I told her I'm going anyway and off I huffed and was banned from

231
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:58.360
the house till I drop that terrible guy named Ramon Simone.
After a week,

232
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.610
Ramon Simone gave me a thousand pardon me,

233
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:05.380
$100 a thousand dollars a hundred dollars to buy myself a New York outfit.

234
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.350
The sounds like prostitution,
but I was so naive,
you know,

235
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.330
and I bought myself a lavender,

236
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.360
one stretch top stretch pants with buttons in a square.

237
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.750
Really Qube a lavender boots.
No,

238
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:20.260
I didn't have enough for a purse and I walked down Lexington Avenue and I knew I

239
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:23.590
would never ever leave New York.
It was that moment a week after I was done.

240
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:27.970
I was like,
this is for me.
I'm Georgy girl.
Cool.
You know,

241
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.360
that kind of thing.
And I never left New York.

242
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:35.260
I got a receptionist job for the Jif Mooney brothers and answered the phone 50

243
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.540
million times a day and one each.
A phony breads can we need to fully brothers.

244
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.740
I did that for a year and then Ramon Simone said,
you know,

245
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:45.940
you'd be great as a real estate broker.
He said,
you got such a good personality,

246
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.760
I'm going to give you $1,000.
Let's start a real estate business.

247
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.670
I wish I could take credit for the idea.
Said,
oh,
that was my dream,

248
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:56.020
wasn't my attitude on nouns.
Hey,
I've had 22 jobs so far,
why not try another one?

249
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.790
That was it.
Bang.
Give it a whirl.

250
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:03.130
And so we started the Corcoran Simone company with an accent on the Simone

251
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.690
because that was his last name.

252
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:09.691
And it was very fancy and after all he had explained to me his name was Ramon

253
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.390
Simone.
I pronounced it perfectly and he was from the Basque country,

254
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:16.360
which had to look up before the advent of the engineer.

255
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:19.170
You had to actually go to a book and look up Basque country.
Right,

256
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.600
and I found out that they were worries of some kind of spam.
Boy,

257
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:25.910
was that a turnoff that finished up my virginity right away.
Just that one.

258
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.710
Okay,
so where was I?
All right.
We started the Corcoran,
some own company,

259
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:36.460
which was a rental company and sublease space on 61st street off of Madison

260
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.520
Avenue,
owned by an accountant.
She bastard.
He raised our rent every month,

261
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.150
but who cares?
He gave us a break initially.
Okay.
Anyway,

262
00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:44.770
that was the beginning of the company.

263
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.520
We had 14 lovely rental agents.

264
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:51.100
Within seven years I felt on top of the world.

265
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.680
I was actually taking a salary check for the first time on the six year,

266
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.250
whatever it was.
It seemed like a lot at the time and I was thinking,

267
00:14:58.251 --> 00:14:59.840
life doesn't get any better than this.

268
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:03.080
I had moved in with Ramon Simone after I moved in with him.

269
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:05.890
He told me he had three daughters.
They moved in with us.
No problem.

270
00:15:05.891 --> 00:15:08.990
I'm good with kids.
Right.
Well surprise.

271
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:12.530
I also found out from his mother's Vicki that his name was knocked Ramon Simone.

272
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.990
It was ray Simon.
He ended the these

273
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.440
and he was from 150 fifth street,
so I'm like,
well,
there's marketing also.
Okay.

274
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.620
We built that little sales team.

275
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.890
There's a picture of the original team with their old fashioned haircuts and

276
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:28.521
stuff.
Okay.

277
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:33.200
On our first little retreat to brainstorm and then almost seven years to the

278
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:37.820
Itch,
Ramon,
Matt mentioned one night when I was dumping the pastor into the sink,

279
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:40.970
he said,
you know,
we have something serious to discuss.
Oh yes,
ray.

280
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:45.380
I looked up through the fog.
They how pretty.
I must look.
I was 29 and he said,

281
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.460
I'm going to marry your secretary,
Tina.
That bitch,

282
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.780
I didn't really say that,
but my head,
I said it.
You know what I mean?

283
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.550
I thought I was in somebody else's bed.

284
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:58.460
Dream like slow motion when you're in a car crash.
From what I hear,

285
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.960
like what her,
Tina?
No,
he goes,
yeah,

286
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.920
don't get upset.
We're madly in love.
We're going to get married.
He said,

287
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:08.450
and really take your time moving out.

288
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:10.790
It was out of there in about a minute with my toothbrush.

289
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.840
Moved on to my best friend and really my only friend because I worked so hard.

290
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:19.340
He didn't have friends.
Uh,
Kathy Gilson on east 79th street,
had a studio.

291
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.020
I just went right to her house and she let me in and I started living off her

292
00:16:24.021 --> 00:16:27.680
couch until I got my feet under me.
Now what happened after that?

293
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:30.600
I'm ashamed of because I was a pretty happy go lucky person.

294
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:34.610
I'm thinking relatively secure.
But somehow when that happened I had,

295
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.380
I felt like my whole insides are pulled out.
What a waste of energy.
After all,

296
00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:42.680
ray had found me in age order.
After all,
he believed in me.
He was my mentor,

297
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:46.670
he was my boyfriend.
He gave me a family I was very,
very,
very fond of is three,

298
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.080
three daughters.
Um,
we worked together.
I mean,
it was my whole world is really,

299
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:51.914
if you think about it,

300
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:57.220
but I made the mistaken conclusion that I was strong because of him and nothing

301
00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:01.250
good would have ever happened without him.
All right.

302
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:03.290
Because that's where I was at that juncture in my life.

303
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:07.790
I also had the ridiculous idea that had 29 I was old.

304
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.370
My Holy Shit,
nobody's going to marry me.
I'm 29 already

305
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.300
when most women,
especially in edge water,

306
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:20.650
all my sisters are married at each of their 18th birthday or within months of
it.

307
00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:23.270
Every girl in edge water was married in the early 18th birthday.

308
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.650
So already my parents will sweating it out on me.
I was a haggard old baby,

309
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:32.520
you know,
and I fell for it myself.
Okay.
But of course,
um,

310
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.920
it took me about a year going in and seeing ray and Tina,
I couldn't fire her.

311
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:39.650
He said because he was a 51% shareholder,
which was true.

312
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.430
And I didn't want to go in and see them.
And they were married in three months.

313
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:45.260
So it was really true love.
And they have three kids together.

314
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:48.950
It was really meant to be and are things all happened like that,
but for me,

315
00:17:48.951 --> 00:17:53.770
I was too naive or too stupid to see it for what it was just meant to be.

316
00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:57.870
It's the way life is.
Right.
Okay.
So it took me a year to get my feet under me.

317
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.280
I pretended for a year,
but when I finally one day somehow got brittle.

318
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.620
I Dunno what clicked.
I can't even tell you what it was.

319
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.620
But I'm marched in on a Friday morning.
I said,
you know,
Ramon,

320
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:11.010
and this is what we're going to do.
We're going to divide this business.
That's,

321
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.700
oh,
that way.
I'm not that bad looking.
Can I go back 29?

322
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:18.270
My face was still full.
I had no facial hair.
Then.

323
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.770
There we go.
So I went in and I said,

324
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.470
we're going to chop up this business just like a football draw.

325
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:29.250
This is my daughter Kate,
but that's what she was six.
She's already nine.
Anyway.

326
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.240
Um,
but it's such a cute picture and I want to show off.
Okay.
All right.
I said,

327
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:36.110
we're going to chop up this business rate today like a football jersey.

328
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.800
We're going to take the accounts that we have between receivables and what we

329
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:41.910
actually had in the account.

330
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.630
We had a little bit sure to 70,000 I remember I said we're going to chop it up

331
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.130
35 for you,
35 from me of the cash portion and the receivables.

332
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.850
You get to pick the first person.
We have seven.
We had 14 people,

333
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:57.240
seven 40 do we have 14 year?
Fortunately we have 14 people.

334
00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:59.220
You get to pick the first person.
I'll pick the second.

335
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:03.180
You go first and then you could decide if you want to stay here or go and

336
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:05.460
whether you want the phone number.
We had a great phone number.

337
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.390
I didn't want to lose a phone number,
but you decide,
okay,
you decide,

338
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.160
but we're ending it today.
He couldn't believe it,

339
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.140
but within a minute he picked Norma Hirsch,
the top producers,
60% of my income.

340
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:20.400
I picked Esther Kaplan like a camel produces steady as she goes.

341
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:23.760
You know what I mean?
And Chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop.

342
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.180
I collected my seven people together.
I put them in the corner of the office.

343
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:30.620
I said,
guess what?
Good News.
Monday,
we're moving our quickly over the weekend.

344
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.440
Give you the new,
just woo.
Yeah,
we're moving on Monday.

345
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:38.190
I didn't tell them the others were moving with us,
you know,
and I said,

346
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.990
come back for work on Monday morning,

347
00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:41.490
but I'll give you the address over the weekend.

348
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:46.050
I went to my existing landlord on third avenue and 58th street and I got the

349
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:50.420
exact same office,
two floors higher than rate eight nine three floors high.

350
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.050
He was on eight I got 11 I got to for 20% cheaper.
Now,

351
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:58.530
that to me sounded like God's will that I was getting a lucky break,

352
00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:59.820
but guess what?
It really wasn't.

353
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:03.180
What it meant was the real estate market was about to crash because the

354
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:05.760
commercial sector of the market always goes before the residential,

355
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:09.330
but I didn't know that then and I should have had it.
Be careful,
be careful,

356
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:11.940
be careful,
but I didn't hear that in those days.

357
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:14.040
You could take a cab down to 42nd street,

358
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.490
you could buy all your desks right on the street and the guys would physically

359
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:21.660
run them up to your office and put them together.
You could order the telephone.

360
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.850
Ma Bell was a big,
big deal in town.

361
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:27.030
You could order a telephone on a Friday having stolen Saturday morning.

362
00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:30.510
That's what I did.
And one day morning came,
we had desks,

363
00:20:30.511 --> 00:20:33.330
chairs in a phone or what do you need in the real estate business?
Just people.

364
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:36.870
And they moved into that ass and they sat down and we were in business.
Bang.

365
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.150
I decided to call the company the Corcoran Group,

366
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:40.320
cause I figured if I was going to make it,

367
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:41.880
I was going to need the help of the group.

368
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.770
And that was the beginning of the Corcoran group when I left the door that day,

369
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.500
uh,
when we ended that business,
because ray rightfully,

370
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:54.700
I think now in hindsight was angry.
I was like,
Hey,
he getting hit broadside.
Okay.

371
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.510
Uh,
but ray gave me the gift of a lifetime.
He said to me,
you know,
Barbara,

372
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:02.590
you will never succeed without me.
And you know what if he had said,

373
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.050
you know Barbara,
you're amazing.
I'm sure you'll do fine.

374
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.750
I don't believe I would have stayed in business in the tough times.

375
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.960
It was my sheer ego of that insult that Burns so deep in my soul that went,

376
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.030
all the chips are down.
I thought I had tried everything in the world,

377
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.040
every that I could possibly think to stay in business,

378
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:20.560
highly leveraged because real estate goes up and down and up and down.

379
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:23.230
I was always leveraged cause I was always greedy about where I wanted to go.

380
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.420
But I would think of those words and son of a gun,
I would think one new thing.

381
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.140
And that one new thing was always the thing that got me through.

382
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.900
So he really gave me a gift.
Thank you.

383
00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:39.901
And of course he was wrong cause I sold my business maybe 22 years later for 66

384
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.420
million now for the next part.
Okay.
All right.

385
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.710
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

386
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.340
<v 0>well this one isn't on my slide so we'll see where we're going.</v>

387
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.200
Now I'm a shark.
I can read the damn thing.
There we go.
Now I'm a shark.

388
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.750
And that's the shark tank set.

389
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:07.110
I got the shark tank Gig as a result of handling rejection as I do so well.

390
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.500
Very well.
Yet again,

391
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.530
everything good in my life always happened on the heels of rejection.

392
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.750
And so when I was hired to do shark tank,

393
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:16.840
I signed the contract without even reading it,
sent it back to Mark Burnett,

394
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.740
Mark Burnett,
a file,
famous produce.
I'm going to Hollywood.

395
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:23.020
I'm going to see the Hollywood on the hill sign.
I'm like,

396
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.830
I bought three new outfits to sign autographs.
I'm going to be famous.
Oh my God.

397
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:28.210
Oh my God.
I was so excited.

398
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.930
And then only four days before I was supposed to fly out to la,

399
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:34.540
I got the dreaded phone call.
I'm sorry we hired somebody else.

400
00:22:34.541 --> 00:22:38.440
We changed your mind.
All right.
And that's when I wrote the email.

401
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.730
Thank God standing up for myself with the help of everyone in my office who's

402
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.331
actually here.

403
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:47.300
And let me not forget to introduce them somewhere in the dark in a minute.
Um,

404
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.740
I wrote the email to Mark Burnett telling him I considered his rejection,

405
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:51.451
a lucky charm,

406
00:22:51.451 --> 00:22:54.160
cited all the negative things that happened in my life and how they turned

407
00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:56.980
around to be the best possible things.
And enter the email is saying,

408
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.220
I suggest you in by both girls out to compete for the lone female seat and I'll

409
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:06.790
pay for my own plate plane fare and I'll be on that plane.
And when he read that,

410
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:10.930
his comment to his secretary of the secretary of the secretary that was standing

411
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:14.800
there,
she told it Shariece I think it was a name,
she said,
all he said is,
God,

412
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:19.780
she's a shark.
And invited me out.
Thank God if not for that email,

413
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:20.980
I would not have gotten that.

414
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:25.630
I would not have met any of the entrepreneurs that I do like my own children

415
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.680
when they're making money

416
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.320
and even the bad ones when they're not making my kind of like him too.
Okay.
Uh,

417
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.630
but I thought it might be very interesting for you to hear,
uh,

418
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.060
what I believe makes for a successful entrepreneur.
All right on there.

419
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.100
My original group from season one and two.
Um,

420
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.920
maybe you recognize some of those people.

421
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:48.230
My favorite of course is the two guys at the top,

422
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.300
especially the one on your left saving.
He's so God damn sexy.

423
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:57.080
I can't even talk to them without breathing heavy.
Okay.
All right.

424
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:59.970
Number one trait.
Uh,

425
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.950
probably in descending order or at least the first few of the key persistence,

426
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.690
the inability to quit.

427
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.420
Every one of my entrepreneurs that are hugely successful have that in spades.

428
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.940
I don't know where to get it.
Or you're born with and you develop it.

429
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:17.630
Do you do it from the school of hard knocks?
I Dunno how you get it,

430
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.480
but I know one thing for sure is investor.
If you don't have it,

431
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.120
you're not going to succeed.
You can have everything else,

432
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.710
but if you don't have that low Iq that when someone's slams you on the head,

433
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:31.930
you go down and then you bounce up and go,
I'm going to ask some Donald backup.

434
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.040
Hit me again.
It's like a weird thing

435
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.990
that kind of a thing that goes on.

436
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.350
The ability to handle a hard hit is key.

437
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.740
And I have been able to separate early on now my investments very quickly on one

438
00:24:48.351 --> 00:24:51.620
little thing that happens in the minute I see it happened,
I'm like,
Oh God,

439
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:52.580
I'm going to lose my money.

440
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.030
And as cold feeling sorry for yourself when I'm talking to one of my

441
00:24:56.031 --> 00:24:57.770
entrepreneurs will say we did the due diligence,

442
00:24:57.771 --> 00:25:00.440
we sign up the deal and working with them now for two to three months and

443
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:02.390
something really bad happens.
A disappointment.

444
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.340
If they start doing a oh poor me like Oh God,
Oh my God that wasn't fair.

445
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:10.520
You know she wrote I on the book,
the minute I hear that talk,

446
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:14.420
I know I'm gonna lose my money because the difference between the really great

447
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:15.820
entrepreneurs and everyone else's,

448
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.280
how long they take to feel sorry for themselves.
I really believe that.

449
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.280
And so if you're the type that just boom and like oh shit that shouldn't have ha

450
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.150
what and keep working,
you're going to do well as an entrepreneur.

451
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.840
Persistence to tell you her story by way of illustration,

452
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.330
daisy was selling 200 cakes.

453
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.010
I believe I might be off on my numbers cause I always make some hops around
them.

454
00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:35.844
Out Mountain your own head.

455
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.770
200 cakes on shark type before she appeared on shark tank.
Boom.

456
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.280
Every guy in America fell in love with her.
She was a girl next door.

457
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.540
Every guy ordered a cake but website crash.
She was out of business.

458
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.700
She was out of business.
But what did daisy do?

459
00:25:49.701 --> 00:25:52.880
She's smart enough to pick up the fall and say here's what I'm doing.

460
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:53.770
And I got wonderful.

461
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.940
She doesn't mind me imitating he has wanted to do and I got one full on here.

462
00:25:57.941 --> 00:26:00.280
Now I'm going to afford that phone line.

463
00:26:00.281 --> 00:26:02.380
And this was a message when she knew I wouldn't pick a,

464
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.940
I'm going to follow that fall onto your phone line in New York and you get a

465
00:26:06.941 --> 00:26:09.610
bunch of girls.
It's sal at me and start taking cake orders

466
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.030
and that's exactly what we did.

467
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.950
Three good actresses it Santa Hello is this daisy cakes?
Each show is,

468
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.330
what did she do?
Okay,
she's amazing.

469
00:26:21.331 --> 00:26:23.640
She has over a million dollars in sales and cakes.
Okay.

470
00:26:23.641 --> 00:26:28.410
If I had to say one trait that I've seen in this lady over and over again is she

471
00:26:28.411 --> 00:26:31.590
knows how to get hit hard and make a lot of bed business judgements,

472
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.350
but I don't really care about them cause I know she's going to come back up.

473
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.160
Persistence.
Okay.
Cousins,
Maine lobster,
you already decided for you?

474
00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:41.730
My handsome Hong Kong,
the right when I come back in to pray to God.

475
00:26:41.731 --> 00:26:43.710
Let me be born as wife

476
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.130
and if he's not available I'll take gym.

477
00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

478
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.540
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
cousins,
Maine lobster,
when they were on shark tank,</v>

479
00:26:53.541 --> 00:26:54.860
they were in business three months.

480
00:26:54.861 --> 00:26:57.470
They had great trade as they are street smart.
Again,

481
00:26:57.471 --> 00:27:00.650
common to all my great entrepreneurs.
But I'll give you a story to illustrate it.

482
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:04.040
Um,
they were selling lobsters out of a food truck.
Bang.

483
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.910
They were in the food truck.
Uh,
they had three months of sales.

484
00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.540
They were so well prepared that they had listened to four seasons of shark tank

485
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:15.230
had written down every question,
any entrepreneur I had ever been asked.

486
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.330
And they came up with two answers.

487
00:27:17.331 --> 00:27:19.340
If they got asked [inaudible] they were practiced.

488
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.010
They were so smooth on the set.
I thought their business for 10 years,

489
00:27:22.011 --> 00:27:24.920
not a single sharks,
they'd,
they'd say our monthly sales are,

490
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:29.090
they never said how long you've been in business.
They never said it.
No one has.

491
00:27:29.091 --> 00:27:30.860
There is that savvy on their feet.

492
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.250
I was lucky shark that won that competition to get them.

493
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.200
They grew their one food trucks to 10 food trucks.
They just opened a restaurant.

494
00:27:39.201 --> 00:27:41.150
They're making money hand over fist already.

495
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:45.170
They also opened an online cousins being lops and direct a lobsters right to

496
00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:46.640
your door,
that kind of thing.
Anywhere.

497
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.860
A very important part of shark tank to illustrate them in action is something we

498
00:27:51.861 --> 00:27:54.650
call updates.
When you have a successful entrepreneur,

499
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.980
the show likes to come back and do an update on the,
hey,
what's happening?

500
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.470
And the viewers at home really like that part of the show.

501
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.050
When I pitched shark tank,
oh listen,

502
00:28:03.051 --> 00:28:06.330
they're getting an award from the governor's office in Maine,
uh,

503
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.490
for creating 50 new jobs in the state.
It's a worst economy of all the states,

504
00:28:10.491 --> 00:28:15.350
the worst job market.
They are,
they are.
You want to shoot it?
Yeah,
we love it.

505
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.410
And then I call the governor's office.
Hey,
shark tank once a chute,

506
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.830
they want you to give them an award for 15 years

507
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.773
<v 1>jobs.</v>

508
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.000
<v 0>Okay,
but here's what he has.
What went awry.
Okay.
Uh,</v>

509
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.740
a day before they said,
we're not only going to shoot them on the dock,

510
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:37.890
we're going to come and shoot them with the governor.
We're going to do two part.

511
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:41.190
The first two part update they ever did.
Whoever.
I had a two parts.

512
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.360
We had the two parts come from.

513
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.780
The second part is we're going to go to the factory and shoot the 50 people.

514
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.060
Hi cousins.
How many friends do you have in Maine

515
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.880
and how quickly can you get chef hats with cousins and bright red printed?

516
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.840
So your brand is branded on TV.
I don't know.
We'll do our best.

517
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.620
They had 50 custommade chef hats within 24 hours.

518
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.030
50 employees of sorts in their factory smiling.

519
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.750
But when the executive,
not,
not when the field producer walked in,

520
00:29:10.751 --> 00:29:12.280
a little tighten of a guy walked in,

521
00:29:12.281 --> 00:29:17.281
he saw all these happy workers with big hats on which I blew garbage bags

522
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.960
individually to puff them up.
We're all standing,

523
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.250
here's the workers and when he walked in,
he goes,
great,

524
00:29:24.251 --> 00:29:28.690
but the chef has to have to go there just too much and saving my loverboy here.

525
00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.070
Cooley turns around and says,
you know,
he said,
unfortunately,

526
00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:35.860
we never let our chefs work without them as company policy

527
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.733
<v 1>and the</v>

528
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.160
<v 0>the guy rolled right off.
I'll go,
okay,</v>

529
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.660
what was most important in this update is every shot of them had the brand in
it.

530
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.710
And what do you think happened to their brand new website that had no sales?

531
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:55.540
It exploded with business.
All right,
fast on your feet,
smart on your feet,

532
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.510
not the kind of stuff you get when you pay all that money for Harvard Mba,

533
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:01.060
street smarts,
street smarts.
How do you get out of the,

534
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.160
how do you finagle and how do you do a fast key quality?

535
00:30:04.161 --> 00:30:08.290
In my entrepreneur next,
Tom and she,
when I met Tom and Chee,

536
00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:12.460
they were had just come out of selling their grilled cheese on donuts out of

537
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:17.080
attendance.
Cincinnati.
All right.
What was so interesting about them?
However,

538
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.050
they weren't talking about a 10 they were talking about a franchise of hundreds

539
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:24.250
of franchise.
Sell Him.
She's a donuts.
Okay.
All right.

540
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:26.590
What do you think happened?

541
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.410
They told me about they're going to have an amusement park one day,

542
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:32.560
a Tom and chee amusement park.
I'm like,
okay.
They're definitely on dope.

543
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.690
All right,
but I don't think so anymore.
I can't wait to go to the museum park.

544
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.530
They have 171 franchise across America.
Exactly what they envisioned.

545
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.340
They got exactly the picture in great detail where they're going to do it,

546
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.710
how they're going to go to the other side of the river in Cincinnati,

547
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:49.570
which is another state.
I forget which one it is,

548
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.170
how they're going to come across back,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I'm like,
okay,

549
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.300
well guess what?
I should have believed them.
Okay.

550
00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:00.430
They have big pictures in their head and every entrepreneur might not have a

551
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:01.990
business plan with everything.
In fact,

552
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:04.270
none of the really do I think the grossly overrated,

553
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.090
but they sure have a movie in their head of who they're going to be when they

554
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:10.390
grow up.
Right.
And when they can't express that movie on Shark Tank,

555
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.330
I'm always out Vikki they don't see it.

556
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.820
How am I going to see it and believe it and they're not going to get their

557
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.220
visual big picture.

558
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.210
I don't know if fleet would deserves to be here because he's still not making me

559
00:31:22.211 --> 00:31:23.044
any money,

560
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.550
but he is a big visionary thinker and he's always pissing away my money on his

561
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:28.384
ideas.

562
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.980
But I have to say I got to stay with them here because I'm going to contract

563
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:37.820
with mostly and I also love him and his own bed child kind of way,
but whatever.

564
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.180
Let me move on.
Okay,
next.
I'm so,

565
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.220
I have a hard time being a phony baloney.
Okay.
What does it say?
Sales ability?

566
00:31:45.221 --> 00:31:48.940
Yes,
definitely Tom and Chee Harlem,
New York.
They originally in Brooklyn,

567
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:50.980
moved to Harlem in New York under the train tracks.

568
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.870
Interesting view of their business.
You go there,
you can't hear each other uhmm

569
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.750
but they have the happiest bakery do a pip corn.
What's pip corn?

570
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.590
Small kernels of popcorn that doesn't upset your stomach if you have any kind of

571
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:07.340
food allergies,
lactose,
blah,
blah,
blah,

572
00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:10.360
all that stuff and it doesn't get caught in your teeth and it's delicious.

573
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.180
They discovered pip corn because Jen had a stomach problem.

574
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.400
Brother and sister team Jen is probably the most charismatic person I've ever

575
00:32:18.401 --> 00:32:19.031
met in my life.

576
00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:22.600
She walks into whole foods and everybody's crawling up to dine at touch her.

577
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.950
She's got charisma.

578
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:29.050
She sells that popcorn to anybody and everybody and they keep coming back for

579
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:32.360
more.
What does a great brother do?
And he's a finance guy named Ian Union Union.

580
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:37.150
Ina Lena,
Lena,
Lena.
Lena.
Couldn't be better partners.
And what does he do?

581
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:41.300
He even goes out and marries a financial,
uh,
what?
What an investment banker,

582
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.390
another Bree and her into the business.
What does Jen do?

583
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.840
She hires a best friend to run the factory.
What does that lady do?

584
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.500
She knows how to make those popcorn popper so happy.

585
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.420
Amazing.
But she's selling every minute of the day.
No matter who shit.

586
00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.440
It's natural to her.
Phenomenal sales ability.
Charisma.
Another one,

587
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:01.730
hold your heart.
Just same thing.

588
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:05.150
These girls tell you you should buy their pants for fat girls acids and I'm

589
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:08.060
telling you I'm going to buy two Paris because they just,

590
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:13.350
how you got to have holiday honches you got to buy in.

591
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:16.430
No one do.
They have $1 million a sale by year two in shark tank.

592
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:20.810
One of the best success stories.
Next risk tolerant.
Great Trade.
Okay.

593
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:25.020
This guy bought into him because he looks just like a pig.
Do you know how?
No.

594
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.790
In a good way.
All right.
Talk Bowel barbecue sauce.
Think about it.

595
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:31.640
Anybody old enough in this room to remember that guy who used to sell chicken,

596
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:34.430
so there's like a chicken.
Frank Perdue looked exactly like a chicken.

597
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.020
I saw this guy go,
he's a new frank Perdue,
but he's a pig.
Okay,

598
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.110
what's great about no,
and he doesn't even mind it.

599
00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:44.540
He thinks he knows for what it is.
Okay,
and he's married.

600
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:46.430
He's more secure now with two kids.
All right.

601
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.940
But when he was single then even then he accepted it.

602
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.310
What's great about them is their risk tolerance.
When I say risk tower,

603
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:54.260
and I believe this,
they,

604
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.680
when their business was young and they had a buy shelves and shelves in the

605
00:33:57.681 --> 00:34:00.680
stores is no way to get those shelves unless you paying for them.

606
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.630
They had a vision of a giant business.

607
00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:06.740
They went out and they raised like 800,000 maybe I did less.

608
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.150
Maybe it was one,
two.

609
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:13.330
They made it like $800,000 when they could barely stay in business and they blew

610
00:34:14.421 --> 00:34:16.970
it all.
I'm more shelf space.
They can go for broke.

611
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.250
They're not the least bit bothered.
And their attorneys,

612
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:21.980
their Washington DC attorneys when they decided to go with this business,

613
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.840
quite an unusual thing.
Competitive.
If I tell Jim from cousins,

614
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:28.160
Maine Lobster,
I don't have his picture here,

615
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:29.630
but you know I talked about him before.

616
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:34.460
If I tell him one little thing about the guy he used to compete with on the

617
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:35.294
hockey team.

618
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.830
Jim was a semi professional hockey player and had some injury or something in

619
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:42.410
the minor leagues,
if I'm telling that right,
but anyway,

620
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.200
his arch enemy on the other team was a guy named Luke.

621
00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:46.011
What do you think happened?

622
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:49.220
Luke's for main gyms for me and Luke went into the lobster business.

623
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.250
All I have to do to double sales and say,
Hey gee,
here,

624
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:56.270
Luke opening another restaurant.
Talk about competitive spirit.

625
00:34:56.271 --> 00:34:58.910
He's ready to kill.
He doesn't stop working.

626
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.820
He hates the idea that somebody might beat him at a game.

627
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.820
It says DNA and his partner savings the same way.

628
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.860
All I have to do is tell grace and lace who makes beautiful lacy socks and

629
00:35:09.861 --> 00:35:14.690
shawls and I my most successful business by foreign terms of making money and

630
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:17.750
what do I have to do to get them going?
Hardly anything.
Well,
I got to do is I,

631
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:21.360
God got a big check from a cousins today,
but you know,

632
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.460
I'll get a check from her like within the week,
a bigger check.

633
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.600
They're winning when it was successful.
Why I didn't say compete with my mother.

634
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.430
That's the way they weren't competitive.

635
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:34.010
You get an entrepreneur who doesn't feel the heat of competition.

636
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.680
He's not going to be good on his feet.

637
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.750
She's not going to come to the fore when she really needs it.

638
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.380
That competitive spirit drives you through all the things that don't make any

639
00:35:43.381 --> 00:35:47.120
common sense in life.
That's what it does.
Okay?
They're my entrepreneur.

640
00:35:47.121 --> 00:35:49.940
Isn't my house in Utah that we just did an update on a facade?

641
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.640
Let me tell you the great thing that I find about working with these people.

642
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:57.360
This is a repeat of what I did at the Corcoran group.
I hired people.

643
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.320
I developed talent.
I love my people to death.
I spoiled him rotten.

644
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.380
I tried to make them the best they could be and I enjoyed every single second of

645
00:36:07.021 --> 00:36:11.130
it.
My greatest satisfaction work with these UNPRI entrepreneurs.
The good ones,

646
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.680
not the bad ones that take your money in the night,
okay?
The good ones is there.

647
00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:21.480
My salespeople all over again.
They are phenomenally successful.
Now,

648
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.510
what are the sharks really liked?
With three minutes and 44 seconds left.

649
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:27.690
I could tell I'm talking too much.
I'll give you the low down.
Okay.

650
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.010
What's Kevin O'leary like?
Okay.
Everybody thinks he's a mean guy.

651
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:34.890
He's the pusher over the show in real life.
He's a pushover.

652
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.590
When his wife walks onto the set,
you could visibly see him shaking on his knees.

653
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.090
<v 1>I'm not making that up,</v>

654
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.000
<v 0>okay?
He,</v>

655
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.490
he fancies himself a very big consortia and doesn't have the common sense to

656
00:36:46.491 --> 00:36:50.840
know,
know the label.
O'Leary wines is not a good fit for wine.

657
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.090
All right?
Whatever.
Okay,
I'll Kevin's game for anything on the show.

658
00:36:56.091 --> 00:37:00.860
He'll pose,
he'll do anything.
He,
we have more weird pictures of Kevin.

659
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.480
Okay.
But he's an absolute sweetheart.

660
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.560
I'm only going to tell you the first half of the story.

661
00:37:08.561 --> 00:37:10.510
You could use your imagination on the second.

662
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:14.710
Kevin is never ready to leave the set at the end of a long 10 hour day and it's

663
00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:15.790
a long day.
Trust me.

664
00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:19.150
It's like being in a army pick all day with a bunch of people.
All right?

665
00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:23.050
So to get him to change and calm,
I ripped his pants down.

666
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.250
I saw us behind.
And you use imagination on the front.
It wasn't much.

667
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

668
00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:33.670
<v 0>What's Robert Hirsch Avec really like?
He definitely is gay and should come out</v>

669
00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.160
<v 1>okay.</v>

670
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.240
<v 0>Constantly tell him.</v>

671
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:43.440
But what's great about Robert is he's a show and a half within the show.

672
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.070
We all go out there,
bring two dresses.
You have to wear the same clothes,

673
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.540
bring two identical dresses.

674
00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:51.170
I fell for that the first three years until I realized I was painful.
No,

675
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.370
I'm bringing one dress and let's hope it lasts.
Okay.

676
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.050
Robert brings racks of 50 suits,
50 shirts,
50 cufflinks,

677
00:37:58.051 --> 00:37:59.040
different color ties.

678
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:01.830
And then you've got to do the Robert Ritual on the first day of filming.

679
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.220
Do you like this?
Tie the shirt.
What do you think about this shirt?

680
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.020
Just put on the fucking shit.

681
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.633
<v 1>Wow.</v>

682
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.260
<v 0>Robert,
please come out.
You'd be such a happy man.</v>

683
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.280
He's always kissing men.
I've never seen him kiss women.

684
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.710
I put that in simply because I look young.

685
00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:23.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

686
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.110
<v 0>I put that in cause I thought I looked better than Lori.</v>

687
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.090
<v 1>Oh,
oh yeah.</v>

688
00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.790
<v 0>What's Laurie like?
Laurie's all about hair.</v>

689
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:37.510
It's unfair.
I get one minute my hair,
Laurie gets two hours.
Okay.

690
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:42.160
Laurie is about her hair all the time.
Her hair,
her hair,

691
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.790
let it go,
Lori.
But Lori's great credit.

692
00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.670
She's the best merchandise around the whole set.

693
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.870
She gets a product that she likes.
She's gonna Slam it home.
She's a gorilla.

694
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.110
I can't compete with her in that.
None of the men could compete with us.

695
00:38:56.111 --> 00:38:56.944
She's phenomenal.

696
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.640
And she has our single best success to date in terms of quick money.

697
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.350
I went on the long term money,

698
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:06.310
but she's waiting on the quick money Scrub Daddy Damon Damon's hysterical.

699
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.151
It's a shame.

700
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:10.120
They edit all of Damon's comments out cause we'd be a much better show.

701
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.290
He's filthy.

702
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.950
But he comes across rather stayed on the show.
I think I'm like,

703
00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:21.130
that sounds Damon.
They edit all the good stuff that he is a chick magnet.

704
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.030
You walk into any place that Damien,
500 women are surrounding you.

705
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.660
I almost get stampeded.
Hey,
there's something about him.

706
00:39:28.661 --> 00:39:30.400
I think it's the way he uses his hands.

707
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.230
So cause I get turned on by that a little.
He's such as smoochy.

708
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:39.630
So I airbrush my face there.
What's Mark Cuban like?

709
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.710
He's filthy rich.
That's what's wrong with them.

710
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.710
I've learned that there's a huge difference between a millionaire and a

711
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:48.930
billionaire.
Okay.
He basically does it for sport.
Mark.

712
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.500
I'll be in the makeup chair the next morning.

713
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.800
I can't believe you plunk down $1 million on that guy and gave him a $400,000

714
00:39:55.801 --> 00:39:58.420
salary.
He said,
you know,
I got to keep the guys busy bar.

715
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.570
He gets grumpy.
You got to loosen this guy up.
Okay.

716
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:10.810
But he's the smartest shark in my opinion,
across many levels.

717
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:14.230
I think he's got such a wide range of smartness in so many areas.
Okay.

718
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.390
And when he's wrong,
he's smart enough.
Never to admit it.

719
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:20.170
I've lost my most money with mark.
Okay.

720
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.360
Behind the scenes of shark tank.
I'll just click through them.

721
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:24.460
We get famous people on the set.
It's a blast.

722
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:28.750
They make us wear all kinds of crap.
Okay.
Oh,
this is automatic.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

723
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:32.800
Okay.
Uh,
you know,
he'd go struck crazy on that set one pitch looks like another.

724
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:37.450
Okay.
All right.
Um,
they got props Galore.
Okay.

725
00:40:37.451 --> 00:40:41.110
On and on.
They married Kevin and I twice now.
It's ridiculous.
Okay.

726
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.670
Kevin loves stuff on his face or anything.
He'll wear it.
There's Damon.

727
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:48.160
I think that's a repeat.
Right?
Okay.
Dusting his head.

728
00:40:48.161 --> 00:40:51.760
How many times a day does his hair get dusted with powder?
Mr. Wonderful.

729
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.540
500 okay.
People love to imitate him.
Damon.

730
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:58.600
That was an outfit they said to him,
you can't wear that.
No,
you can't wear that.

731
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.550
He goes to wet to weigh out on his clothes.
Okay.
All right.
Side benefits.

732
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.190
You get preferential treatment.
Now I get the best tables.

733
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:10.210
My assistant Gail calls,
we always get a table.
Even if they're full guys.

734
00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:12.040
I gave them my doll to this rock star.

735
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:14.740
I still don't know his name and he took her home.
He's been sleeping with her.

736
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.160
That gives me a thrill.
That's the executive producer.

737
00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:21.190
That's his child that was born in year ones.
Now six year old.
That guy with the,

738
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:24.470
for the most important guide because he's in charge of light lighting.

739
00:41:24.471 --> 00:41:27.880
I mean they're going to look good or bad based on him.
These are updates.

740
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:31.420
They're thrilling to do.
Updates are more exciting to do.

741
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:36.470
The opening shots of shots with the jets.
It's like,
wow,
I'm somebody cool man.

742
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:41.270
I'm cool.
Red Carpets,
people flashing at you.
Oh yeah,

743
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:43.850
I'm cool,
I'm cool.
And all that kind of stuff.
Okay.

744
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:46.940
Shooting the updates with the entrepreneurs is fabulous.

745
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:48.110
That's at my beach house.

746
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:52.340
We did an update there before we did the ski one a shooting or shooting them run

747
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:54.050
around the county.
My youngest entrepreneur,

748
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:57.560
he's only eight now he's 12 I picked send my dollar round.

749
00:41:57.561 --> 00:42:00.740
You saw that doll when I can't show up.
That's my pig guy.
Now he's married.

750
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:03.550
That's a good pig.
Pig.
Pig.
Pig,
pig.
Okay.

751
00:42:03.551 --> 00:42:05.870
It gets even those guys a double kiss

752
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.390
daisy cakes,
grace and lace Grayson,

753
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.420
lace Grayson lays opening orphanages in India.
Two of them in their first year.

754
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:18.980
They're making that much money and there's my team and an answer to the final

755
00:42:18.981 --> 00:42:21.230
question.
Do we like each other?
Yes.

756
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.600
You have to spend that much time with somebody.

757
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:24.830
You're going to wind up either hate them.

758
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:28.310
I liked them and we really like each other and respect each other and that's it.

759
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.230
And I went over 40 seconds.

760
00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:40.350
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

761
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.550
<v 0>we only have to take 40 seconds.
I was a question answer.</v>

762
00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:47.780
So what questions do you have?

763
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.610
Anything and the bravest person always raises a hand first.
This guy,
oh,

764
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:55.550
you're popping up.
Is that how you dress for work by the way?

765
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.090
I don't mind.
I'm just curious.
Really.
It's,
I like the work.

766
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.070
<v 3>Um,
I think this is even below Google.</v>

767
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.590
<v 0>I would agree with that and I don't even know Google.</v>

768
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:09.970
<v 3>Um,
I just want to say full sit.
First of all.
That's phenomenal.
Thank you.</v>

769
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.850
Especially the entrance.

770
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.430
I think that was like the best entrance that anyone's made.

771
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.660
<v 0>I you a schmoozer</v>

772
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.540
<v 3>no,
it was good.
If it sucked,
it sucked,</v>

773
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:21.800
I would tell you.
Yeah.
You know what?

774
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:24.950
I predict you're going to be the head of this organization by kissing ass

775
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.580
made.
Maybe if I dress better.
Uh,
but,
um,
I was wondering,

776
00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.100
I see the show have seen it like my parents love it.

777
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.600
I notice a lot of stuff gets edited out.
The parents love it today.
Thank you.

778
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:43.710
They're so excited that I'm here.
It's kind of funny.
Um,

779
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.040
they,
I noticed that a lot of stuff gets edited out or like there are a lot of,

780
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.730
a lot of jumps and I'm wondering like what gets edited out,
you know,
like,

781
00:43:52.731 --> 00:43:54.890
do they actually tell you more?
I mean,

782
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:57.440
they must tell you more than what they show the viewers.

783
00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.260
You don't just make a decision off of like,
oh,
hey,
you know,

784
00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.750
<v 0>um,
well,
three minutes.
No.
All right.
The reality is,</v>

785
00:44:03.751 --> 00:44:07.680
is a typical pitch is 45 minutes to an hour and a half when you're sitting at

786
00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:12.390
home,
it's six minutes.
All right?
A good editor tries to eliminate those jumps.

787
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.520
Very,
very hard to do.
Okay?
Uh,

788
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.790
we know nothing about the entrepreneur when they walked through that fake tunnel

789
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:21.210
with the fake sharks.
Okay?
We know nothing.
All right.

790
00:44:21.211 --> 00:44:25.140
And we are expected to make a deal on the set was very little knowledge other

791
00:44:25.141 --> 00:44:26.250
than what they represent.

792
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:31.800
But what the entrepreneur is also made to do prior to appearing on shark is to

793
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:35.730
assign extensive documents saying that they know it's not a real deal.

794
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.350
If we choose not to close,
roughly I'd say 65% of the deals close.

795
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:43.170
I really don't know that as a fact,
but my sense of it is close.
I'm sure.

796
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.520
And I know that's true of me.
I close about 60% of what you'll see me.
I'm in,

797
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.820
you know,
of course things go awry when you do the deal with diligence.

798
00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:54.480
Not that people lie,
but they're under pressure.
It's TV,
it's alive,

799
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:58.000
not professional actors and actresses and like the,
the,

800
00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.950
the patent that they definitely have really zoned by the brother-in-law,

801
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:07.050
you know,
things go a little loosey Goosey.
Okay.
And so they added a lot out.

802
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.620
Uh,
but also add on to that,
it's owned by Disney world.

803
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.640
Disney is the parent company and they want it clean.
Okay.

804
00:45:14.641 --> 00:45:19.300
So my great line for the two women that had the motorcycle jackets,
uh,

805
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.920
and I had a terrible name.
The first thing I said is,
hey girls,

806
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:24.540
you got to name this dykes on bikes.

807
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.410
And I couldn't wait to see that episode when I sound like that was genius.

808
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:29.390
Barbara date somebody

809
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.273
<v 1>so memorable.</v>

810
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:34.060
<v 0>Well the men on the set,
it's like,
yeah,
that's great.
I love it.</v>

811
00:45:34.061 --> 00:45:36.100
I love it and never made air.
Okay.

812
00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:40.940
So a lot of that risque stuff has to come out.
Okay.
Including Damon's jokes.

813
00:45:40.941 --> 00:45:44.480
Sadly because he's a stoical they'd never make year.

814
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.010
And so did I answer your question?
I think.
And what's your name?

815
00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:49.390
Cause you should be ashamed of yourself.

816
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:58.330
What's your name and what's your last name?
I want to remember.
It's Al Nagee.

817
00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.940
Hyphenated.
Ah,
okay.
I'll watch yourself.

818
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:04.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

819
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.260
<v 0>Who else?
It's hard.
It's hard to see what the light wave if you got oh,
oh,</v>

820
00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:11.450
you're doing a line thing organized.

821
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:12.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

822
00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:17.710
<v 4>Okay.
Hi,
it's nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for being here.</v>

823
00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:20.920
So my question is less about shark tank.
Well,
I do love the show,

824
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.460
but my boyfriend is trying to break into the real estate industry in New York

825
00:46:24.461 --> 00:46:26.470
and he's finding it a little bit challenging.

826
00:46:26.471 --> 00:46:28.990
So I just wanted to know what advice you would have for somebody who's trying to

827
00:46:28.991 --> 00:46:29.510
start off.

828
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:32.280
<v 0>Yeah,
well,
the first thing you should do is go and work for top salesperson.</v>

829
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:33.443
Best way to go in,

830
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.030
the easiest job to get in New York if you want to go in real estate,

831
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.050
is to go to rental company.
It's like the bottom feeders right there.

832
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:42.410
It's terrible.
But you know what's great about it.

833
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.260
And I ran a rental company for seven years before I was eight years for one's a

834
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:48.840
sales,
thank God.
And you know what's great about it?

835
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:52.710
You get a hundred times at Bat.
In other words,
you answered 50 calls.

836
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:55.620
Wa is that apartment available?
That apartment available different.

837
00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:58.710
When you're selling,
it's a slow motion.
So you get a lot of practicing.

838
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.160
If you could work as a free slave,

839
00:47:01.161 --> 00:47:06.161
you in for a licensed top salesperson just sitting next to them being their

840
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:08.850
slave and servant,
you're going to learn everything.

841
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.970
You can't learn in a real estate school.
You gotta be on the street and learn it.

842
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.990
And so that's the most important thing,
you know.
And if you need an introduction,

843
00:47:15.991 --> 00:47:18.600
just give me the car.
I'll pretend I know your boyfriend.

844
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:20.250
Is there anything like you

845
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:24.380
<v 4>I,
yeah,
you sure?
Cause obviously,
wait,
what did you say?</v>

846
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.420
That I'm a little better,
but he's pretty great.

847
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.050
<v 0>Well I'll definitely introduce them to my recommendation to you.</v>

848
00:47:33.051 --> 00:47:35.000
Is you feeling that way right now?
Do not marry this

849
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:42.390
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

850
00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.280
<v 5>yes.
A little.
I'm sorry,
I didn't see that.
Mike.
Hi.
How are you ladies?</v>

851
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.580
A pretty dress.
I may you earlier.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You inspire me.

852
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:55.470
So my question is when you also having to do with your career,

853
00:47:55.471 --> 00:47:57.170
when you started real estate,

854
00:47:57.171 --> 00:48:00.960
I mean sales aspect was always sexy and fun and interesting,

855
00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.910
but it was really dominated by men who are power brokers and suits and if I

856
00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:07.480
understand correctly,
um,

857
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:12.710
and it wasn't an industry that was for sparkling bubbly women who have big

858
00:48:13.561 --> 00:48:15.300
personalities.
So I'm,

859
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:20.200
I'm an attorney which is not known for having a big personalities or including

860
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.100
the ones who made the wrong career decision.
Right?
Well,
no,

861
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:28.230
I mean there's some good there.
I'm not vouching for attorney,
but um,

862
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:32.340
but how do you balance being taken in the beginning were about balancing,

863
00:48:32.341 --> 00:48:37.341
being able to be in front of Titans of industry and being taken seriously in

864
00:48:37.741 --> 00:48:38.280
front of them,

865
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.670
but also being true to who you are and letting people see your personality.

866
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.650
<v 0>You know,
the one great thing about getting older than,
than you fall apart,</v>

867
00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.950
which is really sickening and horrific.
It really is.

868
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:50.800
You find something new every day.
You don't like physically about yourself,

869
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.650
especially with the tend to be self critical.

870
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:58.360
And 99% of women out there are in 99% of men don't even have that gene from what

871
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:00.610
I see.
Okay.
But here we go.

872
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.880
I think it is essential to almost be ignorant.

873
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:10.270
You know what I mean?
I never felt like a woman in a man's field.
And by the way,

874
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:14.230
when I started,
all the companies were owned by men.
They weren't,
oh my one.

875
00:49:14.231 --> 00:49:16.960
But they were worked by women.
The bosses are men.

876
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.680
The women showed the apartments and the general cut of woman,

877
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.340
a woman who showed the apartments for sale on parking fifth,

878
00:49:24.341 --> 00:49:27.160
remember it was a limited high end market.
That was it.

879
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.390
You didn't have third second Tribeca.
The village,
she didn't have that.
Okay.

880
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.570
That Pete,
that was a vibrant rental market sale market.

881
00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:38.530
You had narrow corridors on the east and west side and they were society women.

882
00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:41.470
If you knew the right people,
you could sell them.
That wasn't me.

883
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:45.940
And it was a huge disadvantage to me.
Okay.
That was the disadvantage.

884
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:49.420
My upbringing and my lack of connections more than I was a female.

885
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:50.500
They were men at the Duh.

886
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.890
But it was a huge advantage to me to start hiring women.

887
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.870
I had probably in my firm,

888
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.460
my guess is 75 women before any man ever wanting to work for me.

889
00:50:00.461 --> 00:50:01.211
I interviewed men,

890
00:50:01.211 --> 00:50:05.920
but they'd walk in and see a pool of women and like they were in and out until

891
00:50:05.921 --> 00:50:09.130
Ralph Kruger showed up and said,
I have a pushy wife and too pushy daughters.

892
00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:09.964
I love it here.

893
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:16.050
So I sat him right in the front so a man could walk in Cmn,
that kind of thing.

894
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:21.230
But I think it's very important to almost be dumb.
Uh,
and she's,

895
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.350
Oh,
I forgot where I was going.
The upside when you're getting much older,

896
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:29.210
and I've gotten stronger and stronger in this way as I by the year,

897
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:31.640
by the minute.
Okay.
And I wish I knew it earlier.

898
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.110
It's to be yourself because people,
even if you're weird,

899
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.780
a Weirdo is often the most loved person in a team.

900
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.620
I think if you could be yourself and all that,
it is,

901
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.780
what typically happens is people like you because they can sense it's a real

902
00:50:47.781 --> 00:50:52.430
deal.
It's the heirs,
the phoniness or trying to impress the insecurity,

903
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:55.310
all the stuff that we all strive so hard for when we're young that gets in the

904
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:56.420
way.
You know,

905
00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.420
there was actually a two year period where I had my hair poofed up and didn't

906
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:03.380
wash it all week to try to fit in with the society ladies,
you know,

907
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.770
but my scalp itch like crazy.
I had to get rid of that haircut,
you know,

908
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.830
poof thing once a week.
Hello?

909
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:12.381
Hey.
Yeah,

910
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:15.800
and the only time my business ever fell behind it was when I was so busy

911
00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:18.800
watching my competition.
I analyzed everything.

912
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.280
I had that listings on a chart by category by size,
who had one,

913
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.610
who was my doctor at the time.
I was like a genius at my field.

914
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.150
It was the only year of my whole career.
I never pushed the business ahead.

915
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:33.160
I was so busy watching the next guy was watching me.
Right.
So being itself,

916
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.610
I would say would be the most important thing.

917
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:37.840
I forget about the female male thing.
I'm not saying it's not important.

918
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.390
Certain industries.
Certainly if you're an attorney,
investment banker,

919
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.090
it's such a man's world is a lot of man's world out there.
But entrepreneurship,

920
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:47.930
is it a level playing field?
There's no rules.
And you know what I find,

921
00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:52.480
and sorry I meant to say this,
but I find women can work in a real weird,

922
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:57.020
never mind.
They work harder,
they work harder,

923
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.420
they would just work harder,
you know?
Uh,

924
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:02.570
and maybe that's driven a little bit by insecurity,
but for whatever it's worth.

925
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:05.210
That's my 2 cents.
Your question.
Sorry,
I'm so long winded.
No,

926
00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:06.140
good question though.
Yeah.

927
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:11.010
<v 5>Hi Barbara.
My name is Francine and the eyes,
faith family.
Five kids.</v>

928
00:52:11.011 --> 00:52:14.560
And you have a 10 yeah,
I didn't have my mother had no your mother.
Yeah.
Okay.

929
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.000
I have two.
Yeah.
Two.
Thank you for being your authentic self.

930
00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.950
I think your story was really motivating and inspiring for us.

931
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.420
So my question for you as you speak to so many businesses,

932
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.310
once you do bring them on,

933
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.000
what are the top questions these businesses asked to be fast growth,

934
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.430
high profit businesses and how do you address them?

935
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:36.590
<v 0>What are the questions?
The small businesses ask me,
me,
my entrepreneurs that I,</v>

936
00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.890
uh,
I'm in partnership with.
Yes.
Um,
you know,
it's funny,

937
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.420
everybody has different questions.
Okay.
Um,
I never really thought about that.

938
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:44.991
So good one.

939
00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:48.260
All the categories because I think of them as old individual businesses.

940
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.160
You know what?

941
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.890
I don't think I'm aware of what questions cause I have my own agenda,

942
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.990
my agenda when I'm getting together on Skype calls,
emails,

943
00:52:56.991 --> 00:52:59.890
whatever is how do I push this business ahead?
How do I grow it?

944
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.170
So one thing I know how to do,
I'm not sure I'm good at anything other than I,

945
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.010
I know how to take some small and make it big.
All right?
Some thinking angles.

946
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:09.710
How do we multiply that?
How do we multiply like my mother did the socks.

947
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.190
Same kind of thing.
I'm not [inaudible] my brain's going like that.

948
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:16.940
So the advice and I'm almost always doing is the pushing them,
pushing them,

949
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
pushing them.
You try it,
try it.
And you know what I've also learned,

950
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:22.790
I've learned with all the good entrepreneurs are really successful ones.

951
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:26.220
When they asked me for advice,
you all,
we have this situation,
Barbara,

952
00:53:26.221 --> 00:53:29.280
I'd like you,
Bubba,
Bubba,
and I go and give them my best advice.
All valid.

953
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.660
You know what they do?

954
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:34.830
They do as they please my best entrepreneurs,

955
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:39.600
listen to my advice and then don't do it.
And that's an entrepreneur.

956
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:43.170
It's an independent streak for the same reason my dad should have been lunch

957
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:47.160
manure.
They don't want anybody telling them what to do even though they ask.

958
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:50.580
All right,
so it's not exactly your answer cause I'm not sure I have it,

959
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:54.090
but that's the best I could do.
Okay.
Pleasure.

960
00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.050
You're a cool guy with the hands in your pocket.
Money.
Yeah,

961
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.050
the jacket to the guy in the short.

962
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.820
Okay.
You should give me your pants,
Michael.

963
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.050
Don't tease me.

964
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:20.650
Don't disappoint me.
If we go there,

965
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:27.390
we can do this all day long for some color was so down for me.

966
00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.680
Say that again.
Long time viewer.

967
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:36.010
And in the vein of being a longtime viewer,

968
00:54:36.011 --> 00:54:40.200
I'm curious why you think the show is such a success.
It had to catch on it.

969
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.540
It had to catch on the first couple of seasons.

970
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:46.110
I constantly moved our time slot in a day of the week learner for a show.

971
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:49.680
People just find you,
well that was a fun show and you want to watch you again.

972
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.070
They don't promote it.
They were do no promotion of the show.

973
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:56.160
The next week it landed on a different day,
different time slot.

974
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.480
Then they moved it again.
Just as we started getting trashed,

975
00:54:58.481 --> 00:55:01.380
they kept moving it because we weren't as successful show.

976
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.650
And what happens is you got to like chat,
have a trial by fire.

977
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.380
When United successful show,
very few of them survived.
Very few.

978
00:55:07.381 --> 00:55:10.680
I think it's like 1% of all shows that open ever stay on air.
Okay.

979
00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.980
And so we were tenuous as years and that was the biggest problem.

980
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:15.660
And then we got loyal followers,

981
00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:17.820
you know and I knew this show is going to be successful.

982
00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:20.190
I remember the day some babe,
this lady,

983
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:25.191
Weird lady followed me into a restroom at the shuttle building in a near Kennedy

984
00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.920
airport,
wherever that thing is by Laguardia,

985
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:29.880
you know that Shell Delta shuttle couldn't remember the name,

986
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:34.740
followed me in hustle mean in the John.
I mean,
one thing,
walk me to the saint,

987
00:55:34.741 --> 00:55:39.310
but walk me in the Gi weird and she's like,
I love shopping.
I love shopping.

988
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:42.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

989
00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.320
<v 0>And you know what I thought I thought she's just like my born again.</v>

990
00:55:45.321 --> 00:55:46.820
Nutjob sister Christian.

991
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.940
I thought these are like born again Christian people and not if you're born

992
00:55:51.941 --> 00:55:54.840
again Christian.
I know that's not supposed to say that.
You know,

993
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:55.674
there's somebody,

994
00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:00.560
somebody who's really found God and I was gone for her and I to myself.

995
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.840
Whoa.
That's pretty intense.

996
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.040
And after that we started hearing everybody till the lie all the time.

997
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:09.990
You and my favorite shark and my favorite sharks.

998
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:14.250
I was traveling with Kevin O'leary at an airport once and a woman got on the
way.

999
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:16.860
Thank God not in the stall on the way to the stall.
Said to me,

1000
00:56:16.861 --> 00:56:19.500
you and my favorite shark.
You my favorite shark.
I said thank you.
Thank you.

1001
00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:22.500
I always believe that.
Then I get outside.
And what do you think happened?

1002
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:26.260
She was outside talking to Kevin and I hear her say are my favorite shark.

1003
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.740
How could he be her favorite shark and maybe her favorite shirt on mine?
Yeah,

1004
00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:34.571
you happy?

1005
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:38.380
You could take your hands out of your pocket now did you want the jacket?
No,

1006
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:40.330
and I don't want the other party that can sit down

1007
00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.380
now.
Your mom,
nighttime.
You're a hog.

1008
00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:50.840
We're not going to like me after this.
Okay.

1009
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:53.910
<v 6>You want to preface this by saying you,</v>

1010
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:57.020
you did say you would answer any question.
So hello.

1011
00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:01.930
<v 0>Your eyes are twittering.
You're nervous.
I'm nervous.
Go ahead.</v>

1012
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:02.764
You scare me a little bit.

1013
00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:05.541
<v 6>One of,</v>

1014
00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:09.590
one of my favorite anecdotes of yours is your letter to Mark Burnett and I'm

1015
00:57:09.591 --> 00:57:11.990
amazed at how you handled it.
I loved reading the text of it.

1016
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:16.070
What I'd like to know is who was the younger blonde you were competing with?

1017
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.130
<v 0>Oh,
shark tank.
I can't tell you that.</v>

1018
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:23.330
You said are only thing I want to answer it,

1019
00:57:23.331 --> 00:57:26.240
but you know why I couldn't end now I lied.
I didn't mean to,

1020
00:57:26.241 --> 00:57:29.660
cause I will answer anything,
but you know why I can't answer.
Uh,

1021
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:33.500
because she was a scoring lover and it would feel if,

1022
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.160
if it came back to her,
it wouldn't be right.
Okay.

1023
00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:38.280
<v 6>So my working theory that it was Laurie not correct.</v>

1024
00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.910
<v 0>No,
you're not a wrap.
That's kind of a lorry look alike.
Okay.</v>

1025
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:44.670
Kind of a look lookalike.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
Thank you.

1026
00:57:44.671 --> 00:57:48.540
Sorry I wasn't good for my word,
but it would be too mean spirited.
No,

1027
00:57:48.541 --> 00:57:52.610
I'm just joking.
You good.
Thank you very much.
Not only a had long blonde hair,

1028
00:57:52.611 --> 00:57:56.190
just like Tina miles secretary who stole my boyfriend.
Okay.

1029
00:57:56.530 --> 00:58:00.030
She'll say you do you know what's,
and we'll want to,

1030
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.980
all I had to do is do one click online.
I got while I was rejected.
Uh,

1031
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.250
well,
I you made,
that's not really fair,
but I assumed,
I knew.

1032
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:10.763
You know what I mean?

1033
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:15.610
And I knew I had tremendous liabilities to overcome their age one.
Clearly,

1034
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.850
you know,
I'm old enough to be able to shrugs mothers.
I really am.

1035
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:22.510
Damon said to me one time,
he said,
you're not old enough to be own mother.
I said,

1036
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:24.610
yeah.
I said,
just think about it Damon.

1037
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.810
If they catch up black guy that raped my mother at 20,

1038
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:32.920
they're going to put him behind jail bars.
Get that.
It's a joke.
Damien loved it.

1039
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:37.230
Sorry.
Damon loved it.
He goes,

1040
00:58:37.231 --> 00:58:40.680
that's the funniest thing I have already.
That's why I'm your son.
Right.
It,

1041
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:47.460
this isn't recorded is it?
I'm serious.
This,
this recording.

1042
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.410
Well,
if it is whoever's recording x that out,
cause I could get me in trouble,

1043
00:58:52.411 --> 00:58:54.960
you know,
anything out a context.
Right.
Yeah.

1044
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.960
And then I have to get Damon to come testify.

1045
00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:04.620
Okay.
All right.
Come up with a different question.
Oh,
you're my favorite chart.

1046
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:05.483
Yes ma'am.

1047
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.840
I know you said Damon gets cut,

1048
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:14.470
but I think you might get your airtime cuddle a little bit to too.
Huh?
Um,
no day.

1049
00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:19.470
Oh,
you mean with my filthy mouth?
They cutting you out a lot too.
Yeah.

1050
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:23.140
Um,
so my question is you didn't look like the type that was going to say that

1051
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.620
<v 7>coming at your strong.
Um,
so what,
who is this woman?</v>

1052
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.050
Um,
so what if any sharks do you prefer

1053
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:38.610
<v 0>for working with?
Um,
I like working with Mark Cuban.</v>

1054
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.160
You know why he's got a great team around him.
Uh,
he's quick to decide.
Bam,
Bam.

1055
00:59:44.161 --> 00:59:44.994
Thank you ma'am.

1056
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.050
He doesn't take a lot of time on the due diligence and it gets down to business

1057
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:54.300
and what to say.
He's extremely bright,
extremely bright on many,
many ways.

1058
00:59:54.301 --> 00:59:57.720
He's bright.
Okay.
And something about having a billionaire,

1059
00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:59.970
whether it's right or wrong,
put their money in the business.

1060
00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:02.660
You're putting a millionaire business money in,
um,

1061
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:07.130
makes you feel like you're smarter.
Okay.
Yeah.

1062
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.490
So anybody that you don't like working with,
who is this woman?

1063
01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:17.910
Okay.
Um,
you know what,
I've done deals with all of the entrepreneurs and um,

1064
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.000
I actually liked doing deals myself.
Think about it.

1065
01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:24.180
When you do a deal with another,
a shark,

1066
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:26.190
you've got to agree on terms of the contract.

1067
01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.790
You've got to compare due diligence.
You've got emails going back and forth.

1068
01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:32.940
It's hugely inefficient.
I like to decide,

1069
01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:37.170
get it done and move on because only when we really have in life is our time.

1070
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.080
So anything that's inefficient,
I'm more of a chip off my mother's block.

1071
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:44.590
It is inefficient.
I don't want to mess with [inaudible],

1072
01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.570
you know,
so really by myself and I've done deals with everybody,

1073
01:00:48.571 --> 01:00:52.860
but I never mind doing a deal with mark.
Yep.
Okay,
thanks.

1074
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:58.070
Although mark didn't tell me not to invest in this phenomenal deal because he

1075
01:00:59.341 --> 01:01:01.500
knew all about franchising,
he really did.

1076
01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.930
I didn't invest in who will remain nameless.

1077
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:09.410
And then one of the biggest hits on Shark tank proving that just because

1078
01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:13.950
somebody has more money than that.
Smarter than you.
Yeah.

1079
01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:19.320
Yes.
Wow.
You're like a kind of a cowboy type.

1080
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:24.140
<v 7>Um,
so I kind of have two questions.
Yes.
Oh,</v>

1081
01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:27.310
start with one and maybe I'll get to the other one.
Um,
so the phone,

1082
01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:28.970
what the hell?
Go for two.
All right.

1083
01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.590
So the first question I had kind of do a shark tank,
it itself.

1084
01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:37.910
So like when you're paying entrepreneurs,
how much does the actual idea matter?

1085
01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.560
Like do you care more about the actual person?

1086
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.220
<v 0>It depends what you're after.
For me it's all about the people.
I mean,</v>

1087
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:46.850
the idea has got to have a,
it's got to have a couple of legs important.

1088
01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:50.720
To me it's got to make common sense.
Okay.
And I've got a picture,

1089
01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:54.590
a lot of people buying it.
If I can picture,
a lot of people buy a nuance.

1090
01:01:54.591 --> 01:01:58.740
A lot of that stuff on for TV is nuance products because it's curious why would

1091
01:01:58.741 --> 01:02:00.500
have never thought of that.
And it's good for TV,

1092
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:01.760
but it's not good for my pocketbook.

1093
01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:05.780
So if I see something that makes common sense,
it doesn't have to be unique.

1094
01:02:05.781 --> 01:02:10.220
I mean,
pork power,
barbecue sauce,
how many uh,
sauces are out there.

1095
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.930
I've never even checked it.
I wouldn't want to,

1096
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:15.170
cause I feel like a fool putting money in it.
Okay.
But I had something unique.

1097
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:17.440
I had the guy that looked at the park okay.

1098
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:22.740
And they were great hustlers.
The great hustlers,
you know,
smart guys,

1099
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:27.060
great hustlers.
So for me,
I always pick out the entrepreneurs and the times,

1100
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:27.690
I haven't,

1101
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.900
the Times I've been swayed to pick the business cause it seems amazing.

1102
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.740
I've lost money every time.
It's always when I just,

1103
01:02:34.741 --> 01:02:36.870
and you know what I do in my head when I'm sitting there,
when I'm,

1104
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:39.120
when I'm equivocating which isn't that much like me,

1105
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:43.140
I'm usually in or out within before they open their mouth based on what they

1106
01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:46.470
look like and how they act under pressure with the cameras zooming and how they

1107
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:50.220
hold.
I kind of already deciding at least I know when I'm out.
Okay.
Um,

1108
01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.330
but I have to say that,
uh,
I don't know what I was saying.

1109
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.150
What's your second question?
I lost my train of thought.
Yeah.

1110
01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:02.420
You were talking about what kind of makes it great entrepreneur always pay.

1111
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.370
My conclusion there is,
I always pick the person over the business.

1112
01:03:05.371 --> 01:03:07.020
But your second question is that

1113
01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.510
what do you do?
Like when you are your own worst enemy,

1114
01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:16.530
kind of like when you doubt.
I am good advice on that.
Okay.

1115
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:20.040
Because that is the real enemy in building any business of building any success

1116
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:23.830
for yourself.
I really believe you are the enemy can,
you could look,

1117
01:03:23.831 --> 01:03:25.560
can blame this and this and this,
but how does,

1118
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.370
how does a guy like a Branson do what he did?
I mean,

1119
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:32.430
how does he do and nobody else built this giant airline.
How do people do it?

1120
01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:36.240
You know?
You know what I think?
I think the battle is won inside your own head.

1121
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:39.120
One or loss inside your own head.
For me,

1122
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:43.350
I had a huge advantage because I came into the adult world.

1123
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.040
Pissed.
Okay.
Not all of my parents.
I had spoken glowing terms.

1124
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:47.940
I was happy with that,

1125
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:51.420
but I was such a horrific student in school that the kids made fun of me.

1126
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:52.170
I couldn't read.

1127
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:56.820
My idea of hell on earth was being made to read out loud and have to go the the

1128
01:03:56.821 --> 01:04:01.500
and everybody laughing.
Okay?
So when I got out of that Goddamn school house,

1129
01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:02.910
it was like a jail house from me.

1130
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.570
I came out with vengeance and a need to prove I wasn't stupid.

1131
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.970
Do you know how that's got me through the thick and thin,

1132
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.220
the insecurity of thing,
and maybe I am stupid.

1133
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.820
I still feel that way on a bad day.
But as a result of that,

1134
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:17.040
I share this with you if it's helpful to anybody here.

1135
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:20.940
I learned to develop a tape of my own because my old tape was this.

1136
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.870
I would go into a situation,
not raise my hand.
I mean me speaking up,

1137
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.540
even on shark time,
very hard for me to do,
to be heard.

1138
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.340
You notice I don't talk as much because I'm like,

1139
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.340
if they showed all the tapes for an hour and a half,
you'd see me say,
ah hmm.

1140
01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:40.410
All right.
But what I learned to do for myself is to,

1141
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.370
when I start doing the,
Oh my God,
I should've come here.
Gosh,
they don't like me.

1142
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.640
Oh my God.
All the self talk.
We all do it.
Whatever your thing is,

1143
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:48.900
and it's usually from childhood,

1144
01:04:48.901 --> 01:04:51.330
some bullshit that went on there that formed you.
Right?

1145
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:54.120
When I started doing that,
now I have a new tape.
It's not that new.

1146
01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:57.660
I've been doing now for 30 years and it goes like this.
I sit there and I go,
Hey,

1147
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:03.060
wait a minute,
I have just as much right to be here as that asshole.

1148
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.740
And I psych myself up.
I get really loud and says,
you know what,

1149
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:11.670
this don't nobody who says you can't get your hand on the money like everybody

1150
01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:14.250
else would have anything in life that you really want to desire it go as far as

1151
01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:17.830
you.
When I get myself really steamed up and I always land the same place,

1152
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:22.150
which is,
well fuck you.
And then I raised my hand.
Hey,

1153
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.560
okay.
But that's self battle within.

1154
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:30.790
It is so important within myself because when I feel like that Alice and

1155
01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:35.740
wonderland going down the rabbit holes,
whatever that famous line is,
it's on,

1156
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:38.770
I'm shrinking.
Was that wizard of Oz and melting,
whatever the hell it is.
Okay.

1157
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:42.160
But you know that feeling of going down.
Oh shrinking.

1158
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:46.180
You know the minute that starts now I'm very good at bringing out of the person.

1159
01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:47.830
Right to the front.
You know?

1160
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.220
And I'm going to prove that I'm swearing all the time.
I got to prove it.

1161
01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.500
It doesn't mean I don't feel,
I'm not some time,
but I've really kicked in.
I'm,

1162
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.090
I'm a pretty fast forward on that now.
You know,
that's it.

1163
01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:01.570
[inaudible] and another one little thing for the women in the room,

1164
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.380
sometimes on municipalization.
I just say to myself,
what would a man do?

1165
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:10.960
And you know what?
Men are much more apt to speak up,

1166
01:06:10.961 --> 01:06:14.350
demand more as for the big arrays,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Then a woman would,

1167
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.080
they really are.
I know,
cause I've hired thousands of people,

1168
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:19.690
fire thousands of people.
I've worked with thousands of people.
I'm old,

1169
01:06:19.691 --> 01:06:24.070
I know this stuff.
Okay.
And I will often say to myself,
what would a man do?

1170
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:24.641
And I'll say,
wait,

1171
01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:27.940
I'm not going to like understand the other side better than I understand my
side,

1172
01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:30.820
which is like me,
empathy.
I understand.
I understand.
No,

1173
01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.880
I got to take care of me or to,
Hey,
let me tell you what I want.

1174
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:38.440
That's what a man says.
Hey,
let me tell you what I want with a woman.
It's like,

1175
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:43.060
you know what?
I was thinking that.
Okay.
Yeah.
Little different.
Yeah.

1176
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.970
Different style.
Yeah.
As long as you get there.
Yes sir.

1177
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:49.630
With the plaid shirt on that his mattress and that was all the rage when I was

1178
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:50.464
17.

1179
01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.270
<v 8>Yeah.
Not Take a time machine to come here.
Hello?
Yeah.
Does that bleed by the way?</v>

1180
01:06:56.271 --> 01:07:00.390
That mattress?
Um,
you mean I don't sleep with this but no,
no.

1181
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.110
When we used to wash a mattress it would bleed and that was cool.
Got It.
Oh yes.

1182
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:07.700
Doesn't bleed out and thanks.
Okay.
Who would know by now?
Okay.
I guess I would,

1183
01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:11.540
my question is more along the lines of persistence.

1184
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:15.110
So what's your take on if you're,
if you're trying,

1185
01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.730
if you're fighting a battle right now and you know,
you,

1186
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.430
it kind of looks like you're going to lose,

1187
01:07:19.431 --> 01:07:22.290
but you still have the impetus to persist.
Um,

1188
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.280
what my device do you have on?

1189
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:29.990
<v 0>Well,
that's a hard one because it depends so much on your own good judgment.</v>

1190
01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.550
Okay.
Most often,
uh,

1191
01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:36.220
it's far better to play your hand out because you don't want to leave without

1192
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:38.180
the end of the story in my book.
In other words,

1193
01:07:38.181 --> 01:07:40.940
you want to play it out and see if he could bring him to the finish line.
Okay.

1194
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:42.290
That being said,

1195
01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:46.850
sometimes you're hitting your head against the wall against a wall that doesn't

1196
01:07:46.851 --> 01:07:48.660
believe you.
It's never going to believe in,

1197
01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.510
it's never going to buy in in the first place.

1198
01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:54.620
And then I changed the wall and I use the same persistence to hit against a

1199
01:07:54.621 --> 01:07:57.800
different wall.
Very often a situation where you're an employee.

1200
01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.810
I could've been amazing as a sales clerk at my job at Schweitzer's department

1201
01:08:02.811 --> 01:08:05.270
store selling those granny gals.
Oh,
you're amazing barber.

1202
01:08:05.271 --> 01:08:06.530
You can sell those granny gowns,

1203
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:09.530
but I was never going to run Schweitzer's department store no matter how good I

1204
01:08:09.531 --> 01:08:12.290
was.
You know what I mean?
It was owned by the Schweitzer's.

1205
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.620
So I think you have to push push until your dignity is whole and you think,

1206
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:20.510
well,
nobody could have done it any harder.

1207
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:24.920
But I think you also have to know when you don't have a shot and move on and

1208
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:30.130
spend your God given talents on somebody where it fits or something where it

1209
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:33.830
fits so you can get stuck without moving on if you too much that way.

1210
01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:35.690
No vacillated answer.

1211
01:08:35.691 --> 01:08:37.970
I think I'll make that the last one cause I think we're over time.

1212
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:40.630
Is that your God calling?

1213
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:47.260
<v 2>[inaudible] let's have a show of hands</v>

1214
01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.780
<v 0>on how many people love this guy's hair.</v>

1215
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.670
<v 2>Well,
it is nice.
Okay.</v>

1216
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.360
You have a shampoo.
