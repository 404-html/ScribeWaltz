1
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.820
Welcome.
My name is Malika Saada Saar.

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.800
I'm Google's senior counsel on civil and human rights.
You know,

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.640
about a year ago,
the great human rights lawyer,

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.060
Brian Stevenson,
came to Google,

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.480
came to our Tgi f where all of us come together in mountain view and t gif is

6
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.180
live stream to all of our employees.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.450
And so as a company we came together to welcome Brian and Brian said to us,

8
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.280
challenged us to bear witness,

9
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.490
to be proximate to the human costs of mass incarceration.

10
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.230
And so over the year,
in the last 10 months,

11
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:52.950
in fact,

12
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.950
we have been doing criminal justice forms within Google to really do what Brian

13
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.480
asks us to do,

14
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.630
to bear witness and to be proximate to the human costs of mass incarceration.

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
We've had these conversations in different parts of our company,

16
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.550
we've thought about and continue to ask the question of how do we use our

17
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:21.510
platforms to disrupt mass incarceration?

18
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.620
Because we know that what we do at Google is disrupt,

19
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.700
disrupt for good,
and if anything needs to be disrupted,

20
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.510
it's the over criminalization of our black and brown communities.

21
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.770
But most of how we've had that conversation has really been without the words

22
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:46.050
and lived experiences of women and girls.
And so today,

23
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.510
as part of women's history month,

24
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.870
we want to be able to delve deeply into what is mass incarceration from the

25
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:58.080
perspective of women and girls.

26
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.140
When we talk about achieving racial justice,

27
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.830
how do we do it from a gendered Lens?

28
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.850
Up to 80% of women behind bars have been subject to some form of sexual

29
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.120
violence.

30
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.960
Sexual violence is the primary predictor of girls going behind bars and women

31
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:23.790
and girls are the fastest growing prison populations.

32
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.210
We must have this conversation as part of our overall commitment to disrupting

33
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:31.290
mass incarceration.

34
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.920
We cannot have any real comprehensive discourse around criminalization of black

35
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:43.971
and brown communities without centering the experiences of women and girls.

36
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.130
And with that,

37
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.300
it is my absolute honor and privilege to introduce to you the founder and

38
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:57.861
executive director of the National Council for formerly incarcerated and

39
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:59.920
incarcerated women and girls

40
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.060
<v 1>Angio,
James</v>

41
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.030
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

42
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.360
<v 1>Hi everybody.
Thank you.
I'm not going to be labor.
Um,</v>

43
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.240
anything beyond what Malika has said,

44
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.500
I cannot underscore enough the importance of the words that she did say.

45
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:19.810
I want to say thank you to everybody here at Google,

46
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.110
both in this room and those of you who are on live stream for tuning in to this

47
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.960
incredibly important issue.
And I think without me going on any further,

48
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:33.070
you will understand why it was so important by the end of our time here
together.

49
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.770
Um,
Miss Alice,
are you there?
I'm here.

50
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.830
Can you see me at all?
I know I don't see you right now.
Okay,
well I love you.

51
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.880
I don't know what I'm doing is telling me to do something.

52
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.830
What foe here?
Hi Miss Alice.
There you go.
All right.
Oh,
I see now.

53
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.830
There you are.
Hi,
how are you darling?
Okay,

54
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:58.660
so we're going to begin our conversation.
You are seeing uh,

55
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.830
Ms. Alice Marie Johnson and I'm going to tell you very briefly so that we can

56
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.520
get to Ms. Johnson and you're going to hear from her for the rest of the time

57
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:05.680
that,

58
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.680
that we're having our discussion together about the work of the National

59
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.961
Council.

60
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.961
We are a platform that we have created a really starting out because we knew

61
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.820
that our voices needed to be heard.

62
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.050
I mantra is nothing about us without us because we are the experts,

63
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.010
the women and girls who have gone through the experiences who have been directly

64
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:30.280
affected by an incredibly unjust,
racist,

65
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:33.700
classist and discriminatory criminal justice system.

66
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.780
We are the experts that need to be at the forefront and at the table and

67
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:40.730
creating the policy for not just change,

68
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:43.870
not for reforming a criminal justice system that we don't believe can be

69
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.704
reformed,

70
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.710
but in creating and shifting radically to a human justice system and what that

71
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:51.580
entails.

72
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.460
So the National Council of foreign rate and formerly incarcerated women and

73
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.840
girls was created to connect all of the powerful,
brilliant,

74
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:00.400
courageous,
brave,

75
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.550
incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women and girls across this country who

76
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:10.540
are doing that work as the experts to create the change that we know needs to

77
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.140
happen.

78
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.140
You're going to hear from many of them here today and you are privileged to have

79
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:19.390
the voice of the experience of the women that you will hear from today.

80
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.570
Starting with Miss Alice and the Obama Administration started a project called

81
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:29.851
the clemency project 2014 obviously it was back in 2014 and we went to the mat

82
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.990
under the leadership of our clemency expert,
Amy Pulver,

83
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.100
who was a woman who served years in the federal prison system prior to her

84
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:43.900
sentence been commuted by president,
Bill Clinton and Amy.
We have this thing.

85
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:47.680
When we leave the prison doors and we're walking out the door,
everybody says,

86
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:52.420
don't look back.
Don't look back.
It's like a curse.
Don't look back.

87
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.260
We love you.
We want to see you go do not look back.
If you look back,

88
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.480
it's like the curse going to bring you back until we kind of leave there and we

89
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.630
don't look back.
Amy Povo looked back.
She never stopped.

90
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.150
Looking back from the day that she left that prison,

91
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:08.000
when President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence,
she started,

92
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:11.840
the organization can do clemency and please check it out.

93
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.260
You were going to see some of the faces of the women including Miss Alice that

94
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.320
are part of that.
Well,
unfortunately,
or fortunately,

95
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.090
of the very small number of the thousands of women that should,

96
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:27.710
that met President Obama has criteria,
but somehow we're left behind.

97
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.510
50 of our women did make it out under the leadership of Amy Poba and,

98
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.140
and the women of the council and women across this country that went to the mat

99
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.450
to fight,
to push these women out of prison.

100
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.190
Ms. Alice Johnson fit those criteria,
unfortunately.

101
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.830
And even though she's been in a prison for decades,

102
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.340
was not one of the women that we were able to push up.

103
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.370
And this is incredibly painful for us.

104
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.970
And I'm gonna stop there and I'm going to ask Miss Alison [inaudible],

105
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.990
we love you.

106
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.950
We understand how incredible your sales is in a federal prison speaking to us

107
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:01.784
right now.

108
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.650
And I want you to begin Miss Alice by telling us about you and about your story

109
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:08.990
and why you're sitting in that federal prison.

110
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.570
<v 3>Okay?
Okay.
My name is Alice Murray.</v>

111
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:16.170
Johnathan and obey Sir.
Yes.
Of this year,

112
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.030
I'll be 62 years old.
I've already spent a third of my life

113
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.110
in 1996 my life drastically changed forever.

114
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.650
I was convicted as a first time don valid drug offender instead of the life in

115
00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:35.400
federal prison.

116
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.160
I'd always thought that all is the most heinous crimes warranted a life without

117
00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:42.840
parole sentence.

118
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.150
I have the exact same sentence as Charles Manson.

119
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.720
Prior to coming to prison,
I lived at,

120
00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.180
I guess you could say a pretty protective life.

121
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.050
I never expected anything like this to happen to me.

122
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.590
I had worked in various professional positions.
Uh,

123
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.860
I was working at Federal Express.

124
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.210
I had did a manager with Fedex for 10 years.

125
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.740
I was also a facilitator who trained other people for management.

126
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.700
When I lost my job,
uh,
10 years with Fedex,

127
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.470
I can tell you that my life literally began to spiral out of control.

128
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.020
I made one of the worst choices that I've ever made in my life,

129
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:29.700
which I deeply regret.

130
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.740
I became involved in a drug conspiracy.

131
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.960
I had never sold two outs.

132
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.500
I had never used drugs and I can tell you I literally got in over my head,

133
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.780
but I tell you,
I made some very different choices when I came to prison.

134
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.270
I would have tell you real quickly,
when I was a young girl,
I had someone ask me,

135
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.260
Alice,
what do you want to be when you grow up?
And I said,

136
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.850
I want it to be an incredible woman.
I said,

137
00:09:01.851 --> 00:09:03.830
what is an incredible woman?

138
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.660
It's a woman who goes down in history who make changes in life,

139
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.700
who makes her a print in life and impact people lives.

140
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.710
That's the kind of warmth that I wanted to be.

141
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.470
I decided when I came to prison that because I was in prison,

142
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.610
prison bars don't have to contain your dreams Asti or wanted to be an incredible

143
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:29.814
woman.

144
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.660
So I looped around the my view environment to see how I could impact this

145
00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:39.870
society in prison for good.

146
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.730
So I started serving others and making a difference in their lives.

147
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.690
I picked up my pen and I started writing plays,

148
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.760
plays that we're the largest indict participation programs in the prison.

149
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.940
People who felt they could do anything,

150
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.460
they learned how to do theatrical productions.
They learn how to act.

151
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.650
I started choreographic dance.

152
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:10.010
I found people that the gift of artistry was stir it up to them and they made

153
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.400
beautiful,
beautiful backdrops and I played,

154
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.290
became that place became known everywhere.

155
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.800
I also started mentoring women to see if I could help them be tier from a life

156
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:27.030
of crime.

157
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.500
I use experience that I had with interviewing and job preparedness to prepare

158
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:36.120
other wedding to go outside and be productive citizens.

159
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.850
<v 1>So I want to,</v>

160
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:44.150
I want us to have the opportunity to sell is to talk a little bit about the

161
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:49.151
sacks at we don't have available to us right now,

162
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.000
the clemency project.
We do not have that.
We have a justice,

163
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:59.410
we have a justice department now that wants to turn the clocks back to a place

164
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:04.601
in time that is dark and draconian and something that with all of the education

165
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:10.130
that we have learned over the years and throughout the Obama administration

166
00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:14.690
about the need to decarcerate.
Why Miss Alice,
you are in a prison,

167
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.260
one of many federal women's prisons that are full of women who were there and

168
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:27.071
only but for conspiracy laws in this country that allow these women to be thrown

169
00:11:27.591 --> 00:11:32.591
in and charged and held responsible for this the same amount as the person who

170
00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:35.870
is the leader of the drug ring.
Why Miss Alice?

171
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.050
Why is it so incredibly important that we continue and raise awareness in places

172
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:46.331
like this about the need to push and to continue to push for the freedom of

173
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:48.200
women like yourself through clemency?

174
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:54.040
<v 3>Well,
I can say this about conspiracy.</v>

175
00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.270
Many of the women in here were women who did not have those types of roles,

176
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.850
but they are charged with leadership roles.

177
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.150
They have to take on the responsibility of entire conspiracy because I was dumb.

178
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.780
I was eating of a sack because I had never been in prison.

179
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:15.730
I didn't even know people who have served time,

180
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.640
so I didn't know what a conspiracy charge meant.

181
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.600
It means that you are charged with every element of the crime.

182
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.430
You are held responsible for every act that anyone else has committed.

183
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:31.330
Whether you had knowledge of what they were doing and that that's why it's

184
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:35.080
called conspiracy.
So it becomes a catchall for everything.

185
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.950
And these women,
most of them are mothers.

186
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:44.230
I say 95% of them are mothers.
And I tell you,
we know that women,

187
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.850
not to say anything about the mail,
but the mother is the nucleus of a family.

188
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.490
When a mother is taken out of the home,

189
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.720
so many times the family is split apart.

190
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.660
When a man is taken out of the home,

191
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.850
the woman will hold it down both when the women most of the time,

192
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:04.960
and it's just the truth,

193
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.630
the children I sent away to live with relatives,
foster care,

194
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.070
and too many times they're sent to the streets to be raised by the streets and

195
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:18.010
the cycle of incarceration continues.

196
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:23.380
So this calls of women and girls is saving the families.

197
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.690
<v 1>Yeah,
I was glad that this,
you were a mother,
Miss Alice.
Yes.</v>

198
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.883
Yes.

199
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.080
You were a mother and you know directly what that is like to be a mother who is

200
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:42.340
incarcerated for all of the years that you have been in prison.

201
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.760
And I want to just again command you Miss Alice for your courage to still stay

202
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:54.691
with us as part of the team to raise awareness because it must have been

203
00:13:55.541 --> 00:14:00.541
incredibly difficult to have an opportunity through the clemency project to

204
00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:03.040
maybe gain your freedom.

205
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.510
You're doing something that you deserved a lot of skin in the game.

206
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:09.970
We weren't asking for any favors on your behalf.

207
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.050
You earned your freedom and yet to have been denied.

208
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.790
I know it was difficult for us.
We still are challenged with it every single day.

209
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:22.420
Miss Alice,
we are here as your team fighting to bring you home,

210
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.750
but why is it important that we use our voices to encourage this administration

211
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:33.781
and future administrations to use clemency to push women like yourself out who

212
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:35.110
deserve to come home?

213
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.310
<v 3>The fact that there is no parole in the federal system for most of us,</v>

214
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:47.310
for me clemency had been our only hope so to not push for clemency is to take

215
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:54.110
away their hope because we have exhausted all of the means.

216
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.390
I have not been sitting still.
I filed motions after motions and the court,

217
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.560
but clemency in itself is an act of mercy and forgiveness.

218
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.810
And will you see a person like myself who is did a complete turnaround in their

219
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:12.860
life who has gad?
I get so much support.
I stand,

220
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.120
lift fought so hard.

221
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:19.390
The clemency project was like putting the carrots and then draw it back because

222
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:23.840
we all have so much hope that that was going to come through because I knew I

223
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:26.060
fit the criteria.
But as you see,

224
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.650
I left behind and I'm still here and this is what I want to say to Google.

225
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.250
Google is a company that has been greatly blessed to whom much is given,

226
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.320
much is required when you use your voice.
People listen,

227
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.610
when you champion a cause,
I leadership listens.

228
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.680
You may say,
am I my brother's or sister's keeper?

229
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.360
And I say to you today that if not you,
then who?

230
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.771
If not now,

231
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:02.771
then when I don't want to die in prison to say later may be too late for me.

232
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.700
I'm already 62 I've already spent two decades in prison.

233
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.140
So I believe that as responsible citizens,

234
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.090
we do have a responsibility to each other.
We do.

235
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.070
It is not just a social issue that you put on the agenda that sounds good on

236
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:22.431
paper.

237
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:27.320
It's something that you have to take to heart when you see me and so many others

238
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:28.154
like me,

239
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.600
you see I'm just a representative but very small representative,

240
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:38.540
but there's many more just like me and I don't believe that the public is safe

241
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:39.620
because I'm here.

242
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.180
I'm not valid and I've already spent 20 years and I've had 100% clear conduct.

243
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.430
I'm so,
I was free trial bond,

244
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.490
but two years I was trusted enough to be at all but after my arrest I've proven

245
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.790
that I'm a reformed woman,

246
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.270
but there's still no help for me unless someone takes on this challenge of

247
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:12.970
helping us in mass incarceration and using what you have been gifted with a

248
00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:17.210
blessed competent.
We need you.

249
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.420
I appreciate it if you would help us.

250
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.640
<v 2>Thank you Miss Alice,</v>

251
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.160
<v 1>Miss Alice,
as we always do,
we want to remind you that we are here.</v>

252
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.970
Your team is out here.
We will never,

253
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.780
we are here.
Yeah.
Thank you.

254
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.200
And you know that we are going to continue and we are going to continue to this

255
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:54.351
work hopefully by raising the consciousness level of what you have described

256
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.580
perfectly.
An incredible organization,
uh,

257
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.760
here at Google and the power and the brilliance that they have that we hope that

258
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:07.770
they recognize.
Not that they're special people,

259
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.270
but they are privileged and people who are privileged to have a responsibility

260
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.070
to the rest of the human race.

261
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.460
So I thank you again for again,

262
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.700
coming with us on the road and sharing what is so very difficult and to let

263
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:26.430
everybody understand when I hang up this phone call with Miss Alice,

264
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.280
I'm going to go and I'm going to sit down and I'm going to listen to the rest of

265
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:31.560
the women and girls who are here with us today.

266
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.680
Miss Alice is going to go back to a prison into a prison cell that she has been

267
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:39.210
in for more than 20 years.

268
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.740
We need to bring her home and we hope that all of you here at Google will help

269
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:48.640
us to do that.
Thank you Miss Alice.
We love you.
I love you too.
Thank you so much.

270
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.970
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

271
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.180
I'm going to call your Topeka or up here cause I don't know what I'm supposed to

272
00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:58.880
do now Miss Alice.
But we know that you like to hang out and,

273
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.410
and speak of.
What am I going to do in here?
Okay.
Okay.

274
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.520
We're going to,
I'm not going to let you hang out there and,

275
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.120
and cause Miss Alison's going to cut off when she cuts off because she is

276
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:12.420
calling from a federal prison and they only get a tiny window of opportunity.

277
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.260
But we like to let her hang out and listen for as long as she can because it's

278
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:19.890
like giving her a break from being in the prison.
So I love you Miss Alice.

279
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:22.110
We're going to move on.
Okay,
I'll talk to you later.

280
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.720
I love you Mo Topeka.
Miss Alice was speaking to you

281
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.080
right there to pick him.
Ileka you know what?
Okay.

282
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.820
Thank you.
I'm going to ask.

283
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:40.950
Thank you us.

284
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:07.130
<v 5>So we want to focus on the experience of women behind bars.</v>

285
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.950
And Miss Alice did a powerful,

286
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:15.930
powerful job in helping us to begin to understand that more deeply.

287
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:19.470
And we are so honored and privileged to have your voice,

288
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:23.580
Miss Alice and we're going to make sure that your voice is heard through all the

289
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:25.620
corridors of Google.

290
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:31.590
I want each of you to introduce yourselves and then let's start our
conversation.

291
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.163
<v 4>Okay.</v>

292
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.000
<v 5>Thank you Malika and Google for having us be a part of this conversation and</v>

293
00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:41.480
conversation as definitely necessary and crucial at this time.
Uh,

294
00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:42.800
my name is Mia.
She Benton.

295
00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:45.830
I'm with the woman and Justice Project and I'm pretty much,

296
00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:48.160
we sent it a leaderships directly impacted,

297
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.073
<v 6>um,</v>

298
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.650
women to shift the dynamic change to allow the criminal justice system to be

299
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:54.484
dismantled.

300
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.860
<v 4>Okay.</v>

301
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.870
<v 7>Good afternoon.
My name is Topeka Sam.</v>

302
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.310
I am the national organizer for the National Council for incarcerated and

303
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:04.990
formerly incarcerated women and girls.

304
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.280
I'm a formerly incarcerated woman and I'm also the founder of the ladies of hope

305
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:11.350
ministries.
And our goal,

306
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:15.070
a method national council is to end the incarceration of women and girls.

307
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:16.740
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

308
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.740
<v 6>So I wanted to ask each of you to talk in more depth around how mass</v>

309
00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:25.620
incarceration has impacted you directly.

310
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.770
<v 4>Okay.</v>

311
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.670
<v 6>Um,
so mass incarceration,
like I was arrested at the age of 19,</v>

312
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.850
I was two months pregnant and I did a total of four years in three different

313
00:21:36.861 --> 00:21:39.110
states,
New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

314
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.960
And while incarcerated,

315
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.220
I gave birth to my daughter at the Bedford Hills correctional facility,

316
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:49.370
which is the maximum facility in New York state.

317
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.870
And I spent many birthdays behind bars.
And you know,

318
00:21:53.871 --> 00:21:55.610
when you think about your 21st birthday,

319
00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.820
you really don't think about celebrating inside behind the cell with the woman

320
00:22:01.311 --> 00:22:04.070
you barely know.
But you know,
you make the best of it.

321
00:22:04.071 --> 00:22:08.510
And as women we make the best of I situations.
Um,

322
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.050
I was also fortunate to be able to go into the nursery.

323
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.150
Bedford hills correctional facility has a nursery,

324
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:18.650
would they allow the woman to stay with the children up to a year.

325
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.670
And I was able to bond with my daughter and after I sent her home,

326
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.850
they transfer me to beyond correctional facility,

327
00:22:25.851 --> 00:22:30.350
which is the medium security facility in New York state on a borderline of

328
00:22:30.351 --> 00:22:32.540
Canada.
And from there,

329
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.010
I didn't receive another visit from neither one of my children because I had a

330
00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:39.020
son that was one years old when I went inside.

331
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.850
And this is not like a unique situation,

332
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.800
75% a woman that are incarcerated at the time,
our moms.

333
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:54.110
And I would one of those moms that was far away and did not have access to being

334
00:22:54.111 --> 00:22:57.500
able to see my children and speaking on a phone or letters.

335
00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:00.980
Don't cut it when you have young children and then don't cut it for any children

336
00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:01.850
because you don't,

337
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.930
you're not afforded the bond that you need to nurture and to bring them up.

338
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.560
Um,
so after my four years,
I came home and reunited with my,

339
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.400
my son and my daughter.

340
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.250
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

341
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.100
<v 7>so,
um,
my,</v>

342
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:30.330
my,
um,
impact with incarceration has started.
I just,

343
00:23:30.331 --> 00:23:34.530
just being in an African American woman,
um,
you know,

344
00:23:34.531 --> 00:23:39.480
family members and things that have been incarcerated or friends,

345
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:43.620
but,
um,
my family,
my parents,
they were entrepreneurs,

346
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.970
franchise owners,
and they had,
um,

347
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.110
had us living in an area where we were the only black family and partly was to

348
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:54.500
protect us from what was happening within the country and the things that they

349
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:59.360
went through being from New York City.
And when I went off to go to college,
um,

350
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.920
is when I got exposed directly to different things that were really happening in

351
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:08.921
the worlds and started making poor choices and really buy into the narrative of

352
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:13.370
what being black but like in America.
Um,

353
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.820
and that entailed dating guys who may have been,
um,

354
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.460
drug dealing and things of that nature.
And then,

355
00:24:21.461 --> 00:24:26.230
and then not even understanding what had happened in this country to even caused

356
00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:30.050
that to happen within our communities.
So,
um,
I would,

357
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.080
I had gotten in trouble and I would get arrested and then go on probation.

358
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:38.470
And it was the cycle yet still in college and school,

359
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.060
still maintaining,
um,

360
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.660
employment and building a career or starting a business.

361
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.560
And so when I was incarcerated in federal prison,

362
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:50.720
I was incarcerated for three and a half years.

363
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.770
And part of what Miss Alice spoke about and when we,
oh,
she just touched on,

364
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:59.771
was the fact that I had met so many women who had children and so many women,

365
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:05.030
um,
in the federal prison we are taking,
you know,
far,
far away.

366
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:09.170
And in the northeast,
Danbury,
Connecticut was the only women's federal prison.

367
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.310
And I was camp designated.
So I was in Danbury.

368
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.490
And you had women from all up and down the east coast and Midwest who were there

369
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.020
yet.
They,
I would be in the visiting room and there would be no one there.

370
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.070
And partly is because you had the parents who were home,

371
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:28.310
who are elderly on fixed incomes,
who were taking care of the children.

372
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.800
I couldn't had to choose whether or not they could to have the children go to

373
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:37.460
see their parents or feed the children and make sure that they were okay.

374
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.920
And then a meeting women who had,
had already done 20 years in prison.

375
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.480
Um,

376
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.480
I knew at that point that it was my responsibility to then take what it was that

377
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:53.690
I learned even being impacted by conspiracy charge.
And by the grace of God,

378
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:55.370
I did not get life in prison,

379
00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.400
but those conspiracy laws are just that I'd had no drugs in my case at all yet I

380
00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:03.890
was charged with having 80 kilos of cocaine.

381
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.760
So when you look at just how that law is and what it's in place and what it does

382
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:14.300
to our communities,
specifically women and girls,
um,

383
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.320
one of the policies and the reform that we're doing at the national council is

384
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:21.170
to change that conspiracy law.
Um,

385
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:25.550
so now as a national organizer,
we go around the country.

386
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.360
We are mobilizing,
hoping to get 100,000 members,

387
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.360
which includes formerly incarcerated,
incarcerated women,

388
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.540
directly impacted children of incarcerated parents and people like you who are

389
00:26:38.481 --> 00:26:42.320
movement family and allies who can help us in moving this work and getting the

390
00:26:42.321 --> 00:26:45.390
message out so that we can end the incarceration of women and girls.

391
00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.001
<v 5>So Topeka,</v>

392
00:26:47.001 --> 00:26:50.840
I want to just surface more what you're talking about with the conspiracy

393
00:26:50.841 --> 00:26:55.841
charges because we know right that most women who are behind bars at federal and

394
00:26:56.241 --> 00:26:57.860
state correctional facilities,

395
00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:03.190
our mothers to children under the age of 18 we know that most women and mothers

396
00:27:04.221 --> 00:27:08.750
behind bars are first time nonviolent felons.

397
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.620
What is going on with the conspiracy charges that first time nonviolent felons

398
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.100
who are mothers to children under the age of 18 are being put behind bars for 20

399
00:27:22.431 --> 00:27:26.090
years or a lifetime sentence.
Can you explain that more to us?

400
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.420
<v 7>Absolutely.
It's happening because,
um,
it's a,</v>

401
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.120
it's a like a retaliation tactic.

402
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.860
It's used because if you don't cooperate in whatever the charges are,

403
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:41.490
and a lot of times the women really have no idea what's going on.
I mean,

404
00:27:41.491 --> 00:27:42.750
think about you.

405
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.010
Do you really know what your boyfriend or your husband is doing when they leave

406
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:49.650
you?
You don't.
And so you know,

407
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.310
they want you to then speak on information that you don't make up.

408
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:57.630
Information is people that you may not have even met in the conspiracy yet.

409
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.400
If you don't cooperate,
you end up getting hit with as Miss Alice described,

410
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.310
everything that's in that charge.

411
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.240
And then you ending up in life in prison because of the sentencing guidelines

412
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.600
and the guidelines chart and the fact that you are charged based on the amount

413
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:19.560
of drugs that is said to have not actually have.

414
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:24.270
So they,
it's a,
they call a ghost dope.
You don't even have to find it yet.

415
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:25.920
You'll be charged with it.

416
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.990
And that's how the system is being manipulated in so many women and girls of

417
00:28:29.991 --> 00:28:32.820
being caught and swept into the conspiracy.

418
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.270
And yet it's really conspiracy against our women.
And girls,

419
00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:41.420
<v 5>do you want to add to that mule shoe?
Um,</v>

420
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.210
no.
So I'm going to ask you a different question to add to,

421
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:48.840
but I just want to make sure that people understand what you've said because

422
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:53.220
this is really one of the key ways that when we talk about the war on drugs and

423
00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:57.420
the over prosecution of black and brown communities and the over criminalization

424
00:28:57.421 --> 00:28:59.320
that has happened,
these can pee.

425
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.490
Conspiracy charges are at the heart of how we talk about the war on drugs,

426
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.830
devastating impact on our communities,

427
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:13.010
but often what doesn't get talked about is the particular ways that it's played

428
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.940
out in the lives of women.

429
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:21.020
So Miyoshi I wanted to talk to you about this issue of conditions of confinement

430
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.740
for our women and mothers.
Um,
when,

431
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.800
when I was heading up an NGO on gender based violence,

432
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.240
some women who were previously incarcerated talk to me about how they had been

433
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.610
during Labor and childbirth shackled and,

434
00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:44.230
and I thought they were explaining to me like some crazy thing that was an ab

435
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:49.231
are in violation of practice and policy at a southern prison because they were

436
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:51.620
coming from Tennessee.
Um,

437
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:57.030
and I started to find out that actually shackling women during labor and

438
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:59.710
childbirth is standard procedure.

439
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:03.310
It was standard procedure in all of our federal correctional facilities.

440
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.770
Fortunately,
we were able to change that.

441
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:11.250
It remains standard procedure in most of our state prisons.

442
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.960
So let me be clear in what I'm saying.

443
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.380
When a woman behind bars who is pregnant is in labor and childbirth.

444
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.600
She is shackled,
shackled by her arms,
her legs.

445
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.050
I heard one case of a belly shackled during labor.

446
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.310
Can you talk to us more about this policy and the incredible work that you've

447
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:34.330
done to change it?

448
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.760
<v 6>So
I was one of those women.</v>

449
00:30:38.761 --> 00:30:42.390
I was illegally shackled and New York state.
Um,
they have,
uh,

450
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.410
we had a low of 2009 with law that banned the barberry Shakhlin and pregnant

451
00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:50.880
women when I went in and 2009,
I was pregnant.

452
00:30:50.881 --> 00:30:52.920
I gave birth to my daughter in 2010.

453
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.563
<v 4>And</v>

454
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.230
<v 6>when you're inside,</v>

455
00:30:56.231 --> 00:31:00.250
you don't know your rights and as one of the ways they control you by not

456
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:05.080
allowing you to educate yourself or to educate you on what your rights are.

457
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.240
So the less you know the best for them.

458
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.250
So I didn't know that it was illegal to shackle me while I was in labor are

459
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:15.640
delivering.
And my experience was,
I was.

460
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.620
So just imagine for me like for anyone giving birth,

461
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.780
like you're joyous moment,

462
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:25.840
a moment that she's supposed to be with your loved one,
shift family,

463
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:30.990
Sharon and welcome and anew life and that moment being distorted and corrupted

464
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.590
by a correctional officer who doesn't have any good intentions towards you.

465
00:31:39.311 --> 00:31:43.660
It's malicious energy.
And for me,
while I was giving birth,

466
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.730
I had the correction officers standing in between my legs while pushing while

467
00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:49.900
the doctor was pushing.

468
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.363
<v 4>And</v>

469
00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:52.660
<v 6>you know,</v>

470
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.260
you want to say something and you want to like trying to understand like how can

471
00:31:57.261 --> 00:31:59.360
someone in a right mind think it's okay.

472
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.560
Like how is this humanly possible that anyone in the world would think is okay

473
00:32:03.561 --> 00:32:08.561
for you to stand where I'm trying to deliver my baby and not only put my life I

474
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:13.700
raise but my child's life,
our risk.
So you not only stripped me of my dignity,

475
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.470
my respect,
my self worth,

476
00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.010
but you're going to put my life in danger and my child life in danger.

477
00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.960
So for me that was like a really hard part.
And then you know,

478
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:27.800
the correctional officer and the doctor was arguing because the doctor did

479
00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:30.320
understand like,
you know,
this is my job,
this is,

480
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.190
this was her job to deliver the baby and make sure the mom and the baby was okay

481
00:32:34.191 --> 00:32:37.220
and she couldn't do her job to the best of her abilities because of the

482
00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:41.030
correction officer but not the I gave birth.

483
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.530
They automatically handcuffed you right away.

484
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.090
Like you don't really even have a moment to bond but your child not to feed
them,

485
00:32:50.091 --> 00:32:54.480
not to just hold them and take in that precious moment.
And um,

486
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.300
at when you give birth,
they had seen to Westchester Medical Center.

487
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:04.301
So you are in a prison ward inside of Westchester Medical Center and then they

488
00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:07.410
bring you there in a shock when you handcuff you and they may allow you to see

489
00:33:07.411 --> 00:33:11.510
you judge howled maybe once or twice if you're lucky.
But in that process,

490
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.520
once again,
get shackled and you're handcuffed,

491
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:16.240
then it's the metal chain around your waist and this,

492
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.800
the handcuffs and it's that ankle shackles.

493
00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:22.880
And then you brought into a wheelchair to see your child and they remove just

494
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:27.070
the handcuffs.
So you literally cannot walk with your child.

495
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.020
And all of these things are illegal at the time and no one is held accountable

496
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:30.920
for these things.

497
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:36.070
So as a k for us to be putting into the criminal justice system for breaking the

498
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:36.441
law,

499
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:41.441
but it's okay for Department of correction to break in day in and day out.

500
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.920
Why?
Because they do not value our lives.
Black girls,
women,

501
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.220
our lives are not valued,
not in society,

502
00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:52.850
not in the current administrative system that we have right now.

503
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.020
Not inside a prison.

504
00:33:54.021 --> 00:33:57.740
I will lives are not valued and it was just another reminder.

505
00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.450
So at the,
I,
you know,

506
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.500
went through the whole process of being traumatized and humiliated and just I

507
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:09.760
thought like when I come home like I have to speak up.
Like,

508
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.860
cause if we don't speak up the ones who are being criminalized,

509
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:15.890
the ones who are being dehumanized and we don't speak up,

510
00:34:15.891 --> 00:34:20.891
then who will like it's our stories were the ones who is experienced in these

511
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:24.440
horrific industries.
Just injustices all the time.

512
00:34:24.441 --> 00:34:29.441
So I came home and I met with giant tomorrow who was at the Correctional

513
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.280
Association at the time and they came up to me and was like,
well,

514
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:38.690
where's you illegally shackled?
And I was like,
I was like,
I was so excited that,

515
00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:39.380
you know,

516
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.830
there was something and there was organizations and people out there that cared

517
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.920
and were fighting it.
So I got involved and what we did,

518
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:50.120
we spoke to legislators at Albany,
we had letters,

519
00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:53.130
we dealt with the media.
Um,

520
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.830
we did interviews and we rallies outside of the governor's office.

521
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.270
We fought and fought.

522
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:04.271
We made films about the experience of what we had to go through and we was able

523
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:07.490
to have this progressive law passed.

524
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:10.640
So we reinforced it 2000 the 2009 law.

525
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:15.680
And it also expanded it.
So your whole pregnancy,

526
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:20.681
you were not allowed to be shackled and handcuffed at all and you had the

527
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:26.060
privacy of not having to worry about a correctional officer being inside your

528
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:29.900
room.
I'll give him birth and it expanded so much.

529
00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:34.901
And [inaudible] New York state now has the most progressive,

530
00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:40.420
I'm anti shackling law in the country and it's because a woman directly
impacted,

531
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:41.280
you know,

532
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.990
speaking up in collaboration with allies and that would not have been possible

533
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:50.670
if it was not for the chances that we had to speak our piece and to make it

534
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:52.920
right and we have to continue to do this,

535
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:55.920
but any injustice that we witnessed or that we bear

536
00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:00.750
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

537
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.170
<v 5>you for your work to Pico.</v>

538
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:08.230
We are at this incredible moment around how finally it's a bipartisan

539
00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:14.960
conversation on ending mass incarceration.
Finally,

540
00:36:14.961 --> 00:36:19.961
we have Republicans and Democrats and in the public square talking about the war

541
00:36:20.871 --> 00:36:25.700
on drugs was an egregious violation of human rights.
Finally,

542
00:36:25.701 --> 00:36:28.880
we are saying that mass incarceration must end,

543
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:33.650
but the women who have been locked up,

544
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:38.830
who are still behind bars like Miss Alice are not part of these conversations.

545
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:45.490
What needs to happen in order to make sure that at this critical moment of

546
00:36:46.491 --> 00:36:50.750
reform,
the women are not left behind?
Well,

547
00:36:50.751 --> 00:36:54.650
what needs to happen is what's happening now.
You know,
um,
women like you

548
00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
<v 7>who are in these spaces who are making it necessary and a committing to this</v>

549
00:37:00.281 --> 00:37:05.281
work to allow us those who have been directly impacted to have our seat at the

550
00:37:05.381 --> 00:37:09.790
table.
Our mantra at the council is nothing about us without us.

551
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.460
And so that's because as Andrea had said earlier,

552
00:37:12.461 --> 00:37:17.260
we are the experts and how do you know what we need if you don't ask us and

553
00:37:17.261 --> 00:37:20.770
engage us in changing these laws and these policies.

554
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:24.280
And as Miss Alice said,
you know,
I just want to reinforce that.

555
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:29.310
Like if not you then who you can't look to your neighbor or look to someone else

556
00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:34.000
and say that it's their responsibility as humans in this,

557
00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.020
in this world.

558
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.980
It is our responsibility and commitment to one another in order to make sure

559
00:37:38.981 --> 00:37:41.110
that we are shifting this,

560
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:45.580
this disgusting criminal criminal justice system,

561
00:37:45.581 --> 00:37:48.100
and to a more human justice system.

562
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:54.490
<v 5>Yoshi,
I want to ask you as as we get ready to end this panel,
what,</v>

563
00:37:54.491 --> 00:37:58.570
what needs to happen to make sure that the stories,

564
00:37:58.571 --> 00:38:03.571
the lived experience and expertise of women is part of our conversation on

565
00:38:03.941 --> 00:38:04.930
racial justice?

566
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.460
<v 6>I think before we even say when Nacy be happen,</v>

567
00:38:08.461 --> 00:38:11.760
I think we need to recognize and acknowledge what has been happening.

568
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.020
So women on the inside always played leadership roles.

569
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.380
They may change when change was needed and New York state,

570
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.060
I can speak for New York state and New York state women brought college back.

571
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.840
They had the first HIV peer education program,

572
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:29.850
which is model across the whole country.

573
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:34.110
They also had the children's center impairment and centers like these are the

574
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:39.070
kinds of things that women before coming out and then now they're out in a still

575
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:39.491
fighting.

576
00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:43.690
So I feel like we just need to keep in mind like these are the women that we

577
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:45.010
need to have at the forefront.

578
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:48.640
These are the woman that had the experience and the expertise and these are the

579
00:38:48.641 --> 00:38:52.900
woman that are going to be change agent to shift away from that Perpetual,

580
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.520
perpetual punishment paradigm.
To one of accountability,
transformation and Halan.

581
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.640
So,
um,
when I talked about this panel to some folks,
the response was,

582
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:08.140
well,
so where's the policy person or the lawmaker?
And I said,
right here,

583
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.580
right you all

584
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.880
<v 8>are the ones that we need and we so desperately</v>

585
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.370
<v 6>really need your voices and we're,</v>

586
00:39:16.371 --> 00:39:20.380
we're deeply honored at Google to be able to have you here.
Thank you.
Thank you.

587
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.110
Hello everyone.
Hi,
my name is Markeesha.
Um,

588
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.960
I'm going to be doing a poem for you guys today.
Um,

589
00:39:34.961 --> 00:39:39.910
it's called imprisoned and it's about more than just being in prison physically.

590
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.800
It's about being in prison motion emotionally and mentally.
So I'm,

591
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.330
here I go.
It's called in prison.

592
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.373
<v 8>Okay.</v>

593
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.000
<v 9>Imprisoned in the dark and gloomy chamber.
I am in prison.</v>

594
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.990
My feet chained together,
hands chain behind me.

595
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.450
I'm afraid of what might happen if I fight.

596
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.220
So I sit silently in prison and a dark and gloomy chamber.

597
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.850
I am in prisoned mouth taped shut,
so I can't scream.

598
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.110
I closed my eyes and sleep so I can dream in prison in the dark and gloomy

599
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:18.340
chamber.
I am in prison,
hands and feet chained together with suffering,

600
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:19.420
depression and doubt,

601
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:23.020
but it doesn't take much to break these chains and get out in prison in a dark

602
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:26.680
and gloomy chamber.
I am in prison.
Mouth taped shut with words.

603
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:31.420
I can't speak words like I am smart.
I am pretty words like released me.

604
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:35.440
No longer in prison and a dark and gloomy chamber.
No longer am I in prison.

605
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.530
I found the key to remove these tapes where my hands and feet.

606
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.710
I'm not afraid to fight you fear so don't challenge me.

607
00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:45.610
No longer in prison in the dark and gloomy chamber.
No longer am I in prison.

608
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:48.220
Cut this tape from my mouth so I can scream and shout.

609
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:51.280
It's a great thing when you make a reality out of a dream.

610
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.150
No longer in prison and a dark and gloomy chamber.
No longer am I in prison.

611
00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:59.260
I stand fearless.
No longer in prison and a dark and gloomy chamber.

612
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:03.400
I stand worthy.
No longer in prison and a dark and gloomy chamber.

613
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:05.380
I stand peaceful.

614
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.830
No longer in prison in this dark and gloomy chamber.

615
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.010
No longer am I in prison.
Thank you.

616
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.180
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

617
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:21.430
<v 10>hello everyone.
My name is Ana Kasparian.
I come from a news background.</v>

618
00:41:21.431 --> 00:41:25.910
I'm a reporter and host at the young Turks,
which is a very progressive online.

619
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.020
Yeah,

620
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.480
<v 8>new show.
I just</v>

621
00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.320
<v 10>want to take a minute to thank the organizers of this event for giving the</v>

622
00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:37.940
privilege to be here and to be part of this and also to be inspired by the

623
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:40.250
resilience of the women that we've already heard from.

624
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.990
And of course there are more women that we're going to hear from.
Uh,

625
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.950
in this portion of the event,
I am going to speak to an incarcerated woman,

626
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.810
Miss Santra Rucker and also her daughter Sindia Riley.

627
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:58.870
And it's more about the difficulty of establishing a relationship as a woman who

628
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:04.430
has been incarcerated due to this egregious justice system,

629
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:07.460
establishing a relationship with your family members,
with your children.

630
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.670
We've already heard about the number of women who are incarcerated and do have

631
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:18.080
young children and have a difficult time having a relationship with them as a

632
00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:21.030
result of this.
So,
uh,
do we have a

633
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.313
<v 8>okay.
Sorry.</v>

634
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.670
<v 10>Oh,
we're gonna start with,
okay.
That's great.
Uh,</v>

635
00:42:24.671 --> 00:42:26.600
so we're actually gonna start with kin Sindia,

636
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.510
Riley and Kindi of Riley's.
I apologize.
Sorry about that.

637
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.613
Um,

638
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.873
<v 8>so,</v>

639
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.940
<v 10>okay.
Can we sit over there?
Okay,
great.</v>

640
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:43.783
<v 8>Okay.</v>

641
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.360
<v 10>Thank you so much for being here and having a conversation with me about</v>

642
00:42:54.361 --> 00:42:57.750
something that's so incredibly important and doesn't get talked about honestly

643
00:42:57.751 --> 00:42:59.880
in the field of work that I do in journalism.

644
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.520
So tell me a little bit about your story.

645
00:43:02.521 --> 00:43:05.220
What does it like establishing a relationship with your mother?

646
00:43:05.221 --> 00:43:09.850
I know that she was given a life sentence when you were two years old.
Okay.

647
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.870
<v 11>So,
um,
I'm,</v>

648
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:15.800
both of my parents had been incarcerated with life sentences since I was two.

649
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.890
So it's kind of been like,

650
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.520
like a seesaw between trying to communicate with the,
both of them.

651
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.510
And I was raised underneath my grandparents.
So when my mother went to prison,

652
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.540
obviously it was either she gives me to somebody else or I'd be in a foster home

653
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:34.010
or just under the care of somebody else.

654
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.280
So she gave power of attorney to my grandparents and in that time it was as if

655
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.420
the right relationship between my mother and my father and I had been

656
00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:46.190
transferred to my grandparents.

657
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:51.220
So it was as if they became my actual legitimate parents and the relationship

658
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:57.041
that you would typically have as a child where I would maybe talk to my mom and

659
00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:00.800
individually or ride in a car.
It ceased to exist.

660
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.780
All of our holidays,

661
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.350
whether it's Christmas or birthdays or anything,

662
00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:10.520
we had to go through it in a visiting room or it just,

663
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:13.190
we didn't ever had that physical relationship,

664
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.430
that caring and nurturing that there's just that availability for both of us to

665
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:23.120
sit down and be able to communicate thoroughly and adequately.

666
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:28.540
And I think that it's most effective when it comes to that actual like stable

667
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:34.680
relationship between the of you because no matter how much you talk on the phone

668
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:36.990
where you have 15 minute phone calls,

669
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:40.500
they cost $3 and you have 300 minutes a month.

670
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:45.090
The way that my father's visitation is set up is he can only get five visits a

671
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:48.540
month and out of 365 days,
that's just 60 visits a year.

672
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.050
So not only are we just restricted,

673
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:57.290
it's like we can never have a relationship with real sentimental value because

674
00:44:57.451 --> 00:44:59.010
once my parents come home,

675
00:44:59.011 --> 00:45:04.011
they don't truly know who I am and we have to sit and I guess take that and try

676
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:09.510
to build off of it.
And My mother has a release date now,

677
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.500
so it's six 2022 so it's about five or six years from now.

678
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:14.970
But when she comes home,

679
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:19.830
I'll be freshly graduated from college and it'll be the both of us sitting in a

680
00:45:19.831 --> 00:45:24.831
room while I'm an adult and I'm a grown woman at this point and she's older and

681
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:28.380
we're trying to place ourselves in a situation where we're getting to know who

682
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:33.150
each other really truly is.
And it's kind of devastating for the both of us.

683
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:37.140
And it's practically traumatic because we had,
we don't know anything.

684
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:42.380
And the things that she should know from me being two or three and watching me

685
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:47.490
grow and watching what I like and what I love that's absent and I don't know

686
00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:50.350
what she truly likes because even if it's,

687
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.690
it's not the same as if you're riding in a car with your parent and you sit down

688
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:59.130
and you hear a song and you say,
Oh,
I like this,
and she says she likes it too,

689
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.570
and then we can actually vibe and enjoy it together versus being on the

690
00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:08.130
telephone and I say,
oh,
I like this and she agrees and it's just not the same.

691
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.970
<v 10>I think a lot of times when we hear about incarceration and how we need to</v>

692
00:46:12.971 --> 00:46:15.820
reform our criminal justice system,

693
00:46:15.821 --> 00:46:18.310
and it's always funny to me that it's called the justice system.

694
00:46:18.311 --> 00:46:20.200
When there's such a lack of justice involved,

695
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.560
we don't really think about the impact it has on the family members of the

696
00:46:25.601 --> 00:46:27.100
person who gets incarcerated.
Of course,

697
00:46:27.101 --> 00:46:30.220
it's a massive injustice for the person who is incarcerated but also the family

698
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:33.220
members who are torn from their mothers and their fathers.

699
00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.520
And so I came across an event that you actually spoke at where you talked about

700
00:46:39.071 --> 00:46:42.700
the first time that you had physical contact with your mother.

701
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.140
And I thought that it was so incredible and it,

702
00:46:45.141 --> 00:46:48.010
it shared a perspective that I don't think most people really know about.

703
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:49.360
So can you talk about that a little bit?

704
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.720
<v 11>So I was speaking on,
I can't remember what event it was,</v>

705
00:46:53.721 --> 00:46:58.040
but once my,
my grandmother,
when I was younger,

706
00:46:58.041 --> 00:47:02.210
she used to take me to all the different places and my mother was first in

707
00:47:02.211 --> 00:47:04.640
Danbury,
Connecticut and we were living in Virginia.

708
00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.710
So that was also not even the hike.

709
00:47:06.711 --> 00:47:09.350
We had a fixed income as to Pico spoke of earlier.

710
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.580
So it was hard to travel hard to actually get that money to go there.

711
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:17.540
So mother's days we would go when I was young,
we would go when I was younger.

712
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.780
But when I became older it became a lot more difficult.

713
00:47:20.781 --> 00:47:24.770
We had a lot more responsibilities and I hadn't,

714
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.690
I didn't realize and I,
um,

715
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:30.160
it was over this past summer that I went to go visit her in and I hadn't

716
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:33.770
realized that I hadn't seen my mother for 10 years.
And,
uh,

717
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.360
when I went to go visit her at,

718
00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:39.490
the only thing I could remember was the smell of her hair and just sitting in

719
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:42.850
the visiting room,
seeing how happy and excited she wants to see me.

720
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:47.320
And then watching everything just unfold from the fact that the last time she

721
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:51.730
had actually seen me,
I was eight or nine years old and I was little,

722
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:54.370
I was innocent.
I hadn't been through all the,

723
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:58.110
like traumatic events in turmoil that I had a head,
um,

724
00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:01.140
endured at that point.
So looking at her,

725
00:48:01.141 --> 00:48:05.740
it was like looking at a complete stranger and I couldn't remember how she

726
00:48:05.741 --> 00:48:08.970
looked and just looking at her and telling,
um,

727
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.430
like my aunt who had visited with me and just saying,
wow,

728
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:16.810
we really do look alike.
And just kind of looking into her eyes and thinking,

729
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.370
I've never seen you like pass the photograph or I've only,

730
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.060
I've never heard your voice constantly in front of me,

731
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:26.440
like actually going through my ears.

732
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:28.510
So other than through like the static of a telephone.

733
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:33.190
And I think sitting there and smelling her and just taking me back to the

734
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:36.540
innocence of my childhood and just remembering that I'm in this,

735
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:39.160
I was in the same exact predicament as I was then.

736
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.160
<v 10>How has your experience with having an incarcerated mother impacted your future?</v>

737
00:48:47.901 --> 00:48:51.320
Because in every sense of the word,
you are a success story.

738
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:56.500
You have a successful academic career and you've persevered through what most

739
00:48:57.111 --> 00:48:59.870
people would stereotype is something that's impossible.
Right?

740
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.030
So can you talk to me a little bit about that?

741
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:06.160
<v 11>Um,
so I feel as though with the incarceration of both of my parents,
it,</v>

742
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.740
it's embedded like a sense of determination within me.
That's kind of,

743
00:49:09.741 --> 00:49:12.530
I feel like if I,
if they hadn't been incarcerated,

744
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.740
it wouldn't be as stable and there as it is because as when I was younger,

745
00:49:17.841 --> 00:49:19.710
when I was in elementary school,
um,

746
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.750
they said that I had behavioral issues and it was maybe the,

747
00:49:23.751 --> 00:49:28.130
I was in [inaudible],
which is a combination of first and second grade.
And I was,

748
00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.600
I would act up,
I would threaten my teachers,
I would do all of the above.

749
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:37.490
And one day I wrote a letter to my teacher threatening her and they had to get a

750
00:49:37.491 --> 00:49:41.780
police officer to come into the room and he had to tell me that threatening was

751
00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:45.710
a felony and that it was what basically was just irrefutable,

752
00:49:45.711 --> 00:49:49.700
you can't do that type of thing.
And my dean stopped and said,

753
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:53.450
you're so smart.
I don't understand why,
why are you doing it?

754
00:49:53.451 --> 00:49:56.510
And I told him that I wanted to go with my parents and be with my parents and I

755
00:49:56.511 --> 00:50:00.050
thought getting in trouble would place me in a situation where I go to prison

756
00:50:00.051 --> 00:50:01.160
with the both of them.

757
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.670
And then he explained that it would either get me in juvenile detention or I'd

758
00:50:04.671 --> 00:50:07.640
have to go to Merrimack,
which was the main institution of Virginia.

759
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:12.170
And from it was like that day forward,
I knew that there was like,

760
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:17.390
and it was physically impossible for me to be with them at all times and it just

761
00:50:17.391 --> 00:50:21.350
set a standard for me and an expectation that if I couldn't just,

762
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.050
I naturally had the ability to do well.

763
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:29.210
So why not just do well for the sake of them or the sake of myself?
Because if I,

764
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.510
and like in this the way they,
the police officer,

765
00:50:31.511 --> 00:50:34.670
he explained it and just saying how it's not the same.

766
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:39.320
I'm not going to be in a facility with them and it's not what I think it to be.

767
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:40.790
And just thinking of,
Oh,

768
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:45.350
I don't want to end up in that situation at all ultimately and just trying to be

769
00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:48.560
better and set the stakes and let them know that they,

770
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:52.040
so they wouldn't have that burden where they know their child.

771
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:55.220
And I know it's a lot of blame can go on the parents while they're in prison for

772
00:50:55.221 --> 00:50:57.470
what happens to the children while they're inside.

773
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.030
And I didn't want to be the one that ended up on the streets.
And my father,

774
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.400
when he was interviewed for humans in New York,

775
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.020
he said that I was the exception for a lot of his children.

776
00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.230
And just the fact that,
um,

777
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.640
he said I had a brother that I didn't even know about that as soon as he was

778
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:15.200
gotten prison,
about a year later,

779
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:19.310
he ended up being killed because of following the footsteps of Him.
And he said,

780
00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:22.880
it's children like me that should be the norm when they have an incarcerated

781
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:23.091
parent.

782
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:27.290
We should still be able to do well and still be able to excel and do things

783
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:27.831
differently.

784
00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:32.831
So I feel like my future's impact because it gives me a role and it gives me not

785
00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:36.170
only,
um,
which I've kind of found my voice because of Topeka.

786
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.360
I've found my voice truly and honestly,

787
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:43.220
because I had never spoke about it until I came to a point where I was so

788
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:43.851
destitute.

789
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:48.851
And by myself and alone and I was just hurting and it was everybody that my

790
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:51.800
grandmother had left me with had passed away.

791
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:56.150
So I was 18 living by myself about to go to college.
I was like,

792
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:59.540
there was no one to take me.
No one helped me with that transition.

793
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.360
And it just got to a point where I had nothing.
I didn't have any money.

794
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:06.980
And it grew to the point where I had to go and do everything by myself.

795
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.440
So when Topeka came and said,
hey,

796
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:11.630
would you like to speak on a panel about how it affects you?

797
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:16.910
I never really thought about how it majorly impacted my life and kind of I was

798
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:20.630
numb to it and it was just,
I was so succumb to feeling,

799
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:24.440
oh this like everything was normal.
Oh,
I'd go visit them,
a visitor rooms.

800
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:25.700
I talked to them on the phone.

801
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:31.120
It was just seeing my vulnerability and then realizing that every single time I

802
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:33.860
spoke it was like I was learning something different about myself.

803
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.220
So I feel like from an educational standpoint,

804
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:41.910
it shows that you can practically do anything and like,
um,
to be cassette early,

805
00:52:41.911 --> 00:52:46.911
I do a lot of stuff with grace so it makes me feel like I'm powerful that um,

806
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:48.740
I'm invincible and it makes,

807
00:52:48.741 --> 00:52:52.010
it really takes me to a point where it just because you don't have your parents,

808
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:56.060
you still have that ability to do better and go beyond when anybody can tell you

809
00:52:56.061 --> 00:52:56.930
that you can't do

810
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:58.483
<v 8>amazing.</v>

811
00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.670
<v 10>So I just wanted to quickly note on the young Turks,</v>

812
00:53:06.671 --> 00:53:09.880
we often bring up the issue of white privilege,
which you know,

813
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:13.690
unfortunately some of our audience members get very offended about.

814
00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:17.380
And the reason why I'm bringing that up right now is because these are the types

815
00:53:17.381 --> 00:53:19.660
of obstacles that you know,

816
00:53:19.661 --> 00:53:24.661
the disenfranchise have to persevere through in order to become success,

817
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:25.921
right?

818
00:53:25.921 --> 00:53:30.210
These are the issues that I think a lot of people don't realize occur that we

819
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:32.040
have a bias justice system,

820
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:36.690
that we have certain obstacles for certain communities that people like me don't

821
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:37.710
ever have to worry about.

822
00:53:37.711 --> 00:53:41.490
And that's the reason why I feel that it's important for someone like me to be

823
00:53:41.491 --> 00:53:43.400
an ally and hear stories like yours and,

824
00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:47.850
and do what I can to fight to reform the justice system that we have right now.

825
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.260
If there's one final thing that you would want everyone to know about how all of

826
00:53:52.261 --> 00:53:56.400
this has impacted you and your relationship with your family,
what would it be?

827
00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.030
<v 11>So I think,
and especially over the last couple of days,</v>

828
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:04.710
that just separating a mother from her daughter or a father from our daughter,

829
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:07.620
it's really just rifting.
And like I said earlier,

830
00:54:07.621 --> 00:54:12.270
it's really numbing where you get to this point that you want to know each other

831
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:17.100
so well and it seems so impossible because there's so many physical limitations

832
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.290
and monetary and just,

833
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:24.350
it's just so much stuff where it takes you away from it really ever.

834
00:54:24.721 --> 00:54:29.280
Having that capability to establish a real physical relationship.

835
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:34.020
And just the idea that if you're arguing,

836
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:38.580
if you're sad or you're having just a debate or just a bad day,

837
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.960
there is no way that you can just hop up and say,
I'm going to go visit my mom.

838
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.850
You have to sit on the phone.

839
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:49.560
And then from every single penny of every second you're talking,

840
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:53.970
it's going to either go to waste or go to a really good cause of talking on the

841
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:58.740
phone.
And I think more like lately with my mother,
it's been,

842
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:01.740
we have such limited time but,

843
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.160
and like it's like we're going and talking back and forth and battling about

844
00:55:05.161 --> 00:55:09.720
what we know about each other and what we don't.
And just to sit back and think,

845
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.840
if you are home,
we wouldn't have to do this.

846
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:17.640
Or to think about other daughters that might not have the majority that I have

847
00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:20.550
or might not have that ability to even talk.

848
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:25.910
And I just think that it's unfair to the children and it's just unfair to all of

849
00:55:26.071 --> 00:55:31.071
us are anybody who can sit and allow a parent to not be able to be with their

850
00:55:31.351 --> 00:55:36.351
child in some sense or just not to think about every single stipulation that

851
00:55:36.451 --> 00:55:41.280
surrounds being with their child and just thinking if you took yourself,

852
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:45.540
if you have a child yourself and you take yourself and separate them and put

853
00:55:45.541 --> 00:55:50.340
them in a room and you guys are just divided by these four walls and you have no

854
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:54.630
way of communicating with each other without her sliding a dollar under the door

855
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:59.640
or $5 for a limited amount of time and just thinking about how you could build

856
00:55:59.641 --> 00:56:03.600
that relationship or how that could taint you and it's just not,

857
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.690
I don't think that when they're making the policies and the legislation around

858
00:56:06.691 --> 00:56:10.200
it,
they don't think about us as the children.
They think about the crime,

859
00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:13.890
but they don't put in place that you're hurting us as well.

860
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.770
While my mom's in prison,
that puts me in prison too,

861
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.480
so it's not just affecting them.

862
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:21.660
We both have to live it together and simultaneously,

863
00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:24.010
<v 10>thank you so much for sharing your</v>

864
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.850
<v 2>story.
I appreciate it.</v>

865
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.290
<v 0>Uh,
leaves the stage.</v>

866
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:36.180
I want to acknowledge that not only is can be a powerful,

867
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:41.240
fierce woman advocate for so many other girls and boys who's parents are behind

868
00:56:43.561 --> 00:56:48.060
bars,
but can,
he is also a sophomore at the University of Virginia

869
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.170
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

870
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:57.380
<v 0>majoring in chemistry and minoring in astronomy.</v>

871
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.470
<v 2>So,</v>

872
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:04.640
<v 0>so we,
you know,</v>

873
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:09.670
because it's our commitment to bring in the voices of the women behind bars

874
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:15.610
where we have a little bit of time before we can bring candy as mom in through

875
00:57:16.761 --> 00:57:21.630
the phone.
We can't do it until two 10.
So before,
uh,

876
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:26.060
we bring candy mom,
uh,
onto the car.
I'm going to do two things.

877
00:57:26.061 --> 00:57:31.061
I'm going to ask Andrea James to join the stage with Kendzia and Anna to help

878
00:57:31.671 --> 00:57:33.470
represent a while.

879
00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:38.471
We're waiting for Sandra Rucker to join us to talk about more the experience of

880
00:57:40.161 --> 00:57:43.430
being a mother behind bars and that mother child bond,

881
00:57:43.431 --> 00:57:47.690
which as an a pointed out is rarely talked about,
right?

882
00:57:47.691 --> 00:57:52.040
When we have these conversations around the criminal justice system.

883
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:56.040
So I invite you on,
Anna.
Thank you for going with the flow horror.

884
00:57:56.041 --> 00:58:00.080
It's my pleasure.
And,
and before you all get started on that conversation,

885
00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.910
there are these pictures that had been flashing on the screens and these

886
00:58:04.911 --> 00:58:09.911
pictures are remarkable paintings done by women and girls behind bars as part of

887
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:15.860
an organization known as artistic noise.

888
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:21.040
It's a New York based organization that goes into our correctional facilities,

889
00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:27.310
adult and juvenile and gives young women and men and boys and girls and our

890
00:58:29.181 --> 00:58:34.181
elders the chance to have art in their lives as an opportunity to express their

891
00:58:35.061 --> 00:58:37.650
emotions,
their pain and their joy.

892
00:58:37.651 --> 00:58:41.900
So I want to acknowledge these beautiful paintings that artistic noise has

893
00:58:41.901 --> 00:58:43.430
allowed us to share with you.

894
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:51.490
<v 10>So I think it's also important to maybe focus a little bit on,</v>

895
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:55.810
you know,
the types of laws like the war on drugs and,
and you know,

896
00:58:55.811 --> 00:59:00.811
some of the influences behind those types of policies that lead to individuals

897
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:04.280
being incarcerated for ridiculous reasons.
Um,

898
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:09.340
so since I come from a news background and do a lot of reporting on the justice

899
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:12.430
system and also policies that politicians propose,

900
00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:16.960
there are a lot of financial interests at play that,
that force,

901
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:21.560
not force but influence politicians to push for sentencing.

902
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.070
Uh,
that's incorrect,

903
00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:28.100
incredibly harsh related to drug policy or for mandatory minimums,

904
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:32.480
things like that.
And so it's not,
it's not an accident.

905
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:37.460
What we're seeing in our justice system is a direct influence of things like

906
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:40.790
money and politics of private prisons in,
you know,

907
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:46.030
encouraging our representatives to pass legislation that would incarcerate

908
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:50.570
people for profit.
And so I don't want anyone to think that,
hey,

909
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:52.820
these are people who are just,
you know,
tough on crime.

910
00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:55.130
It's not being about tough on crime.

911
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:59.140
It's about victimizing people to make a dollar.
And,

912
00:59:59.141 --> 01:00:02.780
and I think that that's an important issue that everyone needs to focus on.
The,

913
01:00:02.781 --> 01:00:06.200
the women that we've heard from today are not criminals.

914
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:11.230
These are innocent individuals who have been victimized by an injust justice

915
01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:14.120
system were unjust,
I should say justice system.

916
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.880
So I can't help but share my opinion.
I don't,
I,

917
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:19.880
no one told me that I should or if I could,

918
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:23.720
but I can't help myself because this is something that I'm very passionate about

919
01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:28.520
and I really do want reform here anyway.
Uh,
so thank you for joining us,
Andrea.

920
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:32.660
Um,
so talk to me a little bit about your experiences.
I,

921
01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:36.740
you've been working in this line of work for a long time and I think it's so

922
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:37.760
incredibly important.

923
01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.720
Can we talk a little bit more about the positive impacts that,
you know,

924
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:46.550
women such as yourself have had,
uh,
in this,
in this space?

925
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.390
<v 1>Well,
sure.
I want to dial back just a little bit just so we can,</v>

926
01:00:51.391 --> 01:00:56.310
just so we can touch upon the issues that can dia was talking about because as
a,

927
01:00:56.311 --> 01:00:57.470
as a woman who taught,

928
01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:01.740
so I was a lawyer who was sentenced to serve a 24 month sentence in the federal

929
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:06.150
prison for women in Danbury,
Connecticut.
Okay.
I was allowed to self report.

930
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.720
I was a lawyer.
We were treated differently.
I showed up in court twice,

931
01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:12.780
wants to hear the charges against me and the other two here.

932
01:01:12.781 --> 01:01:14.460
What I was going to be sentenced to.

933
01:01:14.461 --> 01:01:19.461
I negotiated my sentence down from 63 months to 24 months and I went off and uh,

934
01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:24.900
serve my 24 months.
I happen to have older adults,
children at the time,

935
01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:29.370
but I also had a 12 year old daughter who's currently a sophomore at Spelman

936
01:01:29.371 --> 01:01:30.960
university,
Spelman College.

937
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.200
And I also had a baby boy who I had just given birth to who when I walked into

938
01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:39.810
that prison.
So my whole family took me to the prison.

939
01:01:39.811 --> 01:01:44.130
I again was treated differently than 99% of the women that I was incarcerated

940
01:01:44.131 --> 01:01:45.210
with.
Uh,

941
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:48.390
who had not seen their children since they were looking out the back window of a

942
01:01:48.391 --> 01:01:53.391
law enforcement vehicle and watching their babies being shuttled away by some

943
01:01:53.491 --> 01:01:56.130
other state actor.
Okay.

944
01:01:56.131 --> 01:02:01.131
And then I was in a prison with women who had not seen their children for six,

945
01:02:01.831 --> 01:02:02.340
seven,

946
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:07.290
eight years if they had seen them at all since they had been incarcerated.

947
01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:12.450
And the feeling of what that's like,
I,
you know,
my baby boy was five months old.

948
01:02:12.451 --> 01:02:16.500
I did not come home until he was two.

949
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.940
This is Sandra calling in.

950
01:02:17.941 --> 01:02:21.110
So I'm happy that cause I want to hear her voice and not mine.
Uh,

951
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.570
but those are the very real things that women who are incarcerated are dealing

952
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:27.330
with and not even being able to breathe.

953
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.320
I want to leave us with this point that for a woman who leaves her children

954
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:31.621
behind,

955
01:02:31.621 --> 01:02:36.330
we literally have to put our children on a shelf in order to breathe to get

956
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:38.250
through our sentence.
That is criminal.

957
01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.230
<v 8>Okay.</v>

958
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:43.063
<v 1>Yes.</v>

959
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:44.263
<v 12>Okay.</v>

960
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:46.690
<v 13>Okay,
great.
Uh,
my name is Ana Kasparian.</v>

961
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.500
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me.

962
01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.230
<v 12>Oh,
thank you.
Thank you for allowing me.</v>

963
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:58.380
<v 13>So we were just having a great conversation with your daughter about some of the</v>

964
01:02:58.381 --> 01:03:01.740
obstacles to,
you know,

965
01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:04.800
establishing a bond between the two of them.
And you know,

966
01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:06.270
we heard her side of the story,

967
01:03:06.271 --> 01:03:09.720
her perspective and I was hoping that we can also hear your perspective as well.

968
01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.013
<v 12>Okay.</v>

969
01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.560
Well the dynamic is like the dynamics of being an incarcerated.

970
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:23.570
It's really sensitive when it comes to a mother and daughter relationship
because

971
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:30.250
you don't want your child to have any type of resentment or anger because she

972
01:03:31.131 --> 01:03:35.710
feels abandoned or whatever the situation is due to my circumstances.

973
01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:40.490
And that'd be the come to prison.
Do you know?
These are the things that I hope,

974
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.370
but you know,

975
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:46.940
people might feel that it's wrong for me to say.

976
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.460
Like I'm not really remorseful

977
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:54.380
for the things that led me to come to prison.
In fact,

978
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:59.470
I think that the greater gravity was my choice and my poor choices at the time.

979
01:04:01.341 --> 01:04:05.810
I didn't think of those choices that those choices would affect my children or

980
01:04:05.811 --> 01:04:10.790
my family because I was doing the things that I love to do at the time.

981
01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:13.550
So at the same time,

982
01:04:13.551 --> 01:04:18.551
I don't want to beat myself up for my past to make my relationship better with

983
01:04:19.011 --> 01:04:23.090
my daughter because I can't change the past,
you know?

984
01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:27.770
So what I'm doing is I'm trying to benefit from it from the past and move on.

985
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.600
But in my own beliefs up,

986
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:34.700
I believe that Karma plays a big part and the condition of my imprisonment

987
01:04:35.211 --> 01:04:37.100
because that's my personal belief,

988
01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:42.680
but at the same time I believe that whatever you are and whatever you are not,

989
01:04:42.681 --> 01:04:47.360
you earn it whether it's good or bad and whatever you are or whatever you are,

990
01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:49.940
not you.
This call is from a seat,
a little cousin,

991
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:55.210
and right now I feel like I have changed dramatically and not have inclined

992
01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:59.150
raise my level of consciousness to a higher vibration.

993
01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:04.100
So what did I can be able to be active with my daughter to show love for my

994
01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:04.934
daughter,

995
01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:09.740
to do the things not trying to make up for my past with the things that a mother

996
01:05:09.741 --> 01:05:12.740
would do.
I tried to do these things over the phone,

997
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.740
30 emails through visitation,

998
01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:21.190
sending things to my daughter to show her that I love her and that I am sorry to

999
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:25.750
not be there.
So in my absence I do things but my heart

1000
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:35.180
<v 13>a little bit about what it was like to have physical contact with you for the</v>

1001
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:40.090
first time.
I'm curious to hear what that felt like for you

1002
01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:45.190
<v 12>because you don't know</v>

1003
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:51.160
what to say.
Like,

1004
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:52.930
I want it to be a mother,

1005
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:57.931
but I didn't want to act too over protective because of my absence due to my

1006
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:03.340
absence.
But I wanted to show her that.
Yeah,
true.

1007
01:06:03.341 --> 01:06:06.130
I am your mother and I want you to be open with me.

1008
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.590
I want you to understand me,

1009
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:12.460
and I want you to learn who I am through visitation.

1010
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:14.650
Because we only would talk over the phone.

1011
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:21.300
And it was kind of a bonding time where I looked at her and she looked at me

1012
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:27.130
and,
and,
but at the same time,
I didn't know what to say.

1013
01:06:27.131 --> 01:06:29.140
I didn't know if I should touch her.

1014
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.010
I didn't know if she would reject me.

1015
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:42.160
So I watch how other people in a visitation with their children.

1016
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:46.420
So does,
I can learn that,
okay,
this is our right to hold that in.

1017
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.200
This is our right to do this.
Well,
this is our rights to do that.

1018
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.760
But it was pretty,

1019
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:56.850
it was more emotional for me when I came back because I would like,

1020
01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.670
I wish I would've said this.
I wish I would have said that.

1021
01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.190
And when she came to visit me,
my other family was there,

1022
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.480
my sister and my nephew.
So it's kind of,

1023
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.450
I couldn't be as personal as I wanted to be,

1024
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:14.170
let's say the things that I really wanted to because it was so long.
It was,

1025
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.760
it had been 10 years before I said before,

1026
01:07:16.761 --> 01:07:19.390
I say my family and my daughter.

1027
01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.880
So it was really hard.

1028
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:25.830
It's even harder when you have to come back from visitation

1029
01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:31.840
to be around total strangers that you don't love and that you don't know,

1030
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.800
you know?
So I'm sorry,
can you hear me?

1031
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.070
<v 13>Yes,
I can hear you.
Thank you so much for sharing your story.
It's,</v>

1032
01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:44.120
it's through several members of the audience that are in tears right now over

1033
01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:47.260
your,
what you're saying.
Um,

1034
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:50.620
so India has done incredible things with her life.

1035
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:55.270
She is a sophomore at the University of Virginia.
She's studying,
you know,

1036
01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:59.350
majors that I can't even wrap my brain around.
She's an incredible young woman.

1037
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.040
And so what are your feelings about that?

1038
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.760
<v 12>I wonder if my hat made her life better because she was raped,</v>

1039
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:20.000
raped by the same parents as me.
That's my mom the day.
So I know,

1040
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.330
I knew she would be a good person,
a loving person.

1041
01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:28.490
You know what,
I'm glad.
I feel like she's the better side of me.

1042
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:30.170
You know?

1043
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:35.090
Like I feel like I could make it and I didn't make it and I wasn't successful.

1044
01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:39.540
Like I want this to be,
I see good that with her doing it,

1045
01:08:39.541 --> 01:08:43.910
it makes me feel proud because she is,
she's a part of me,

1046
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:44.893
you know?

1047
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:49.310
And I knew that she would do great things and I just always knew that she has,

1048
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:50.970
she has great potentials,

1049
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:56.470
so I wasn't shocked that she would be as productive and intelligent as she is

1050
01:08:56.751 --> 01:09:00.130
and everything that she says play in,
you know?

1051
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.190
So I knew that he would be all right,
you know?

1052
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.120
But I often wonder if I was home to raise her,

1053
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:12.520
which she has taken that route,
you know?
Oh,

1054
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:17.240
maybe my poor choices would have incepted her and affected her,

1055
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.400
you know?

1056
01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.300
So I was Kinda glad to be asked then in a way so that she could have the perfect

1057
01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:24.134
life.

1058
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:32.090
<v 13>You shared with us that you fortunately finally have a release date.</v>

1059
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:37.150
And so I'm curious what you maybe fantasize about doing with your family doing

1060
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.730
with India when you are released.

1061
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:46.930
<v 12>Well,
a lot of tops I see other subtle,
a lot of prisoners that lead,</v>

1062
01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.910
they make big plans and the oldest seem to be somewhere lost in the attic when

1063
01:09:51.911 --> 01:09:52.744
they get home.

1064
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.330
But I know one of the biggest problems that my family faith is financial

1065
01:09:58.331 --> 01:09:59.164
problems.

1066
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:04.490
So I've been into your studying how to learn the different grants that's

1067
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:09.500
available when I get out the different loans that they have were convicted felon

1068
01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:12.370
and try to use those things.

1069
01:10:12.371 --> 01:10:15.910
Please open up a restaurant where my family could benefit from.

1070
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:21.630
And I think that financing is a great important for everybody in life because

1071
01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:24.010
without money you can't really do anything.

1072
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.030
And I believe that we can come together as a family and be productive and to

1073
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:34.031
have fun and go places and travel and do the things not to make up for lost

1074
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.990
time,
but for the now,
you know.

1075
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:40.570
And so I hope to have a restaurant when I get out.

1076
01:10:40.571 --> 01:10:45.571
I took call an area art and I told Kenya how to bake over the telephone.

1077
01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:50.620
So I'm hoping that I could do that,
not just for myself but for my family.

1078
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:55.030
You know,
that's one of the main things and I just want to be,

1079
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:59.740
I just want to be a mother to my daughter and those things I have tried to do

1080
01:10:59.741 --> 01:11:03.760
from prison,
you know,
which I have great limitations here,

1081
01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:07.570
but I believe when I get home it could be better.

1082
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.830
Would it be pissed on my daughter because of my daughter,

1083
01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.340
daughter feels bad at her.
Well,

1084
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:19.200
she feels any resentment or she feels any anger towards my absence,

1085
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.760
then it's going to be quite difficult for me to do the things that I would love

1086
01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:26.280
to do and have been a great desire to do.

1087
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.760
But it has to be a mutual agreement.

1088
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:35.550
And I just hope to be the most successful person that I can be.

1089
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:40.790
I want to be the person that I wasn't in 1999 before I came to prison.

1090
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.990
So I have high goals,
I have high standards,
I have high principal,

1091
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:50.460
and I believe that with God being in my life,
that these,

1092
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.920
these things are manifested in before I even come home,
you know,

1093
01:11:55.921 --> 01:12:00.270
so I'm not waiting for the manifestation that take place when I walk out the

1094
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:03.790
door.
Um,
I'm preparing it now through my provisions,

1095
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:06.780
through my prayers and through what I know,
which is my belief.

1096
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:11.520
But I believe that we were all one and we'll be one.

1097
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:17.300
It's Kinda hard to be one from prison because of the barricades that we say,

1098
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.960
but hopefully I hope that through my mom and dad,

1099
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:24.090
that the love that they instilled in me,

1100
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.940
the human compassion that they instilled in me,

1101
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:31.050
that they instilled those things to pick India.
So when I get home,

1102
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:36.570
everything will be as if I never left.
And that's how I would like it.

1103
01:12:36.571 --> 01:12:40.750
That's how I would want it to be.
One I touched,
you know,
home,

1104
01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.650
I'm sorry I get on the way.
Emotional.
What she knows.

1105
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:51.240
I'm sorry.
No,
go ahead.
Yeah,
but you know,

1106
01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:53.070
I understand where I am.

1107
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.460
I understand the circumstances of my life and they've visited,

1108
01:12:56.550 --> 01:13:01.020
took shape to get me here and the people who are gravitated to,

1109
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.820
but doing that era of the eighties that was like the end thing.

1110
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:07.980
This call is from the seat of the prison.

1111
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.040
What was happening in that it's hot and the decision set up made were what were

1112
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:18.690
good decision.
It was just normal and typical for people my age in that area.

1113
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.040
<v 10>Sorry to interrupt you.</v>

1114
01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:25.640
I just want to let you know that we might lose you soon and if we do,

1115
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:29.420
I just want to thank you for your time and thank you for speaking with us and

1116
01:13:29.421 --> 01:13:30.470
sharing your story.

1117
01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:33.400
<v 12>No,
and I thank you for allowing me.</v>

1118
01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.290
I thank you for having human compassion to be able to be attentive audience to

1119
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:41.620
this like this as a shift of awareness and note it.

1120
01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.040
I just know everything is going to be all right just from speaking to y'all.

1121
01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:48.580
And I think you all can make a big difference.
And I thank you again.

1122
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:54.490
I really do because you haven't influential power that can change a lot and just

1123
01:13:56.111 --> 01:14:00.610
from the audience being there today,
this shows that everybody,

1124
01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:04.930
destiny and their destiny and fate can change and you could be really

1125
01:14:04.931 --> 01:14:09.931
influential in a carriage and two prisoners as well because it's difficult.

1126
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:14.410
It's very difficult,
difficult for our children and for us as prisoners.

1127
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.370
But I thank you as well.
Sorry I'm crying.

1128
01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.880
<v 0>Do you have no reason to apologize?</v>

1129
01:14:20.881 --> 01:14:22.980
Please take care of yourself and thank you again.

1130
01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:25.283
<v 12>You</v>

1131
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:32.930
<v 0>who Google where working at Google is like understanding jazz that,</v>

1132
01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:36.270
you know,
somebody's been here some as we've been there.
So this is awesome.

1133
01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:41.220
This is a very googly because this is very much like an act of jazz.
Um,

1134
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.950
I know that it's,
it's a lot to hold all of the,

1135
01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:51.340
the ways in which we are bearing witness and being proximate to what the costs

1136
01:14:51.411 --> 01:14:55.700
of incarceration has been to our mothers and our daughters.

1137
01:14:55.990 --> 01:15:00.990
But I think it's important to stay present because it's not only an issue of

1138
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:07.390
placing and over criminalizing and relegating our women and mothers to

1139
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:10.550
incarceration.

1140
01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:15.690
It is also a narrative of what is happening to our girls and there's a lot of

1141
01:15:15.921 --> 01:15:19.940
conversation around the school to prison pipeline,

1142
01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:25.180
but there's not conversation around how the girls fit into that pipeline and how

1143
01:15:26.241 --> 01:15:31.220
in many ways the girls have a separate pipeline into the juvenile justice

1144
01:15:31.221 --> 01:15:32.054
system.

1145
01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:37.060
We wanted this panel to be able to surface some of the lived experiences and the

1146
01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:42.110
lived expertise around what is happening to our girls.

1147
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:44.120
So if we could start with charity,

1148
01:15:44.121 --> 01:15:46.760
if you could each introduce yourselves and then we'll talk.

1149
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:50.420
<v 14>Yes.
Hello everyone.
My name is charity Chandler Cole.</v>

1150
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:55.450
I am a social justice advocate and I advocate for various social justice issues

1151
01:15:55.521 --> 01:15:57.200
such as criminal justice reform,

1152
01:15:57.201 --> 01:16:01.220
human sex trafficking and foster care and I sit on various boards and committees

1153
01:16:01.221 --> 01:16:05.240
throughout the state that addressed these issues.
Hi,
I'm going to have to know,

1154
01:16:05.241 --> 01:16:09.410
my name is Michelle [inaudible] for the task force on an ending course

1155
01:16:09.411 --> 01:16:14.360
incarceration in New York City for [inaudible].
Hi,
my name is Sarah.

1156
01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:17.390
I'm actually also part of the task force and I'm also,

1157
01:16:17.391 --> 01:16:19.880
I'm working at the [inaudible] Institute of Justice in New York City.

1158
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.890
<v 0>So beginning with charity.</v>

1159
01:16:22.891 --> 01:16:27.891
If you could each talk about how you were placed into the juvenile justice

1160
01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.660
system and your experiences there.
There.

1161
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.741
<v 14>Absolutely.</v>

1162
01:16:31.741 --> 01:16:36.741
So at the age of 10 my mother was going through a divorce and she got breast

1163
01:16:37.231 --> 01:16:41.580
cancer at the same time and she pretty much afterwards went through a state of

1164
01:16:41.581 --> 01:16:43.200
depression,
stress and anxiety.

1165
01:16:43.201 --> 01:16:47.370
And she basically just gave up on the six children she had.

1166
01:16:47.371 --> 01:16:49.410
And we kind of had to fend for ourselves.

1167
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:53.160
My older sister in at the juvenile justice and foster care system at the age of

1168
01:16:53.161 --> 01:16:56.340
12 so when I was 14 I was the big sister.

1169
01:16:56.341 --> 01:17:00.600
I was the mother and I did everything I could to provide for my four younger

1170
01:17:00.601 --> 01:17:05.601
siblings while we were on welfare at the age of 16 I got caught stealing

1171
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:11.150
underwear from Ross.
Nothing cute.
It was Haynes,
you know,
from a siblings.

1172
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:15.860
So it was,
you know,
simply out of a peer desire of need for my family.

1173
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:20.510
And the police caught him,
my mother to pick me up and she said take her to jail.

1174
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.561
And they did.

1175
01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:25.670
And my mom at the time use the foster care system and juvenile justice system to

1176
01:17:25.671 --> 01:17:27.320
kind of one by one,
you know,

1177
01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:32.090
get rid of the children that she no longer desire to have.
At the time.

1178
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:33.670
It wasn't because she just didn't love us.

1179
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.800
She just didn't know how to take care of us any longer after you know what she

1180
01:17:36.801 --> 01:17:41.270
experienced.
I um,
from there,
after there,

1181
01:17:41.271 --> 01:17:44.750
I spent the next two years in and out of juvenile hall and foster care.

1182
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:49.790
No one at any point ask my mother,
why do you want your child to go to jail?

1183
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:51.860
You know,
why is she stilling underwear?

1184
01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:56.030
What situation is happening in your family to cause your daughter to,
you know,

1185
01:17:56.090 --> 01:18:01.070
still underwear?
Um,
here are some alternatives to incarceration.
I was just,

1186
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.470
you know,
they said,
okay.
They hung up the phone,

1187
01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:07.010
they handcuffed me and put me in the back of their patrol car book to me and

1188
01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:08.270
took me to juvenile hall.

1189
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.660
I at that very moment realize that my life had zero value and that I could

1190
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:19.001
easily be discarded and put away my experience in the juvenile justice system

1191
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.270
and the foster care system were horrid and I experienced and was exposed to

1192
01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:26.210
things I probably would have never experienced,
you know,

1193
01:18:26.211 --> 01:18:31.100
living in the streets and in gang infested and drug infested neighborhood I any

1194
01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:35.240
ounce of self esteem and confidence I have when out the window and I was

1195
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:36.590
constantly degraded.

1196
01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:41.650
I felt enslaved and I was psychologically abused and sexually exploited while in

1197
01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:43.100
the fall in the system.

1198
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.310
And because of what I experienced and because of the filling of,
you know,

1199
01:18:47.311 --> 01:18:49.790
abandoning the four siblings that needed me,

1200
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:52.100
who was going to feed them and take care of them,

1201
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:56.480
who's going to walk them to school the next day,
just filming,
you know,

1202
01:18:56.481 --> 01:19:00.950
completely just abandoned alone and worthless.
I left the system,

1203
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:05.030
determine that I was going to work my ass off for the rest of my life to help

1204
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:05.864
change it.

1205
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.923
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1206
01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:18.160
<v 15>Um,
well everything has led to one,
almost 13.
Amani 20.
Um,</v>

1207
01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.960
I came here,
I did notice,

1208
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:24.970
speak English at all and my mother was working seven days a week.
Um,

1209
01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:30.370
and,
um,
the only person that I knew it was my mother and they,
nobody else.

1210
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.030
When I went to school,
I,
my,

1211
01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.280
my school class was only Spanish,

1212
01:19:36.281 --> 01:19:39.490
so I didn't need it really learn English at all.

1213
01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:42.790
And when I was going to school,

1214
01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:47.050
I was shy.
I didn't talk to the other kids.

1215
01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:52.120
And then one time I just went to Mcdonald's and I met this guy and you know,

1216
01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.190
like he was much older than me,

1217
01:19:54.191 --> 01:19:56.890
keeping in mind that I was only 13 and you're like,
uh,

1218
01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.790
he talked to me and you know,
like I say,
my mother was never time.
No,

1219
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.880
never had the time to be with me.
And I,

1220
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:06.760
the reason why I moved to new to United,

1221
01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:11.640
it was because I wanted to have the mother and daughter relationship because my

1222
01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:15.630
mother all the time she was working.
And,
um,

1223
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:20.580
and then this guy who,
you know,
treat me right,
quote unquote,

1224
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:24.450
who pay attention to me,
make me,
uh,
being in the idea of been in love.

1225
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:27.600
And one time,
um,
you know,
like I was going crazy,

1226
01:20:27.601 --> 01:20:31.390
the only person that I really pay attention to and once I,

1227
01:20:31.391 --> 01:20:35.040
we just went to the mall and like,
he stole a tee shirts from JC penny,

1228
01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:39.990
25 bucks and you know,
um,
we got caught and you know,
he was like,
oh,

1229
01:20:39.991 --> 01:20:42.780
Michelle,
take charge,
take charge.
They're not going to do nothing to you.

1230
01:20:42.781 --> 01:20:47.670
You're underage.
And I was like,
no,
it's not my full.
And he's like,

1231
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.110
oh,
he's a argument with me.

1232
01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:51.150
And of course you don't want to be mad with the purse.

1233
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.980
You don't want the person to be mad at you,

1234
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:56.310
the only person who's paying attention to you.
So I said,
yeah,

1235
01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:59.970
I take the charge and then I will spend an eye,
uh,
the person.

1236
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:02.220
And then my mother came,
took me into the next day,

1237
01:21:02.221 --> 01:21:05.790
I run away and went back to him and he like,
this was like,
um,

1238
01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:10.020
family core and my lawyer was like,
oh,
just Michelle,

1239
01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:13.320
just take the charge is going to be 18 months of probation.
And of course,

1240
01:21:13.321 --> 01:21:17.900
you know,
like I did not know nothing.
I didn't speak English.
My lawyer was um,

1241
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.850
only speak English.
So it was really,
really hard.

1242
01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:25.020
The interpreter was there only for like two minutes.
And I was like,
yeah,
sure,

1243
01:21:25.021 --> 01:21:29.700
whatever.
Um,
and then I wanting me to another stop missing school.

1244
01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:33.870
I got pregnant at 15,
I was in seventh grade and you're like,
oh,

1245
01:21:33.871 --> 01:21:38.040
this thing crash.
I,
I run away,

1246
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:39.970
got a warrant.
Then I,
uh,

1247
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.410
violation of probation went back cause I always wanted to do the right thing.

1248
01:21:43.411 --> 01:21:45.690
I always want it to be somebody but never,

1249
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:49.470
nobody asked me why I was doing what I was doing,
what I wanted to be,

1250
01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.960
where am I going,
what is my future?
Right.

1251
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:55.500
And at the end I went back,
I try,

1252
01:21:55.530 --> 01:22:00.360
I try to do things right but there was no support at all.

1253
01:22:00.361 --> 01:22:01.230
And you know,

1254
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:06.290
I was a teenage mom and I Japan drop out of middle school and every graduated

1255
01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:11.940
and I just,
I couldn't take it any longer.
And I,

1256
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.810
my probation officer by me again,
I ran away.

1257
01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:21.140
Then the judge said that I was a runner and he put me in a secure facility in

1258
01:22:22.201 --> 01:22:26.130
New York and I spent like a pie a six to eight months in there.

1259
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.570
And after that I went to the um,
a group home close to home,
you know,

1260
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:34.460
secure facility.
And I was uh,

1261
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.210
it was when it starts to speak in English was when I was in this secure facility

1262
01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:41.250
cause nobody speaks Spanish over there.
But I could,

1263
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:45.900
I could put together the images,
what I see,
what I hear and it was amazing.

1264
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:49.140
But you know,
like at the first time when I was there I couldn't eat.
Why?

1265
01:22:49.141 --> 01:22:52.980
Because I didn't like the food.
Like I just,
I couldn't take it.

1266
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.140
Nobody want there.
How he lost 10,
20 pounds in a month over there.

1267
01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.830
And you know,
like,
um,
when I got out,

1268
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.460
I spend like two months in a group home,
but I was always scared,
you know,

1269
01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:10.580
like people talk about Rikers island is secure facility and how bad it is.

1270
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.240
And I was like,
damn,
I don't want to go there.

1271
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.290
I was so afraid because at that time I didn't have papers at all.
And,

1272
01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.860
and then I was like,
if I do something and then was this girl,

1273
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:22.960
she was 15 and tried to fight me and I was like,

1274
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:26.860
I can't get into her cause you know,
like,
what is next?
Next thing you know,

1275
01:23:26.861 --> 01:23:30.520
I'm going to get deported.
I can't do that.
Have a child and I want something,

1276
01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:32.290
I want to do something with my life.

1277
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:36.910
And then I got moved to the foster care system where,
you know,
um,

1278
01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:40.720
I spent about two years in there and I met this amazing work and then I made my

1279
01:23:40.721 --> 01:23:45.670
mentor and everything started being put in together,
went to school,
got my GED,

1280
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:47.740
and then like when I was going to school,

1281
01:23:47.741 --> 01:23:51.460
it's when I see when I got to sit down with people that has been decades of

1282
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:55.090
their life and press them in how much they stuff for.

1283
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:58.810
And then I will ask them,
why you don't do something about it?
Looping like,
no,

1284
01:23:58.811 --> 01:24:00.280
they're waiting for the other person.

1285
01:24:00.281 --> 01:24:04.150
And then I decided to be that person and you know,
um,

1286
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:07.540
if there's one thing that I will,
that I have to go back to,

1287
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:12.250
I wouldn't change it even though I would love to have been for my daughter or

1288
01:24:12.251 --> 01:24:14.500
this time,
but I am where I am because I,

1289
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.070
everything that I had done and I'm liking myself,

1290
01:24:18.071 --> 01:24:19.870
I'm starting to love myself.

1291
01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.780
<v 16>I'm just listening to,
to you ladies.</v>

1292
01:24:28.781 --> 01:24:31.190
I mean it's just echoing the same thing that,
you know,
um,

1293
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.100
I was 14 the first time that I was involved with the system and I mean I was in

1294
01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:39.700
the back of the police car or 14 years old handcuff because of a fight that

1295
01:24:39.701 --> 01:24:43.390
happened at home.
And um,
you know,
my parents,

1296
01:24:43.391 --> 01:24:47.560
I mean they stay together,
they're still together today and you know,

1297
01:24:47.561 --> 01:24:51.520
coming from Long Island,
which is a suburban community,
um,
you know,

1298
01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:54.220
that's not something that is the norm there.

1299
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:57.100
So parents are limited resources on what to have.

1300
01:24:57.101 --> 01:25:00.910
Like what do you do when your child is out of control or what do you do when you

1301
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:03.670
know your kid is skipping school?
And in that case,

1302
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:08.410
the cops were called and I was placed in handcuffs and the whole ride at 14,

1303
01:25:08.411 --> 01:25:12.200
too.
I didn't even know where I was going.
And I went,

1304
01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:17.080
I ended up getting taken to the family court and that there was a petition

1305
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:19.030
filed,
a pins petition at the time.

1306
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.560
And it was just so chaotic that I had no idea what was happening.
I just thought,

1307
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:24.970
well,
I must have committed a crime.

1308
01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:27.550
Must've done something wrong because I'm in the back of this car.

1309
01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:32.970
And that just continued on from age 14 on until 18.

1310
01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:36.820
And I just kept going back and forth to court.
Also in school,

1311
01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:42.450
I was considered homeless because I didn't live at home and I was actually

1312
01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:48.670
kicked out of three different high schools and it was very chaotic.
And people,

1313
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:52.150
um,
in the school district didn't understand why I was acting out.

1314
01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:57.370
I was disrupting class.
It was disrupting everything that came into my path.

1315
01:25:57.371 --> 01:26:02.371
I just destroyed it because I didn't have any support at home and everything

1316
01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:04.850
seemed,
it was fine from the outside,

1317
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:08.060
but no one was asking those questions to find out what was really going on.

1318
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:10.430
And there was,
at the time,

1319
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:14.330
there is a probation officer's station in the school district and she would,

1320
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:18.380
you know,
full uniform school resource officers,
what they're called now.

1321
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.250
And she would come to class and make sure I was in class and all my classmates

1322
01:26:22.251 --> 01:26:26.780
thought that I was a problem.
No one wanted to hang out with me.
Um,
you know,

1323
01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:27.501
my friends,

1324
01:26:27.501 --> 01:26:30.950
their parents wouldn't allow them to hang out with me because I was a problem

1325
01:26:30.951 --> 01:26:31.784
child.

1326
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:36.920
So that continued and eventually I ended up in independent living.

1327
01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:41.030
So when I turned 16,
I was eligible to go to this group home with other girls.

1328
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:45.500
And,
um,
I started experimenting with drugs.
I was smoking weed.

1329
01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:47.360
I mean I just wanted some kind of escape,

1330
01:26:47.361 --> 01:26:50.150
like some kind of release because I didn't have any,

1331
01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.830
I didn't feel any connection to anyone,
not even to myself.
So,
you know,

1332
01:26:54.831 --> 01:26:57.980
and then family core,
going back and forth to court during that time,

1333
01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:01.760
the legal aid who was supposed to be representing me didn't ask me,

1334
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:02.630
what do you want?

1335
01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.690
What's going on or what's going on at home or where do you want to go?

1336
01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:10.220
So I just kind of cycled through the system.
And when I aged out at 18,

1337
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.930
there was no,
um,
plan.
Like there was no nowhere for me to go.

1338
01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:16.370
It was just like,
well,
you're,

1339
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.660
you've aged out of this system and now we're just going to leave you to your own

1340
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:21.494
devices.

1341
01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.820
And what ended up happening was because I had no relationship with my family

1342
01:27:25.821 --> 01:27:29.900
that wasn't reconciled all those years from 14 to 18,
um,

1343
01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:34.700
I ended up moving in with a boyfriend of mine.
And by the time I turned 19,

1344
01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:36.680
actually seven years to the day,

1345
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:41.740
I was arrested for my part in a robbery and I was tried as an adult and I served

1346
01:27:42.501 --> 01:27:47.300
time in jail.
And,
um,
it's just been,
it's,
you know,

1347
01:27:47.301 --> 01:27:49.940
that all those missed opportunities from when I was younger.

1348
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:53.090
And it just seems so simple now when I look back on it,

1349
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.900
that all somebody had to do was ask me what is going on with you?

1350
01:27:56.901 --> 01:27:59.480
Or how can we help you?
Or how can we support you?

1351
01:27:59.481 --> 01:28:03.560
And that simple question could have changed the trajectory of my whole life.

1352
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:07.430
And it's just been such a struggle now from being a girl and now being an adult

1353
01:28:07.431 --> 01:28:09.530
woman with this felony conviction.

1354
01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.580
And it's been so challenging to find a job.
And,
and you know,

1355
01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:18.380
I'm not representative of the population of girls that are in the system.
I mean,

1356
01:28:18.381 --> 01:28:20.780
it disproportionately affects women and girls of color.

1357
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:23.810
And I feel like it's a responsibility that I have.

1358
01:28:23.811 --> 01:28:27.980
And then I hope that those listening and those here today can understand that

1359
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.400
like we have a responsibility to speak out about it because that's the only way

1360
01:28:31.401 --> 01:28:34.220
that we're going to change the hearts and minds of people that can make

1361
01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:38.160
decisions.
And um,
yeah.
So it's just been challenging.

1362
01:28:38.161 --> 01:28:42.530
And if we can change things from the front door,
which is the girl system,

1363
01:28:42.531 --> 01:28:43.364
then that would help

1364
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:49.440
<v 2>[inaudible] talk</v>

1365
01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.300
<v 16>about this piece more that each of you has given voice to have.</v>

1366
01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:58.670
Nobody asked me what was going on and I've spent many,

1367
01:28:59.071 --> 01:29:03.150
many moments,
hours

1368
01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:06.180
<v 5>and days in girls correctional facilities.</v>

1369
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:10.770
And I remember the first time I went,
I thought,
my gosh,

1370
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:15.870
they're just girls.
They're just hurt,
abused,

1371
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.090
violated girls.
Right?

1372
01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:20.793
<v 2>Hey,</v>

1373
01:29:22.730 --> 01:29:27.080
<v 5>I want to understand better.
Can you help me to understand better?</v>

1374
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:32.530
Why is it that the system feels so comfortable just putting the girls behind

1375
01:29:34.641 --> 01:29:39.440
bars then asking that question of what's going on?

1376
01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:43.460
<v 14>Well,
I think for girls,
um,</v>

1377
01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:47.900
just overall we're just looked at differently in the criminal justice system.
Um,

1378
01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:51.430
people fail to realize that,
you know,
when we have fanned,

1379
01:29:51.431 --> 01:29:55.120
it's normally because of something we experienced in our life prior to the

1380
01:29:55.121 --> 01:29:56.760
offense.
Either through,
you know,

1381
01:29:56.770 --> 01:30:01.510
bad parenting or poverty or lack of education are being abused in that when we

1382
01:30:01.511 --> 01:30:06.130
offend,
it's usually out of survival.
So it's usually something we've stolen our,

1383
01:30:06.131 --> 01:30:06.341
you know,

1384
01:30:06.341 --> 01:30:09.610
we've acted out or because we were actually victims of something such as,

1385
01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:13.060
you know,
sex trafficking or exploitation or even domestic violence.

1386
01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:17.980
And when they look at us as women,
because as,
even as girls,

1387
01:30:17.981 --> 01:30:19.780
we still are,
are nurturers.

1388
01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:22.510
We still help to provide for our family and for siblings.

1389
01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.300
So when we have fanned versus when boys a fan,

1390
01:30:25.450 --> 01:30:29.440
we should have known better and we deserve the punishment we received as opposed

1391
01:30:29.441 --> 01:30:32.140
to boys.
Oh,
they're just youthful at immature.

1392
01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:36.250
And when we are charged for our fences where,
you know,

1393
01:30:36.251 --> 01:30:40.420
ours are gender specific offenses versus,
and so,

1394
01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:46.000
um,
because there are gender specific offensives we're perceived differently and

1395
01:30:46.001 --> 01:30:48.940
judged differently and treated differently once we're in the criminal justice

1396
01:30:48.941 --> 01:30:52.660
system because what gets sets in jail versus what gets boys in jail,

1397
01:30:52.661 --> 01:30:55.120
they don't really know how to,
to deal with that.

1398
01:30:55.121 --> 01:30:58.390
So they just look at us as being,
you know,
just,
you know,

1399
01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.380
we're just bad or where we're acting out or where it were whores because we were

1400
01:31:02.381 --> 01:31:03.940
sexually exploited or wherever the case.

1401
01:31:03.941 --> 01:31:08.560
So we should be treated as such instead of realizing that,
you know,

1402
01:31:08.561 --> 01:31:12.130
we're,
we're more vulnerable,
where more fragile,
we,

1403
01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:17.350
we need more help because we're susceptible more susceptible to violence and to

1404
01:31:17.351 --> 01:31:19.060
be treated being treated differently.

1405
01:31:19.061 --> 01:31:23.080
So it's just a totally different lens because of what we're,
you know,

1406
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.250
because of our offenses is,

1407
01:31:24.251 --> 01:31:29.251
is different and we often go to jail for nonviolent offenses and we get these

1408
01:31:29.561 --> 01:31:33.250
crazy ridiculous charges for something that's minimal and something that had

1409
01:31:33.251 --> 01:31:35.920
someone taking the time to say,
you know,
what's going on?

1410
01:31:35.921 --> 01:31:39.790
Why are you 14 in jail for prostitution?
You know,

1411
01:31:39.791 --> 01:31:41.710
the first thing I saw when I went to juvenile hall,

1412
01:31:41.711 --> 01:31:43.060
even though that wasn't my charge,

1413
01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:47.710
was that there are so many girls in here locked up for having sex with adult
men.

1414
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:52.600
I was blown away and at no point did anyone say,
you know what?

1415
01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:55.930
What's happening?
You're being exploited or being victimized.
No,

1416
01:31:55.931 --> 01:31:59.650
they were criminalized and we're constantly being criminalized for that.

1417
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.360
<v 15>We should be looked at as you know,
ways to help us in.
That's just not happening.</v>

1418
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:10.750
Well I do believe the people don't get to the roof of the causes of the
problems.

1419
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.220
You know,
like we put,

1420
01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:17.140
let's say we have taught who are the real expertise on these.

1421
01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:19.630
Like is it a book who's going to teach you?

1422
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:23.140
Like what is it going to be about in there?
And no,

1423
01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:26.260
of course now we need to put the youth.
We need to put the people,

1424
01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.950
nothing about us without us.
You know who,

1425
01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:33.970
who are the ones who are going to come up with a solution because we experienced

1426
01:32:33.971 --> 01:32:35.050
what is the problem.

1427
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:39.790
And of course all we have all this amazing people that come here that goes to

1428
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:44.560
the dissertation centers or whatever and they have no idea.

1429
01:32:44.561 --> 01:32:49.120
They don't know what it's like to be there.
Um,
and most importantly,

1430
01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:54.570
the people that come up with ideas are go,
go to these places.

1431
01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.700
And you know,
like when you're in that facility,

1432
01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.720
we have seen people be treated differently.
People,

1433
01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:05.560
kids who have been intimidated by the staff and you know,

1434
01:33:05.561 --> 01:33:10.340
like when you are in a facility once a month,
the ones,
whatever you need,

1435
01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.420
the staff are there for safety reasons.
But you don't,

1436
01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:16.930
you are you able to speak Fridley?
Of course now.
Why?

1437
01:33:16.931 --> 01:33:19.540
Because you don't like you get there and you leave.
No,

1438
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:23.830
I'm stayed there and if I say something wrong,
what it's going to happen next.

1439
01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:29.460
<v 16>Um,
I just wanted to make a point that,
you know,
a status offense.</v>

1440
01:33:29.461 --> 01:33:33.900
So I was when I was actually detained,
like I a status offense is something,

1441
01:33:33.901 --> 01:33:36.710
it's not a crime and it's when you're,
um,

1442
01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:40.500
it should because of your status as a minor that the action becomes
criminalized.

1443
01:33:40.501 --> 01:33:42.960
And that's what happened.
That's how I started.

1444
01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:47.280
And I became involved with the system running away from home and skipping
school.

1445
01:33:47.281 --> 01:33:51.270
I was placed in handcuffs and I was placed in a detention facility in a jail

1446
01:33:51.271 --> 01:33:52.740
cell because I skipped school.

1447
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:57.600
And I think people don't realize that that's what we do here.
I mean,

1448
01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.110
if we really take a hard look at the practices and the policies that we have

1449
01:34:01.111 --> 01:34:04.050
that affect girls and,
and just all kids in general,

1450
01:34:04.051 --> 01:34:08.220
like we should not be locking up kids for skipping school.
And,
um,
you know,

1451
01:34:08.221 --> 01:34:09.360
that experience and like,

1452
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.680
and not asking children are cause that's what we're talking when we're talking

1453
01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:18.390
about children,
what dry the reasons behind their actions are.
And um,

1454
01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:18.811
you know,

1455
01:34:18.811 --> 01:34:23.811
I remember just being the only girl in the facility and I was spending a lot of

1456
01:34:24.331 --> 01:34:26.720
times,
I mean isolated.
Um,

1457
01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:29.490
because like we need to be separated from the boys.

1458
01:34:29.491 --> 01:34:33.510
And just there's always this notion to protect girls and we need all this

1459
01:34:33.511 --> 01:34:34.201
protection.

1460
01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:38.760
And that was not helpful because the protection that's offered as punitive and

1461
01:34:38.761 --> 01:34:43.230
it,
it's,
it really damaged the rest of my,
you know,
my trajectory.

1462
01:34:43.231 --> 01:34:47.040
So I think it's important to listen and there are a lot,

1463
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:48.780
there was a lot of assumptions that are made,

1464
01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:51.540
I think a different system points when you're in court.

1465
01:34:51.541 --> 01:34:55.320
The assumption is made by the judge that the legal aid has talked about this

1466
01:34:55.321 --> 01:34:58.070
with the kid or with the child and that's not what

1467
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.440
<v 15>happened to me.
So,
um,
yeah,</v>

1468
01:35:00.441 --> 01:35:04.130
I think we just need to just start implementing that every system point.

1469
01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.520
Can I add something to it?
Um,

1470
01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.610
so I do believe that we are being put in,

1471
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:15.470
in the menu in that,
in the table.
Um,
yeah.

1472
01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.070
<v 5>Menu and not at the table.
Yeah.</v>

1473
01:35:21.690 --> 01:35:23.980
Um,
unfortunately,
uh,

1474
01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:28.690
what could be a whole day of conversation on girls and we need to have a whole

1475
01:35:28.691 --> 01:35:33.691
day on conversations around girls because of the systematic negligence that is

1476
01:35:34.241 --> 01:35:37.640
being shown to our girls.
Um,
we have to,

1477
01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:42.430
to give the stage over to cap black and mally chacan but I went as so deeply

1478
01:35:42.431 --> 01:35:46.000
thank you for being the young women,
the young,

1479
01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:51.460
fierce warrior advocates for other girls who are behind bars.
Thank you so much.

1480
01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:52.493
Yeah.

1481
01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:54.930
<v 17>Hello.
I'm,</v>

1482
01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:58.290
I just wanted to thank you guys so much for inviting me to introduce our next

1483
01:35:58.291 --> 01:35:59.124
speaker.

1484
01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:04.120
My name is Kat and I had been a youtuber since I was a young teenager.
Um,

1485
01:36:04.170 --> 01:36:06.100
youtube has been a very central place in,

1486
01:36:06.101 --> 01:36:10.020
in my life and it's really been where I've always come to express the things

1487
01:36:10.021 --> 01:36:14.010
that have happened in my life and um,
the good,
the bad and the ugly.
Um,

1488
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:16.380
and unfortunately while I had my platform,

1489
01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:19.650
I experienced sexual violence and

1490
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.180
<v 8>okay,</v>

1491
01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:24.470
<v 17>he has,
youtube had been such a,
an integral part of my life.</v>

1492
01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:29.650
It was where I turned to express my trauma and that didn't go very well.

1493
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.560
I was told almost immediately that I had made up the story that I told the story

1494
01:36:36.441 --> 01:36:40.190
for views that I had fabricated it because after all,

1495
01:36:40.191 --> 01:36:42.320
who would want to rape someone like me?

1496
01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:48.130
And so I internalized that I deleted my videos and for really long time I didn't

1497
01:36:48.201 --> 01:36:52.220
talk about it.
But once I gained the strength to speak about it again,

1498
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.520
I realized just how much rape and sexual violence is a tool of silence.

1499
01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:04.660
Just how much it is used against women and people in general to silence them and

1500
01:37:05.241 --> 01:37:08.150
to stop them from being able to get justice.

1501
01:37:08.151 --> 01:37:11.330
That rape culture relies on this silence.

1502
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.830
And that social media especially is an amazing place for us to be able to come

1503
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:18.590
forward and speak.
And when I started telling my story,

1504
01:37:18.591 --> 01:37:21.590
I got contacted by women who had similar stories,

1505
01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:26.180
who said that my story reflected theirs and we all said to each other the words

1506
01:37:26.181 --> 01:37:30.710
that we all needed to hear so badly that we believed you.

1507
01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:37.760
So social media has been a very important part of my,

1508
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:40.260
my activism and what I do.
Um,

1509
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:44.950
we've seen so many good positive things come out of raising voices and,

1510
01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.830
um,
a lot of the women today,
um,

1511
01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:51.430
there's that spoke our leading leaving me wanting to have conversations on my

1512
01:37:51.431 --> 01:37:55.950
platform to draw attention to a lot of the things that I didn't about,
um,

1513
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.500
were happening to our women and girls.
Um,

1514
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.420
our next speaker is going to be married Yukon,
who is a woman who is,

1515
01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:08.240
he has been using her poetry to fight against,
um,
um,

1516
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:11.100
women who are being,
who are being trafficked.
Um,

1517
01:38:11.101 --> 01:38:13.910
so I just wanted to introduce ImageCon.

1518
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.473
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1519
01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:25.213
Hi Guys.

1520
01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:32.350
<v 7>Okay.
Um,
so yeah,
I was traffic that 12th.
Um,</v>

1521
01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.990
thank you.
Um,

1522
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:38.200
so I wrote this poem when I was 13 years old.

1523
01:38:38.230 --> 01:38:42.410
I just wanted to give you guys a mind frame of where I was,
um,

1524
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:47.470
at the time and my walking through hill or beneath the shadows of death.

1525
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:51.160
I need someone to help me.
I'm like a baby crying for nipple,

1526
01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.060
like a dog wanting it to owner,
beautiful on the outside,
but he'll degraded,

1527
01:38:55.061 --> 01:38:58.960
misusing ugly on the inside.
Why?
No?
Why no one loved me.

1528
01:38:58.961 --> 01:39:02.350
For me pushing people away because they act as if they care,

1529
01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:07.120
like to park with his mistress.
Love affair have a soulless steel,
uh,
hardest.

1530
01:39:07.121 --> 01:39:10.390
Lindsay has a bird's feather,
like a tiger hunting for prey,

1531
01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:15.370
but a mind frame of a baby cut on the level of a great boat and have a spark out

1532
01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.910
of this road.
And I have dreams,
but what is that?

1533
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:23.590
I want to help people because I need help or reach out to people because no one

1534
01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:24.520
reached out to me.

1535
01:39:25.570 --> 01:39:29.680
I'm living alone with no honesty and existing in this role with no dignity.

1536
01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.920
They say,
I have a purpose,
but what might that be?

1537
01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:36.400
I want to be like sleeping beauty,
healthfully,
wake up in someone else's body.

1538
01:39:36.401 --> 01:39:40.330
That's not me.
I keep asking who might that be wanting to be like pink,

1539
01:39:40.331 --> 01:39:45.220
how she's so energetic and so sleep like Jim Murray crying like a puppy acting

1540
01:39:45.221 --> 01:39:49.210
out like Angelina Jolie,
Mr and Mrs. Smith beating myself up.
Not me,

1541
01:39:49.211 --> 01:39:50.110
but inside of me

1542
01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:54.310
they say I act out because of my ADHD.

1543
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:57.970
I'm going to be me learning to set up like a baby.

1544
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.710
Better yet trying to come out of cocoon hopefully one day or maybe picking that

1545
01:40:02.711 --> 01:40:07.000
cheese like a baby mice,
like a cage bird screaming for food.

1546
01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.240
Is it bad that mark mine six the gates of hell or wonders for a black night?

1547
01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.380
Why can't I have someone hold me tight?

1548
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:19.960
I look at my reflection and yet my body starts to feel cold like a polar bear

1549
01:40:19.961 --> 01:40:22.390
and winter.
But a vampire.
You're at night,

1550
01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:28.120
Katrina washing people away and I'm trying to find a secret.
Get away.
Thank you.

1551
01:40:40.190 --> 01:40:43.250
<v 17>Wow.
Um,
thank you Molly for sharing your words.
You know,</v>

1552
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:45.500
the poem speaks for itself,
but I just,

1553
01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:50.510
I feel so incredibly privileged to be in this room and thank all of you for

1554
01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.120
sharing your stories.
Um,

1555
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.740
just that we're so privileged to have you here at Google today.

1556
01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.810
For those of you that I haven't met,

1557
01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:04.060
my name is Matthew for him and I'm a program manager@google.org which is the

1558
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:08.590
philanthropic arm of Google and I support our racial justice work.

1559
01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:13.420
So I've been incredibly moved by everything I've heard today.

1560
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:14.080
Um,

1561
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.370
and also reminded of sort of where we've started this work is Google and how far

1562
01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:19.950
it's come.
So I,

1563
01:41:19.951 --> 01:41:24.340
I wanted to share a little bit of that story and in reflect back to when we

1564
01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:29.341
began our racial justice funding at Google back in 2014 and we were to be

1565
01:41:30.281 --> 01:41:33.950
honest,
curiously optimistic about where it would lead.
Um,

1566
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:35.860
like many folks in the room,

1567
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:40.450
there are definitely Googlers who have been impacted by the system of mass

1568
01:41:40.451 --> 01:41:45.451
incarceration who have parents and family members who are incarcerated today.

1569
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.650
And many of these Googlers advocate and volunteer with criminal justice

1570
01:41:50.651 --> 01:41:52.510
organizations in their personal time.

1571
01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:57.880
But working on the giving team at Google,
uh,
we were trying to,

1572
01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:02.660
to move this issue to the center of our companies consciousness and to,

1573
01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:07.670
to bring it to a place where we could open that conversation to those who may

1574
01:42:07.781 --> 01:42:09.640
not feel as proximate to the issue.

1575
01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:14.740
And so I remember the day that my colleague Justin Steele got the signal from

1576
01:42:14.741 --> 01:42:18.970
our executives to present our initial work in this area at our company meeting.

1577
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:23.620
And Malika referenced it at the beginning of our,
of our day.
Um,

1578
01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:28.330
but it's,
it's a,
it's a big meeting.

1579
01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:32.410
Um,
Googlers from all over the world.
Tune in on Gvc,
um,

1580
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:35.900
which is our kind of virtual way to connect.
And a,

1581
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.930
the room isn't that much bigger than this one here,

1582
01:42:37.931 --> 01:42:41.320
but we knew that thousands of Googlers would be listening and it was our way to

1583
01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.270
kind of test out,
uh,

1584
01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.600
Googlers willingness to get close to the issue.

1585
01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:51.040
And I remember on the backend calling our community partners and letting them

1586
01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:51.860
know,
uh,

1587
01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:55.330
many of them who were now supporting through our grants that this work was going

1588
01:42:55.331 --> 01:42:57.220
to be talked about during our company meeting.

1589
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:59.770
And I actually didn't share how big that meeting was.

1590
01:42:59.771 --> 01:43:03.010
So they might think it was just a couple of folks who are interested in hearing

1591
01:43:03.011 --> 01:43:04.990
more about their work.
Um,

1592
01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:09.790
but the response from Googlers that day and to this day,

1593
01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:14.080
um,
Google shore challenging themselves to learn more about this issue and in

1594
01:43:14.081 --> 01:43:17.750
supporting the folks that have boots on the ground,
um,

1595
01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:22.870
it really inspires us on our team to keep moving the company forward.

1596
01:43:23.050 --> 01:43:26.750
And challenging ourselves to,
um,

1597
01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:31.090
discuss this conversation and push where we haven't pushed before.

1598
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:36.010
So our employees have hosted movie screenings on mass incarceration both on

1599
01:43:36.011 --> 01:43:40.540
campus and in the community policy convenings like today on criminal justice

1600
01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:44.440
brought some of the nation's most prominent speakers and voices in the movement,

1601
01:43:44.441 --> 01:43:47.410
folks like Brian Stevenson and Gina Clayton,
um,

1602
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:52.100
to our campus and our volunteering and the communities and in prisons.

1603
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.320
And we think that's very important.

1604
01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:58.820
We're very excited now to be a testing out,
uh,

1605
01:43:58.850 --> 01:44:01.110
Googlers actually getting in the,

1606
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:05.270
on the ground in the office and working alongside one of our community partners,

1607
01:44:05.271 --> 01:44:08.730
center for policing equity to engineer systems,
um,

1608
01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:13.400
and help build a national database that can help,
uh,
reduce bias and policing.

1609
01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:18.200
And so I just wanted to share with the room that we're pushing ourselves to get

1610
01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:23.160
smarter and do more.
Um,
and I want to encourage everyone who's listening,
uh,

1611
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:28.270
from the company side on the GBC today to really just continue your volunteering

1612
01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.790
you're giving and learn more about this issue.
Um,

1613
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:40.480
and as we are challenged today,
make an intentional effort to support,
um,

1614
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:44.300
and share our platform with women and girls who are directly impacted.

1615
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:49.100
You can go to go slash get proximate if you're listening in to get involved with

1616
01:44:49.101 --> 01:44:52.340
our volunteering efforts@google.org uh,
in criminal justice.

1617
01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:55.040
And then for the folks who are in the room,
uh,

1618
01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.410
let's please find ways to collaborate.

1619
01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:02.090
If you have a creative idea on how we can share our platforms,

1620
01:45:02.091 --> 01:45:06.980
please find me after this event or you can reach out to me my email dresses m a

1621
01:45:06.981 --> 01:45:07.320
B

1622
01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:12.320
map@googledotorgandyoucanlearnmoreaboutourcriminaljusticegrantmakingeffortsatwww.google.work.

1623
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:16.980
So thank you all for sharing,
uh,

1624
01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:20.060
this room with us today and for sharing your voices and your stories are really

1625
01:45:20.061 --> 01:45:20.894
appreciate it.

1626
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.393
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:26.410
<v 0>Um,</v>

1628
01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:31.180
I want to thank everybody for being with us today and I want to give special

1629
01:45:31.181 --> 01:45:36.181
thanks and honor to the women and girls who not only share their narratives,

1630
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:42.030
but also their expertise of how we dismantle these pipelines into incarceration

1631
01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:44.410
for women and girls.

1632
01:45:45.010 --> 01:45:50.010
I also want to say to those in the room and those who are listening in that one

1633
01:45:51.281 --> 01:45:56.170
powerful way of being part of this movement to make sure that our women and

1634
01:45:56.171 --> 01:46:01.171
girls are not left behind is to know what the National Council for formerly

1635
01:46:01.571 --> 01:46:05.140
incarcerated and incarcerated women and girls is up to.

1636
01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.000
If you go to their website,

1637
01:46:07.150 --> 01:46:12.150
you can find out how to donate to them as well as be part of the campaigns that

1638
01:46:12.671 --> 01:46:14.080
they are advancing.

1639
01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.440
I also want to plead to make sure that we as a company continue to be proximate,

1640
01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.680
continue to recognize that this issue is at the center of all of our work and

1641
01:46:27.041 --> 01:46:30.160
communities and lives that need is not marginal.

1642
01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:35.340
That it is part of how we can use our goodness and use our wisdom and use our

1643
01:46:37.061 --> 01:46:42.061
platforms to make sure that we live in a society where everyone is valued,

1644
01:46:43.061 --> 01:46:44.110
where every life,

1645
01:46:44.111 --> 01:46:48.610
where every mother child bond is honored and has the chance to be.

1646
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:54.830
And finally I want to close this out on two notes of gratitude,

1647
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:59.490
a gratitude to Topeka,
Sam for helping us bring the right

1648
01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.393
<v 8>women.</v>

1649
01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.180
<v 0>Take.</v>

1650
01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:09.180
Keep thinking about ways to use tech to scale the prison walls and we tried to

1651
01:47:09.411 --> 01:47:13.280
do that today and thank you to Pika for helping us to do that.

1652
01:47:13.281 --> 01:47:18.281
To bring the voices of Miss Alice and Ms Sandra into our space and I also want

1653
01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:25.450
to give special thanks to Greer Stockman who allowed this all to come together.

1654
01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:35.080
Thank you for all of the courage that was shown today and we are going to close

1655
01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:36.460
out with Kristen,

1656
01:47:36.461 --> 01:47:41.461
the n allowing us to just breathe in this moment and think how we are going to

1657
01:47:41.741 --> 01:47:44.740
move forward in the work before us.
Thank you.

1658
01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.800
<v 18>Hi everyone.
Um,</v>

1659
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:55.480
there's two songs I want to play for you today that I think are very fitting.
Um,

1660
01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:59.500
and before I do,
while I set up and tune my instrument over here,

1661
01:47:59.501 --> 01:48:02.710
if anyone that's the way in the distance feels far away and wants to come over

1662
01:48:02.711 --> 01:48:04.810
to this side,
we'll have a second for you to do that.

1663
01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:09.910
The first song I want to play is called the escape and it's from an album that's

1664
01:48:09.911 --> 01:48:11.910
coming out later this year.
And this song,

1665
01:48:11.911 --> 01:48:15.010
the single actually is going to drop on Thursdays.

1666
01:48:15.011 --> 01:48:19.690
So you guys are hearing it before everyone else and it's called the escape

1667
01:48:19.691 --> 01:48:23.710
because,
uh,
my new album is about a character who escapes a prison.

1668
01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.720
And I wrote this,
I wrote this song not just about escaping a physical prison,

1669
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:33.160
but the kind that we impose on ourselves in terms of the kind of self love we

1670
01:48:33.161 --> 01:48:37.180
give ourselves or how we allow other people to dictate who we are and what we

1671
01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:41.770
can be.
So,
um,
I hope you enjoy it.
And then I'll explain the second song here.

1672
01:48:41.771 --> 01:48:43.150
So thank you very much.

1673
01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:51.140
<v 19>Mm.
Mm,</v>

1674
01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.110
mm,
mm,
mm

1675
01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:47.060
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

1676
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:49.340
<v 18>thank you.
Thank you so much for everyone's sharing stories today.</v>

1677
01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:52.670
It was just an incredible day.
And um,

1678
01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:57.230
leads me to why I want to play this next song that I wrote called unconditional,

1679
01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:02.000
and I call it unconditional because I wanted to write a song that captured the

1680
01:57:02.001 --> 01:57:06.230
essence of unconditional love.
Not just any kind of love but unconditional.

1681
01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:10.280
It's the kind that loves you not only in your best moments,

1682
01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:12.830
but your worst moments.
You know,

1683
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:16.010
I kind of love that accepts you for who you are,

1684
01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.710
including the highest version of yourself.

1685
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:22.460
And then that monster that comes out sometimes that we're ashamed of,

1686
01:57:22.461 --> 01:57:25.000
but is a part of us.
You know,
the,

1687
01:57:25.001 --> 01:57:29.900
the stories of our lives that we can't be without,
because as hard as they are,

1688
01:57:29.901 --> 01:57:32.930
they made us,
they are us.

1689
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:37.940
So I wanted to see if I could read a song,
even if without lyrics,

1690
01:57:38.210 --> 01:57:41.540
that could capture that feeling of what it means to be unconditionally loved.

1691
01:57:41.541 --> 01:57:42.980
For those of us who know that feeling.

1692
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:47.330
Because even though everyone deserves unconditional love,
not everyone has it.

1693
01:57:47.690 --> 01:57:51.530
So I thought if I could capture it in a song,
we could all share it.
Thank you.

1694
01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:59.660
<v 19>[inaudible]</v>

1695
01:58:09.070 --> 01:58:12.170
no.
