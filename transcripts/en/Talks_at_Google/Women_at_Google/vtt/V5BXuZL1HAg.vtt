1
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.800
I'm delighted to welcome to the Google plex,
Kelly mcgonigal,

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.510
a health psychologist at Stanford University and the author of a new book,

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.530
the willpower instinct.
So in life,

4
00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:19.531
sometimes we struggled with choices and accomplishing goals and we often believe

5
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.610
that sheer willpower will get us there,

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.420
but much of what we believe and know about bill far could actually be wrong.

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.800
Or that's what Kelly discovered in working with students at Stanford University

8
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.750
where she teaches at Stanford University School of Medicine and the Stanford

9
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.583
Center for compassion.

10
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.600
So she created a course called the science of willpower at Stanford School of

11
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:48.430
continuing studies and became one of the most popular courses at the school and

12
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:51.730
went onto become a hugely successful blog at psychology today.

13
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.100
And now a book which you can get your hands on a bend of the stock and Kelly's

14
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.030
ACFE.
If she has her way,
it'll soon be an action figure and an action movie too.

15
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.820
So today Kelly's going to talk about how we can accomplish the array of goals

16
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.480
that we often struggle to get done.
It might be a healthier lifestyle.

17
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.280
It might be a life of greater productivity or sometimes something as simple as

18
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:22.570
having waited for six months.
Finally,
finally clearing out the closet.

19
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.310
So please help me welcome Kelly mcgonigal.

20
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.363
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

21
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.190
<v 2>Hello.
Well,</v>

22
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.350
I've been giving a lot of talks this last month and a lot about new year's

23
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:36.071
resolutions.

24
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:39.400
I have to say this is the first place I've taught where there was apparently a

25
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:43.660
healthy code resolution going on.
Is that right?
Did I see the signs right?

26
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.710
So who's still keeping their healthy code resolution?
Anyone?
Good?

27
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:51.460
Congratulations.
We've got some willpower.
Um,
why don't you tell me,

28
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:53.140
just sort of get things rolling.

29
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.130
Tell me something that has challenged your willpower today.

30
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.760
Anyone getting up on time?
Getting up on time.

31
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.440
Washing the dishes.
Okay.
So we've got to kind of,
I will power challenges.

32
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.920
Something you have to make yourself do,
even though be a little bit easier.

33
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.470
Just not do it.
Something else.
Yeah.

34
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.780
Doing Yoga for back pain.
Well,
I'm glad to hear that.

35
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.920
Were you at my talk two years ago about Yoga for pain?
That's great.
Uh,
yeah.

36
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:25.560
Another,
I will challenge something else.
Yeah.

37
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.930
<v 2>Yeah.
So an example of I won't power.
There are all these links you could follow.</v>

39
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:41.100
You could just click and get lost down the link hall.
Uh,

40
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.480
and you have to find the ability to resist that temptation.

41
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:44.350
Maybe one or two more.

42
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.583
<v 1>Oh,</v>

43
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.290
<v 2>anything back row.
And he will power challenges.</v>

44
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.620
How about lunch options for today?
Yeah.
Have you had your lunch yet?
Are you

45
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.220
great?
Yeah.

46
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.900
So we make lots of decisions every day about what to eat and what to do.
Okay.

47
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.330
Well these are all great examples of willpower challenges.

48
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.620
And I want to just start with a little definition.
My definition of willpower,

49
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.670
willpower challenge,

50
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.390
and I define a willpower challenge as something that is basically a competition

51
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.410
between two parts of yourself.

52
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.790
Neuroscientists are famous for saying that even though we have one brain,

53
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.210
we actually have two minds and we are completely different people depending on

54
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:34.210
which mind is active or which systems of the brain are more active.

55
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.800
And so willpower challenges,

56
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.600
anything where those two versions of yourself have competing goals.
So,

57
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.351
for example,

58
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:45.280
there may be part of you that really wants to eat a candy bar for your snack.

59
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.400
And then there's a part of you that actually has some longer term goals.

60
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.820
You're thinking how you're thinking weight loss,
you're thinking bikini season,

61
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.090
whatever.
And maybe the banana seems like the better snap.

62
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.640
And again,
both of these choices,
uh,
you might be drawn to buy different,

63
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:03.610
different parts of your mind are two different versions of yourself.

64
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.330
And one of the things that has really influenced my work with willpower is

65
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:09.580
thinking about it in terms of what's going on in the brain.

66
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.410
And we're going to talk about that a little bit today.

67
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.580
The fact that you could be the very same person,
but depending on your mindset,

68
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.490
depending on your energy,
depending on your stress levels,

69
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.940
your brain is going to meet this willpower challenge in a different way.

70
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:23.450
And you're going to end up making,
you know,

71
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.150
one choice today and one choice tomorrow.
Um,
so as mentioned,
uh,

72
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.570
this book is based on the class that I teach at Stanford called the science of

73
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.260
Willpower.
Those are our actual students.
I'm not sure what I said that was funny,

74
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.650
but those are actual signs of willpower students.
And,
um,

75
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.880
I created this course because I was going around trying to teach people how to

76
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.970
be more productive,
how to improve their health.

77
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.340
And everywhere I went people said,
oh,

78
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.940
we know we're supposed to do that stuff already.
We just don't want to do it.

79
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.270
And there was this really interesting fundamental gap between what people wanted

80
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:01.630
and what they thought they wanted,
that his people were very identified.
Um,

81
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.480
you could say with this version of the cells,

82
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.520
people felt like deep down they were the person who wanted the candy bar and

83
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:13.660
this other person who wanted the banana.
Like,
who is that?
That's not really me.

84
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.290
Um,

85
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.610
and I realized that people didn't just need to know what is the right thing to

86
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:22.450
do or the healthy thing to do or tips for stress management and productivity.

87
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.290
They needed to feel like this person and they needed to know how to be that

88
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.050
person as the default rather than walking around,

89
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:31.740
always feeling like they had to.
They had to uh,

90
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.280
resist this core self that only wants immediate gratification or never want to

91
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:40.810
do anything difficult.
Okay.
So that's how the class came about.
What his clicker.

92
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.750
There we go.
Okay,
great.

93
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.680
So I thought today since this is a class based on science that I would share

94
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.370
with you five of my favorite experiments from the class and from the book.

95
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.670
And I chose experiments that I like because they use tiny interventions,

96
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.250
really,
really small interventions to shape people's behavior.

97
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.340
And they have very large outcomes.

98
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.770
And I think this is the kind of thing many of us are looking for.

99
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.390
One small change we can make,

100
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.390
whether it's a change in how we think or change in the way that we're

101
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:16.391
approaching a willpower challenge that can have huge payoffs down the road,

102
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.940
making it easier to do what it is we really deep down want,

103
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.300
even when it's sometimes difficult or part of us doesn't want.
Okay.

104
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.630
So let's start with the first experiment.
How many,

105
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.980
you guys sometimes feel like this guy,

106
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.000
I know at least one of you only had three hours of sleep last night.
Yeah.

107
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.470
So it turns out that when you're this version of yourself,

108
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.220
every willpower challenge is more difficult.
And the first intervention,

109
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.340
and I want to tell you about is actually a sleep intervention.

110
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.230
The main intervention was trying to help people sleep more or sleep better.

111
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.850
And it was people who had a very,
very serious willpower challenge.

112
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:56.390
These are people who were recovering from addiction to drugs and they were in a

113
00:06:56.391 --> 00:07:00.950
substance abuse recovery program and half of the people in the standard care

114
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.900
were assigned to take a mindfulness meditation training that was designed to

115
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:08.330
help them improve their sleep or sleep more.

116
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.390
And so the first thing I want you to take a look at on this graph,

117
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.870
this is minutes of sleep per night and you're going to thank,

118
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:17.700
this is insanely optimistic,
I know,
but,
uh,

119
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.070
that everyone's starting around seven hours and we're going to improve on seven

120
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:26.090
hours and that that probably seems impossible dream.
Okay?

121
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.270
So everyone in the group was starting around seven hours.

122
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:32.870
And with the researchers found was that just doing a little bit of meditation,

123
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:34.910
everyday breath focused meditation,
uh,

124
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.350
increased sleep time to just over eight hours a day and the control group had a

125
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.710
little bit of deterioration to slightly less than seven hours of sleep at night.

126
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.020
Okay.
Now that's not the interesting finding.
I mean,

127
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.480
it is nice to know that if you meditate for a few minutes a day,

128
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:51.150
you will sleep better and get more sleep.
But what's interesting is how that,

129
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.270
that change in sleep time then made these recovering addicts,

130
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.140
uh,
impervious to relax,
they were stronger against relapse.

131
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.290
And this is a very high correlation 0.7,
Oh,

132
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.000
the increase in sleep time predicted resistance to relapse with a correlation of

133
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:08.850
0.7.
Oh,

134
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.790
getting one more hour of sleep at night suddenly made it a lot easier for these

135
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:17.240
recovering addicts to resist the temptation of falling off the wagon.

136
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.820
And interestingly,
the,
um,
the number,

137
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.700
I never know it's going to bounce off the screen.
Right?

138
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:26.120
I should point at the screen.
You guys are tech experts.
Uh,

139
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.150
the number of minutes per day that people meditated also predicted resistance to

140
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.270
relapse.
So there were really two things going on in this intervention.

141
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.900
There was getting more sleep and there was also something about the actual

142
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:42.380
practice time and it wasn't a lot,
but it was something like 10 minutes a day,

143
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:46.580
15 minutes a day.
And both of these things,
sleep and meditation,
we're um,

144
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.840
we're giving people more willpower for one of the biggest willpower challenges.

145
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.410
So what does the thing together a little bit about why those two small

146
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.280
interventions,

147
00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.210
an hour more sleep or 10 minutes of meditation a day might actually give us more

148
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:02.070
willpower for any willpower challenge.

149
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.200
What you're looking at here is an image from an FMRI study of what happens to

150
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:11.030
the brain when you are a little bit sleep deprived.
And most studies use,
uh,

151
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.040
less than six hours of sleep a night as sleep deprived,

152
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.840
which may seem normal to you,

153
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.260
but for most of us that's actually functioning far suboptimal.
Um,

154
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.030
what you're looking at here is a composite of a lot of different people's
brains,

155
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.070
some who are sleep deprived and some who are not.

156
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.870
And we're going to slice the brains.

157
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.900
So imagine me standing this way and we're going to have one of those like meat

158
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:34.320
slicers and we're going to slice down the head and just start taking sections

159
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:38.790
off and looked down the middle.
And so where you see these yellow spots,

160
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.260
that's the front of the brain right about here or right about here that where my

161
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:44.890
brain pointing that way,
uh,

162
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.920
and yellow means that this area of the brain is under activated when you have

163
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:54.240
less than six hours of sleep at night or this area of the brain is unable to do

164
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:57.450
it to job as efficiently.
And the,
uh,

165
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:00.260
the red areas are areas that are more activated,
um,

166
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.440
sort of mid brain regions that are associated with basic impulses and instincts.

167
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.110
So when you're getting less than six hours of sleep at night,

168
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.780
your brain is actually unable to,
uh,

169
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.950
to recruit the systems of the brain that you need to be that better version of

170
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:17.390
yourself.
This area of the brain.
I love this image because it's,

171
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.650
it's like here's the,
where the balance is way.

172
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:22.530
Do I want the weight loss or do I want the chocolate bar?

173
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.520
And this area of the brain right here is basically keeping track of your goals

174
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.580
and uh,
it's sort of hard job.
It's heavy lifting.

175
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:33.270
It needs to do is to remember longterm goals,
uh,

176
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.470
core values.
And when it is unable to do that,

177
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.840
when it's under fueled or when it's underactive,

178
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.880
your brain thinks all it really wants.

179
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.330
All you really want is the chocolate bar or to procrastinate or to follow that

180
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:49.860
link through or to not bother doing your yoga exercises.
And so in some key way,

181
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:53.070
the ability to remember who you are and what your big goals are,

182
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.210
is dependent on the ability of this area of the brain to use energy.
Well.

183
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.840
And sleep deprivation is one of the main things that can get in the way of that.

184
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.610
And I think that's one of the reasons why this small sleep intervention ended up

185
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:09.990
helping people resist relapse to drug addiction because they now had brains that

186
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:13.530
were better fueled to remember their goals,
to stay clean and sober.
Um,

187
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.030
and it's not just sleep that impacts,
uh,
the physiology of your brain,

188
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:19.470
how well your brain uses energy.

189
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.450
There are a couple of other things that seem to really,
um,

190
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.490
strengthen the ability of the brain's frontal regions to do what they're

191
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:30.840
supposed to do to help you control impulses and find your motivation.

192
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.800
And a,

193
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.420
here are the four things from the research that seem to do it to make your brain

194
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:40.140
a kind of willpower machine.
One is sleep,
as I mentioned,

195
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.870
and hopefully there's going to be one thing on this list that you're not

196
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:46.650
currently doing that you're willing to do because you don't have to do all four.

197
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.930
Uh,
so getting a little bit more sleep really makes the,

198
00:11:49.931 --> 00:11:54.160
the prefrontal cortex better able to regulate those systems of the brain that

199
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:58.930
direct you towards temptation and immediate gratification and meditation also.

200
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.980
And both meditation and physical exercise has been shown not only to make your

201
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.280
brain more efficient at using these self control systems,

202
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.510
but they actually make these systems bigger and better connected to the regions

203
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:13.870
that they are supposed to be controlling.
Um,
and again,
it's,

204
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.620
it's can be a very quick time course to see these benefits.

205
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.460
People who meditate maybe 10 minutes a day after a couple of months,

206
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.360
the brains look different.
These regions are bigger and better connected.
Uh,

207
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.350
people who work out on a regular basis who used to be sedentary.
Again,

208
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:32.680
studies show that in as little as a couple of months or regular workouts,

209
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.140
their prefrontal cortices are bigger and denser and better connected.
Um,

210
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.020
and so these are two of the things you can do that actually train the physiology

211
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:44.220
of your willpower.
And the last thing,
uh,

212
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.940
that the research suggests is what you eat has a very big influence on whether

213
00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:52.450
or not your brain is able to be this better version of yourself.

214
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.600
There's something about having a big,

215
00:12:55.601 --> 00:13:00.220
big spikes in blood sugar levels and then big drops in blood sugar levels that

216
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:03.740
really screws up how the brain uses energy.
Um,

217
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.900
and you need your brain to be like an energy efficient machine if you're going

218
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:12.340
to be walking around the world in that kind of better you mindset rather than

219
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.050
the,
that kind of basic impulse you.
Uh,

220
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.330
and so research shows that shifting to eating a more plant based diet actually

221
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.930
changes the way the brain functions and has a lot to do with what's going on

222
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:24.070
with your blood sugar levels.

223
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.880
And so these are all things that we sometimes think of as requiring willpower,

224
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.360
right?
We think,
okay,
I have to sit down and force myself to meditate.

225
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:36.220
I have to work out,
I have to say no to the doughnut and eat something.
You know,

226
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:37.870
that has fiber in it for breakfast.

227
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.880
But we rarely think about the fact that that actually not doing these things.

228
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.800
Maybe part of what makes it so difficult to begin.
And there's a kind of a,

229
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:51.670
a curve where when we first started,
it feels like we're using willpower.

230
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:54.760
But everything on this list that takes a little bit of willpower to begin with

231
00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:00.150
ends up giving you back far more willpower than the take and not just for these

232
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:04.060
challenges.
It's not just that exercising makes it easier to exercise.

233
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.060
Studies show that exercising makes it easier to eat,
right,

234
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:11.410
to not spend too much money to stop procrastinating,
to pay better attention.

235
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.890
All of these things have a kind of global training effect on what you could

236
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:16.810
think of as your willpower muscle.
It was,

237
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:18.280
was there a question up front or a comment?

238
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.450
So the question is why does it say low-glycemic and plant base?

239
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.660
There's actually more evidence that a Vegan Diet does this better than a diet

240
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:31.060
that is low-glycemic and includes animal products.

241
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.850
But I'm not sure that that's entirely realistic for everyone.

242
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.400
So I think you can kind of pick your,
your uh,

243
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.840
which way you're willing to go with that both low-glycemic and plant based help.

244
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.830
But if you look at just the physiology of it,

245
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.540
there's more evidence for the plant based Diet.

246
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.993
<v 3>Okay.</v>

247
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.190
<v 2>So let me go onto the next experiment.</v>

248
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.080
The first experiment was just get some more sleep.
Second experiment.

249
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.640
I want you to think about a recent setback you had or a kind of a willpower

250
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:02.240
failure.
Maybe it was not eating the healthy thing at lunch.

251
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.850
Maybe it was not doing your exercise in the morning.

252
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.300
Maybe it was spending all morning long following links that had nothing to do

253
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:09.410
with your project.
Okay.

254
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:13.240
So I want you to think of a recent time when you has some kind of willpower

255
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.083
failure.

256
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.990
Does anyone need to borrow one of mine?
Yeah,
you guys got one?
Okay.

257
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.670
So my question for you is,
do you,
do you think that feeling bad about that,

258
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.990
presumably feeling maybe a little bit of regret,
a little bit of guilt about it,

259
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.210
a little bit of self criticism about that.

260
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.690
Does that help us improve next time?
Does that,

261
00:15:36.691 --> 00:15:39.720
can that be a real source of future willpower?

262
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.490
Raise your hand if you think that feeling bad can actually be a real source of

263
00:15:44.491 --> 00:15:47.190
willpower to improve next time ends up.

264
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.630
And how many of you think that that feeling bad is actually going to be a

265
00:15:51.631 --> 00:15:54.600
further drain on willpower?
Yeah.
Great.

266
00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.250
Maybe some of you have read that chapter in the book.
Um,

267
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.620
so I want to talk now about some of the research that tends to surprise people

268
00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:03.390
the most.
When I first started teaching this class,

269
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.820
this was the research people argued with,

270
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:09.090
like literally I couldn't get them to be quiet in the classroom because they

271
00:16:09.091 --> 00:16:11.160
were so convinced this could possibly be true.

272
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.240
This is a study looking at whether it's better to let yourself off the hook for

273
00:16:15.241 --> 00:16:19.680
your mistakes in terms of preventing future willpower collapses.

274
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.490
And so this particular study I'm going to talk about in a little more detail,

275
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.230
broadened people who were trying to manage their weight and eat healthy and they

276
00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:31.050
gave them an immediate willpower failure.

277
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.550
They showed up for the study and they were forced to eat a donut and they even

278
00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:38.310
had to choose the flavor of donut they were going to eat.

279
00:16:38.311 --> 00:16:40.770
So they would feel really complicit in this willpower failure.

280
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.800
And they had to drink a whole glass of water too so they'd feel a little bit

281
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.570
uncomfortably full.
Okay,

282
00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:49.290
so we have everyone died or is here having it now a willpower failure.

283
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:51.020
They just ate this donut.
Uh,

284
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.290
and then the next part of the study is a taste test where they're given a lot of

285
00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:58.770
different types of candy and they're sad,
you know,
um,

286
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.710
we want you to evaluate all these candy,

287
00:17:01.711 --> 00:17:03.750
so please just eat as much as you need to,

288
00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:07.080
as much as you want so that you can evaluate these candies.
Uh,

289
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.700
and of course these candies were all pre wade so that experimenters could find

290
00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:15.990
out exactly how much candy the dieters eight after they had blown their diet

291
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:18.690
with a donut.
And in this particular study,

292
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.210
the researchers had a hypothesis.

293
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.550
They thought that that the guilt that dieters experience when they fall off

294
00:17:26.551 --> 00:17:30.400
their diet actually really undermines future self control.

295
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.720
And so they wanted to create an intervention that would basically get rid of the

296
00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:37.770
guilt and shame that people feel when they make a mistake.
And so in this study,

297
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.810
half the dieters were randomly assigned to receive a special letting themselves

298
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:44.310
off the hook message.

299
00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.660
So between the donut eating and the taste test and experiment or came in and

300
00:17:48.661 --> 00:17:52.610
said very simple,
they said,
by the way,
we've,

301
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.820
we've realized now that some people in this experiment feel guilty after eating

302
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:58.230
the doughnut.
Okay?

303
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.800
So there was an opportunity for people to recognize they might be feeling
guilty.

304
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.080
Second part of the message,
um,

305
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.400
we want you to remember that actually everyone indulges sometimes and we asked

306
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:11.910
you to do it.
So there's a kind of putting it in a broader perspective.

307
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.370
And the last part of the message was a simple plea.

308
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.330
Please don't be too hard on yourself about it.
Okay?
So very simple.

309
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.290
You might be feeling guilty.
Remember,
everyone does it.

310
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.950
Don't be hard on yourself about it.
And then they went onto the taste test.

311
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:30.080
And what the researchers found was that the women who had been given the,
um,

312
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.070
the self forgiveness message,

313
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.870
eight less than half as much candy as women who had not been told don't worry

314
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:38.460
about it.
It's not a big deal,

315
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.030
which is exactly the opposite of what most people think.
Most people think.

316
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.310
You make a mistake,
you have a willpower failure,

317
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.460
and you start saying nice things to yourself about it.

318
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.620
That this could only lead to disaster,

319
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.740
that would lead to licensing even more indulgence.

320
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.130
And yet that's exactly the opposite of what was found in this study.

321
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.120
And not just this study,
but in a lot of different studies.
Now,

322
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.050
this is one of the,

323
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.250
sort of the strongest pieces of a theory we have and willpower research right

324
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:09.900
now.
That is the harder you are on yourself when you have a willpower failure,

325
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.530
the more likely you are to have the same failure again.

326
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.940
And the bigger it's gonna be when you do.
For example,
one study took a look at,

327
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.420
um,

328
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.160
at problem drinkers and had them keep track of how much they were drinking and

329
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:25.080
how bad they felt the morning after.

330
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.100
And what they found is that the people who were the most self critical and felt

331
00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:32.670
the most ashamed or guilty about drinking the night before,

332
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.150
wanted to drink more immediately when they woke up and also drank more that

333
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.143
night.
And the next,

334
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.050
there was something about the self critical nature of the shame and the guilt

335
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.350
that was driving people back to the very thing they felt bad about.

336
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.040
Same has been shown for addictions,
including quitting smoking.
You know,

337
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:53.370
you have that first relapse and the more you beat yourself up about it,

338
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.710
the more you now need to be comforted with something.

339
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.610
Probably the very thing that you're feeling bad about because that's probably

340
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:03.120
why you do it in the first place.
Same has been shown for gambling.

341
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.050
The more people feel guilty,
uh,
and self critical about losing money,

342
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:10.680
the more likely they are to borrow money and try to win it back and end up

343
00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:13.430
losing more.
And even for procrastination.

344
00:20:13.431 --> 00:20:17.580
So you may not have any kind of addictions.
Um,
but even for procrastination,

345
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.730
research shows that the harder someone is on putting some,
uh,

346
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.210
the hardest someone is on themselves or putting something off the longer they

347
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:25.710
procrastinate the next time.

348
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.240
And all of this has to do with the basic fact that when we are feeling stressed

349
00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:32.010
out and guilty and ashamed,

350
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.610
that is a state that puts us into the version of ourselves,

351
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:39.780
the mindset that is much more susceptible to immediate gratification,

352
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.760
temptation and anxiety.
It's,

353
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.930
it's basically the biological opposite of what needs to be happening in your

354
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:50.931
brain and body to your longterm goals and to be that other version of yourself

355
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:53.470
that what we would call the willpower version of yourself.

356
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.200
And as soon as you start piling on the guilt and the shame,

357
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.190
your brain switches into that other mode in which now everything's going to be

358
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:04.210
more tempting,
including procrastinating or including smoking or drinking.

359
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.650
So I just wanted to give you a sense of wow,

360
00:21:07.651 --> 00:21:11.040
what it would be like to give yourself a self compassionate message is going to,

361
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.810
I said this was a tiny intervention,
this doughnut study,

362
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.940
and this is basically all it was.

363
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.510
And there are a number of programs now that are teaching people how to write

364
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.920
these messages for themselves,
uh,

365
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.970
and to literally have them scripted for the moment.

366
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:28.960
They fail for the moment that they procrastinated and they're late again or for

367
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:32.500
the moment they had that cigarette when they hadn't smoked in a week.
Uh,

368
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.400
and to be able to,

369
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:38.290
with this message out as a way of not falling down that hole that we often fall

370
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:39.040
into.

371
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.280
So the three steps of this message is the first is mindfulness of what you're

372
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:44.380
thinking and feeling.
Uh,

373
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.610
noticing that you're feeling guilty or noticing that you're feeling self doubt

374
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.520
or self critical,
um,

375
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.910
maybe angry at yourself and actually allow yourself to see those feelings.

376
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.710
Because a big reason that people go from feeling guilty to giving and again is

377
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:01.420
that they just want to get rid of that feeling.

378
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.070
It's so kind of overwhelming and they want to distract themselves from it with

379
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:08.950
something that is going to get them into further trouble.

380
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.490
And then the second step is this common humanity.
Uh,

381
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:17.470
one of the reasons that it is hard to find our motivation and our willpower is

382
00:22:17.471 --> 00:22:20.500
we start to feel like there's something uniquely broken with us.

383
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.460
There's something about who we are that is wrong and weak.

384
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.630
And that mindset makes it very difficult to tap back into your motivation or

385
00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:30.910
your strength.
And so this,
uh,

386
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:34.570
this message of common humanity is basically saying to yourself,
you know what?

387
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.560
This is part of the process of change.
This is how things get done.

388
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.490
Sometimes we procrastinate,
sometimes we fall off the wagon.

389
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.250
Everyone is imperfect and to recognize it,

390
00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:47.710
this is not saying anything about who you are.

391
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.430
It's saying something about the process and what matters is how you respond

392
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:53.770
afterward,
not the fact that it happened at all.

393
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.950
And then this last step is encouragement over criticism.

394
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.800
And if you were to think about someone you were mentoring,
you know,

395
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:04.360
some of you probably have mentees here or interns or you think about a child

396
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.670
that you care about or dear friend,

397
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.170
what would you say to them when they had a setback?
And to say that to yourself,

398
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.660
it might be reminding yourself of your goal.

399
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.060
It might be reminding yourself of the big picture rather than the sort of the,

400
00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:21.130
the micro picture in which you feel like a failure.
Uh,

401
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:24.700
and to do that rather than the voices we often have in our head that are saying

402
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:27.700
things like,
oh,
why did you do that again?
You're so stupid.

403
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:29.000
You're never going to change.

404
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.680
And to actually start to talk to yourself a little bit in the second person as

405
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:36.250
if you were good for them.
And research shows that,
that this particular approach,

406
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:40.540
learning how to talk to yourself in this way is a,
is more effective.
For example,

407
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:44.110
at quitting smoking,
the nicotine replacement therapy,
uh,

408
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.170
that's how being able to respond to setbacks with self compassion can be want

409
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:55.511
you to take a look at these circles which go from being totally non overlapping,

410
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.490
two extremely overlapping.

411
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.290
And you're going to decide which of these sets of circles best represents how

412
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:07.100
you feel about who you are today and who you're going to be,

413
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:10.100
let's say 30 years from now,
30 years in the future,

414
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.770
or pick a time period that feels right to you.
Okay?

415
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:15.320
So this is your current self and this is your future self.

416
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:20.321
30 years from now this means who you are today is really very different than who

417
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:25.250
you're going to be 30 years from now.
Some overlap,

418
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.820
but actually a lot of change is going to be happening between now.
Who knows?

419
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.030
And then,
uh,
this last set of circles,
this is like,
you know what,

420
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:36.440
who I am today is probably who I'm going to be in 30 years.
Same me.
Okay.

421
00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:38.510
So you're gonna pick for yourself.
Take another few seconds.

422
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:42.360
I think where you are on this graph,
actually let's,

423
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.460
let's do like a kind of rolling wave,

424
00:24:44.461 --> 00:24:47.460
cause I'm actually curious if there's a trend being here at Google.

425
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.880
So just put your hand up when you see your circle.
Highlight it.
Who's over here?

426
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.610
<v 4>Who's over here?
Over here?
Over here.</v>

427
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.580
<v 2>Oh,
you guys are normally distributed.
This is great.
This is over here.</v>

428
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.500
Who's over here and who's over here?
Yeah,
pretty good.
Pretty good.
Oh,

429
00:25:04.501 --> 00:25:06.270
that was great.
Okay.
Um,

430
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.540
so it turns out where you put yourself on this map has a lot to do with some

431
00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:16.470
very important willpower challenges related to health and money and even moral

432
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:17.304
behavior.

433
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.910
Don't feel too bad if you're at an extreme tail that is not associated with

434
00:25:20.911 --> 00:25:24.540
willpower because I'm going to show you some strategies for being able to get to

435
00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:28.980
the,
uh,
the end that is associated with willpower if you need it.
Okay.

436
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.310
So let me start with the first intervention.
And this was an intervention that,

437
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.010
uh,
that was done here at Stanford University.

438
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.720
And this was using undergraduate students who are very young and it was a

439
00:25:39.721 --> 00:25:44.280
virtual reality experiment were undergraduate students came into the laboratory

440
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:49.110
and uh,
the researchers had carefully created three d avatars,

441
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.910
uh,
of the student themselves.
So if I came into the laboratory,

442
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.510
I would be meeting a three D Avatar of myself at retirement age.

443
00:25:58.511 --> 00:26:01.980
And it was a really great setup,
um,
in which you can,

444
00:26:01.981 --> 00:26:06.090
you've got all the virtual reality equipment on hearing and seeing and it feels

445
00:26:06.091 --> 00:26:10.650
like you are sitting across the table from your future self and it's set up with

446
00:26:10.651 --> 00:26:14.850
cameras in such a way so that if I move my left hand like this,

447
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:19.050
it looks like my future self is also moving their hand.

448
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.320
And if I talk it looks like my future self is talking back.

449
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.400
And in the study the college students were invited to interview their future

450
00:26:26.401 --> 00:26:30.300
selves to say things like,
Hey,
future Kelly,

451
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.650
what's going on right now?

452
00:26:31.651 --> 00:26:33.990
What's really what's really important in your life right now?

453
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.350
And then they had to answer the question and so they would see there.

454
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.400
I would see future Kelly describing what's important in my life at retirement

455
00:26:41.401 --> 00:26:45.990
age,
uh,
and went on for about an hour getting to know their future selves.

456
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.710
And the reason that I'm the researchers decided to do this intervention is

457
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:54.540
because they had discovered that most of us feel like our future self is a

458
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:59.280
stranger and all of you who are on that first half of the distribution sort of

459
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:01.550
thing like you thinking about the future self and you know,

460
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.820
really know who that is.

461
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.020
It could be really an improvement on this model or it could just be an older

462
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:09.240
version of this model.
We don't know.
Uh,

463
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.510
but what research has found is that the more you feel like your future self is,

464
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:14.340
a stranger is different than you,

465
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:19.230
the less likely you are to do things to protect that future selves health and

466
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:20.064
happiness.

467
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:25.050
Because why would you bother saving money for some stranger when you could spend

468
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:27.740
it today on someone you know and love.
Um,

469
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.320
so in this particular experiment,
uh,

470
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.680
after they had gone to know their future self,

471
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.340
there was some time elapsed cause they didn't want it to be totally obvious what

472
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:39.174
was going on.

473
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.560
There's some time elapse and they brought people back and had them divvy up

474
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.590
$1,000 in a budgeting task and you know,

475
00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:49.860
they pretended like they were interested in how people make budgeting decisions.

476
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.220
But what they found is that the college students who had met and interacted with

477
00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:55.700
their future self,
uh,
ended up,
uh,

478
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.710
allotting more than twice as much money into a retirement account.

479
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.920
Then college students who had not met their future self college students would

480
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.130
nominate their future south were much more likely to want to allot that money to

481
00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:12.150
their present expenses or to,
to some fund splurge.
And,
um,

482
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:17.450
this research has actually had a lot of impact in the world of retirement

483
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:18.870
savings and banking.

484
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.620
I just heard an economist recommend last week that we should be trying to

485
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:26.880
Photoshop pictures of people's future self on every mortgage application or

486
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:30.360
credit card application so that people would have to really think about the

487
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:34.290
implications of this.
Um,
I mean,

488
00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:38.430
you could imagine an HR setting right where people are new new employee and

489
00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:40.770
they're asked to make their retirement allocations.

490
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.800
What if they had to interact with their future self first new college students

491
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:44.940
coming into a first job?

492
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.340
My make a very big difference in their retirement savings down the line.
Okay.
Um,

493
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.850
so that was just one that was the intervention.
That was the experiment.

494
00:28:51.851 --> 00:28:54.440
But I just want to point more broadly to some of the research.
Uh,

495
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.950
looking at that circle graph that I showed you and it turns out that people who,

496
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.680
um,
who believe that there is more overlap,

497
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.680
that they're more closely related to their future self,

498
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.510
have a lot more willpower for different types of willpower challenges.
Oops.

499
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.373
Didn't mean to do that.

500
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.920
So the first thing is they're less likely to procrastinate in general and less

501
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:17.550
likely to be late.
I mean,
one of my favorite findings from this research is that,

502
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.170
um,
people who had,

503
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.250
who felt like they were less similar to their future self were also more likely

504
00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:27.810
to show up late for the experiment or skip it completely to just blow it off.
Um,

505
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.220
and that was kind of interesting finding.
Uh,

506
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.840
they also are more comfortable or sorry,

507
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:36.450
are more likely to make ethical decisions at work.

508
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.140
So people who think that the future self is more different,

509
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.560
like a total stranger,

510
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.910
they're actually more likely to feel good about betraying a colleague at work if

511
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:47.650
it helps them advance in their career,

512
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:52.000
they're more likely to keep money that they found even when they might have an

513
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:53.650
inkling of that money belongs to.

514
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.980
And that's kind of an interesting finding because we could,

515
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.490
we could understand retirement future herself.
Um,

516
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.710
but it seems like this,
this,
uh,

517
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:07.300
ability to disconnect from the longterm consequences of your choices actually

518
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:11.320
primes you to be that more impulsive self even when it doesn't really have

519
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:14.520
anything to do with your own longterm benefits.
Um,

520
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.520
and then also looking at real world outcomes.
Not just an experiment,

521
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.790
but you look at what circle people choose and how much money they have,

522
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:24.820
their assets,
their home,
their debt,
their wealth,

523
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.950
and people who feel closer to their future self actually have,
uh,

524
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.470
have more assets,
are more likely to own their home,
outright,

525
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.900
more money in the bag,
more retirement savings.

526
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.370
And so this is a real world finding,

527
00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:40.270
not just an experiment and they're also more likely to do things that don't have

528
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:43.630
a pay off immediately like flossing and exercising,

529
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.130
but that will be good to protect their future self.
So with that in mind,

530
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.650
one of my favorite,
uh,

531
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.620
willpower boosting strategies that you can do that doesn't really take any

532
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:57.940
willpower at all is to get to know your future self.
Uh,

533
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.410
and very,
you know,
you actually hear,
maybe you can do three d avatars,

534
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.490
is that like,
so like a Google project somewhere.
Um,
but,

535
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:08.740
um,

536
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.830
but so most people can't actually interact with their future self and that high

537
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:15.370
tech away.
Um,
but it seems like there are other ways that work as well.

538
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.300
And one is to write a letter from your future self to your present self.

539
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.310
And you can do this in a number of different ways.

540
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:25.390
So one way is to just write to your present self about who you are,

541
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.570
what you're doing,
where you're living,
what you care about.

542
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.050
Or You could even write a more closely defined letter,
uh,

543
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:34.680
that that looks at some challenge you're dealing with.
Now,
you know,

544
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.830
maybe you're struggling to quit some addiction or uh,

545
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.710
spend time with your family or it's just something that it seems like it's not

546
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:43.240
working the way you would like it to.

547
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.050
And you could write a letter from your future self thanking your present self

548
00:31:47.051 --> 00:31:51.800
for doing it and describing what it was you did and why it mattered.
Um,

549
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.750
and research suggests that this kind of letter writing from your future self can

550
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:57.550
actually give yourself more willpower.
Yes,

551
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.120
that is probably not the letter you should.
Right?

552
00:32:09.121 --> 00:32:13.890
So just for the people who are watching this on the video,
the question was,

553
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.980
um,
if you,
if you feel really bad about yourself now cause this,

554
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.350
could this have the opposite effect where you think,
oh my God,

555
00:32:19.351 --> 00:32:21.090
I'm never going to change and your all,

556
00:32:21.091 --> 00:32:22.980
if you're a loser now you're going to always be a loser.

557
00:32:22.981 --> 00:32:25.890
So the letter might be like,
dear loser,
I'm still a loser.

558
00:32:25.891 --> 00:32:29.470
You're still a loser lifestyle that is not the letter.
Um,

559
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:33.510
actually so research suggests it is better to be optimistic in this letter then

560
00:32:33.511 --> 00:32:37.420
to be pessimistic.
Um,
but at the same time that,

561
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:42.290
so the key thing about this finding is not so much whether you think you are

562
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:44.570
going to be exactly the same,

563
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:49.550
but whether you understand that is going to be the same person having the future

564
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:53.390
experience and that which actually comes to the,
the second point here.

565
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.340
And so that's actually a different thing.

566
00:32:55.341 --> 00:33:00.341
It's not like are you still going to have all of the same problems and all of

567
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:05.150
the same neuroses or have you fixed them?
It's not that kind of same self,

568
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:08.780
different self.
It's,
do you understand that?
Like,

569
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:11.690
you know how real pain is right now.
If I were to come and punch you,

570
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:12.620
how much that would hurt.

571
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.880
Do you understand that 30 years from now it's going to hurt if someone punches

572
00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:17.570
you?

573
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.840
And that seems to be the thing that people actually have problems with when they

574
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:24.170
think about their future selves.
They don't have access to those emotions.

575
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.340
They don't understand that that future happiness is going to be as real and as

576
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:30.260
important.
And so,
um,

577
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.080
so when you're doing this kind of letter writing or doing this future self

578
00:33:33.081 --> 00:33:33.950
imagination,

579
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:39.170
the actual critical part is getting to feel like that future self is real and

580
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:42.620
that it is in some way you that you are going to be the one having this

581
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:43.454
experience.

582
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:47.420
And it's not so much whether you think you're going to be the identical person

583
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:51.100
still listening to the same music you listened to in 1983 or if it's not,

584
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.990
not at that.
Okay.
So here's the second feed yourself exercise,

585
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:57.950
which kind of gets to that.
And I call this going back to the future.
Um,

586
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.640
and this is the exercise of a mat.
Just imagining yourself in the future.

587
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:06.080
Studies show that just imagining yourself grocery shopping in the future,

588
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.470
not like,
not anything even relevant to your goals,

589
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:13.700
but just grocery shopping then ends up helping people make better decisions in

590
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:15.320
the present moment.
Uh,

591
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:19.940
that's going to lead to pay off in the future because you can actually imagine

592
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:23.060
it and you can imagine what would be on the shelf and you know what it feels

593
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.650
like to be pushing a shopping cart.

594
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:28.580
And there's something about making the future real that gives us more willpower

595
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.820
and an independent of the content,
what you're thinking about.
Um,

596
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:35.210
but there's also studies showing that you can imagine specific futures related

597
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:39.890
to your willpower challenge and both good sort of future realities and negative

598
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:41.900
future realities can be very motivating.

599
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.860
So in one study they had people who wanted to improve their health to imagine

600
00:34:45.861 --> 00:34:49.900
the consequences of not making a change,
like really vividly what that,

601
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.900
what's that going to be like?

602
00:34:50.901 --> 00:34:54.200
What's it gonna feel like 10 years from now if you don't make this change?

603
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.500
And they had another group.
Think about the positive consequences.

604
00:34:57.501 --> 00:35:00.470
I'm making the change and what would that be like and how are you going to feel?

605
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:05.520
And both of those sort of future thinking ended up increasing the,

606
00:35:05.521 --> 00:35:07.700
the good health behavior in the present.

607
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.130
And so I said you guys have seen back to the future too,
right?

608
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:12.710
Have you guys seen back to the future too?
You know,

609
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:16.010
he goes into the future and there's like a really bad future and a really good

610
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:20.210
future.
Okay.
At some point that that reference is not going to work anymore.

611
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.630
Okay.
Here's,
um,
so we've got two more interventions in this next intervention.

612
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.000
I just want to take a poll.
So we're talking about visualizing things.
Um,

613
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:34.640
if you had to guess,
which would be more helpful for finding your willpower,

614
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.850
do you think it's more helpful to imagine or yourself failing or is it more

615
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:43.050
helpful to visualize and imagine yourself succeeding?

616
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.710
Raise your hand if you think imagining failure is going to be more helpful.

617
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.950
Raise your hand if you think imagining success.

618
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.810
You guys are such a typical Americans.
Okay.
Um,
that's what everyone thinks.

619
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.520
So,
um,
actually it turns out imagining failure is way more helpful than imagining

620
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:02.910
success.
Not that imagining success is always bad,

621
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.130
but imagining failure is better.

622
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.670
So let me tell you about this one intervention and then some of the theory a

623
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:12.110
little bit more broadly.
And this particular study,
they took women,
uh,

624
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.840
from young adult to middle age,
a little bit older adults,
uh,

625
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:20.520
all of whom were not exercising at all and all of whom had the goal to exercise.

626
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.300
And some of those women were randomly assigned to your typical,

627
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.290
it's good to exercise.
Here's why you should exercise.

628
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:31.680
Now think about your goal and imagine yourself doing it.
Very typical.

629
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.380
And the other half were randomly assigned to a,
what they call it,

630
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:41.100
an obstacle condition where they had to imagine themselves failing.

631
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.660
They had to ask themselves,
when are you going to not exercise?

632
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.910
What is the opposite going to be?
When is it going to happen?
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

633
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.250
what are you going to do if that happens?

634
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:58.470
And they had people write about that every single day.
They had to write out,

635
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.450
when are you going to not exercise?

636
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:03.240
What are you going to say to yourself that allows you not to exercise?

637
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.230
When's it gonna Happen?

638
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:06.930
How's it going to happen and what are you going to do when you start to

639
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:08.400
recognize that stuff happening?

640
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.080
And so the women were becoming kind of detectives have their own failure and

641
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:16.140
everyday they revise what they were writing based on what they notice.

642
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.470
I didn't exercise because I told myself I'll do it later.
I'll do it later.

643
00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:21.420
I'll do it later.
Now it's time to go to sleep.

644
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.960
Or I didn't do it because I got so busy at work and then I didn't have my

645
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:26.370
sneakers.
So I didn't do it.

646
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.900
And they became very clear about how they fail and they were able to predict

647
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:34.770
future failures from that.
And uh,
here's what the results were.

648
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.030
It had an immediate effect of doubling the amount of time they were exercising.

649
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.540
So the very first week they started to predict their failure in this way,

650
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.780
they doubled to 102 minutes of exercise a week.

651
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.100
And that's getting pretty close to the amount of exercise that you need to have.

652
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.140
Very serious health benefits,
both mental health and physical health.
Uh,

653
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.630
there was a much smaller improvement here in the group of a,

654
00:37:57.631 --> 00:38:01.920
of women who were given the standard you want to exercise.
Exercise is great,

655
00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:06.510
let's do it.
And a 16 weeks,
so four months after that study,

656
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.650
the a women who had been predicting their failure had maintained and we're

657
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.030
exercising twice as much as the women who were in the basic,
let's exercise here,

658
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.200
here's why it's good.
This is the thing that always blows people's minds.
Um,

659
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.910
there is a lot of studies showing that tracking your success leads people to

660
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:28.380
slack off in the long run,
but nobody believes it.
Um,

661
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:32.100
so you probably heard how important it is to keep track of your success because

662
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:35.350
we feel really good when we're able to write down that we did something right.

663
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.200
You know,
you feel really good,
you're like,
yes,
check it off.

664
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.870
Some people make to do lists just so they can check stuff off.

665
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.680
And we know how good we feel when we're able to write down and record our

666
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:49.580
successes.
And we mistake that feeling good as motivation to do more.
But a,

667
00:38:49.581 --> 00:38:54.581
a number of studies show that when people are reminded of their success and take

668
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:55.960
note of their progress,

669
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.140
they then are much more likely to do something inconsistent with their goal.

670
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.510
So if you are a somebody,
so for example,

671
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:05.020
there's studies of dieters where people come in and the experimenter says,

672
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.370
by the way,
we wanted to,

673
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.100
to let you know how much progress you've made on losing weight.

674
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.680
You're this close to your goal,
you've been doing great.

675
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.530
And on the way out of the lab do would you like a chocolate bar?

676
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.940
And women are much more likely to take the chocolate bar if they were reminded

677
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:22.090
of their success.
The same studies has been shown for procrastination.

678
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.990
You have people keep track and feel good about the progress that they've made on

679
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:30.610
a task and they're much more likely to choose not to work on it.
And,
uh,
this is,

680
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:33.140
this is the goal switching hypothesis.
Um,

681
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.960
the idea is that that any willpower challenge is a competition between these two

682
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:40.450
versions of yourself and they're both you.

683
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:45.460
And as soon as your mind realizes that one of you is satisfied cause you made

684
00:39:45.461 --> 00:39:46.300
some progress,

685
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.500
the other goal becomes primed and your brain and it becomes more appealing.

686
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:54.700
So I don't want to say don't keep track of your success because I think in what

687
00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:59.650
I really wanna encourage you to do is both.
Um,
but let me just,
uh,

688
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.610
let me point to a couple of other,
other ideas along this line.

689
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.310
Okay.
So,
um,

690
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.720
about why pessimism can be so helpful because it's profoundly unamerican to be

691
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:12.250
pessimistic when you have a goal.

692
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.880
And I just wanna encourage you to think about using pessimism is actually a

693
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:18.310
source of willpower.
Um,
so there's,

694
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.120
there's this kind of finding floating around that people who are most optimistic

695
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:25.990
about their ability to make a difficult change give up sooner and are most

696
00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:30.760
likely to fail.
And it tends to be because they are shocked by their setbacks.

697
00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:34.870
And to one of the ways that predicting failure it can be helpful is that when it

698
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:35.650
happens,

699
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.580
it's not like some shock to your system where you can't believe it happened.

700
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.660
It must say something bad about who you are or about your likelihood of success

701
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:48.060
in the future.
Um,
there's also interesting studies as I mentioned that uh,

702
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.190
optimism while this is both progress and optimism,

703
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.700
but studies show that if you have people make optimistic predictions about what

704
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:58.300
they're going to do,
they're more likely to then not do it today.

705
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.950
So people who intend to exercise tomorrow are more likely to eat something

706
00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:04.630
unhealthy today and skip the gym.

707
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.900
And even just having people think about what they're going to do in their
future,

708
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.540
it makes people more likely to make a different choice today.
Uh,

709
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:16.000
and so just knowing that you're going to be just as tempted tomorrow,

710
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.810
you're going to be just as busy tomorrow just to stress out tomorrow turns out

711
00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:24.190
to be an important source of re a willpower today.
Okay.
And then this,

712
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:26.890
I just had to throw the same cause I think this is one of the funniest findings

713
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:31.750
in the willpower research that 75% of corporations that are investigated by the

714
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:36.751
sec for fraud can be tracked back to initial optimism that then people were

715
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:41.570
unwilling to let go of.
They were so optimistic about profit,

716
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.380
their profit projections that when they met their first setback,

717
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.320
they didn't know what to do and they started to fudge the numbers.

718
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:53.510
And this is something that we all do with our own goals when we set very high

719
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:58.511
ideals and then refuse to adjust our expectations based on reality.

720
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.130
And this is something I run into a lot at Stanford.

721
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.000
People say they want to make big change or they have a big goal in mind.
Um,

722
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.650
and they aren't the least bit interested in setting a small goal or a baby step

723
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:11.870
cause I,
how is that going to ever get me where I want?

724
00:42:11.871 --> 00:42:13.340
So let's go big or go home.

725
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.960
And then when they start to run into problems with that huge level of success,

726
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.580
they kind of hang on to the ideal.
And yet end up doing nothing.

727
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:26.150
And so you can think of yourself as your own little corporation with goals.
And,

728
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:29.510
um,
if you find yourself hitting setbacks,

729
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:33.700
one of the most important things you can do is adjust your expectations,
uh,
and,

730
00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:37.730
and take a really serious look at the process of how failure is working.

731
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.980
Okay?
So here is,
um,

732
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.580
so here's an example from that exercise study that's a little bit broad and out.

733
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:44.640
And,
uh,

734
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.890
this is basically the writing exercise those women were doing that doubled the

735
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:51.780
amount of time they were putting into their goal.
Uh,

736
00:42:51.781 --> 00:42:54.620
and they were supposed to do this writing exercise every day.

737
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.330
The first is to identify your goal and what would be a really positive outcome

738
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:03.270
of that.
So you just,
you gotta get your motivation on board,
right?
And then,
uh,

739
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.790
and then what are you going to do to take it?

740
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:09.080
So you've set some clearly defined steps and then you spend some time thinking

741
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:13.400
about how is this not going to happen when and where and why.

742
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.570
Is there anything you can do in advance to prevent that failure?

743
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:21.110
And when failure happens,
what are you gonna do about it?
And you know,

744
00:43:21.111 --> 00:43:23.990
you don't have to actually make it seven full steps like this,

745
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.900
but it's a very basic exercise that you can do for any goal.

746
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:30.260
I think of it as being like stress testing a goal.
You have a goal.

747
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:33.980
You say you're going to do something well now put it to the task and find out

748
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:38.170
how it's going to break,
how it's going to fail.
Okay,

749
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.370
last intervention.

750
00:43:39.371 --> 00:43:43.460
Let's all do it together unless you have health problems and then you know,

751
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:48.340
I don't want anyone to pass out or have a stroke.
So,
uh,
if you,

752
00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:49.570
if you are willing to take this challenge,

753
00:43:49.571 --> 00:43:54.190
we're just going to hold our breath for 15 seconds.
Who's got a second hand?

754
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.390
Great.
You're going to time us.
Okay.
Only if you want to do this.

755
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.110
Take a deep breath in.
We'll be your second hand.

756
00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:07.120
Go to take a deep breath out now.
Exhale,
exhale,
exhale.
Exhale it out.

757
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.620
Stop breathing.
Time us

758
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.140
memory.
You can breathe anytime you want to if you need to.

759
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.210
I just want you to notice how this feels.

760
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.480
Three,
two,
one.
Breathe.
Good.
Okay.
So holding your breath,

761
00:44:26.481 --> 00:44:29.930
obviously that's a little bit of a willpower challenge.
Um,
some of you may be,

762
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:31.650
you need to hold your breath for two minutes to feel it,

763
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:33.840
but I did not want anyone passing out.
Um,

764
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:39.060
so would you believe that this ability to hold your breath is one of the best

765
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:43.680
predictors of people's ability to succeed at difficult goals?
Uh,

766
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.180
it's kind of interesting.
Psychologists call this distress tolerance,

767
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:52.920
the ability to stay put when things get uncomfortable.

768
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:58.220
So I want to tell you now about a small intervention that teaches people how to

769
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.720
sort of hold their breath but not exactly how to basically ride out physical

770
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:07.350
discomfort that gets in the way of making a difficult change.

771
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.140
And to tell you about two different studies that are basically using the same

772
00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:14.220
technique.
So you can kind of pick your willpower challenge here.
The first,

773
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:18.420
I called the the torture chamber and this was a study of smokers who wanted to

774
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:22.830
quit but had been unable to and the researchers asked the smokers to abstain

775
00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:24.930
from smoking for 24 hours,

776
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:29.400
sort of a first challenge and then to come into the laboratory with a fresh

777
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.450
unopened pack of their favorite brand of cigarettes.
So all the smokers show up,

778
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.470
they've got their pack,

779
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:38.070
they are desperate for a smoke and they even like carbon monoxide tested them to

780
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:40.710
make sure they hadn't smoked.
So they had all,
they were really,

781
00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:42.150
they were ready for a cigarette.

782
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.840
They all get the seated at a long table and asked to put away all distractions

783
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:52.020
except for a lighter or a match and their cigarettes.

784
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.300
So you got a bunch of smokers,
now they're ready.

785
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:59.370
And then the experimenter is about to begin the process of allowing them to

786
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:02.100
smoke.
And she says through actually a microphone like that,

787
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:03.450
you hear this voice that says,

788
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.400
take out your pack of cigarettes and everyone does.
They're all excited.
Woo.

789
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.150
Stop.
Okay,
they have to wait two minutes now.

790
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.060
And they're not allowed to do anything except look at their pack of cigarettes.

791
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.420
Pull off the cellophane.
Okay,
great.
Stop.
Two minutes.

792
00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:25.710
They have to wait.
Okay.
Packet.
Or there was patsy.
I don't smoke.

793
00:46:25.711 --> 00:46:28.840
I forget some of these steps.
They're the pack the pack to uh,

794
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.900
and they got the cellophane open.
Okay,
take out a cigarette.
Finally stop.

795
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.060
They have to wait two minutes.
And this goes on.
And every two minutes they,

796
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.800
they're writing down how intense their cravings are and how much they want to

797
00:46:40.801 --> 00:46:42.990
smoke.
But other than that,
they're not allowed to do anything.

798
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:47.520
Take a cigarette out.
Stop two minutes,
look at the cigarettes.
Stop two minutes,

799
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.470
smell the cigarettes.
Stop two minutes,
put the cigarette in your mouth.

800
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:56.580
Stop two minutes.
Take out a lighter.
Look at it.
Stopped two minutes.

801
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.040
This went on for over an hour.

802
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:05.370
Nobody was actually allowed to light the cigarette.
Okay,
so here's what the,

803
00:47:05.371 --> 00:47:08.580
I didn't tell you what the actual intervention was yet half of them before this

804
00:47:08.581 --> 00:47:10.650
happened,
had been taught a technique called surfing.

805
00:47:10.651 --> 00:47:15.300
The urge in which you learned to pay attention to the physical discomfort of

806
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:16.590
wanting something.

807
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:22.250
You give it your full attention and you trust that you can tolerate those

808
00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:26.310
physical sensations.
And if you just wait with patients,

809
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.160
they will go away.
That any craving,

810
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.930
any emotion will eventually pass.

811
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.190
If you can just breathe and wait,
wait it out.

812
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.950
That you don't have to act on every impulse or emotion.

813
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:41.860
So that's the technique they were taught.
They were surfing the urge,

814
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:43.840
they were imagining those cravings as a wave,

815
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.620
but they were getting on and they were just going to breathe and they knew that

816
00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.030
it would eventually end just like a wave.
Uh,

817
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.000
before I tell you the results of this study,
let me just give you the food.
One.

818
00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.040
Food one's a little bit different.

819
00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.520
They took people who had problems with self control around food,

820
00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:04.510
especially suites,
gave them a clear container of Hershey's kisses,

821
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:05.560
transparent container.

822
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:10.240
And they had to carry that box of Hershey's kisses around with them for 48
hours.

823
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.310
And we're not allowed to eat a single one.

824
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.190
And they were all carefully marked little pins scratch.

825
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:17.650
So that the researchers would know if the ATM and restocked it,

826
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.420
which would not be cool.
Okay.

827
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.900
And they were taught the same technique about how to handle cravings,

828
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:27.610
how to surf the urge,
allow yourself to feel the craving and yet remember,

829
00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:30.700
you don't need to act on it and the craving will go away eventually.
Okay.

830
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:33.250
So the results in this study,

831
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.820
the smokers who had been taught how to surf the urge in that,

832
00:48:36.821 --> 00:48:41.050
that one hour torture test,
um,
they ended up reducing their cigarette,

833
00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:43.840
smoked by 40% in the very next week.
Uh,

834
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.650
even though the researchers had not asked them to,
the control group,

835
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:51.700
did not reduce their cigarettes at all.
And interestingly,
um,

836
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.930
in that the people who had learned to surf the urge there was now no longer a

837
00:48:55.931 --> 00:49:00.580
connection between psychological stress and smoking,
which is actually the,

838
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.430
that's the main connection for a lot of people who are trying to quit.

839
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.220
They're stressed out,
they're anxious and so they need a cigarette.

840
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.550
And in this particular group with this intervention,
uh,

841
00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:14.970
cut that link between stress and giving in probably because they had a tool for

842
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:19.720
dealing with difficult feelings and emotions.
In this study,
the,
uh,

843
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.420
the people who had trouble with self control around food,

844
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:27.600
if they were taught to surf the urge zero had a single Hershey's kiss over the

845
00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:30.100
entire 48 hours.

846
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.310
Whereas those who have been given other strategies including distraction,
uh,

847
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:38.770
ended up much more likely to give in and also really stressed out about it.
Um,

848
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:42.520
so these are just two different examples of how surfing the urge can give us a

849
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:47.080
lot of willpower for the things where we need willpower.
You know,

850
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:50.890
a lot of times I hear people talk about how important it is to build good
habits.

851
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:55.870
But the reality is sometimes you need strength to do something difficult and

852
00:49:55.871 --> 00:49:59.530
there's no habit in the world that's going to make you not want a cigarette when

853
00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:02.890
you see it or want a donut when you see it or make you want to avoid something

854
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:03.910
because you're anxious.

855
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:08.090
There's a real impulse and a real feeling that you need to deal with.
Um,

856
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:12.400
and this power of acceptance seems to be the best strategy for dealing with

857
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:16.450
these difficult emotions,
these difficult thoughts and these difficult cravings.

858
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.710
Uh,
and any attempt to kind of push them away or get rid of them backfires.

859
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:25.480
But being able to ride them out and imagine them as passing experiences that you

860
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:29.540
don't need to act on has been shown to help a lot of different willpower

861
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:33.920
challenges,
including the kind of anxiety that leads us to not do things.

862
00:50:33.921 --> 00:50:37.100
We know we should do intrusive thoughts,
you know,

863
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.570
that's a real willpower challenge.

864
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:43.400
Sometimes our mind goes places we don't want it to go to memories or two things

865
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:47.630
were imagining or to negative thoughts about ourselves and others and research

866
00:50:47.631 --> 00:50:51.020
shows you can apply the same technique to a negative thought without having to

867
00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:55.430
act on it.
It's been shown to improve weight loss.
It actually this,

868
00:50:55.550 --> 00:51:00.350
this technique of learning how to accept your own cravings tripled the long term

869
00:51:00.351 --> 00:51:04.160
one year weight loss success rate among people who were in a really standard

870
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.540
weight loss program.

871
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.440
It helps substance abuse and it even helps people with schizophrenia.
I mean,

872
00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:13.940
talk about a willpower challenge when you have voices in your own head that you

873
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:18.710
cannot escape and you're trying desperately to have some kind of normal life and

874
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:20.120
relationship with the world.

875
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.600
When you've got these voices in your head that are telling you to do something

876
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:24.830
or not to do something.

877
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.930
And studies show that a schizophrenia who learn to accept their own intrusive

878
00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:34.931
thoughts and hallucinations and delusions like a craving that's not real and you

879
00:51:35.271 --> 00:51:39.290
don't need to act on it,
but it's going to be there and eventually it will pass.

880
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:43.160
They actually end up being,
uh,
more likely to,

881
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:47.360
to be out of the hospital bed hospitalized and function normally compared to

882
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:49.700
people who have not been taught this technique.

883
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.370
<v 3>Okay?
So</v>

884
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.860
<v 2>if you want to apply this technique to any willpower,
challenge yourself,</v>

885
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.920
here's what that small intervention would look like for yourself.

886
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.760
Here's what people were taught in a,
in both of those studies.

887
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:09.290
And the first is this mindfulness to allow yourself to feel what you're feeling

888
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:14.240
or thinking about your thinking and to actually attend to the experience rather

889
00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:17.240
than immediately tried to escape it.
So if you're hungry,

890
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.270
actually notice like what does hunger feel like in my body?

891
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.440
Where if you're anxious,
what does anxiety feel like in my body right now?
Uh,

892
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.710
and then to actually just breathe,
breathe it out,

893
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:31.580
use the breath as a source of stability.
You know what you're feeling,

894
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.290
take a few breaths and then broaden your attention out and look for the first

895
00:52:36.291 --> 00:52:38.750
opportunity to recommit to your goal.

896
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.650
That's what they were taught in both the smoking study and in the Hershey's kiss

897
00:52:42.651 --> 00:52:45.320
study.
And it's a technique that you can practice.

898
00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:49.430
It takes like 30 seconds and a and it can help with any sort of willpower

899
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:52.720
challenge.
Okay.

900
00:52:52.721 --> 00:52:56.800
So just to wrap up five willpower rules and I would just invite you to think if

901
00:52:56.801 --> 00:53:00.700
you heard anything today that might be relevant to your willpower challenge to

902
00:53:00.701 --> 00:53:05.110
give yourself this short dose,
the small dose intervention and a,

903
00:53:05.111 --> 00:53:07.960
and see how it works because that's actually the nature of the class.

904
00:53:07.961 --> 00:53:10.600
And the nature of the book is basically to become a willpower.

905
00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:15.250
Scientists yourself to get some ideas from the research and then test it out.

906
00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:19.000
If you've got a hypothesis,
you can see if it works or not.
Collect your own data.

907
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:20.440
So those five strategies,

908
00:53:20.441 --> 00:53:24.610
one is to train your willpower physiology by meditating,
by sleeping,

909
00:53:24.611 --> 00:53:28.590
by or by eating a diet that's going to sustain your energy,

910
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:32.640
forgive yourself the next time you have a willpower setback.

911
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:34.920
Make friends with your future self.

912
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:38.280
Kind of think about the future in a way that feels real,

913
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:42.600
predict your failure even though it's really nice to imagine success.

914
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:45.420
Really get interested in the process of how you fail.

915
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:49.770
And then finally think about surfing the urge when you are facing temptation.

916
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.510
And uh,
thank you.
Well you guys,
you waited it out.

917
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.370
You showed a lot of willpower sticking around here.

918
00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:01.150
