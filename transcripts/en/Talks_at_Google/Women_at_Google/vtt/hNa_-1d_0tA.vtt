00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.773
Hi,

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.700
I'm Marissa Meyer and I'm really excited today to be joined by the world famous,

3
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:17.050
incredibly talented,
the one and only lady Gaga

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.430
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.110
<v 1>at Google.
We've seen goggle build her career by embracing technology,</v>

6
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:34.280
including some,
some Google tools as well as constantly innovating for her fans.

7
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:37.220
And we're going to get a glimpse behind the scenes to see how some of that

8
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.900
innovation works today.
But first I'd like to play a video to welcome God.

9
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.763
Go onto Google.

10
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.253
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

11
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.283
no,

12
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.823
yes.

13
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.580
[inaudible]

14
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.173
yeah,

15
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.610
<v 2>the new wheel chairs are a little high.</v>

16
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.590
<v 1>I hear so much for coming.
This is going to put my purse weight.
Yeah,</v>

17
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.390
<v 2>I love you too.
Hi everyone.</v>

18
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.240
Can you just get out of jail?
Yeah,
me too.

19
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.980
Uh,
uh,
we are so excited

20
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v 1>to have you here</v>

21
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.900
<v 3>and I'm so excited to be here.
I just want to say before we even begin,</v>

22
00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:08.070
thank you so much.
This is such an honor.
Uh,
you know,

23
00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:11.700
when I was in high school,
all my girlfriends wanting to get jobs here

24
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.863
and,
um,

25
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.940
I wanted to be what they were searching for or putting on the,

26
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.070
you know,
the side column would comes up first.

27
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.730
I believe that's what my friend Mary Hurley does here at Google.
But uh,

28
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.000
so just thank you so much for coming and I really,
um,

29
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.460
I respect all of you so much.

30
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.550
I know that there's some really amazing minds in this room and how competitive

31
00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:35.840
it is.
So thank you.

32
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.770
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

33
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.400
<v 1>Speaking of searches,
you are among the most searched people in the world,</v>

34
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.300
even on the top.
And we're at 2009 and 2010 fastest rising searches.

35
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.070
We made a portrait here of you taking the millions of searches that had come in

36
00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:58.140
for lady Gaga.
Beautiful.

37
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

38
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.520
<v 1>So,
uh,
you know,
obviously you've been a huge search star,</v>

39
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:09.140
also a huge youtube star,
bad romance.
It has 316 million views.

40
00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:10.340
Just that one video,

41
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.200
Andrew,
the queen of the download.

42
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.710
You're actually the most downloaded artist in history with more than 20 million

43
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:21.620
singles downloaded.
It's amazing.
Thank you.

44
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.870
All of which brings us to today.

45
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.520
So last week you opened up a moderator page on your Youtube Channel and you got

46
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:29.570
questions from your fans.

47
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.840
54,000 questions and more than a quarter million votes in just three and a half

48
00:04:35.781 --> 00:04:39.530
days.
We have questions that are both in text and video.

49
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.390
I bought the top 20 questions here.

50
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:44.990
We're going to go through those and then also do some questioning,
the same dress

51
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.303
<v 0>branding.</v>

52
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.250
<v 1>So the first question I'm going to ask can you came in in video form,</v>

53
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:02.310
but it was also going to be my first question.
Uh,
it comes in from a user,

54
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.700
a certain resonance and we'll go ahead and roll that video question.

55
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.940
<v 2>Well,
my first question that I wanted to ask was how are you,</v>

56
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.900
I remember in one of your interviews you said that that was a question that

57
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.840
interviewers never really asked you and actually meant it.

58
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.180
And so I wanted to ask you and actually mean it.
So how are you?

59
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.680
<v 3>Wow.</v>

60
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.680
I am absolutely wonderful and a little bit choked up because that is why I am

61
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.450
still here and why I worked so hard.

62
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:45.451
It's because I really am very blessed to have fans with such a beautiful spirit.

63
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.680
And I'm sure you can see just from that one video very much what a lot of my day

64
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:51.251
is like.

65
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:56.251
I do spend a lot of time on Google looking for a fan videos and messages and I'm

66
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.150
doing wonderful today.
And I wouldn't say that,
um,

67
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.890
the only reason I ever mentioned that people don't ask me how I am genuinely is

68
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:11.530
because it took a lot of bravery to get to where we are today.
Uh,

69
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.130
a lot of people see glasses and shoulder pads and crazy outfits.

70
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:16.970
And um,

71
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:21.740
over the years it was very difficult to do interviews because that's all people

72
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.574
would talk about.

73
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.830
So I guess what I would say is I'm doing wonderful now because of how brave that

74
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.670
all my fans have made me.
So thank you for making me brave and I hope I can.

75
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.053
Thank you.
Break.

76
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.860
<v 1>You're also on tour,
so you're performing tonight in Oakland</v>

77
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.100
<v 4>hairdo going,</v>

78
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.950
<v 1>uh,
and what the next question is about your tour.</v>

79
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.500
So Gong on fame 11 from the UK asks,

80
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.040
do you have any funny stories to tell about things that had happened backstage

81
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.210
at the monster ball?

82
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.790
There are lots of funny things that happened backstage at the monster ball.
Um,

83
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.160
<v 3>I don't like surprises and I don't like pranks natural.</v>

84
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.980
I'm sure you can maybe tell her that's fine
when I don't like pink.
But,

85
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:17.040
um,
I actually with me,

86
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.860
I brought all my friends from New York City on tour with me.

87
00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:24.850
So I have had very few,
I should say famous,
uh,

88
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.960
acts opening.

89
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:30.880
It's been mostly a really underground bands and Djs and I've known since I was

90
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:34.870
18 years old.
So there's a lot of backstage shenanigans.

91
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.640
Very often they make jokes about my diet cause they know I have to say stay fit

92
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.570
for music videos.

93
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:44.560
So they'll leave like mountains and cheeseburgers and stuff in my dressing room.

94
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.660
<v 4>Vicious.
Vicious.</v>

95
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.810
<v 1>Uh,
so going back to before the cheeseburgers where you got your star wars,</v>

96
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.920
one of your fans,
Mr Gold,
Maddie from California asks,

97
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.400
where were you the first time you heard one of your songs on the radio?

98
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.470
<v 3>I was in Canada.</v>

99
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.280
<v 4>I know,
never,
I</v>

100
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.480
<v 3>forget it,
but it's a very different,
it's funny.</v>

101
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:16.980
It's almost more enjoyable now when I hear it for the first time on the radio

102
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:21.150
because at the time in Canada I had,
I mean,

103
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.420
many people don't know this about me because it seems as though one just stands

104
00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:28.500
at number one.
It was this big massive,
oh,
she became a star overnight.

105
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:29.490
But to tell you the truth,

106
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:34.440
I hadn't been working so hard doing three shows at night.

107
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.990
Uh,
oh all day long.

108
00:08:36.991 --> 00:08:40.530
Going to radio stations doing of a phone or as my,

109
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.860
the reason we're here on Google today is because the original campaign for my

110
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.060
music and my project began with online,
uh,
and meeting based,

111
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.480
uh,
advertisement.
So,
uh,
that's really where I began.

112
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:58.890
So I remember was in Canada and I was really tired and I was about to go on

113
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:03.120
stage at this outdoor,
um,
uh,
performance.

114
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.600
I actually think it wasn't winning pain,

115
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.750
which is why we aren't gonna smell it from the video.
And,
um,

116
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.680
I remember I heard it and I started crying and my tour manager,

117
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:16.290
David said,
how does it feel?
And I said,

118
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.990
<v 4>damn tie.</v>

119
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.110
<v 3>And so now when it comes on,
it's a little bit more of a gracious,
humbling.</v>

120
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.103
<v 4>Well,</v>

121
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.910
<v 1>so in terms of other special moments,
a Song Adelaide from Sheffield,</v>

122
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:36.300
England ass when exactly it was that moment in your career when you realized you

123
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.220
were going to be an international superstar.

124
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.500
<v 3>I still don't feel like one
really like possible.</v>

125
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.453
<v 4>I just,</v>

126
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.650
<v 3>I know that sounds very silly,
but um,</v>

127
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.340
even this morning I was getting ready to Ted tweet that I was coming here today

128
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.570
and I got like 50 freaking emails.
Like don't tweet it.
It,

129
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:01.340
they don't want anyone to know.

130
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.830
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

131
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.010
well I guess,
I guess they were worried

132
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.120
<v 3>for security,
but I need him.</v>

133
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.150
I need to market when workers,
you know,
people need

134
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:21.723
<v 4>no,</v>

135
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.100
<v 3>and so everyone was saying,</v>

136
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:28.160
well they know you're going to be there and just don't tell them when.
And I,

137
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.300
and Oh my gosh,
my security is always,

138
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.360
they want to shoot me because I will literally leave the house and go to the

139
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.390
Bodega down the street where I live in New York.
And they're like,
where?

140
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.353
<v 4>All right.</v>

141
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.120
<v 3>Because where I live,</v>

142
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.490
I haven't been hustling for so long that it's more just like your home,
you know,

143
00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:51.080
like everybody's so cool.

144
00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:55.460
And I guess even though my first album was called a beam,

145
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.880
that was never the ultimate goal of any of this.

146
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:03.881
It was always that I just really am genuinely a musician to my core.

147
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.280
And a lot of people don't know that about me,
but I write every lyric and we,

148
00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:10.851
Melanie,

149
00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:15.800
I'm in there with a producer's whipping them to make the new future of music.

150
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:19.580
And I,
that is why I'm here.
I'm not here.

151
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.340
Took me a superstar.
But,
so yes and no.
I,

152
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.460
I never,
ever,
there was never a day when I woke up and said,

153
00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:33.200
I'm a superstar.
I'm still waiting for that to happen.

154
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.980
<v 1>Fair enough.
So in terms of formative experiences,
um,
hugs and kisses,</v>

155
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:43.130
x o x o 94 from Pennsylvania asks,

156
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:46.820
<v 4>okay,</v>

157
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.940
<v 1>you said that in school a lot of people bullied you and didn't like you.</v>

158
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.030
Now that you're famous heaven,
you can try to quote unquote apologize,

159
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.050
become friends.
And so when did you say to them?

160
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:57.950
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

161
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.190
<v 1>I wouldn't say apologize.
There's been lots of concert ticket with us.</v>

162
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.190
<v 4>Okay.</v>

163
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.023
<v 3>Um,</v>

164
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.220
and I think one of the most awkward things that anyone ever said to me was,
um,

165
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.700
well my,
my,
how the tables have turned.

166
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.320
Um,
but to be honest site,

167
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:23.350
I don't have that kind of binge fall spirit and myself and I never did.

168
00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:29.030
And it was just more that,
you know,
and I say this with so much,
Jay,
you know,

169
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.410
genuine is from like my heart is it bullying really stays with you your whole

170
00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:36.680
life.
And it really,
really never goes away.

171
00:12:36.681 --> 00:12:41.681
And I know you're using words like superstar and most googled and billions of

172
00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:45.370
youtube videos,
but I was never,

173
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.630
the winter I was always the loser and,
uh,

174
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.260
that's still stays with me.
And,
uh,

175
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.370
do I want to stick it to anybody?
No,
I just want to make music.

176
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.280
So,
uh,

177
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:05.230
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

178
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.890
<v 1>and well I do think,
I think bullying is a really big issue right now,</v>

179
00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:11.724
especially to him.

180
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.453
<v 4>MMM.</v>

181
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.113
<v 1>I'm listening.</v>

182
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:22.550
<v 4>Okay.</v>

183
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.600
<v 1>I imagine that born this way is a little bit about being yourself and how to</v>

184
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:29.510
overcome bullies.
And I don't know if you want to talk a little bit,
a little bit,

185
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.423
what's so funny

186
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.120
<v 3>that song out because everybody was like,
oh,</v>

187
00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:37.670
the lyrics are so literal.
And I'm like,
yeah,

188
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.230
when you know,

189
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.000
when you get bullied you kind of try to,

190
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.140
there's almost this like emotional poetry that you go through in high school.

191
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.400
Oh well,
Sunday.

192
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:55.000
And he just couldn't turn a high from it and be the bigger person.

193
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.830
But born this way is about saying this is who I am,

194
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.840
this is who the fuck I am.

195
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.280
I mean the next single Judas is like this very classic Gaga record.

196
00:14:11.281 --> 00:14:13.410
But more importantly,

197
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:18.470
the song born this way is this like gateway drug for the album.

198
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.640
And really trying to say in the most literal and honestly that I can,

199
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.220
that when I go to the monster ball,

200
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.350
I see somethings so fearless and so special in my fans,

201
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.580
but I also see something afraid.

202
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.330
It's something that I was sending that I was unsure and I really encourage

203
00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:47.370
people to look into the darkness and look into places that you would not

204
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:52.371
normally look to find uniqueness and specialists because that's where that the

205
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:56.660
diamonds are hiding,
I think.
Awesome.

206
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.563
<v 4>MMM,</v>

207
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.130
<v 2>and you were actually,
I'm around very classically trained pianist,</v>

208
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.020
jazz musician and one of our video questions from Leopard scholar 20 actually is

209
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:12.900
about your market.

210
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.470
You've got a little bit in the and Scar Libre scar 20 wants to know about your

211
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:21.630
training ongoing.
So we'll go ahead and roll that video.
There you go.
Done.

212
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.920
<v 5>This is Rudy Hernandez,
one of your little monsters from Portland,
Oregon.</v>

213
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.360
My question is is I was just wondering if you still took piano training in vocal

214
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.990
training to improve your skills.
It'd be great to hear you answer my question.

215
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.740
I can't wait to see you again here in Portland,
Oregon.
And pause.

216
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.100
<v 4>Hi Katie.</v>

217
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.840
<v 2>Um,
uh,
yes,
I am</v>

218
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.540
<v 3>Shelly vocally rehearse every single day,</v>

219
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.420
nine to eight 30 minute warm up every single day.
Uh,

220
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.990
it's been the same vocal warmup that I've been doing since I was 11 years old.

221
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.500
I've been,
I'm hitting my mentor,
Don Lawrence,
uh,

222
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.820
has been my voice teacher since I was 11,
so it's over 10 years now.

223
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.410
Um,
and in terms of piano,
um,
Panas funny.

224
00:16:13.411 --> 00:16:15.600
I mean it's kind of the thing that always stays with you.

225
00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:18.530
I don't know if there's any penis in this room,
uh,

226
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.050
but if you don't practice for a little while and then you focus on it,

227
00:16:22.051 --> 00:16:25.770
you kind of get your jobs back pretty quickly.
So I,

228
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.180
what I do mostly for a piano is I tried to find time when I'm in New York City

229
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:35.510
or on the road to do shows and have jam sessions with my band just for fun.

230
00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:41.601
So whenever you see those really Horton photos of me looking drunk on a piano

231
00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:44.880
bar,
uh,
I'm actually

232
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:47.710
<v 2>okay.</v>

233
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.570
<v 3>Ah,
that's just how I like to rehearse.</v>

234
00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:53.530
I like to have a couple of words teenies and play some Cole Porter.

235
00:16:53.531 --> 00:16:56.350
And that's just the way I like to learn.

236
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.800
<v 2>Yeah.
But it was day in school.</v>

237
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.610
So changing,
changing gears a little bit.

238
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:15.230
I actually have a confession to me.
So we'll pull a picture up here.

239
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:21.010
I was new for a Halloween in 2009 I want to see it

240
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:27.610
and you can see your parents.
Nah,

241
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.380
fabulous on my hands.
And look at cheese.

242
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.720
So I guess transitioning to your style is inspired so many people and

243
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.913
no,

244
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.490
<v 3>what is it about?
Is it because it's a blonde</v>

245
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.010
<v 2>blonde and I actually am,
I am stars on my face,
the long island.
Oh,</v>

246
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.590
<v 1>I see the side of,
there's no poker chips on my hat</v>

247
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.470
for poker face.
So,

248
00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:00.150
<v 4>okay.
So,</v>

249
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.500
<v 1>so many people beyond just me and millions of people have been inspired by your</v>

250
00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:10.220
style.
Uh,
and one of the other fans would like to know is Sore Gaga official.

251
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.640
Sir Gaga would like to know with all the clothes you have,

252
00:18:13.641 --> 00:18:17.090
how do you decide what to wear every day and what happens to the garments after

253
00:18:17.091 --> 00:18:17.924
their warm?

254
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.820
<v 3>Um,
how do I decide what to wear?</v>

255
00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:26.740
It's actually not quite as complicated as some of you might imagine.
Um,

256
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.970
I sometimes,
I mean I'll,
I'll plan months ahead for certain things.
Uh,

257
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.620
that I,
for example,
at the grammys,
the,
um,

258
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.560
the Hussein Chalayan Bessel,
although it's become known as the egg,

259
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.720
he wants me to mind you.
It's the vessel.

260
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.313
<v 4>Uh,</v>

261
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:46.980
<v 3>that was,</v>

262
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.210
that took months and months of conception and I wanted to do a whole performance

263
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:54.420
art piece that began on the red carpet and ended after the performance.

264
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:57.420
So certain things take a while and yes,

265
00:18:57.421 --> 00:19:01.650
I do view the vessel as a fashion piece.

266
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.550
Uh,
but like today,
um,

267
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.540
I wore the same black dress because I wanted the fans to recognize me a certain

268
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:11.520
way when I entered the Google building

269
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.000
<v 1>and also on the topic of style and you have tattoos and one of the other fans</v>

270
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:21.690
noticed that they're all on your left side.
So Taylor,
Monster 15,

271
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:24.630
like to know why are all of your tattoos on the left side of your body?

272
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.510
<v 3>It was actually parent my father's request.</v>

273
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.520
<v 4>So tell us more ass that</v>

274
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.520
<v 3>I remain on one side,
slightly normal.</v>

275
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.950
So I only have my attention is on my left side.
Uh,

276
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.360
I don't,
I'm also a lefty,
so,
um,

277
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.880
<v 4>it's funny,
my father,</v>

278
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.711
<v 3>when I was a kid,</v>

279
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:57.790
he used to try to change my hands when I was little and the doctor would be
like,

280
00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:59.230
she was born that way.
You can't.

281
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.090
<v 4>Uh,</v>

282
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.800
<v 3>so I think maybe some of it just from a neurological standpoint,</v>

283
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.700
it might be because I'm creatively driven by my left side.
And maybe that's why.

284
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.390
But he's at,

285
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:16.220
he's asked that I don't get any more on the rates side for whatever reason.

286
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.770
I think he sees this as my,
like Marilyn Monroe side.
And this is my ag passe.

287
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.713
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

288
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.740
<v 1>So be under silent close and tattoos.</v>

289
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.300
You also has shown tremendous style and your videos and the Struby do would like

290
00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:34.740
to know how do you come up with your video ideas?
Every time I watch that,

291
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.670
I'm stunned by the creativity and meaning.
I love you get lady Gaga.
Struby Dude,

292
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.520
you're a little monster.
Three.
We do.
Struby do.

293
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.800
<v 4>Okay.</v>

294
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.190
<v 3>Um,
it's just good old faithful.</v>

295
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:53.370
I'm a creative person and I just always at some point the idea comes to me and

296
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.330
the most important thing I think with creativity is that you honor your

297
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:03.220
creativity and that you don't ever ignore it or um,

298
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.050
uh,
go against what,
uh,

299
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.100
that creative image is telling you because of what society is projecting on you.

300
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.970
I remember when I called Troy Carter,
my manager from Amsterdam and I was like,

301
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.480
I want to be on a government owned alien territory and space and I wouldn't be

302
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:25.150
giving birth to my own head.

303
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.590
I just want to ask about the clients.
You know,
you hear them.
Ooh.

304
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.580
And he was like,
why?
And I said,

305
00:21:35.581 --> 00:21:40.581
because I see myself and my fans and I feel that they give birth to me and I

306
00:21:41.071 --> 00:21:45.240
give birth to them and the AA symbolized the race of the future,

307
00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:49.680
which oppose no prejudice.
So you know,
I have my own and I'm like,

308
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.000
then I was showing him Francis Bacon photos,
which is like all this like,

309
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.430
you know,
bleeding imagery.
And he was like,
I don't get it.
You know,

310
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.740
we worked with Nick Knight on that video.

311
00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:05.600
If you think I'm bad and McKnight is woo,
he is so smart.
I'm just like nick,

312
00:22:05.601 --> 00:22:08.090
I love you but I don't understand what you're saying.

313
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.573
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

314
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.770
<v 3>Um,
but uh,
I just really always like just the other night,</v>

315
00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:17.520
last night actually I was laying in bed and I had this idea for an outfit and I

316
00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:21.420
just made myself get up and I sketched it real fast and then I went back to

317
00:22:21.421 --> 00:22:25.800
sleep.
I think it's when you say,
Oh,
I'm too tired,

318
00:22:25.801 --> 00:22:29.460
let me just go to bed.
That's when the creativity stops stops coming.

319
00:22:29.461 --> 00:22:33.860
And when you,
you know,
if God calls you pick up the damn phone.
Hello.

320
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.700
So on the topic of videos,
you've obviously shared youtube star.

321
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.200
I was going to ask and so it was dark,
dark of USA from Kentucky.

322
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.870
What's your favorite youtube video that isn't yours?

323
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.700
My favorite youtube video that

324
00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.740
it's so embarrassing,
but I love it.
I love the boy.

325
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.320
But when he comes home from the dentist,

326
00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.620
<v 4>Aye.</v>

327
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.480
Aye.

328
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:16.310
<v 3>Play always sick.
Whenever I'm really tired before I use this show,
I always go,</v>

329
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:17.730
is this real lie?

330
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.810
<v 4>Okay.</v>

331
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.360
<v 3>Because I'll have been up for like 30 hours straight during interviews and then</v>

332
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:28.650
I'll hear the,
you know,
did it dent

333
00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.490
and it shows darts and I just go,
is this real life?

334
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.890
Everybody knows it is.

335
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.970
I love that mini boy.

336
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.250
There's also so many fan remixes and remakes IB your songs

337
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.940
<v 1>on Youtube.
I was wondering if you have a favorite thing or,
I know there's Maria,</v>

338
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.720
the young girl I think really embodies a lot of what is interesting about

339
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:54.554
technology.

340
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.210
<v 3>Maria is just so special and you know,
she's,</v>

341
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:04.310
she's like 10 years,
she's 10 years old,
but even 10 year olds today,

342
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:07.880
I know how to work a web cam and uploading youtube video.
You know?

343
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.870
And I think that's the,

344
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.910
that is why this for myself,

345
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:19.150
my campaign and with my album has been so successful is because I too am a child

346
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:21.980
of the.com era.

347
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:25.970
I mean my father ran an internet company when I was really young,

348
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.080
so I was listening to lots of technology talk jargon over the dinner table.

349
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.970
Not Understanding till lunch later what it all meant.
Uh,
but,
uh,

350
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.400
she's beautiful.

351
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.460
She's very young and she has a voice in the world and she latched on to a song

352
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:50.741
that was very risky for me to put out a so soon and my career.

353
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.950
Uh,
but if I could just touch maybe 10,

354
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.160
10 year olds in the world and every single continent,

355
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.690
maybe I could make a difference

356
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.900
<v 1>there.
We have the Maria video.
I think it would be good for people to stay ahead.</v>

357
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.560
I think I may have a coupon.

358
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.903
<v 0>Oh,</v>

359
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:37.783
<v 6>she say</v>

360
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.553
great.

361
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.100
Oh
yeah.

362
00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.700
Was this way

363
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.533
<v 0>amazing.</v>

364
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.210
<v 3>It's,</v>

365
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:20.210
so what I would like to speak about is the way that we experience music now.

366
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.670
We experienced the music thing.

367
00:26:23.671 --> 00:26:28.671
The Internet has really great effects and it also has really negative effect.

368
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.650
The great effect is Maria,

369
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:37.430
the negative effect is you sort of quite mathematically input your songs and

370
00:26:38.341 --> 00:26:43.260
your soul into a computer and out spits out charts.

371
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.593
<v 1>So</v>

372
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.670
<v 3>like the fan experience now,
um,</v>

373
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:56.180
digitally is they buy in the song and then they get into chat rooms and they

374
00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:58.370
watch the song climate chart.

375
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.880
But somebody like Maria has no pretension.

376
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:06.560
She's wildly innocent and beautiful and she only cares about the music and the

377
00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:07.394
lyrics.

378
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.460
So when I'm working on doing now is creating a fan experience with the release

379
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.210
of born this way that takes them a bit away from the computer in terms of the

380
00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:19.700
actual purchase of the song.
Uh,

381
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:24.470
I want to encourage the fans to experience the music and the lyrics.

382
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.310
Um,
we moved of,
uh,

383
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:32.720
that sort of behind the computer.
Um,
uh,

384
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.050
uh,
banter.
When I was a kid,

385
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:41.051
I was standing outside of h and the praying that I saw Billy Joe's fingernail

386
00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:46.580
and the window,
uh,
going to get my green day CD signed.

387
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.760
I was hoping that I would see Tongue York when Radiohead came in,

388
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.520
you know,
that is what I want to recreate from my fans.

389
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:59.360
We've done it with the monster mall and now I want to do it,
uh,

390
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.520
with album retail.

391
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.370
<v 1>And you're also showing a lot of things from behind the scenes.</v>

392
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.840
So you hadn't gone vision on Youtube and go,
I got info from Twitter.

393
00:28:08.841 --> 00:28:12.860
Would like to know.
Please could you bring back Gaga Vision?
We miss it so much.

394
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.630
Ps,
we love you and we're so proud.

395
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.230
<v 3>I love Gaga Vision.
Uh,
that was the,</v>

396
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.890
they were these little films that I was doing,
uh,
back when I first began,

397
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.570
uh,
touring.
But I actually just got so busy,
um,

398
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.720
it was really difficult to have a camera in my face.

399
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:35.610
You will never see me do reality television.
It will never don't even app.

400
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.623
<v 4>Whenever it happened,</v>

401
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.740
<v 3>it will never happen.
It's just,
um,
I'm not that kind of person.
Uh,</v>

402
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.370
life whole life is a performance piece.

403
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.400
So I don't need to have my picture taken to feel that I'm in a moment of art.

404
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.710
So,
uh,

405
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:59.520
but the good news is as I'm planning the born this way ball,

406
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.320
I have been speaking at Terry Richardson,
who's this really amazing photographer.

407
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:06.410
He wanted to,
uh,
uh,

408
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.420
film some of them making a process of what we're doing.

409
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:14.421
So I'm hoping we can resurrect the Gaga vision videos for,

410
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:18.990
uh,
the creation of the new tour so you guys can creatively,
um,

411
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.600
being more connected to how I make things.

412
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:23.883
<v 4>I'd be great.</v>

413
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.340
<v 1>Oh,
since we're at Google,
this question is apropos,
uh,
these run from in Chicago,</v>

414
00:29:33.341 --> 00:29:37.750
Illinois asks,
have you ever googled yourself just to see what came up?
Yes,

415
00:29:37.751 --> 00:29:40.360
of course I have.
When was the last time?

416
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.730
<v 3>The last time I probably,
uh,</v>

417
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.870
well last night I wanted to know if people knew when I was going to be here

418
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.190
because everybody was telling me not to,
to

419
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.103
<v 4>wait.</v>

420
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:58.510
<v 3>So I googled and I didn't see enough come up.
So I said,
well,
I'm tweeting.</v>

421
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.090
<v 4>Yeah,
I saw that problem.</v>

422
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.513
<v 1>And then,</v>

423
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:06.190
<v 4>mmm,</v>

424
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:10.270
<v 1>well you've got 443 million hits on Google for lady Gaga,</v>

425
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:13.300
which basically means you don't have very much anonymity laughed at all.

426
00:30:13.301 --> 00:30:16.420
And I guess pooky one,
two,
or three or four from Colorado asks,

427
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.250
are there ever moments the Paparazzi,
doesn't it

428
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:24.080
<v 3>recognize you?
I have to be really honest.</v>

429
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.910
People that stay and that they can't escape the Paparazzi are full of shit.

430
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:31.973
<v 4>So</v>

431
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:37.090
<v 3>let me just be the artist to throw everybody under the bus.</v>

432
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.270
My head of security standing over there nodding.

433
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.330
I don't spend money on houses and lots of cars,

434
00:30:45.331 --> 00:30:49.970
but I do spend money on security and they never find me.
So,
uh,

435
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.190
no,
it doesn't run my life because,
uh,

436
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.330
getting my photo taken is not what makes me feel like an artist.

437
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.830
It's being in front of 50,000 fans screaming.

438
00:31:01.831 --> 00:31:04.410
I was born this way,
baby.
That's why I'm here.

439
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.150
<v 1>We have another video question from peach dog.</v>

440
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.260
A one to two for the user names aren't great.

441
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.850
Stock keeps dog wants to know a little bit about regrets.

442
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:22.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

443
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.733
<v 7>Amen.
The Monster.</v>

444
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.030
My name is Ben and my question for you is that in the song born this way that

445
00:31:29.031 --> 00:31:30.910
you were used to at least,
which is awesome.

446
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.990
You have the lyrics that don't hide yourself in regret.

447
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.440
I was wondering if you have ever regretted anything or if there's something your

448
00:31:38.441 --> 00:31:40.830
life that you'd ever want to change in the past.
Um,

449
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.030
thank you for looking at my question.
I really love you.

450
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.550
Thank you for making these.
Bye.

451
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.930
<v 3>Is there anything that I regret from my past?
Um,</v>

452
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.340
well,
I'll begin with the lyric and I will say,

453
00:31:57.341 --> 00:32:02.080
don't hide yourself in regret is don't perpetuate negativity in your life.

454
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.700
Don't obsess about the things that you didn't do or the things that you may have

455
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:10.360
not done your best.
Obsess about the future,

456
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.920
obsessing about today.

457
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.460
Thank endlessly about how you can pull the inner queen or king out of yourself

458
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.010
and let that,
let that superstar shine.

459
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.080
I don't believe that famous something that is obtainable.
I believe that it's,

460
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.440
it's inside of you.
It's not something that you can touch.
It's not tangible,

461
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.680
which is why when I speak about the pop rocks and things,

462
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.200
it's very meaningless to me.

463
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.620
There are days when I wake up and I don't feel like a superstar.

464
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.610
And it's those regrets.
He say,
uh,

465
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.740
did you ever wake up and feel like a superstar?
The answer's no.
Uh,

466
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:55.130
the regret of some days me waking up and not feeling brave enough.

467
00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:55.940
Uh,

468
00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.140
those are the regrets I have because I have so many things to be grateful for.

469
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.890
So many fans looking up to me and the days when I feel insecure,

470
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.270
those are my regrets.

471
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.220
I want to always be secure and strong for you because look at how speed they're

472
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.970
there.
They're so,
uh,
so genuine and they're listening to the lyrics,

473
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:17.090
you know?
And so I guess what I would say is don't,

474
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.280
don't obsess over what you've done wrong.

475
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.320
Always look into yourself and the answer and be the best you that you can be in

476
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:25.154
the future.

477
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.080
<v 1>And in the same area.</v>

478
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.153
<v 0>I think it's</v>

479
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.830
<v 1>in the same vein.
We have a Christian for Australia.</v>

480
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.200
What's the greatest piece of advice you've ever received?

481
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.790
<v 3>It's the greatest piece of advice I've ever received.</v>

482
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:46.993
<v 0>It is.</v>

483
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.820
<v 3>If you don't have any shadows,
you're not standing in the light.</v>

484
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.513
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

485
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.153
I say that to me

486
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.260
<v 3>every day,
every single day.</v>

487
00:34:03.261 --> 00:34:06.980
I say that because I'm not a squeaky clean person,
you know?

488
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:11.590
So there's nothing about my music or the monster ball.

489
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:14.820
All my fans that were not squeaky clean.
Well,
you know,

490
00:34:14.821 --> 00:34:16.040
when people always say to me,

491
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:21.041
who's the ring leader you when in reality we're pretty much an open book about

492
00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:25.700
my life.
Uh,
what you're asking me about his magic.

493
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.250
And if you are magical,

494
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.750
you always have shallows in the light.
You must cast a shadow.

495
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:34.750
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

496
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.940
<v 1>So let's talk a little bit about the new album.
It's out on May 23rd boring.</v>

497
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:41.350
This winning the s the first thing and all the title singles already out.

498
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.140
It's been number one for five weeks already.

499
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.730
<v 0>You done</v>

500
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.950
<v 1>and we have a video question about the new album.</v>

501
00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:53.380
So we'll go to jazz bridger here on video.

502
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

503
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.030
<v 8>Hi.
If you could describe the born this way album in just three words,</v>

504
00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.043
what would they be

505
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:06.200
<v 3>in three words?
See how smart my fanzine?</v>

506
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:07.483
<v 0>Well,</v>

507
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.860
<v 3>I would call it,</v>

508
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.530
I would,
well I would I Wendy's a,
it is one word.

509
00:35:22.531 --> 00:35:24.570
I suppose that avant garde is one word,

510
00:35:24.571 --> 00:35:28.380
but I would call it Avant Garde techno rock.
Okay.

511
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.950
<v 0>Well
there's a lot of 'em.</v>

512
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:37.920
<v 3>It's Atlanta,
um,
rock influences on the album,
but not in a,</v>

513
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.950
uh,
this is a rock music record kind of way.

514
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:45.951
It actually is quite steadfast and that it is an exploration and electronic

515
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:49.590
music and techno sonics.

516
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:54.830
But I have sort of created a genre of metal dance,

517
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.340
techno pop music with a lot of wrong anthemic courses.

518
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.100
Um,
because that is the music that I love.
I'm actually really obsessed with it.

519
00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.510
Bruce Springsteen.
Um,

520
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.530
my father used to play,

521
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:15.460
we're Springsteen records for me all the time when I was a kid and he was,
um,

522
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:20.170
blue collar America.
And in a way,

523
00:36:20.171 --> 00:36:25.171
I guess I related to Bruce because I watched my father,

524
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.860
a blue collar American citizen relate to Bruce.

525
00:36:29.861 --> 00:36:32.980
And I think that in a social way,

526
00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.870
my fans feel blue collar.

527
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.860
They feel like they're the underdogs that will someday be the winners.
And,
uh,

528
00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:44.390
I took the influence of Bruce on my father in my life,
uh,

529
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.520
to create this album.
And uh,
yeah,
lots of really big,

530
00:36:48.521 --> 00:36:53.521
almost like big def Leppard style melodies and the in the courses.

531
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:58.180
But,
uh,
it's electronic dance music.
It's very hard and very edgy.

532
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.020
Um,
and I'm very [inaudible].
I did it for you to hear it.

533
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.910
<v 0>We're all looking forward to [inaudible].</v>

534
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.340
<v 3>One of the things that you face as an artist is censorship.</v>

535
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.250
So Shane Rz 66 from Colorado asks,

536
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:17.970
how do you feel about Malaysian radio stations editing out your imperative,

537
00:37:17.971 --> 00:37:22.890
no matter gay,
straight or bi lesbian,
transgendered lifeline from born this way?

538
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.920
Well,
obviously I disagree with it.

539
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.980
Otherwise I wouldn't have specifically put those words in a song that I knew

540
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:36.430
would be put on top 40 radio.
Um,

541
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.910
what I would say is for all of the young people in Malaysia that want those

542
00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:44.350
words to be played on the radio,

543
00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:49.410
it is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard.

544
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.630
You must do everything that you can.

545
00:37:52.631 --> 00:37:57.340
If you want to be liberated by your society,
you must call.

546
00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.660
You must not stop.
You must protest piece of lane.
Nobody.

547
00:38:01.661 --> 00:38:04.450
I don't believe in violence.
I don't believe in negativity.

548
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:06.910
There's no reason to be derogatory.

549
00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:12.210
You just have to keep fighting for what you believe in and to be quite honest,

550
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.160
honesty and the truth is always what will set you free.

551
00:38:15.161 --> 00:38:20.161
I can't tell you how many times I get phone calls from TV stations and Troy will

552
00:38:21.011 --> 00:38:25.600
call me and he'll say,
they want you to edit out this section of the video or,

553
00:38:25.601 --> 00:38:27.400
and I say,
well just tell them I'm not doing it.

554
00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:30.570
And if they don't want to play it,
they don't have to.
Yeah.

555
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.450
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

556
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:40.590
<v 3>artists is constantly loading ourselves and changing and bridging,</v>

557
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:47.560
bridging what we do for the machine than the artists becomes part of the

558
00:38:47.561 --> 00:38:49.960
machine.
I don't want to be part of the machine.

559
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.880
I want the machine to be part of me.

560
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:55.643
<v 1>The next question,</v>

561
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.740
the next question is actually a composite and we'll open up to actually to

562
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:05.930
Google or questions if you want to move to the microphones in just a minute.
Um,

563
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.850
is it your boss?

564
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:11.850
There were 643 fan questions asked about the next single but comes off of born

565
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.240
this way.
Judas.

566
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.480
And so I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the inspiration for

567
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:18.910
it.
Um,
the video you have planned.

568
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:20.900
<v 3>I'm very excited actually.</v>

569
00:39:20.901 --> 00:39:24.620
I can exclusively with zeal here.

570
00:39:24.621 --> 00:39:25.970
I Google that.

571
00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.360
I will be making my directorial debut with Lorianne Gibson directing this video

572
00:39:31.851 --> 00:39:33.290
with her ourselves.

573
00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.720
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

574
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.883
<v 3>surprise,</v>

575
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:46.950
I'm sure to many of you that Judas is a man of the biblical senses.

576
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.660
Uh,
so,
um,

577
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.920
expect to see some symbolism in this video.
Uh,

578
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.100
but the song is about some of the words in the song like can prevail here are,

579
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:02.440
um,
when he comes to me,
I am ready.

580
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:07.830
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs forgive him when his tongue lies

581
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:11.920
through his brain.
Even after three times he betrays me,

582
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:17.110
I'll bring them down a king with no crown.
Uh,

583
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:22.140
so the song is about honoring your darkness in order to bring yourself into the

584
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:24.040
light.
Uh,

585
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.010
it's kind of what I just mentioned to you about if you're standing in the light,

586
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.480
you cast a shadow.
I have been haunted by my past for very,

587
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.560
very long time.

588
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:36.640
And actually that's a recurring theme on Elmo and has a lot to do.

589
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:41.380
I think with identity and being able to be proud and say I was born this way,

590
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:45.910
but I was haunted by being able to go back to New York.

591
00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:47.560
Being able to go back to my past,

592
00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:52.300
being able to understand why made certain decisions that instead of regretting

593
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:55.900
them,
I chose to embrace and understand why I made those choices.

594
00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:01.260
And what the Song Judas about is about is you have to look into what's haunting

595
00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:07.231
you and you need to learn to forgive yourself in order to move on or we all

596
00:41:07.661 --> 00:41:07.850
looking

597
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:08.683
<v 0>forward to</v>

598
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:15.800
and it's really fun to dance to.
And it sounds like

599
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.920
<v 3>a pop priest record.
It's really fun.</v>

600
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.860
<v 1>So we'll go ahead and take some questions from the audience.
Hi.</v>

601
00:41:24.861 --> 00:41:28.130
So I understand that the fame brought you a lot of great things like your

602
00:41:28.131 --> 00:41:30.230
monsters and everything that's happening to you,

603
00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.340
but is there something that the fame brought you that could do without

604
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.940
<v 3>that I could do without?
Um,
I don't know.
No,</v>

605
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.470
I would say no.
I don't want to focus on anything negative like that.
It's,

606
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.620
there's always,
whether you're famous or you're not,

607
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:50.740
there's always things in your life that you could do without.

608
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.320
So I don't think anything is particularly fame related.
I,

609
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.960
I've got a really good family and if anything,

610
00:41:56.961 --> 00:42:01.520
I'm grateful because my family and I wrestled fame to the ground and we're

611
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:04.070
stronger than ever.
So,
uh,
so no.

612
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.820
<v 9>Hi Lady Gaga.
Thanks so much for coming.
And I'm so cute.</v>

613
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.610
A little background on this.
Um,

614
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.050
I took the inspiration from the Kermit the frog one.
Yeah.

615
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.920
It's how I added a little bit of myself in it.
They're bunnies.

616
00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:25.940
So for eastern I thought it'd be a,
uh,
hoppin you know,
attire.

617
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.780
You liked that.
I liked it too funny.
Sorry,
what was that?

618
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:38.000
That's funny.
Yeah.
So I mean,
I,
I thought I had to,
you know,
dress up shoes.

619
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.820
I definitely wanted to speak to you and give you a hug or whatever.
Um,

620
00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.693
but I think,

621
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.180
I think Google as a whole and youtube and the world is very excited for you to

622
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:51.110
come here and be so candid.
Um,
so on that note,
I'm disappointing,
you know,

623
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:55.520
really curious when you're not in the spotlight,
um,
when you're home,
you know,

624
00:42:55.521 --> 00:42:58.340
in New York with your family,
um,
what are,

625
00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:02.110
what are some of the things you enjoy doing?
Um,
what do you wear?
Um,

626
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:06.570
what are your pajamas look like?
Um,
um,

627
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.260
<v 3>well I'm actually,
um,</v>

628
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:15.910
I'm very into yoga,
so I do a lot of that really cry.

629
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.860
I sound the yoga rooms here at big Pharma.
I'm not Google.
I was like,

630
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.140
it's ending my way,

631
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.380
but I'm actually really into that crazy hot yoga in hundred degree rooms.

632
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.440
Um,
it's the only thing that I can,

633
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.040
I feel can be really bad at and nobody knows.

634
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.010
So I sort of take comfort in the journey on becoming good at Yoga because,

635
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:46.020
uh,
if I suck at one day,
nobody sees it and it's just me.

636
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.680
And that's,
I guess that's the thing about fame that,
that is,

637
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:54.750
is difficult is if a screw up
Google

638
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:57.993
<v 9>there.</v>

639
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.360
<v 3>Um,
I love,
I love Yoga.
I love cooking.</v>

640
00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:07.530
I'm a really good cook actually,
which means some of you may not know about me.

641
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.140
Um,
I love spending time with my mom.

642
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.220
I love getting really drunk with my friends at the same bars that we used to go

643
00:44:14.221 --> 00:44:19.221
to and listening to ACDC records and,

644
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.430
um,
what else do,
what do I wear?
Um,
I mean,

645
00:44:23.431 --> 00:44:27.630
to tell you the truth,
it's very funny because my father quite often it's like,

646
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.990
can't you just put on this or,

647
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.470
but
have you been to any of my shows out of curiosity?
No,

648
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:39.300
not yet.
You haven't yet?
Well,

649
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:44.330
I would say anyone that's seen me live would tell you that whether I'm dressed

650
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:48.030
like this or wearing a tee shirt,
I look the same.

651
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.190
And I know that that might sound silly,
but,
um,

652
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.070
it's not this that you are responding to anymore.
And I keep talking,

653
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:01.800
talking about this because my fans are actually quite blind to my clothes.

654
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.000
No,
because they're so used to it that they don't see it anymore.

655
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:10.710
They just see me.
And I'm excited about that because I think with this new album,

656
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.983
uh,

657
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:16.860
people will wonder less and less what I look like when I'm brushing my teeth.

658
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.730
But the truth is I look exactly like I look right now,
I just,
you know,

659
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:25.440
probably have a motley Crue tee shirt on and there's a really good looking guy

660
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:26.274
and my bed.

661
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:31.390
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

662
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.300
<v 2>well I think my manager is out on the road.</v>

663
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.713
<v 0>Well</v>

664
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.750
<v 9>anytime you want to come cook in or you know,</v>

665
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:44.910
hanging out with my mom and you're more than welcome.

666
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.330
<v 2>Well you asked for a hug.
So do you want to come up in here?</v>

667
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.420
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

668
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.110
<v 2>so cute.
That's a lot of bunnies.</v>

669
00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:22.520
<v 3>16</v>

670
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:27.810
<v 9>so we'll take a few more questions here.
Hi,
my name is Logan.</v>

671
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:32.250
Thank you so much for coming.
I Logan thrilled that you're here.
Hi.
Um,

672
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.760
I'm wondering,
have you seen the video called Friday by Rebecca Black?

673
00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:38.283
<v 3>No.</v>

674
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:42.640
<v 9>So this is the latest Internet sensation and it's this 13 year old girl who made</v>

675
00:46:42.641 --> 00:46:46.450
a video and now it's online and everyone's making fun of it and just kind of

676
00:46:46.451 --> 00:46:48.910
criticizing it as really cheesy,
which it is.

677
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.450
But she's only 13 and my reaction to it,

678
00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:57.190
or I'm curious about your reaction to youtube as a forum for new artists and for

679
00:46:57.191 --> 00:47:00.160
some of the criticism that may be young people get for going online.

680
00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:03.580
And then on the other side there's the Justin Biebers who are becoming famous

681
00:47:03.581 --> 00:47:07.450
through youtube.
So what do you think about the future of fame through youtube?

682
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.490
<v 2>I think it's fantastic.</v>

683
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:15.160
I wrote back,
oh black is a genius.

684
00:47:15.161 --> 00:47:18.700
And anyone that's telling her she's Chinsy is full of shit.

685
00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.060
<v 0>Okay.
Sorry.
Here</v>

686
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:30.640
<v 10>I got.
Thanks for coming.</v>

687
00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.890
<v 3>Nice.
Nice.</v>

688
00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:38.870
<v 4>I think I've done the,
you know,
I don't want to laugh</v>

689
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.970
<v 3>because I'm quite certain that sometimes want to,
I enter the room.</v>

690
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.160
That's how painful.
Well,

691
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.120
it's really good.
It kind of looks like the Chrysler building.

692
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:50.890
<v 4>Thank you.</v>

693
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.210
<v 10>Yeah.
I used to be an architect.</v>

694
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:56.080
So did you go to school at Carnegie Mellon?

695
00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:58.400
<v 4>Great.</v>

696
00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.830
<v 10>Well,
I'm happy to I lenders to you for your concert.</v>

697
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.213
<v 4>Okay.</v>

698
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.850
<v 3>One of them Lanco quite well actually</v>

699
00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:09.643
<v 10>it's all yours.</v>

700
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.580
That might surmise serious question though is,
and we talk about Gaga,

701
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:20.090
this guy got out and the fame and the fame monster.
But what about Stephanie?

702
00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.880
Like how do you stay Stephanie through,

703
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.750
<v 3>I have this question.
Who are you living?</v>

704
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.270
<v 4>I'm right here.</v>

705
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:36.160
<v 3>Stephanie is also who I am.
God has just my nickname.</v>

706
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:40.510
It's like when you're a kid and your mom calls you skip or

707
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:42.923
<v 4>okay</v>

708
00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:47.070
<v 3>calling you,
uh,
you know Johnny,</v>

709
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.950
she calls you Jonathan.
And when you're,
when you're bad,
uh,

710
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.160
it's the same thing for me.
It's just,

711
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.400
it was a way for me to release so many years of being told no by this business.

712
00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.440
And it's actually funny because I didn't,
um,

713
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:10.310
I didn't shop around to record labels until I was calling myself Gaga and until

714
00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:13.290
people in New York knew me as lady Gaga,

715
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.680
but in high school and making music and choir and being Catholic and the boys

716
00:49:21.121 --> 00:49:23.820
play and all the girls hated me because I always got the lead,

717
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:30.130
hated me for that cause it was at the boys' school.
So if you've got the lead,

718
00:49:30.131 --> 00:49:32.250
they were always at the boys' school,
upper school.

719
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:37.500
So I guess what I'm trying to say is,

720
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:42.710
is I really make absolutely no separation between Stephanie and Gaga.

721
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.170
It is the absolute same person.
It's just,

722
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.890
it was a way for me in my life and I was in gift.

723
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:54.600
I wish I could give to anyone is if you went through hard times when you were a

724
00:49:54.601 --> 00:49:58.860
kid or when you were in college or maybe you had a job that really,

725
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.960
and they fire and you and you were,
you were,
you know,

726
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.630
poor for two years and then you got any,

727
00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:08.660
I wish I could give that gift to anyone of being able to say I will be unique,

728
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.360
all of that negativity and I am no a new person and I'm going to be the queen.

729
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.240
I know that I can be.
And that's really all that.
I bet it is.

730
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.790
<v 10>Thanks.
I know you have it meticulously plan wardrobe,</v>

731
00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:24.360
but just in case I'm going to leave this.

732
00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.190
<v 3>Thank you very much.
We'll take</v>

733
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.810
<v 0>two days.
Leave all fashion accessories.
Ooh,</v>

734
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.700
Ooh,
thank you.

735
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:43.210
I can't help but

736
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.800
it's not balancing very well.
Okay,
well no you weren't.

737
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:59.560
<v 10>Oh,
thank you very much for coming.
[inaudible] so much of you music is,</v>

738
00:50:59.561 --> 00:51:00.660
as you kind of labeled it,

739
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.690
the Avant Garde techno rock and kind of lends itself towards this really epic

740
00:51:04.691 --> 00:51:06.560
sound.
Um,
and then you,

741
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:10.610
you take those songs and you make these amazing acoustic versions that,

742
00:51:10.611 --> 00:51:13.700
that are just as polar opposite in terms of the music.
How it,

743
00:51:13.701 --> 00:51:17.680
and I was just wondering if you'd talk about the process of building those two

744
00:51:17.681 --> 00:51:20.740
songs out of the same lyrics,
same notes,
same chords.
Um,

745
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.350
and is there one that you prefer like performing?

746
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:24.800
<v 3>Oh,
well,</v>

747
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:30.130
I guess what I would say is a lot of times and my songwriting process,

748
00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.800
I will begin at the piano.
So I'll,

749
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:37.040
I will actually write one of the songs and they all along that is truly one of

750
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:41.480
my favorites.
It's called the edge of glory.
And,
uh,
it's kind of a sad story,

751
00:51:41.481 --> 00:51:42.330
sorry to be a downer.

752
00:51:42.331 --> 00:51:47.060
But my grandpa died about five months ago and my dad and I were going to say

753
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:52.061
goodbye to him at the hospice and I got out of big thing of a god way Tequila.

754
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.600
And my dad sat next to me at the piano and we just started doing shots back and

755
00:51:56.601 --> 00:52:01.040
forth.
And I wrote the edge of Gloria and then piano.
My Dad and I cried.
And,

756
00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.300
uh,
this song's about,
um,
your last moment on earth,

757
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.690
the moment of truth,
the edge of glory is that,

758
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:12.900
that moment right before you leave there.
Um,

759
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.610
so that song can be played on the piano,

760
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.590
but it's actually set to this giant,
huge techno rock,

761
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.290
Springsteen s Dan Speight.

762
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:27.650
I actually had Clarence Clemons from the e street band come out and play

763
00:52:27.651 --> 00:52:32.120
saxophone on it.
It's fucking beautiful.

764
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:37.130
And I do that with a lot of my songs,
but it's,
it's,
it's funny,

765
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:42.160
it's so interesting to hear your perspective on it because that is really what I

766
00:52:42.381 --> 00:52:47.060
wanted to do with this album as I wanted to show my abilities as a songwriter.

767
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.340
So a lot of the songs are like that.

768
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:54.030
There's really no song on the album that can't be played at a piano
acoustically.

769
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.640
It's all about the song writing.

770
00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:00.170
It's all about my abilities as a writer from a melodic perspective.

771
00:53:00.171 --> 00:53:05.090
And I coproduce produced every song on the album.
So,
uh,
sonically it just,

772
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:08.210
it just smells like me,
if that makes any sense.

773
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.890
So I guess what I'm trying to say is,
um,
in my opinion,

774
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:17.330
all good music can be played at a piano and still sound like a hit.

775
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:22.520
<v 0>Thank you very much.
And one more question here.</v>

776
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.200
Hi.
Hi.

777
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.033
<v 10>I'm Chris.</v>

778
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.820
<v 0>Hello.
Why do I</v>

779
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:31.160
<v 3>likes the movie were coaxed into doing this.</v>

780
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:32.623
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

781
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.990
<v 10>Cause we were promised we would get a prize if he's the best dressed.
Oh.</v>

782
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:37.310
Hoping to win.

783
00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:40.460
<v 3>So you get 200 bucks.
I'm painting then those Bala,</v>

784
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:45.680
<v 0>the action
there.
What?</v>

785
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:46.920
Loofahs Lupus.

786
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:51.360
<v 3>Oh sorry.
Can I take my glasses up?
Yeah.
To take a really fancy shower then.
Okay.</v>

787
00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:52.423
<v 0>Okay.</v>

788
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:58.960
<v 10>Um,
okay.
So I've got to on my credits,
I'm nervous.
But um,</v>

789
00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:05.130
what I wanted to ask you after hearing you talk,
you have a very positive,

790
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:10.110
um,
look on life.
So I was just kind of wondering where that came from,

791
00:54:10.111 --> 00:54:13.650
what happened in your life to shape that cause not many people are,

792
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.370
are like you and can always say rebuke things that are bad and you know,

793
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:18.240
always looked at it.
Good.

794
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.940
<v 3>Well my mom has a really good mom.</v>

795
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.480
She really was there for me and she always taught me to be very gracious.

796
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.670
My mother is the kind of person that won't give you the shirt off her back if

797
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:39.210
you're called a,
and that is how I was raised.

798
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.210
But I guess I would also say in it,

799
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.200
I don't know if people want be more religious.

800
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:48.201
And I always felt kind of awkward talking about religion because I don't want

801
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:53.310
people to feel like I'm impressing any kind of belief on you.
Um,
but I do see,

802
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:58.880
I do believe that God comes in many forms and I don't believe that we know what

803
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:03.530
he looks like.
That's something that I actually address and um,

804
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.510
and Judas,
but I see God in my fans.

805
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.930
So every night when I look into the audience,

806
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.380
I feel like I see this,

807
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:18.900
this force of beauty and,
and that,
I don't know,
it's just faith.

808
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:23.820
So I say faith and my fans and,
uh,
that's what keeps me strong as them,

809
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.220
as I really want to go out there.
That,
you know,
I don't,

810
00:55:26.221 --> 00:55:30.630
I don't go out after this showing get plastered and do a ton of drugs.

811
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:34.410
And when I go on stage the next day,
I can barely sing.
You know,
I'm very,

812
00:55:34.411 --> 00:55:38.820
very disciplined and hardworking and I am a,
as a book,

813
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.130
as a blonde woman with tits and ass.

814
00:55:41.131 --> 00:55:45.140
Very proud of my accomplishments as a musician.
And I say that with,

815
00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:49.200
with lots of strength.
Um,
people call it arrogance,
but I,

816
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:53.280
I do believe that women in pop music,
um,

817
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.230
have a very bad rap.

818
00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:59.820
And I think people have learned to expect very little from all of us.

819
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:03.060
And it's very unfair.
It's a very prejudice.

820
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:07.110
So me and my tits and my ass and my brain,
I'm very proud to be here

821
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.063
<v 0>today</v>

822
00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.980
and I truly,
I truly see that.
Thank

823
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:19.690
<v 3>God and my fans,
they are,
they are,</v>

824
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.390
they are who I worship is when I'm trying to say,

825
00:56:22.391 --> 00:56:24.400
and I believe you worship in your life.

826
00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:29.660
It doesn't have to be religion or an institution or a certain kind of God.

827
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:34.600
It's just you must worship your,
your faith.

828
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:39.550
I perhaps I am speaking,
uh,
and my own Gaga tongues,

829
00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:43.810
but I worship my fans is what I'm trying to say.
They are.
They are my religion.

830
00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.293
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

831
00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:52.340
I love your music.
I love you too.

832
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.553
<v 0>No.</v>

833
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:11.090
[inaudible]

834
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:16.700
<v 2>that's how that towel wrapping its game to me.
Like new Jerusalem to then,</v>

835
00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:23.010
so if I'm not mistaken,
next Monday,
March 28th is your 25th birthday.

836
00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:23.990
Yes.

837
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:28.140
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

838
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.440
<v 2>happy birthday and meet you.</v>

839
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:35.330
And you can tell him I just keep telling people I'm 24 we won't tell you who

840
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:38.850
light,
but we won't,
we have a surprise for you.

841
00:57:38.851 --> 00:57:41.760
But you can tell that there's many people in the audience who are dressed up in

842
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:46.110
their best Gaga garb and we've handed cards to a few people.

843
00:57:46.111 --> 00:57:49.290
So one of the people who came and got her card before the show come up and we're

844
00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:52.290
going to have you the best lady Gaga.

845
00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.060
You want to come on and come on here.

846
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:02.920
<v 0>Hi.
Can I get those all of you?</v>

847
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:11.230
That's really good.
Hello.

848
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:16.463
Thank you.

849
00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:24.530
Thank you.
Hi.
Hello.
Hi.

850
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.180
<v 2>This is interesting.
It's very easy.</v>

851
00:58:27.181 --> 00:58:30.490
Sounded wrong in the 60s is an ammunition belt.

852
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:36.280
<v 0>Wow.
That's heavy.
Nice boots.</v>

853
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:40.390
Hi,
you look beautiful.
Hi.

854
00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.970
You know what's so funny?

855
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.130
<v 3>I was on my first record label go,
you can go back.</v>

856
00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.093
<v 2>Sorry.</v>

857
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:55.620
<v 3>When I was on my first record label def jam,
not to bring up,
it's our story,</v>

858
00:58:55.621 --> 00:59:00.621
but I sent all of the employees and def jam disco balls that I pan painted

859
00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:08.450
myself like that except I wrote his Gaga all over them and I sent them huge bags

860
00:59:10.531 --> 00:59:15.150
of candy from the dollars.
But these disco balls,

861
00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.760
it had my name on it and I got dropped like a month later.
But,

862
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:19.523
<v 2>but I,</v>

863
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.420
<v 3>I remember someone called,
told me that everybody in the office was like,</v>

864
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:28.900
who sent all these,
these gummy worms and just go blog.

865
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:33.170
The thing Gacaca,
I hadn't painted those suckers.

866
00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.580
I mean one of them.

867
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:39.163
Okay,

868
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:45.100
well this is very good and this is very good because it looks almost exactly

869
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:51.041
like my Terry me and glare inspired outfit from the fame ball.

870
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.060
Very first fame ball.

871
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.300
This is amazing because it looks just like the telephone video.

872
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.730
However,

873
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.320
I have to say that the mark of a true Gaga fan is always thinking forward.

874
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.100
And that is you.

875
01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.610
<v 0>It's very,
very deep.</v>

876
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:22.180
<v 3>The pony tail looks perfect.
The,
uh,
the shoulder pads on that.</v>

877
01:00:22.181 --> 01:00:24.160
You,
you did a nice job with the duck tape

878
01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:32.220
and that is exactly why it took me an hour to get my makeup done for that.

879
01:00:33.011 --> 01:00:34.930
And it's 15 minutes.

880
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:41.190
That's a real glamour girl.
Well,
congratulations.

881
01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.003
<v 0>Okay.</v>

882
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:49.160
<v 3>No,
I got was performing O'quinn tonight.
So all of our cochair competition,</v>

883
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:52.530
even here on stage,
we're all going to pair him tickets to the concert tonight.

884
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.970
<v 0>And here you can have the riding car.</v>

885
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.940
<v 3>Really wonderful.
It's really what that actually,
that's set up guys.</v>

886
01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.350
I'm just to explain it a little bit.
Sure.

887
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:10.870
Wico who was in the video with me?
He has the same,
uh,

888
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:15.040
he's tattooed that way.
I read that last night.
Yes.
That's really,

889
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:19.810
he's really tend to that way.
And I asked him,
you know,
when we run the set,

890
01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.680
I said,
why didn't,
why did you get,
it's kind of like a weird,
funny question,

891
01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:27.320
but why did you touch yourself this way?
And he sent the Zuka Gung Ho.

892
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.730
I said,
what do you mean bazooka gum?
And he said,
well,

893
01:01:30.731 --> 01:01:34.060
you know how busy it could come,
comes at the stick on tattoos.
He said,

894
01:01:34.061 --> 01:01:36.550
I really liked them and I loved punk rock when I was a kid.

895
01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:41.080
So I just used to listen to punk rock and put bazooka gum tattoos on.

896
01:01:41.081 --> 01:01:44.140
So they touching my face like this.
So that's why we've,
we've,
uh,

897
01:01:44.141 --> 01:01:49.120
chew bubblegum and the video.
Uh,
but I,
I wanted to tribute winco because,

898
01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.013
um,

899
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:55.300
I believe what this look represented to me was that I will not allow,

900
01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:00.220
um,
society or critics dictate my beauty.

901
01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:04.570
I,
I tell you what I believe is beautiful about me.

902
01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:09.400
Every person defines their own beauty for themselves.
Uh,
so that's what,
uh,

903
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.910
makeup represents to me is that Waco was defining who he is in an artistic way

904
01:02:15.221 --> 01:02:19.000
and not,
um,
relying on society to tell him what makes

905
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.933
<v 11>valuable.</v>

906
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.780
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

907
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.820
<v 2>so you look fabulous.
She's coming to the show.
Yes.</v>

908
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:33.090
They were all coming to the show.
Right?
Right.

909
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.930
They are not the only people who are coming.

910
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:41.020
So we have 40 more on these cards taped to the bottom of seats.

911
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:44.890
So if you look under your seats,
you can get a pair of tickets.
Oh,

912
01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.070
the Gaga concert tonight.

913
01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:56.260
There are instructions on the back as to how did it go.
Cute.

914
01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.440
And just school.
Lauren.
Lauren,
any phone number?
Yeah.

915
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:08.250
And just so no one leaves empty handed.
We actually have special edition.

916
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:13.370
Google goes Gaga tee shirts for everyone here they are in Bengazi in building 43

917
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.700
starting at three o'clock.

918
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.880
So there we're there now so you can stop by there on your way,

919
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:21.180
on your way and leaving.
And I just want to say a big thank you and thank you.

920
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:22.014
In the house of Gacaca,

921
01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:22.903
<v 0>are we good?</v>

922
01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.430
<v 2>Been an unbelievable number of people here at Google who have helped out,</v>

923
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:33.780
but mainly Andrew sholtee who was

924
01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:41.240
on and are some of you don't know this.

925
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.760
My Andrew was an ra at third north where I went to college and he wrote me up

926
01:03:47.211 --> 01:03:48.350
for drinking in my room

927
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.830
and she came to Google anyway,

928
01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:57.610
so we go way back.

929
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

930
01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:03.270
<v 2>I just want to say a huge thank you to you from all of us.
Andrew,
your fans.</v>

931
01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:04.380
Thank you so much for being here today.

932
01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:06.003
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

933
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.390
[inaudible]

934
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.430
this is the manifest

935
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.570
<v 11>of mother monster,</v>

936
01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:54.580
<v 0>a government,</v>

937
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:57.320
<v 11>the alien territory and space.</v>

938
01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:02.830
A birth of magnificent and magical completions took place by the birth was not

939
01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:06.920
finite.
It was infant

940
01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.110
<v 0>as the wombs numbered</v>

941
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:14.100
<v 11>and then my ptosis of the future began.</v>

942
01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:18.790
It was perceived that infamous moment in life,

943
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.740
it's not temple turn on

944
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.670
and thus began the beginning of the new ratings,

945
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.440
a race within the race of humanity,

946
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:34.030
a race which bears no prejudice,
no judgment,

947
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.070
but boundless freedom.

948
01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:42.240
But on that same day as the eternal mother Hubbard in the multiverse,

949
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:47.710
another more terrifying birth took place.
The birth of evil,

950
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.610
and as she herself split into two,

951
01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.990
rotating an agony between two ultimate forces.

952
01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.440
The pendulum of choice began its dance.

953
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:21.930
It seems easy.

954
01:06:21.931 --> 01:06:26.931
You imagine to gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good.

955
01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:37.450
She,
how can I protect some things?

956
01:06:37.451 --> 01:06:38.284
So conflict,

957
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.640
it doesn't matter if you love him or capital h I n

958

959
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.900

960
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.880

963
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:15.503

964

claim.
Don't be a drag queen.
You don't be a Grad.

965
01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.320
Just be acclaimed.

966
01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.210
Rejoice.
It's true.

967
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.533
Cool.

968
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.840
<v 6>Sure.</v>

969
01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.220
