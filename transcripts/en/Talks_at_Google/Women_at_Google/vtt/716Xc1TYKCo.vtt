1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.080
I had the great pleasure of being the founder of girls fights back and women

2
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.340
thinking education company after teaching lag self defense seminars to over 1

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.450
million people worldwide.

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.740
She's the old girls buy back in 2013 and since then she's been working as a

5
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:22.540
speaker,

6
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.290
an author and a communication strategist who helps people seek their purpose.
And

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.570
this fall,

8
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.230
last fall she spoke at Tedx Boulder was actually how our women act committee

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.160
found air and we were scouring the tonic folder site and all the different

10
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.310
videos and uh,
we were all blown away by your were really,

11
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:44.920
really fade out in the room today or she's going to talk to us today are why

12
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:48.400
once you talked to Todd,
I folder about how to connect with one another,
right?

13
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:52.220
Communicating authentically and that is one of the primary things we brought her

14
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:53.590
in her today.
She's about to do that.

15
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.110
I can kind of help us speak more authentically with that,

16
00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:58.240
please help me welcome [inaudible].

17
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.510
<v 0>Hello everyone.
I'm so happy to be here.
Are we projecting?
Is this good?</v>

18
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.960
Okay.
All right.
You could magically make it happen.
We're Google,
right?
No,

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.310
this is not what you do here.
He magically make things happen.
But,
um,

20
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.260
my name is Aaron.
Wait,

21
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:20.650
I'm really excited to be here on International Women's Day is a big day,

22
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:22.030
a big deal for all of us.

23
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.620
I've spent a good amount of my career working in the women's and industry realm,

24
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:30.640
if you want to call it.
And it's a,
a place that I feel very at home at.

25
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:34.360
But I also feel like it's really inspired though.
I saw a few men in the room.

26
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.970
I think that's really important.

27
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.560
We gotta be super inclusive and this is so much bigger than women were.

28
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.270
Only half of the world.
There's another half.

29
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:41.980
And we got to bring the whole thing in.

30
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.240
And one of the things we're going to talk about today is how to seek our purpose

31
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.500
and speak our truth.

32
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.240
And one of the reasons that I feel so passionately about this topic is it's

33
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:53.560
because of women's issues.

34
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.690
If we don't know what's real inside of us and if we don't know how to show up

35
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.190
and communicate in a strong,

36
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:04.300
powerful and clear way that doesn't alienate and terrify people,
then we,

37
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.220
how can we ever expect to make progress?

38
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.630
So that's one of the reasons that I am here today is to share with you a tool

39
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.820
because I don't want to stand up here and talk and keynote the whole time.

40
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.870
I want to just give you a little bit of background and explain some concepts.

41
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:20.890
But then we're going to do an exercise where you all are going to learn how to

42
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.350
show up more authentically in your conversations.

43
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.010
This is beneficial when it comes to your personal life,
obviously,

44
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.760
but even in business as well.
So I'm going to show that to you today.

45
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:34.650
But first I wanted to give you a little background on things.
Um,

46
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.110
I actually wanted to kick off by sharing with you this really weird dream I had

47
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.370
recently.
We all have weird dreams.
I don't know if mine are weirder,

48
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.190
but I have this weird dream.
It was just a few weeks ago.

49
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.480
I feel the need to share it with you because it felt like one of those dreams,

50
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.720
it's so simple and so clear.
Yet you wake up in the morning,
you're like,

51
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:55.720
what was that?
And then later on you're like,
Duh.

52
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.420
It was like almost so spelled out that I couldn't get my head around it.

53
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.313
So here's the dream.

54
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
So I'm in this room and it's like a full white room and I am a glowing egg,

55
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.510
like a little ball.
That's all I am,
right?
And I look around in this,

56
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:14.230
out in the rest of this white room and there's a bunch of glowing eggs and

57
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.360
that's all we are.
And,

58
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.720
but I can tell even by looking at all these like little glowing marble looking

59
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.120
things,
we're all different now.

60
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:27.121
The only exit point from this weird white room is this amazing slide that you

61
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:33.670
would find at like a McDonald land sorta deal.
He's like crazy colors.
Woo.

62
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.900
You know,
like there's like a real party feel to it.
And so one by one,

63
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.160
each of these glowing little orbs would go up to the entry of the slide and
they,

64
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:47.710
a word would be thrown at them like freedom or abundance or love.

65
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.520
And they'd be like,
okay,
got it.
And they'd go,

66
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.600
<v 1>they'd go</v>

67
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.230
<v 0>down,
down,
down,
down,
and this went on forever.</v>

68
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.830
And finally it was my turn and I got the word authentic and I was like,
wow.

69
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.890
<v 1>Now the way that I remember</v>

70
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.110
<v 0>thinking,
wow,</v>

71
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.060
this is going to be intense because to show up authentically can be a challenge.

72
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.640
And what I later learned about this dream was that all of us,

73
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:13.620
these little glowing orbs,

74
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.510
like maybe this is some weird explanation of what life is,

75
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.070
is that we come into these bodies and we get this one shot to show up in a

76
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:24.490
particular way,
to learn something,
to teach something to be a certain way.

77
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.870
And maybe it's as simple as just one word.
So mine being authentic.

78
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.370
I'm here today to talk to you just about that and I wanted to kick it off with a

79
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:37.600
quote and forgive me in advance if I trip.
It's probably a 100% likelihood.

80
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.610
Um,
uh,
no ballerina.

81
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.950
But I wanted to kick off with a quote from Carl Jung famous psychologist.

82
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.300
He said,
the privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.

83
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.830
The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.

84
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.420
It really is a privilege.
And on this international women's Day,

85
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:02.200
I just want to take a quick moment to honor the fact that we have the privilege

86
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.380
to do the kind of introspection to show up authentically.

87
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.570
Because when you're in a war zone,

88
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.700
when you're wondering how you're going to feed your kids,

89
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.120
when you're living in extreme poverty or tear,

90
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.190
or even if you're in our world,
our paradigm,
and you're afraid to go to work,

91
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.930
or you're afraid to come home from work,

92
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.931
if there's something in your life that's not giving you the privilege to show up

93
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.390
authentically,
then how can you possibly expect to,

94
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.350
so we do have great privilege living in this time and in this place.

95
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.000
One of the things that I've noticed about Western women is that sometimes that

96
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.000
comes a little shame with that or guilt of like,
Ugh,

97
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.510
how could I even be upset about that meeting that just went horribly when I know

98
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.870
that someone's getting bombed halfway across the world?
Right?

99
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.240
I think it's our responsibility though.

100
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.720
It's our spill responsibility to own that privilege into rocket.

101
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.520
Because what I've learned about authenticity and when we show up,

102
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.690
it's like a ripple that creates this energetic force field around the world to

103
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:05.090
help other people show up for real as well.

104
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.800
So today let's do the work for the women who can't do the work themselves and

105
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.700
let's really affect the world by creating that ripple so that other people can

106
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.990
show up that way too.

107
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.740
So the privilege of a lifetime is to become who we truly are.

108
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.170
And we'll come back to that.
But I wanted to

109
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.680
give you a little background about me and how I got to this point.
Um,

110
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.360
I believe in connection.

111
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.530
I believe in connection of ourselves and ideas to other people.
And we,

112
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.720
when we can make those connections,
that's when we truly change the world.

113
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.820
A woman named Susan Pinker,
Data Tedx talk and her talk,

114
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:47.960
she's a psychologist.

115
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.290
Her talk was all about how connection is one of the number one things that can

116
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.920
lengthen our life.

117
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.660
Like if you want to know how to live to over a hundred it comes down to the

118
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:02.690
connections.
Now you might think,
oh,
it's about diet,
it's about exercise.

119
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.880
It's actually not.
Those are pretty low on the list.

120
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.350
The top two are social integration and close relationships.

121
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.140
And she did a whole Ted talk on this and it was amazing.

122
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.110
But I believe that it's even more than that.

123
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.030
It's not just having a close relationship,

124
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.020
it's having an authentic close relationship.
So how do we show up in that way?

125
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.270
So I learned how to do this back in 2001 I had just graduated from college.

126
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.650
I grew up in Chicago,

127
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.130
went to Eastern Illinois University and all I could think about being in that

128
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:35.000
little farm town was getting the heck out of there and move into the big apple.

129
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.760
So I moved to New York City,
no money in my pocket,
no job.
The whole deal.
The,

130
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.570
that makes,
it comes about this all the time,
right?

131
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.860
The girl from a farm town who goes to the big city that was made.

132
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.510
So I moved to New York and all I wanted to do was get a job in television

133
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:55.070
production.
I've always been a storyteller.
I was a speech communications major.

134
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.140
No one actually gives speeches for a living that do that.
Managers are so funny.

135
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.490
I already,
but um,

136
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.150
but I really wanted to tell stories and Hawaiian to tell real stories.

137
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.330
So I wanted to work in documentary production.

138
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:12.770
So I moved out there and for a year I was working on all sorts of documentaries

139
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:17.450
for history channel,
MSNBC,
really riveting stuff.

140
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.500
Now also the other side,
if anybody's ever worked in production,

141
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.910
it's not a very well paid field.
And so a lot of people have side hustles.

142
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.480
So one of my side hustles was working as an extra in reality television.

143
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.810
Just let that sink in for a minute.

144
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.480
Working as an extra of reality television being paid to make reality TV.

145
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.350
See more real and uh,

146
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.650
that was an interesting petri dish of,

147
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.670
of what is real and what is now real.
And what I learned is that there,

148
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:55.680
there was a lot of inauthenticity in our world.
I was kind of shocked the time,

149
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.270
it just how much there was.

150
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.540
But I remember through that experience thinking to myself,

151
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.770
we have got to show up more real and it's a choice.
How real do you want to be?

152
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.010
And we have that choice every single day.

153
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.480
So I bought back and forth between making documentaries during the daytime and

154
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.260
working as like,
this is okay,
let me just tell you exactly what I do.

155
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.450
So I worked with a show called eliminate.
It is as classy as it sounds,

156
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.550
if you haven't seen the late night reruns on Bravo.
So eliminate it's one person,

157
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.880
they go on a date with four people of the opposite sex and throughout the night

158
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:33.330
you get all these four people get eliminated until there's one person left and

159
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:36.630
then you like right off into the sunset together.
And usually in the midst of it,

160
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:40.560
there's fighting,
there's drunk in this,
there's belligerence.
It's,
it's insane.

161
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.203
Anyway,

162
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.250
it taught me a lot about that question of like how real do you want to be by

163
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:51.180
simply observing people who are showing up as so in authentic.

164
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.320
But the thing is about New York,
I had such a great time,
whether it was making,

165
00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.420
making movies or making crappy TV,
I was just having a blast in this experience.

166
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.380
So I was doing that for about a year when I got a phone call that one of my best

167
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:10.380
friends from back when I went to college at Eastern Illinois University named

168
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:14.070
Shannon Mcnamara had been murdered while fighting off an attacker in her

169
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:14.904
apartment.

170
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.200
This was one of those game changing moments were kind of reminds me almost of

171
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:22.950
the matrix.
You know,

172
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:28.010
when neos given the choice between the two pills and he has the choice to like

173
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.300
go to the real world,

174
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:35.330
which is kind of darker and gritty and intense and scary and uncertain or live

175
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:36.744
in the program,

176
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.140
which is light and orderly and very sensical and predictable and safe.

177
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.370
And in that moment of getting the news that Shannon had been killed,
I was like,

178
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:51.930
wow.
Like,
there's this whole underbelly of the world.
And I mean,

179
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.060
I'm almost embarrassed they'd like to that point in my life,

180
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.530
I really hadn't gone through anything bad.

181
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.550
I really was one of those people that had had kind of a sheltered existence.

182
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.920
And so I remember getting that news and just the whole world's shifting and

183
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:06.270
seeing it in a different perspective.

184
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.600
And I went home for the wake and the funeral.
Well,

185
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:14.601
that first night I decided to have a campfire in my parent's backyard and pull

186
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:18.390
together all of our friends because when something really bad happens,

187
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.980
I feel one of the most healing things we can do is share our perspective on what

188
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.040
did happen to speak up,
to speak our truth.

189
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.110
And so I have this bonfire and most of the people in attendance that night were

190
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.210
me and Shannon's sorority sisters.
Um,
and so we're sitting around,
we're all,

191
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.200
you know,
and the ages of,
let's say like 19 to 22 for the most part.

192
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.290
And for the first few hours we're talking about Shannon,

193
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.190
we're talking about who could have done this because at that point the guy who

194
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.540
murdered her had not been caught.

195
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.750
So it was just a super intense time around that.

196
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.370
But I noticed the evening progressed,

197
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.200
we stopped talking specifically about Shannon and we started talking about our

198
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:04.201
own experiences as women in regards to safety and fear and I started hearing

199
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:10.210
some of my best friends in the world.
Educated,
strong,
smart,

200
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.890
bold,
beautiful women.
Say things like,
you know what?
After,

201
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.150
after what happened to Shannon,

202
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.650
I don't want to take that internship at the hospital downtown Chicago cause it

203
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:25.210
just probably isn't safe to be walking to my car at night
or after.

204
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.570
What has happened to Shannon?
I've learned that you know this guy I'm dating,

205
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:31.990
we've been talking about moving in together and I was thinking about breaking up

206
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:33.190
with them.
I don't think he's my guy,

207
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.540
but I might as well just move in with him because it's probably safer to not

208
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:41.290
sleep alone at night.
Then another friend saying,

209
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:44.680
I have this whole trip planned to backpack Europe Solo,

210
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.320
and all of a sudden after this is occurred,

211
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.800
it just feels like a really radically unsafe thing to do.

212
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.220
This went on for hours,
hours of us,
strong,
empowered,

213
00:12:57.221 --> 00:13:00.790
bold,
educated women talking about all the things we weren't going to do because

214
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.410
fundamentally we were afraid.

215
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.050
And I remember just listening that whole night and really taking it all in and

216
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:10.690
realizing the injustice,
not just the violence,

217
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.890
but of the fact that we were able to be who we truly are because fundamentally

218
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:18.670
we were afraid to be.
And that seems like the bigger,

219
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.850
the bigger injustice and the two things in that moment,

220
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.880
because I thought to myself,
what would Shannon be upset about?

221
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.490
She'd be pissed about that she'd be upset,

222
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:30.730
that we weren't taking the trips and we weren't being with the right people and

223
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:32.950
we weren't taking the jobs that we're going to fill us up.

224
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.780
That's what she'd be upset about.

225
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.650
And so that was the first time that I started to realize the power of speaking

226
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.380
truth,
especially in a healing situation like that.
Well,

227
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:46.381
the next day was the wake and it's one of these wakes when someone young dies.

228
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.620
I mean there's just huge,
right?
Just hundreds of people.

229
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.970
She was a very loved person and at all American athlete,
very popular woman.

230
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.880
And so we're waiting for hours to get to the front of the way can into pair

231
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.260
respects and to meet her family.

232
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.820
And so in these hours I had a lot of time to think about what it occurred.

233
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.140
And by the time we got to the front,
I had been thinking about,
well,

234
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:13.090
what are you going to say in those situations?

235
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:15.610
Like how do you speak your truth when it,

236
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.120
it's almost like the unspeakable has happened.
How does that work?

237
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.650
And so it had to kind of surrender at that moment when we got up to the front to

238
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:24.470
just be like,
all right,
well,

239
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.620
whatever's going to come out is going to come out and I'm just going to have to

240
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:28.330
be a piece of that,
but I'm just going to have to be real.

241
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.390
And the awfulness of this.
Well,
before I met her family,

242
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.470
I kneel in front of her casket and I just remember thinking,

243
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.060
this feels so unsolvable.
This feels so permanent and unfixable.

244
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.400
But then I also had a moment where I was like,

245
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.230
I don't think people who have passed in the way that she did would want us to

246
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:51.040
stay paralyzed in that.
I think that we don't have to put a,

247
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.770
at the end of those kinds of stories,
when those injustices happen,

248
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.630
but we need to put a comma and we need to keep speaking for them cause they

249
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.920
can't speak for themselves.
And so I get up and I meet her family.

250
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:01.821
Now,

251
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:04.280
you know when you go to college and you have these like super tight friends that

252
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:05.390
are,
they're like your family,

253
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:08.480
but you never know where they came from because you're not hanging out with

254
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:12.530
their family.
They're far away.
So I'd never met her,
her mom,
Cindy,

255
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:15.380
but I had always heard so much about her and she apparently had heard so much

256
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.650
about me because I introduced her.
I'm like,
hi,
I'm Aaron Weed.

257
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:22.730
I'm so sorry about what's happened.
And she just like cuts me off.
She was like,

258
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.350
Oh,
you're a week.
He's like,
hey man,
we got to last name.
Like we,

259
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.430
you gotta like just own that,
you know?
So in college I was weed,

260
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.440
by the way,
I'm totally running for governor someday,
governor of Colorado.

261
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:37.274
I'm come on,

262
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.710
get all the trustafarians I'm Pearl Street to be my campaign managers will be

263
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:47.570
awesome,
you know?
So,
uh,
so Cindy was like,
oh my God.
I was like,

264
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.310
oh yeah,
this is kind of weird.
Okay,

265
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.290
we're just having this moment and we're laughing and um,
and she goes,

266
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.110
she's squeezed my hand.
We had this instant connection.
She said,
me,

267
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:59.960
you know what we,
it's so crazy.

268
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.510
But even after the worst thing that has happened,
the losing a child,
I don't,

269
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.670
I don't know that there's too many more worse things that can happen in a human

270
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:12.020
existence.
She said,
you know what?
There's something worse.
And I was like,

271
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.020
what could possibly be worse than what has occurred?
Like this moment will,

272
00:16:16.021 --> 00:16:18.470
it could possibly be worse.
She's like,

273
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.850
what's worse is that I'm so afraid that the world is going to forget about her.

274
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.930
I'm so afraid that everyone's gonna forget her name.

275
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.640
And I remember in that moment just being like,
wow,

276
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.240
just the moment of of that sinking in of that,

277
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.780
how we can have levels of fear and how her bigger fear in that moment was just

278
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.630
the forgetting of people not hearing about her anymore.

279
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.720
And I think a lot of us have had that fear maybe for ourselves.

280
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:50.870
If you've ever been faced with your own mortality or the mortality of a loved

281
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:53.000
one,
what do people forget?

282
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.790
And remember in that moment as a 22 year old woman just being like,

283
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:57.590
you know what?
That is one thing I know how to do,

284
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.710
cause I had a big mouth and I can make sure I can't solve violence.

285
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:01.790
I can't end murder,

286
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.920
but I know how to talk and I can get other people to talk and speak their truth.

287
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.930
And so I kind of walked away from that,

288
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:13.370
realizing the power of speaking truth transcends death.

289
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.400
It transcends tragedy and all of those different things.

290
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.470
What I ended up doing with the help of many,
many people,
a great community.

291
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.510
It's starting a company called girls fight back.

292
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.810
What we did was women's safety and self defense seminars.

293
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.190
We mostly went into high schools and colleges all across the world in addition

294
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:32.001
to the United States.

295
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:37.001
We also expanded into India and Pakistan and we localized the content so that it

296
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:40.580
was specific to their culture and to the safety risks that they faced.

297
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.440
And in addition to all that,

298
00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:46.910
we were doing the radio shows and the TV shows and I read a book and a magazine

299
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:48.920
column for Cosmo girl and it was amazing.

300
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.430
It was just such an incredible program,
but it's some points.

301
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.610
There came this,
this point about 12 years in,

302
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.100
in that period of time I'd had two children.

303
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.370
A lot of things had shifted and there came this point where I realized it was no

304
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:09.540
longer my story to tell.
It felt like it was almost this old story.

305
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.460
Not like it wasn't significant,

306
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:14.700
but almost like I had crossed the bridge from pain to peace.

307
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.840
And I noticed that a lot of times in the victim world,

308
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.080
it doesn't matter what one is a victim of,

309
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.570
sometimes people can get stuck in the story.

310
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.460
And that prevents us from being in our truth.

311
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.710
And I started to give myself permission to let that story not need to be the

312
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:36.711
center of my being anymore and to just let it go and to let it dissipate.

313
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.270
And so as I started doing that,

314
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:42.810
it was very kind of painful because sometimes we can be identified by our

315
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:47.640
stories.
It's almost like this,
this egoic attachment that we have.
Well,

316
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:48.150
I'm,

317
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.140
I'm a woman that NBC calls when something bad happens and I'm there to be able

318
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:55.500
to show up and offer safety strategies and that's who I am

319
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.863
or is it?

320
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.070
And so it started to kind of slip away in the identity started to slip away.

321
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.910
And so I ended up selling the company because I knew that it was time for

322
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:08.760
someone else to tell that story and their version of it.

323
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.150
And I had a bit of a identity crisis because at that moment I'm like,

324
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.680
well who am I now?
You know,
if I'm not the ass kicking girl.
Um,
cause by the way,

325
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:19.940
I'm like one of the most highly trained women in the world and ask kicking.

326
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.100
I'm really fun at parties,
like just um,

327
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.140
really handy skill that you can do nothing with.
Right.

328
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.940
So,
uh,
so I found myself in a little bit of a crisis of sorts.

329
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:38.220
I wasn't Midlife,
but uh,
definitely a crisis.

330
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.850
I started thinking about what I'd learned about seeking purpose and speaking

331
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:45.390
truth and how can I show up in a new way and to both of those things.

332
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.310
I started working for Ted and Tedx and Tedx Boulder,

333
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.980
started coaching for them,
Develop Their Speaker coaching program,

334
00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.120
also Ted x mile high.

335
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.470
And I was just so excited about this idea of really distilling down our truth

336
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.490
and to like the 10 to 18 minutes turning it into a story that can really

337
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:05.070
captivate and then affecting audiences by it.

338
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.220
I started doing the speaker coaching thing,

339
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:12.330
but I realized that there's so much more to it when you get somebody that's like

340
00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:16.560
a ted speaker and they're brilliant and they've got these amazing ideas and

341
00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:20.760
they've done these epic things and they come in.
I was thinking to myself,

342
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:22.260
I don't want to just make them shiny.

343
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.000
I want them to seek their truth and share that with the masses because that's

344
00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:30.420
going to be so much more powerful.
So I came up with this thing called the dig,

345
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.580
which I'm going to share with you today.
Uh,

346
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:37.020
at least a little snippet of it because these people needed to understand their

347
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:40.170
purpose and their why and their drive behind it if they were going to really be

348
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:42.720
able to show up and communicate authentically.

349
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.760
But I feel like speaking truth not only affects us in the personal,

350
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:50.050
but also in the business world.

351
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.270
Shortly after I sold girl sway back and started working for Ted,

352
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.510
there was also kind of a personal churning and it was happening.

353
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.880
I was starting to realize that the marriage I was in was not a good marriage.

354
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.740
It was,
he's not a bad person,

355
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:10.741
but it was really built on some pretty inauthentic foundations and this was

356
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:14.350
rough because not only had I lost my girls fight back identity at that point,

357
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.670
my other identity was being a married mom of two kids and I started getting

358
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:23.320
really shaken at the idea of like I don't think I'm supposed to be here anymore.

359
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.390
I don't come from a family of divorce.

360
00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:28.990
I actually used to hold a lot of judgment around it and I remember being in that

361
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:31.570
moment and be like,
Oh man,
this is going to be so bad,

362
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.160
but this is what I have to do to be real is to leave this mirrors.

363
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.100
It was not healthy you probably for either one of us,
so it was very painful.

364
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.670
But I started to go through the process of moving.

365
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.330
Now when I put my house on the market,

366
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.050
at the time we had been living in Broomfield and put my house in the market and

367
00:21:50.051 --> 00:21:51.190
like how do you find a realtor?

368
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.420
Well apparently I find it by like the grocery carts,
you know those realtors?

369
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.080
Like what a bizarre place to like put an ad like where your,

370
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.790
where your baby's butts.
It's like all day I whatever.

371
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.120
It worked for me apparently.
So this guy looked friendly so I was like,
Hey,

372
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:07.570
I'll call him.
So I called him,
I think his name was John,
I forget,

373
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.650
but he comes over and it's like him and his wife and they're like this dynamic

374
00:22:11.651 --> 00:22:14.440
duo and they got their whole system down and they're like,
okay,

375
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.890
what do you want to sell the house for and how many bedrooms is a head and

376
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.720
doesn't have a basement?
Is it finished and what's the garage like?

377
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:23.350
And so they were,
they were like had locked down.
It was tight.

378
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:24.610
Like from a business perspective,

379
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:29.611
how they showed up was like completely solid but never once did they ask why I

380
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:34.810
was selling my house.
They had no idea what was going on personally.

381
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.970
They were so in their heads about the facts of what was occurring and how they

382
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:43.420
could help me in that sense that they weren't really looking at the bigger

383
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:46.150
experience of what does it mean to let go of your home.

384
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.280
And that was okay because their jobs is so my house,
right.
Well,

385
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:55.450
they did a good job within one day my house was sold and it was sold to someone

386
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:59.290
with a cash offer.
Now a few weeks after that happened,

387
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.220
everything was just like done.
I'm moving to Boulder,
I'm moving forward.

388
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.550
Somebody asked me,
hey,
what's the name of your realtor?

389
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.900
Cause I want to sell my house.

390
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:10.960
And you sold quick and everything for the life from you guys.

391
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.940
I could not remember.
I could not remember these people's names and I still get,

392
00:23:14.941 --> 00:23:16.750
I still don't know what I mean.
I called the Dude John,

393
00:23:16.751 --> 00:23:21.010
because that's like statistically a good likelihood.
But I mean,

394
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.970
I didn't know.

395
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:26.971
And I think the reason is because there was no connection beyond just the facts

396
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:32.080
and what was coming going on in the head.
Now on the flip side,

397
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.250
as I was starting to move,
I was looking for movers.

398
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.530
There were no ads on grocery carts for that.

399
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.950
So I had to do a little more digging,
a little more yelping.

400
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.460
I found this random company and hired him and this duo of dudes were amazing and

401
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:50.631
one specifically,

402
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:55.631
his name was Frederick and he was this super charismatic guy who loved his job,

403
00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.430
used to work in tech.
And I remember asking him like,
Hey Frederick,
you know,

404
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:05.090
to kind of doing the whole business professional meeting someone thing and you

405
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:07.170
know,
how do you do what you do and how'd you get here?
He's like,

406
00:24:07.171 --> 00:24:11.300
he used to work in tech but I wanted to be a mover.
I wanted to haul stuff.

407
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.440
And he's like,
no,
I don't want to haul stuff.
I want to move people.
And I'm like,

408
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.830
Oh this is exciting,
you know?

409
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.200
And he probably read the look on my face and being like,
why?
And he's like,
yeah,

410
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:29.180
we're going to move you,
but I'm going to move here.
I'm like,

411
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.870
okay.
Like I said,

412
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.230
like feel the need to know cause I was like,

413
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.270
do you feel in me?
You know what I'm talking about,
I'm going to move you.

414
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:42.140
And I was like,
not really.
He's like,
he's like,
why are you selling your house?

415
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.770
And I was like,
I'm selling my house cause I'm getting divorced.

416
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.850
Why are you getting forced?
Wow.
Going there.

417
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.480
And in that moment though,
I was like,
wow,
that's so appropriate.

418
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.910
That is so appropriate.
Because he was being real and curious.

419
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:59.570
There was no judgment in that question.
He was just legitimately curious like,

420
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.840
oh you're,
you're moving cause you're getting divorced.
Why,
what happened?

421
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.690
So you know,
I actually told him a few sayings,
whatever.
And he's like,

422
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:12.650
all right,
all right,
it's time to move you forward.
This is not a house.

423
00:25:12.651 --> 00:25:14.420
This is your life.
And we're moving,
you know,

424
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:18.590
like he was giving me like this sermon in my kitchen and um,

425
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.100
and I started realizing,
oh my gosh,
this is a mover.

426
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:27.130
His only job is to move my stuff and get his why he's authentic meaning for what

427
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:33.110
he does is that he wants to move people.

428
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.070
He wants to just like take them from this phase and get them into the next phase

429
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:37.904
of their life.

430
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.900
He was able to see that this wasn't about a moving truck and strong muscles.

431
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:45.080
This was about helping people make hard transitions.

432
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.620
And because he did that two weeks later when somebody asks me for a

433
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:51.380
recommendation on a mover,
I'm like,
oh my God,
you had to call Frederick.

434
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:54.260
Here's his cell phone number.
He just texted the other day.

435
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.730
So I feel like we can learn a lot in business in addition to our personal lives,

436
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.900
if we're willing to show up more than just in our head and our thoughts and just

437
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:13.250
the transactions we're actually able to get with each other and connect on the

438
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:16.790
heart level and the core level of like,
what do you want?

439
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.690
How can we get you where you want to go?
We can feel that.

440
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.870
And so that's what I want to share with you guys say and actually give you the

441
00:26:23.871 --> 00:26:25.730
experience of how to do that.

442
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.800
And where we're going to do that is this exercise as a part of the dig.

443
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.090
I call it head hardcore.

444
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.920
And the difference between a mysterious John,

445
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:39.740
the realtor and awesome Fredericton mover,

446
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.250
was that Frederick showed up from all three places.

447
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.690
He was willing to connect with me on the facts.

448
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.030
He was willing to connect with me on the feelings.

449
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.550
And he was willing to connect with me on the desires

450
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.740
and he was willing to hold all of it and I think we can all show up in this way.

451
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.720
This is how we be authentic is communicating the facts.

452
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.500
Yes and the feelings.
Yes and the desires.
Yes,

453
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.770
but we do it not just from a place of transparency but from authenticity.

454
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.180
Now I gave a Tedx boulder talk just this past fall and it was on that topic.

455
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.110
What's the difference between being transparent and being authentic?

456
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.000
My opinion is that it's showing up in all three of these from the head,

457
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:24.840
the heart and the core.

458
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.560
Have you ever met somebody who is just one of these people that just spouts off

459
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:32.670
anything in a moment and they're like super proud of how authentic they are even

460
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:34.620
when they're hurting people and like making people cry?

461
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.260
I actually don't think that's authentic.

462
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.160
That's wounded transparency and those are totally different things.

463
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:43.950
Just because you have no filter doesn't make you a real person.

464
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.360
It makes you a wounded person who's not doing the work to find out what's really

465
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:48.990
true.

466
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:53.580
Because the reality about authenticity is that if we go and communicate about

467
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:55.860
what we feel about something from the head,
the heart and the core,

468
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.890
it usually ends in a very soft place.

469
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.630
It doesn't usually end in like poison as vitriol.
Okay.

470
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.860
Our truth,
I believe for most people is a kind truth.

471
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.300
It is a peaceful truth.
It is one who wants best for self but best for others.

472
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.500
So today what I want to do is take you through the head hardcore exercise.

473
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.920
This is something that I developed as I started working with these Ted people

474
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:22.920
from all over the world who are trying to show up like the realtor.

475
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.350
But really they had to show up like the mover.

476
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.250
They were trying to show up and just talk about their new scientific innovation

477
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.050
and they just wanted to stay here with the needed to drop down here.

478
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:36.210
But what they felt about it and what they believe for it,

479
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.500
what they desired for it.

480
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.800
And that is what really started my new company because that was the thing that

481
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:43.824
was working.

482
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.740
So people fly over all over the world to work with me on their ted talks.

483
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:50.010
But what they're really getting is a better self understanding about what their

484
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:52.860
truth is and permission to actually share that with people.
And guess what?

485
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:53.820
On the other side of that,

486
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.380
people are so excited because now you have given them permission to show up in

487
00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:01.440
that way too.
And that's the ripple I'm talking about.

488
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.870
So let's talk about the head,
the heart and the core.
Um,

489
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.740
the head is feeling,
or I'm sorry,
the head,
his thoughts.

490
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.700
It is things that we think it is things that are undisputably true.

491
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.080
Things like your age.
If you have a dog where you're from,

492
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.130
where you went to college,
these are our head facts.

493
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:25.110
They are things that are indisputable.

494
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.360
The next part is the heart.
These are feelings.

495
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.910
This is what's true for you emotionally in that moment.

496
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.030
The thing about being in the heart is that it's changing constantly.

497
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.200
What's true for you emotionally 10 minutes ago could be true for,

498
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.940
could be totally different than what's true for you 10 minutes from now.

499
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.200
So part of the trick about being in the heart and why so much of our culture

500
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:51.610
doesn't stay here or go here even is because it requires presence.

501
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.010
It requires us to actually stop

502
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.540
and breathe and feel for a second to even know what's happening there.

503
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.630
So we have a lot of unconsciousness happening in our culture because we're just

504
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:07.780
not dialed into that.
And then finally the core is I desire,

505
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.950
it's what we want now,
especially women.

506
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.940
We're kind of trained to to keep that under wraps a bit like no one wants to

507
00:30:15.941 --> 00:30:17.210
hear a woman walking around and tell them,

508
00:30:17.211 --> 00:30:19.900
I want you to talk about what you desire is what she wants in the world.

509
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:23.710
She sounds demanding.
Well guess what?
When we do this part of the exercise,

510
00:30:23.711 --> 00:30:26.410
but you're probably going to notice in the room is when you get a room full of

511
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:28.960
people who are showing up and talking about what they want.

512
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.770
There's this energy of like,
yeah,
yeah.
You know,

513
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:36.190
like because what you want is probably very similar to what other people want

514
00:30:36.191 --> 00:30:39.790
and like can we all please just give each other permission to save what we want?

515
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.640
It's,
it's so freeing for everyone.
And even if in relationships,

516
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:46.474
even,

517
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.690
have you ever been in a relationship with somebody where they're like mad at you

518
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.510
and you can't figure out why and they won't tell you what they want,

519
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:53.770
but you're trying to figure it out.

520
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.940
I mean like that is a losing battle for everyone.
But if they just say it,

521
00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.400
even if it means the relationship is over,

522
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:03.700
it's such a thief because you're finally in the truth of it.

523
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.590
So what I'd love to do is just not just explain this,

524
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.490
but actually give you guys an experience of what does it mean to be in the head,

525
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:14.410
heart and core.
And like I said,

526
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:16.780
I developed this for Ted speakers because this is,

527
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.020
this is the ingredient for any of any of you who do public speaking.

528
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.040
This is how you speak.
You find the balance of,

529
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.920
I think I feel,
and I want,

530
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.700
if you can find a balance of those three things and for every speech is

531
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:32.740
different depending on the intention of the outcome.

532
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.930
But if you can find that balance,

533
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.320
that's how people are going to get the most full authentic expression of you.

534
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.560
And on the other side of that is where the connection occurs.

535
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.640
So it happens in one to one situations,
one to some settings.

536
00:31:45.641 --> 00:31:47.560
If you're leading a team or one to many,

537
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:51.130
like giving a talk or even giving a Webinar.
So head,
heart core,

538
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.300
it's like a recipe.

539
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.540
So I was wondering if I could get maybe three brave volunteers to come up here

540
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.360
and help me out with an exercise.

541
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.560
It's going to require speaking from the head,
heart,
and core.

542
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:09.901
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

543
00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:14.901
get rid of [inaudible].

544
00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:19.090
All right.
Okay.

545
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.390
[inaudible] 50 guys over here.

546
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.840
<v 0>Okay,
so first of all,</v>

547
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:31.900
thank you guys so much for showing up for this.

548
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.760
It can be kind of a brave and scary thing to intentionally speak your truth.

549
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:40.460
And what I want to do before we begin is almost put a little bubble around this

550
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:44.000
room,
you know,
for all of you up there,
for all of you down here,

551
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:45.440
for all of us on stage,

552
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.650
I'm just kind of imagine we have a bubble of safety for a moment.

553
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.000
I know even before I came onstage,

554
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.290
your first session was some people were sharing some really amazing powerful

555
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:55.540
stories.
And so let's,

556
00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:59.240
let's kind of like reclaimed that energy of safety because we got to have safety

557
00:32:59.241 --> 00:33:02.210
to show up and speak our truth.
So

558
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.000
this exercise,

559
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.570
what we're going to do is we're going to simply introduce ourselves.

560
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.580
So I'm going to model it.

561
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:15.420
Then our three friends up here are each going to do there,
um,

562
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.550
custom piece of what I've modeled and introduced themselves.

563
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.270
And then we're going to have you guys pair up and you guys were wanting to do

564
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:28.260
this with a partner.
So I want you to experience it as well as learning.

565
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:33.260
So what we're going to do basically is introduce ourselves three times first

566
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:37.130
from the head,
then from the heart,
then from the core.

567
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.960
Now you might be thinking,
well that's a bit repetitive and it's actually not.

568
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.740
Because introducing ourselves from these three places is a totally different

569
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:46.574
experience.

570
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.560
And what I'd like for you to notice as we're doing this exercise is how it is in

571
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:53.540
your body and what comes out of your mouth.

572
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.460
There's only one rule in all this outside of just confidentiality and safety.

573
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.660
Can we all agree to that?
Okay,
so outside of that,

574
00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:07.520
the only rule is that you can't rehearse while other people are talking.

575
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.160
And people always laugh at that because it's true because that's what we're all

576
00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:15.950
doing.
Even the most present

577
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.310
amazing person,
we're all rehearsing.
Some of us are better at it than others,

578
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.450
so it's just less office.
But we're all doing it all the time.

579
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.860
Now let's think about it for a moment.

580
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:32.861
What are the repercussions of the whole world where everyone is rehearsing what

581
00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:36.290
other people are talking?
We're not listening,

582
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.420
but even worse on the other side of that,

583
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:43.280
we're not connecting that thing that's like a survival deal that can actually

584
00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:46.100
increase our lifespan.
We're not getting that.

585
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.630
And we have a very lonely separate world right now despite being how connected

586
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:54.650
we are.
So we need to start with being present.

587
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.390
And in order to do that,

588
00:34:56.391 --> 00:35:00.110
we need to trust that if we show up presently from the head harder core,

589
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:05.410
whatever's going to come out is perfect and it's probably going to be 10 times

590
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:10.190
better than what you rehearsed.
And I've seen this firsthand.
Okay.

591
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:16.000
So while we're all not rehearsing,
um,

592
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.560
I'm going to kick this off now.

593
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.290
Can I have a timer as someone good with the phone and,
okay,
cool.
Jess.

594
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.970
Sometimes I try to do it and I screw up the whole thing.
All right.

595
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.600
I get like so into it and then okay,
can you do like 60 seconds?

596
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.000
So there is a time component.

597
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.630
The reason is I'm a hyper distiller.

598
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.600
I don't think we need a ton of time and space to do some of the things we think

599
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:42.600
that we need.
Things like getting to your truth.
People like Whoa,

600
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:46.820
that sounds heavy and long.
Not really want to know how I know this.

601
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.120
Cause I have a five year old.
She gets to our truth really fast right now.

602
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:54.300
She's in a phase where she's not wearing shoes.
Everybody knows about it.

603
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.670
It's very clear.
I'm not going to ask you today mom.
Okay.
All right.

604
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.860
She's very clear that speaking from the core,
I will not wear shoes,

605
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.050
but it doesn't take a long time to get to your truth.
Well,

606
00:36:04.051 --> 00:36:06.780
it does take a long time just to filter out all of this stuff.

607
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:10.380
Do we have that stopped us from having permission for ourselves to speak our

608
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:12.660
truth.
That's a totally different thing that we all have as adults,

609
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:17.370
but this process will help us take us through.
So with one minute on the clock,

610
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.660
I'm going to introduce myself from my head.
Facts only,
completely unrehearsed,

611
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.290
which you're probably gonna notice within yourself and maybe watching other

612
00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:28.350
people is that some of us are really good in the head.

613
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.990
Some of us are really good in the heart.
Some of us are really good in the core.

614
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.100
Most of us are not good at all three or I shouldn't say not good.

615
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:39.150
It's just not comfortable.
It's not like your go to and that's okay.

616
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.400
I'm not here to teach you how to be better at it.

617
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.760
I'm just here to teach you how to bring consciousness to when you're in which

618
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:48.900
space.
Okay.
For better.
For worse.
So one minute.
All right.

619
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:52.320
Just let's do this thing.
Okay.

620
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.870
Facts only if I say a feeling you kind of all go and

621
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.620
totally non abrasive.
Alright,
so facts only.
Um,

622
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.370
my name is Aaron Weed.
My middle name is Underwood.

623
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:10.610
I was made fun of a lot for my weird name through growing up.

624
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.310
Graduation ceremonies were kind of the,
the biggest part.

625
00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:18.900
Aaron Underwood weed and everyone would laugh.
I don't think it's that funny,

626
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:23.880
but whatever.
Um,
I am from Chicago.
I lived in New York after that.

627
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.960
Have started a few companies.
I have two children,

628
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.860
ages eight and five.
We live in boulder.

629
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.950
Just moved last week.

630
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:40.050
Thought I would make it more interesting and adopt a puppy this weekend.

631
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.030
So far that's proven to be intellectually factually true.

632
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:50.250
It's more interesting.
Um,

633
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.860
I am learning to play the Ukulele.
Okay.
Thank you.

634
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:59.580
So there are my facts.
So,
um,
no.
Um,
oh,

635
00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:01.890
you'll also notice I kept my head on my my hand and had a little time.

636
00:38:01.891 --> 00:38:02.970
You're probably wondering why I was doing that.

637
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.230
Here's why this exercise is about teaching conscious awareness about when you're

638
00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:08.430
in your head,
your heart and your core.

639
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:13.080
The reason I'm doing that is so that you can have the power to shift out of your

640
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:16.860
head harder core and into a different place in your,
in your communications.

641
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:21.660
So for this exercise we're all gonna put our hands where we're speaking from so

642
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:24.450
that we could start learning where we are.
It makes sense.

643
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.090
It's like kinesthetic screen.
Okay,
cool.
So hand on your head.

644
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.990
One minute backs only about who you are.
Hi,
I'm Lisa

645
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.280
to Denver,

646
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.170
<v 2>recently from New York and from who lives in New York from Seattle.</v>

647
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.620
So that's where I originally come from and I got engaged in October and we have

648
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:53.710
a small dog.
His name is Connor.
Small dogs.
Name is Gabby.

649
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:57.740
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

650
00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.890
<v 2>We call him our son a junior senator Sunday.</v>

651
00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:05.600
My fiance,

652
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.600
Connor just got a job and I and switching teams payments and I am going to take

653
00:39:13.881 --> 00:39:17.650
30 days off in between to wreak.

654
00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.480
How much time do I have?

655
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:25.723
<v 1>I do a little bit with,</v>

656
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.913
okay.

657
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.300
<v 2>Hi,
my name is Leslie Pace.</v>

658
00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:45.310
I am a Colorado native.
However,
I wasn't wearing Oklahoma,

659
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.040
moved here when I was six.
Um,
grew up in a rural Colorado.

660
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.930
Um,
and would you change the high school that way?
Anybody is familiar?

661
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.250
Um,

662
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.250
then I graduated from there and [inaudible] Howard University in Washington DC

663
00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.670
where I studied computer information systems,

664
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.840
minor in information assurance and I also learned how to jab it in my men very

665
00:40:10.551 --> 00:40:11.384
well,

666
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.123
<v 1>easy.</v>

667
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.590
<v 2>And came back home.</v>

668
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.790
I was managing restaurants in DC and my dad said,

669
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.770
we pay you to go manage restaurants.
I said,

670
00:40:27.771 --> 00:40:28.604
no.

671
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.320
And I came home and I started working at a startup called zen planner,

672
00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:36.260
any Middleton and they do information systems,

673
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.200
fitness businesses and I actually,
it was there.

674
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.263
<v 1>Right.</v>

675
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.960
<v 2>My name is Paige Jessica [inaudible] and my name never fit on scantrons growing</v>

676
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:57.370
up,
uh,
I'm the Admin in g tech.

677
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.440
I've been at Google for eight years.

678
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.120
I started out as a TVC and became an Mtu 2011.

679
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:08.260
I just recently in August moves,
uh,
Irving,

680
00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:12.670
California to Colorado and it,
aside from a one year stint in Germany,

681
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:14.950
it's the only time I've lived outside of California,

682
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.520
but I'm really excited that I left.
Uh,

683
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:23.140
I got my degree in German and international relations.

684
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.880
I live with my boyfriend,
Noah and our two dogs.

685
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.750
Budget and Bogart.
Uh,

686
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.710
I love to,

687
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.970
<v 0>but you can.
Yep.
Yeah,
I am outside a lot</v>

688
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.590
next week and,

689
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.760
<v 1>okay,</v>

690
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.080
<v 0>so now it's your turn.</v>

691
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.500
I'd love for you to find a partner and one minute for each of you.

692
00:41:57.501 --> 00:42:00.920
I'll tell you when the minute's up.
So remember hand on the head.

693
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:05.780
Facts only ready and break.
30 seconds.

694
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.600
<v 1>Okay.
So</v>

695
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.930
what did you all notice about speaking from the head?

696
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.770
<v 0>Hollered out or it's hard to not say things you're like,
yeah.</v>

697
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.940
What else do you learn?
You ran out of facts.
Okay.

698
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.330
<v 1>It's like,
I gotta get going.
We've got a headboard</v>

699
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:35.340
<v 0>right here,
right?
It's hard to disconnect emotion.
Okay.</v>

700
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:37.490
Okay,
great.

701
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:47.480
<v 1>Like,
I'm a totally lame person.
What a tough discovery at a workshop,
you know?</v>

702
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:48.993
Um,

703
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.500
<v 0>well the great thing about head like this,
this is by no means the,</v>

704
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:57.920
the punchline is not like don't stay in your head,
don't like go to your head.

705
00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:02.420
Like that's not the punchline.
The punchline is don't live in your head.
Okay.

706
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:05.780
And that's what a lot of our culture dies is we live in our head like networking

707
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:08.870
events.
Great example.
You go to a networking event,

708
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:11.110
what are the two questions people ask you?
What you do,

709
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.190
where are you from and what do you do right over and over and over again.

710
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.970
And it's what it leads to is just this culture of disconnection because that's

711
00:43:20.971 --> 00:43:24.170
like where we're starting now.
I don't have a problem with starting there.

712
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:28.640
If you use it as a jumping off point to go somewhere else because it can be

713
00:43:28.641 --> 00:43:31.630
socially awkward just to walk up to someone and be like,
what are you passionate?

714
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.390
<v 1>You know,
like sometimes got to lie</v>

715
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.840
<v 0>no a little bit.
But if we just let it go there,</v>

716
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.940
what are the things I notice about like the where are you from?

717
00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:45.020
What do you do thing,
especially the,
where are you from?
Like you'd be like,
oh,

718
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:48.420
I'll be like,
oh,
I'm from Chicago.
And then the person I was meant to like,
oh,

719
00:43:48.421 --> 00:43:52.650
I have a cousin who was from Wilmette,
which is outside of Chicago.
Oh really?

720
00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:56.130
Where'd she go to school?
And Oh really?
She wants a lawyer all,

721
00:43:56.131 --> 00:43:59.190
I have a friend who was a loyal and I'm like,
where is this going?

722
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.090
We're now talking about two people that neither one of us really know at this

723
00:44:03.091 --> 00:44:07.290
point.
Anyway,
not authentic.
Very,

724
00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:10.560
very transparent.
Okay,
so we want to go for the authenticity,
the head,

725
00:44:10.561 --> 00:44:11.970
the heart and the court as a blend.

726
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.200
But another one of the reasons head is important is because it gives context.

727
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.130
Oh,
week where that,
where's that person from?
Now we can place them.

728
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:24.180
There's something about having context that allows you to trust someone.

729
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.480
Like if I would've just stepped up here and started talking about stuff and

730
00:44:27.481 --> 00:44:31.050
Alison had introduced me and you had no context of like what my deal was,

731
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.120
what my background was,
you'd be thinking,

732
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:35.700
why the heck is this woman here right now?
And like why am I listening to her?

733
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.810
Like I don't,
I don't understand.

734
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.530
So head is is powerful and important as long as we don't stay there forever.

735
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.160
Okay,
so now let's move on to the second part.
The heart.

736
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:47.880
Now for this part of the exercise,
I'm going to give you two minutes.

737
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.090
The reason is

738
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.560
two minutes of feelings everybody.
That's what you got today.

739
00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:02.330
So the reason I make this a little bit longer is because I like to create some

740
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:07.821
time and space for you to even figure this stuff out before you start talking.

741
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.840
So many times in our culture,
we just talk way too soon.

742
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.400
We just started saying all this crazy stuff that is not true,
not authentic,

743
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.480
maybe not even transparent,
just because we are conditioned to fill the space.

744
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.800
So in your personal relationships,
in business,
doesn't matter.

745
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.190
I encourage you all to take a minute,
take a day,
take a week,

746
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.930
take what you need to figure out what is the authentic emotion.

747
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.530
So within this exercise,
I'd love for you all to start out.

748
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:41.370
We're all have our hand on our heart and start off and just

749
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.580
taking a breath.

750
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.650
Close your eyes if you need to just drop in with yourself.

751
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:54.990
What if we did this like eight times a day?
Would that be an interesting life?

752
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.050
We wouldn't be so lame anymore because it actually kind of see well I'm like a

753
00:45:58.051 --> 00:45:59.760
complex individual.

754
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.490
I've got range,
you know,
and it's true.

755
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.180
So we need to like drop down and sink in to even figure it.

756
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.170
Figure out what that is.
Okay.
So I'll model it for you.

757
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.750
Give it two minutes.
All right.
Okay.

758
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.860
What am I feeling?

759
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.120
So I'm in this space right now where I'm feeling total joy and connection

760
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.860
because of this puppy that I adopted.

761
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:34.730
I have not had a dog for like years cause my pug died a few years ago and I've

762
00:46:35.431 --> 00:46:37.770
always wanted this French bulldog,
like one a French bulldog.

763
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:41.700
But I didn't want to do a breeder cause I have this like ethical thing around
it.

764
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.930
I was like,
I want to adopt a French bulldog,
like,
and they just,

765
00:46:45.931 --> 00:46:48.430
it doesn't happen very often.
And then she came through Petfinder,

766
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.550
which I would get obsessive,
Lee.

767
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.020
And she showed up and she was given up and discarded by a breeder because she

768
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:59.610
has this epic underbite
like out of control,

769
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.950
like cheap hanging out of mouth,
like she's 11 pounds.

770
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.980
And I just remember feeling in that moment like,
oh my God,
that's my dog.
Like,

771
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.880
and I just moved a week ago and this is terrible timing and awful,

772
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:10.080
but like something in my heart,

773
00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:12.150
just like it was exploding for this little creature.

774
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.030
And so we rescued her on Sunday and ever since then,
and I'm like,

775
00:47:16.031 --> 00:47:19.980
even total puppy craziness,
but it's just like something about her.

776
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:24.750
It's like re awakened what it means to connect what it means to care for people,

777
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.530
what it means to,
um,
to be straight forward about what you need.

778
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.720
Like,
like,
don't eat my couch.

779
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.273
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

780
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.080
<v 0>Do that crap there.
You know,
but just a button,</v>

781
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:41.860
a loving sort of way just to show up in that way.

782
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:44.260
And so I've really been basking in that.
And,
uh,

783
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.710
yesterday my kids met her for the first time and it was just like,

784
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.330
I'm still kind of like riding it.
Um,

785
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.010
and it's for me kind of a welcome respite just with so much that's going on in

786
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:57.430
the world right now.
I actually kind of came out of like a month of just,

787
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.130
just not dumps per se,

788
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:04.510
but just feeling like just the world was disconnected from each other,

789
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.520
you know,
and uh,

790
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.920
it just kinda felt dark and a little hopeless after the school shooting and

791
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.620
missing school shooting like really kind of rocked me to my core because I,

792
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.600
I used to get the calls,
that sort of thing would happen.

793
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.530
And now I have two kids that are in elementary school and it's just real in a

794
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:24.160
whole different way.
And so
by the time,

795
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.780
so when the time ends,

796
00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:28.660
like you finish your thought because otherwise it's just a Brompton feels weird

797
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:32.110
for everybody.
So really,
um,

798
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.540
in closing what I've been feeling into,

799
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.520
it's just like the paradox of what it is to be alive,

800
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:41.770
of like holding the light and the dark in the very same moment and the joy and

801
00:48:41.771 --> 00:48:45.970
the pain in the very same moment and just trying to become

802
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:50.920
more,
more skillful with just allowing it all to be true.

803
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:53.163
Thank you.

804
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:58.370
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

805
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.930
<v 0>good breath.
The whole room can take a breath too.</v>

806
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:06.190
Cause when you're hearing other people share,
it can be heavy on,
on you as well.

807
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.750
<v 2>This one's telling me that this is a self soothing</v>

808
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:26.200
bowler
bourbon holder,

809
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:28.660
Neha,

810
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:33.660
last year started and pretty much from day one as in a situation that wasn't

811
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:39.160
good for me.
Um,

812
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.920
it's a complex thing and it's many reasons but ultimately it wasn't a good team

813
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:47.150
fit.
But I'm not,

814
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.480
not the same amount of clutter because there's plenty of things that we have up

815
00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:54.180
on with.
But I want to succeed.
And so I,

816
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:59.340
I spent so much of my energy and my time talking about people who

817
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.910
were breaking you down.

818
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.840
So much of that spend doing that at home,

819
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.800
in Van Pool.
Just anyone that would listen.

820
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:14.950
And to the point that I just got tired of having,

821
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:20.020
having that be my story every day.
And so

822
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:26.470
putting a good amount of work and I want to the courage to say this isn't my

823
00:50:26.471 --> 00:50:30.590
place anymore and I,
I want to succeed and I think I can succeed,

824
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:33.260
but it can't be on this team and I'm switching teams.

825
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.490
And since that does,

826
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:41.750
like it all got approved and everything's settled down and I have a few weeks

827
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:46.751
left in my pain and it is amazing how when I know that the consequences of the

828
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.040
day to day interactions aren't going to affect me anymore.

829
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.570
How much for your I am on how,
how empowered him to actually do my job.

830
00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.520
I've done more of job in the past month effectively and well then I think I did

831
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:05.750
in the three months prior just because I'm finally free.

832
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.160
And so it just then decided like,
wow,
I've got,

833
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:13.040
when I'm in a space where I feel really safe and really awesome.
Yeah.
Oh,

834
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.470
and I'm finished.
How much work did I do there?

835
00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:27.630
I just moved out of my parents' house so I feel really free.

836
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.630
I'm really excited about it.
Even,
you know,

837
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.450
10 to 61 square feet to me,

838
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:41.060
really happy about it and I definitely did factor into my neighbor's car.

839
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.740
<v 1>I feel nervous.</v>

840
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:52.390
<v 2>I felt very responsible because I wrote him a note to smell store while I was in</v>

841
00:51:53.141 --> 00:51:53.974
my pj's.

842
00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.453
<v 1>Hi.</v>

843
00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.780
<v 2>I feel very optimistic and my brother is graduating high school soon on the arm.</v>

844
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:05.910
He's thought to go to college architecture.
Um,

845
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:10.930
I'm scared he has epilepsy that is triggered by sleep deprivation and you know,

846
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:17.090
you're in college.
How are you doing this day and all night?
And uh,

847
00:52:17.091 --> 00:52:19.700
I was like morality,
you know,
Kendra can you alcohol,

848
00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:22.250
you can be out here and say that Blake pulling all nighters.

849
00:52:22.251 --> 00:52:25.040
It's not a thing that you can do like everybody up,

850
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.340
he's going to be balanced in the house.
Nervous,

851
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:33.050
but I'm excited.
Um

852
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.810
Hm.
Um
Hm.

853
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.443
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

854
00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.713
<v 2>MMM.</v>

855
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:48.800
She is my little brother.
He's six.
Five.

856
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.293
<v 1>Okay.</v>

857
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.033
<v 2>Teach.</v>

858
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.520
Yes.
Started growing dreadlocks.
Don't like them.

859
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:11.060
<v 1>And that is what matters.
Took</v>

860
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.620
<v 2>him to see Kendrick Lamar there his 18th birthday.</v>

861
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:19.810
And he was so excited and he said
all of a sudden,

862
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.050
and he is an old man and a young man.

863
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:30.090
You were younger,
I would say,
hey,
let's go get ice cream.

864
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:32.220
You'd be like,
I already have my pajamas on.

865
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:37.223
Yeah.

866
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:41.323
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

867
00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.750
<v 2>I feel lots of feelings</v>

868
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:04.040
all the time.
Actually.
Three feeling person,

869
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:09.620
wear glasses on you're feeling,
it's like go out

870
00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.470
like watching commercial.

871
00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:24.090
It's just when you say something Nice I get teary and it's really annoying trait

872
00:54:24.771 --> 00:54:27.920
that I have,
but I'm kind of learning to embrace it.

873
00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:33.420
I'm 31 years old and I feel like your thirties are about embracing who you are

874
00:54:34.151 --> 00:54:38.440
and uh,
and acknowledging and loving yourself for who you are.

875
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.713
I spent,

876
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.653
I am

877
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.140
right as I was actually able to watch game of Thrones,
I just like,

878
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:03.180
but I feel like spent a lot of the,
uh,

879
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:05.520
the last couple of years,
uh,

880
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:11.630
kind of working through this part of who I am and that being okay.

881
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:18.080
And it also coexisting with other parts of who I am and like the smart parts in

882
00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:22.830
the professional parts hardhearted parts.
And,
uh,

883
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:27.630
and also just growing up,
I feel like I'm in a growing up kind of phase.

884
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:32.870
I recently kind of separated from my dad and that was a really don't know why

885
00:55:34.051 --> 00:55:38.220
I'm sharing but really hard a year,

886
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:44.420
but also really about me and it being okay to be unique and that you don't,

887
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:52.920
you don't need everyone else's approval around you to be you and to love you for

888
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:53.754
you.

889
00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:00.050
So yeah.
That's good.

890
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:05.390
<v 1>[inaudible] Hey,</v>

891
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.120
<v 0>I'm hot to you guys.</v>

892
00:56:10.121 --> 00:56:13.690
I just want to just make a note because like I can feel your self consciousness

893
00:56:13.691 --> 00:56:15.100
in it.
Like how easy is it?

894
00:56:15.101 --> 00:56:18.930
Is it to hear her like it's so easy to,

895
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.630
to just be with you in the authenticity of it and like what if we as women,

896
00:56:22.631 --> 00:56:25.840
we could let of any judgment if we show up in that emotional way.

897
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:30.040
Like it's just so easy to hear you,
so thank you.
So,
um,

898
00:56:30.041 --> 00:56:32.980
at this point we can't go back to our partners two minutes for each.

899
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.360
<v 2>Did you notice about</v>

900
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:45.150
<v 0>the difference between the head and the heart outside of the visual difference</v>

901
00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:45.984
of the room.

902
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:53.890
<v 2>Okay,
interesting.
Okay.
What else?</v>

903
00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.420
Yeah,
yeah.
It was uncomfortable.

904
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:06.950
They just aren't typically things that would come out in a first meeting with

905
00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:13.040
being censored and like feeling sort of that polite.
Those highlights,

906
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:16.600
social boundaries.
You wouldn't off put those things on.

907
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:21.320
Somebody told her offloading actually kind of,

908
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:22.330
it's the opposite I think.
It's

909
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:30.050
like you don't know anything about me and everybody is like [inaudible] my

910
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:40.890
therapist [inaudible]

911
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:45.743
okay.

912
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:52.010
Some of the things I said was they felt but never set up that very cool.

913
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.243
<v 0>Interesting.</v>

914
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:58.060
Did anyone who tends to be more of a head person because just because we're

915
00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.940
mostly women here,
it doesn't mean we're all heart people.
You know,
there's,

916
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:02.770
there's women who are just more head people too.

917
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:04.990
So it was there anybody who is more of a head person,

918
00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:09.991
you've almost noticed yourself like analyzing the feeling like I think that I

919
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:11.830
feel this and you can almost like,

920
00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.130
and you can usually tell when you're doing the exercise,
when someone's like,

921
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:18.970
I had person thinking about their feelings when it's just like there's no body

922
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:23.590
match up,
you know,
so it can come off as being a little incongruent.
So,

923
00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.980
so had people have to be careful of that.
Um,
so that people,

924
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:30.550
that people don't distrust them because it's not matching up,

925
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:34.390
if you know what I mean.
So,
so heart is really important.

926
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:37.270
Like there's a lot of connection because at the end of the day,

927
00:58:37.271 --> 00:58:40.390
we're all human beings and that's the thing we have in common and this is where

928
00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:43.840
we can really connect.
But on the flip side,
just as if we,

929
00:58:43.841 --> 00:58:47.110
if we show up at our head all the time and there's a lack of connection if we

930
00:58:47.111 --> 00:58:51.430
just showed up and were just like bleeding all over the floor,
um,

931
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:56.470
with our feelings,
98% of the time,
after a while,

932
00:58:56.471 --> 00:58:59.950
people are gonna start avoiding you because that's exhausting.

933
00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.940
I work with a lot of activists that are trying to make big change in the world

934
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:06.220
and a lot of these activists are trying to make this change because something

935
00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:10.210
bad happened and it woke us up to something a better way.

936
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:13.450
And it's just kind of this natural thing to just go into the,

937
00:59:13.451 --> 00:59:15.700
and this happened and this happened to me and this was awful.

938
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:18.310
And this person died and bled,
you know,
like it's all bad.

939
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:20.800
Like as someone who talks about rape and murder for 12 years,
it's,

940
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.040
and we need to be able to talk about it from the head and we need to be able to

941
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:27.260
talk about it from the core to and balance it out.

942
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.080
Otherwise people get emotionally exhausted and you don't,

943
00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:33.140
you don't connect that either.
So everything is about balance.

944
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.581
So that's the heart.

945
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:38.030
The final piece of this and then we're going to tie up is the court,

946
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.580
we're going to shift back to one minute for this.

947
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:43.640
You might not even need all that time and you don't have to use it on.

948
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.960
Speaking from the cork tends to be very short,
very to the point.
My daughter,

949
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:52.220
I don't want to wear shoes very clear.
It doesn't necessarily need to make sense.

950
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:57.260
So let's just,
you know,
release ourselves from having to,
for that to happen.

951
00:59:57.530 --> 01:00:00.770
It can just be what you want in that moment.
I want this,
I want that.

952
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.010
And so I find that a good prompts when we do the core,

953
01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:05.360
and you might want to do this with your partners,

954
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:10.100
just start off with what do you want.
In some ways it can sound abrasive,

955
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:12.200
but in other ways it can sound totally free.
Really.

956
01:00:12.201 --> 01:00:14.510
Like really I can answer that question like anyway,
want to,
okay,

957
01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:18.200
here's what I bought.
You know,
so have some fun with this.
Notice what comes up.

958
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:21.380
I also notice when we speak from the core,
sometimes it can seem really random.

959
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.520
Like I want world peace.
I don't want to sleep later.
You know,
like it's

960
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:29.630
seemingly unrelated,
but maybe I've,
everyone slept later,
I don't know.

961
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:34.820
So just whatever we're remember,
we're not rehearsing still.

962
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:36.710
So just what everyone's come out comes out.

963
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:37.940
So this time we're just gonna hold her belly.

964
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:41.360
This is kind of the place where we manifest things.
So again,

965
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:45.710
take a good deep breath.
What do you want?
And especially by the way,

966
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:47.990
as leaders,
we need to tell people what we want.

967
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.310
If we want to lead people somewhere,

968
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:53.450
Martin Luther King Jr like if he gave speeches and he didn't tell people that he

969
01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:56.420
had a dream,
like do you think it would have been as effective?

970
01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:00.230
We wanted to get on board with that dream.
He took us somewhere.

971
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.840
So we need to do that as leaders in our relationships,

972
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:06.050
in our teams and in the world.
Okay,
I want,

973
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.790
uh,
I want to potty train my dog

974
01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:15.710
cause I think it will make my life better.
I want,
um,

975
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:19.910
in this sense and more work sense,
I want people to show up more authentically.

976
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.000
I have the luxury of doing this for a living,

977
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.970
of getting people to the most authentic selves and helping them communicate.

978
01:01:25.971 --> 01:01:29.390
And I see what's on the other side of that.
And it's that thing that like,

979
01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:31.250
you know,
that maybe not everybody knows.

980
01:01:31.251 --> 01:01:33.920
And it's so frustrating because you want everyone to know it because life is so

981
01:01:33.921 --> 01:01:36.710
much better when they do that.
And so that's Kinda how I feel.

982
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:40.850
And so opportunities like this are so exciting to me so that hopefully you can

983
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:43.400
take the tool and run with it.
Um,

984
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:48.050
I want to figure out the,
um,
the violence problem in our world,
the,

985
01:01:48.051 --> 01:01:49.490
and maybe even more than the violence,

986
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:53.480
like the anger and the disconnection that's behind all of that.

987
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.250
I want to get to the root of things and I think back up here,

988
01:01:58.251 --> 01:02:01.970
but I think one of the reasons we feel so disconnected because we're all

989
01:02:01.971 --> 01:02:03.170
conditioned to be inauthentic.

990
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.100
So I want us to show up in a different way than we maybe have been.

991
01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:11.810
Cause there's really a spectrum time.
There's really a spectrum and um,

992
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.440
I think we can choose in every moment to show it more authentically and the in

993
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:18.560
the world would be better for it.
All right.
That's my minute.

994
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:21.923
<v 2>What do you want?</v>

995
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:28.470
I want to utilize my body to,

996
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.950
it's grace and Cassidy.
Um,

997
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:35.700
mostly anything physically because I just think that each of us are given the

998
01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:40.560
gift of the mobility that we have and I want to be as fit and as strong as

999
01:02:40.561 --> 01:02:43.830
possible.
And I want to share that gift,

1000
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:47.940
a bottling mobility with other people because I think that a lot of times that's

1001
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.233
I should work out,

1002
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:54.370
work out and not like fucking get to go move my body until it sweats and wants

1003
01:02:54.661 --> 01:02:55.770
to like come up to the floor.

1004
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.640
That's how I feel about it and I want to share that.

1005
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.970
And I think it sends a lot from,
I've had four knee surgeries,

1006
01:03:03.971 --> 01:03:08.520
so I know what it's like to not have the ability,
not be able to use your body.

1007
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.080
And it's not a vanity thing,
it's a feeling.

1008
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:17.040
I think that I feel better about every other part of my life when I feel strong.

1009
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:21.420
And I think everybody should feel strong because everybody can feel strong.

I want to be able to control the emotional part of me while still feeling it.

1029
01:04:55.890 --> 01:05:00.210
I want to have more time to read.

1030

I want to write a book someday.
I want to go on vacation.

1031
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:10.620
I want to hike more.

1032
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:14.430
I want to have time.

1033

I want to spend more time with my mom.

1034
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:25.030
I want to spend more time.
Lots of people.

1035
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:30.760
I want to have a sense of purpose.

1036
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.790
I want coffee.

1037
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.190
I want to stop now.

1038
01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.780
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1039
01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.020
<v 0>like we're doing in this session.
So sorry.
Your Gusto into this partner up.</v>

1040
01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.850
You got one minute.
What do you want?

1041
01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.290
<v 1>So what did you notice about speaking from the court?</v>

1042
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.360
Powerful.
Yeah,

1043
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.020
<v 0>it's what?
Energizing.
You can feel it in the room right now.</v>

1044
01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:17.720
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Speaking from the court really allowed,

1045
01:06:17.721 --> 01:06:20.040
it allows people to follow us,
allows people to connect with us.

1046
01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:21.780
So as you can see from this exercise,

1047
01:06:21.781 --> 01:06:23.910
when we show up and speak from those three different places,

1048
01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:27.240
there are so distinctly different get,
they're all distinctly you.

1049
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.090
And when you show up and you'll bring all of those things,

1050
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.470
people can get the most authentic experience of you and you can feel the most

1051
01:06:34.471 --> 01:06:35.700
authentically expressed.

1052
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.760
So the final thing I want to leave you with is just a quick little story.

1053
01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:41.430
Something that I do with these big Ted speakers,
right?

1054
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:44.130
That after we go through this process and we write their talk,

1055
01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.100
they're always like,
okay,
well I'm gonna go give this talk.

1056
01:06:47.101 --> 01:06:49.980
Like any other final pieces of advice.
I'm like,
yes,

1057
01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:55.170
my piece of advice is for you to break a coconut.
They're like,
that is like,
like,

1058
01:06:55.171 --> 01:06:58.680
what am I paying you for?
Like what's happening?
And I'm like,
yeah,
okay.

1059
01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.140
So here's the deal.
So I'm in the Hindu religion.

1060
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:03.510
They have the ceremony called bricking a coconut,

1061
01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:06.600
and it's something that you do when there is something in your space that's

1062
01:07:06.601 --> 01:07:09.510
preventing you from like being the human that the God's intended you to be.

1063
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.950
So it's like your ego interfering,

1064
01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:13.410
fearing like either you're playing yourself down,
you're playing yourself up,

1065
01:07:13.411 --> 01:07:16.020
doesn't matter,
but like something's blocking it in the way.

1066
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.900
And the question becomes what do you need to let go of?

1067
01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:23.220
And so in the Hindu religion,
they like approach the community.

1068
01:07:23.221 --> 01:07:26.190
Whoever in the community is being blocked by this thing that's preventing them

1069
01:07:26.191 --> 01:07:27.960
from being the awesome person that they are.
And they say,

1070
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:32.961
you need to break a coconut and imagine what is that thing that you can abuse

1071
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:37.380
spiritually into that coconut that you need to let go of to get out of the way

1072
01:07:37.381 --> 01:07:40.290
and become the person that you were supposed to be for the sake of the gods.

1073
01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.930
And so they smashed a coconut.

1074
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:46.530
This person does and releases the thing that they need to get out of the way.

1075
01:07:46.531 --> 01:07:51.420
Maybe it's fear of money,
fear of success,
fear of being seen.
Fear of failing.

1076
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.310
It's usually a fear of some kind,
but smashing that coconut and in that process,

1077
01:07:56.311 --> 01:08:00.330
smashing that thing that's preventing us from showing up as our authentic self.

1078
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.800
And then the milk splatters everywhere.
And it's the most freeing thing.

1079
01:08:04.801 --> 01:08:06.210
I actually do this with clients.

1080
01:08:06.211 --> 01:08:09.720
Like we actually go to Boulder Creek and smash coconuts and it's in front of the

1081
01:08:09.721 --> 01:08:11.610
police station.
So I'm just waiting for the day that they're like,

1082
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:15.000
just don't even really know how to start.

1083
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:20.170
But are you breaking coconuts in nature?
But when the milk splatters,

1084
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:20.961
it's amazing.

1085
01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:24.830
And then you pick up the pieces though of the coconut and you definitely throw

1086
01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:26.390
them into water.
Um,

1087
01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.330
in our case we use the Boulder Creek and the reason that you start them into

1088
01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:34.100
water is it's supposed to be a grateful letting go because that thing that came

1089
01:08:34.101 --> 01:08:37.670
into your space to prevent you from being who you truly were,
it was a gift.

1090
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.840
It protected you.

1091
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:43.280
It's some point in your life that kept you safe and now it's not needed.

1092
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.150
And so you smashed the coconut to let it go.
But you think it on its way up.

1093
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:50.780
And so my final thing I wanted to leave you today with,
it's just a question,

1094
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:55.820
what do you need to let go of to be that woman or to be that man that you were

1095
01:08:55.821 --> 01:09:00.290
meant to be?
Let it go.
Break a coconut if you need to.
Whole foods carries them.

1096
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.560
Get the brown ones,
shatter it,

1097
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:05.570
throw the pieces of white and thank it for protecting you,

1098
01:09:05.571 --> 01:09:07.910
but be ready for a new layer of self to emerge.

1099
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.390
I want to thank you all so much for having me here on International Women's Day.

1100
01:09:11.391 --> 01:09:12.650
