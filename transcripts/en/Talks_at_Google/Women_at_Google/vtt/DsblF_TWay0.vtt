00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.221
In the book,

2
00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:10.820
bored and brilliant rediscovering the lost art of spacing out man minutiae is
on,

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.750
explains the connection between board,

4
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:17.440
I mean being unplugged and how that state of mind can ignite original thinking

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.210
through Ah,
through reviews with scientists,
famous artists and regular people.

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.320
Some roadie explains by putting a greater emphasis on doing nothing is vital and

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.510
age of constant notifications and digital distractions.

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.310
She explores how we can harness boredom's hidden benefits to become our most

9
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:40.480
productive selves.
Bored and brilliant.
It's permission to unplug.

10
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.090
Please welcome the author and host of the podcast note to self is I'm already,

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.220
<v 0>thank you so much.</v>

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.470
<v 3>Right on.
Thank you guys.</v>

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.520
<v 0>Thanks for being patient with me and hanging out.
I don't know,</v>

14
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:57.840
like you rush off to meetings at Google or is evolved enough that you don't have

15
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.730
to do that.
I don't know.
Um,

16
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.760
so I'm just going to play you a little video just to get a sense of,
um,

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.050
what I've been working on for the last couple of years.
Let's see if it plays.

18
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.280
<v 0>So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to tell you about how this book came to be.
Um,</v>

20
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.430
cause it's kind of unusual.
I think it's truly the first,

21
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.600
and this is a mouthful,

22
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:42.580
the first podcast crowdsourced project to be turned into a book.

23
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.330
I'm going to take that title for myself.
I know everyone's been clamoring for it,

24
00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:49.750
but I'm going to take it.
Um,
so I'm going to tell you about the genesis of it.

25
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:51.940
I'm gonna play you a little bit of audio,

26
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:53.200
some of the stuff that I've been making,

27
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:56.650
cause it's all really comes down to the podcast that I've been making.

28
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.410
And then I'm going to tell you about the book tour that I've been on for the

29
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:02.890
last two weeks because it's been sort of my own little focus group across the

30
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:03.724
country.

31
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.570
And it's been fascinating to hear the people who've come out to spend time with

32
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:09.370
me and what's on their minds,

33
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:13.150
which I think is interesting to all of us making the stuff that they use.
Um,

34
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.060
so if you don't know what my podcast is called,
note to self,

35
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.470
it's part of New York public radio.
Um,
I started out as a hardcore journalist.

36
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:23.830
I was with the BBC,
I was with Reuters.
Um,
and my,

37
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.510
my job was flying around the world for a long time and covering hotspots.

38
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.630
And then once I had kids,
I was really more covering business and tech.
Um,

39
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.220
and then I got into podcasting and I sort of realized that my job had changed.

40
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:39.970
It was less about reporting on the developments that was happening at companies

41
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:43.150
like yours,
but really more that as a podcast,

42
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:46.570
there was an intimacy that was there with my community that people,

43
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.830
when you listen,
there was this sense that we were talking to each other,

44
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:55.831
there was conversation and that what people really wanted was some help.

45
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.290
They were feeling as though the world was moving at a accelerating pace and they

46
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.670
felt unmoored by it.
Because as you know,

47
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.870
technology is changing the way that we fall in love,
the way that we parent,

48
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.760
the way that we work,
everything.
And people sort of didn't know how to handle it.

49
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.330
And so that's what note to self really evolved into.
Um,

50
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.390
and so one of the things that I did was a project,
um,

51
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.820
an interactive project that was called the bored and brilliant project,

52
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.560
the lost art of,
of spacing out.

53
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:31.561
And this was in 2015 and the genesis of this was actually that the podcast,

54
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.730
you know,
it was doing well,
it was 2014 podcasting was starting to take off,

55
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.190
which was super exciting for me.
And I was,
I dunno,

56
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:43.120
I'd give us like a B plus a minus.
And I had this moment where I was like,
okay,

57
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:47.490
how am I going to step up my game?
It was kind of a cliched moment to have,
um,

58
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.100
how am I going to come up with better ideas?
And I had this feeling like,
well,

59
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.920
when was the last time that I did come up with my best ideas?

60
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.560
And it was such a cliche.
It was like,
Oh,

61
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.580
when I'm driving in the car and staring out the window,
I was never bored,

62
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:01.960
is what I realized.

63
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.280
I realized that all the cracks in my day when I was waiting to get a cup of

64
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.400
coffee or I was waiting to get on the subway or to pick up my kids,

65
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.410
all those little moments when I used to sort of be spacing out or thinking

66
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.800
things through or whatever,
I now was looking,

67
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.750
somebody did leave their phone up here.

68
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.990
I was looking at this thing and I guess I was like,
well,

69
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.830
I guess never being bored.
Is that a good thing?
I mean,

70
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.520
I guess it's a good thing.
That's what they tell us.
Only boring people get bored,

71
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:33.070
right?
But then I started to wonder like,
well,

72
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.170
what actually happens in our brains when we get bored?
Or more importantly,

73
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:42.820
what could be happening to all of us if we never get bored ever again if we

74
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:46.930
don't,
uh,
experience this human state that has,
I think,
been with,

75
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.610
with us for Millennia.

76
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.030
And so I sort of reached out to my listeners and I was like,

77
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.500
are you guys thinking about this too?

78
00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.920
Are you wondering how your smartphones or changing your thinking patterns,
um,

79
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.650
would you be interested in?
Maybe,

80
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.250
I dunno what's like doing a week of experiments where we see that if we changed

81
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.890
our smartphone habits,
how it would affect our thinking.

82
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.420
And I thought like a couple hundred people would sign up to play with me for a

83
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.920
week.
And um,
and within 48 hours,
20,000 people signed up and I was like,
Whoa,

84
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:21.370
okay.
This is a thing.
A lot of people are feeling this.

85
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.510
People like Corrine.
Hi,
my name is Caryn.

86
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.190
I am made New Yorker,

87
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:32.191
born and raised and was desperate for this board at brilliant challenge.

88
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.710
It's perfect.
I needed it.
Um,

89
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:40.630
I've definitely developed some compulsion's for Facebook,
Instagram,

90
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.980
checking the news,
checking emails,
replying to email right away,

91
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.570
texting,
hunting for funny emojis.
Just,

92
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.080
I just need a break from my phone because I'm not sure that these activities

93
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.800
really add all that much value to my life and they certainly take up a lot of my

94
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.720
time.
Okay.

95
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.250
So Caren and I for one week in 2015 every morning we woke up and we put out a

96
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:11.570
little podcast that explained the neuroscience of what is going on in your brain

97
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.800
when you actually get bored.

98
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.760
It describes some of the technologies design in terms of getting our attention

99
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:20.510
and how we use it.
And it asks them to do a very small behavior change,

100
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.860
something to try that day just to see what would happen and then report back to

101
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:27.620
us.
Um,
and so what we learned,

102
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.900
and I found out that this is fascinating,

103
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:34.430
we are at an extraordinary moment when it comes to understanding what happens in

104
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:39.260
the brain when the mind wanders.
It's like it's really hot news and neuroscience.

105
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.480
So it turns out that when you get bored,

106
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:45.200
you ignite a brain network in your brain called the default mode.

107
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.890
And in the default mode,
we have our most original thoughts.

108
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:53.480
We do our most creative thinking.
We take two seemingly disparate ideas,

109
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.820
we smashed them together and create a new idea.

110
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.350
And we do something that I had never heard of before called autobiographical

111
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:03.350
planning.
This is where you look back at your previous,

112
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.420
at the earlier life that you've had,

113
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:10.340
and you take note of the highs and the lows and you build a personal narrative

114
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.030
and then decide,
you know,
where am I going to go from here?
What are my goals?

115
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:17.780
And you set the steps that you need to reach those.
And um,

116
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.690
so kind of important stuff that is going on in your brain.
Um,

117
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.450
and it also turns out that a decade ago we shifted our attention at work about

118
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:31.070
every three minutes and now we're shifting our attention at work every 45

119
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:35.810
seconds.
I found this amazing researcher,
her name is Dr Gloria Mark.

120
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.200
She's a professor of informatics at UC Irvine.

121
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:44.201
And she told me that the average person is switching tasks at work 566 times a

122
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.690
day.
So what I asked Gloria was,
I said,

123
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:51.800
is it because the technology has been designed to take our attention and get us

124
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:52.760
switching like that,

125
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.600
or is this just a human thing that if it wasn't the technology,

126
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.290
we'd be distracted by something else?
And here was her answer.

127
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.450
So I think it was a combination.

128
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.750
One thing that we've found is that there's actually a physiological reasons that

129
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.030
can explain why people shift their attention so rapidly.

130
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.720
So we find though when people are stressed,

131
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.860
they tend to shift their attention more avidly.
We also found,

132
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:19.970
strangely enough,

133
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.710
the shorter amount of sleep that a person gets,

134
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.910
the more likely they are to check Facebook.

135
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.370
We're in this vicious habitual cycle.
I mean,

136
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.400
I thought that was hilarious and made complete and utter sense because when I am

137
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:37.550
tired at night,

138
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.350
that is when I find myself going like this on my phone and not even looking at

139
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:45.830
whatever it is that I thought I was looking for.
And of course,

140
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.400
I mean I think that this has been a wake up call for a lot of Americans.

141
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:51.440
This idea that if the product is free,

142
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:55.470
then you are the product and we're seeing that conversation be more and more

143
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:58.020
prevalent and more mainstream.
Um,

144
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:02.610
so really the most gratifying,
um,

145
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.540
I found was that a lot of classrooms across the country did the bored and

146
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.830
brilliant project,
uh,

147
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.150
mostly high schools and freshmen college kids.
And,

148
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.710
and here's how I put it in the book,
talking,
listening,
eye contact,

149
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.800
downtime,
responsiveness and yes,

150
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:24.630
boredom are all activities that now need to actively be put into practice.

151
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.440
It's not the digital natives don't feel or know these things,

152
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:33.060
it's just that they don't get prioritized and so we must name schedule and

153
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:33.990
celebrate them.

154
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.950
Whether it's the effect that reading on screen has on our attention spans or

155
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:42.450
video game play has on socio ability or taking photos has on memory.

156
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.120
We're living in an age of self experimentation.

157
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.750
Technology is evolving faster than researchers can study it.

158
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.130
Science can't keep up,

159
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.970
which is why we need a new interdisciplinary approach like the one we could

160
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:56.280
offer with bored and brilliant research.

161
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.930
Now Neves needs to move out of the lab because life is the new lab.

162
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.230
So just in case you think like it's not a detox.

163
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.770
I absolutely refuse to use that word because I don't think it's a binary,

164
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.600
it's not on or off.
Right.

165
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:13.680
I think what we're finding is that users need to understand how it fits into

166
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:17.250
their lives and turn their phones from what had become task.

167
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:21.120
Mack masters back into tools that actually improve their lives.

168
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.860
And right now they're not feeling like there are,

169
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:26.520
a lot of them are feeling like they're not there yet.
Um,
so,

170
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.560
and I just want to play you a clip.

171
00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:34.140
So one of the days that we asked we had was called delete that app where we

172
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.440
asked people to,
uh,
take the APP that was driving them bonkers,

173
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:41.100
bananas off their phone just for the day.
You know,
you don't have to quit it,

174
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.940
whatever.
Just delete that off your phone so it's not following you around.

175
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.230
And I want to play you a clip from a listener named Liam who did the original

176
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.610
product,
uh,
project.

177
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.270
<v 4>This is Leon in Los Angeles and I deleted Twitter,
Facebook,</v>

178
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.860
Instagram,
Tumblr,
snapchat,
and vine from my phone in one fell swoop.

179
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.290
And it was kind of an embarrassingly emotional experience at first.

180
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.350
It felt weirdly loneliness to look at that lock screen with no new notifications

181
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:13.614
on it.

182
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:18.650
But I really like deciding for myself when to think about we're access my social

183
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:23.340
networks,
not giving my phone the power to decide that for me.

184
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.470
So thank you.

185
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.260
<v 0>I Love Liam.
He's such an extremist,
right?
He's like,
I'm taking them all off.</v>

186
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.320
All of them.
Okay.
So people took all kinds of things off.

187
00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:36.490
They took social media off,
they took games,
some people took news off.

188
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:39.100
If you've got a headline,
refreshing habit.
Um,

189
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.660
but I will say the other thing that we did during the original product,
uh,

190
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.330
project was that we partnered with two different apps.
Um,

191
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.000
and I did get some pushback on that.
People were like,
wait,

192
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.500
you're telling us to download certain apps in order to take apps off?
I was,
look,

193
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:56.030
we got to meet people where they are.
So,
um,

194
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.380
moment was for the iPhone break free was for android.

195
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.160
And what they did was measure how many minutes a day they were on their phone

196
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:07.630
and how many pickups day they were on their phone.
So we were able to have,
um,

197
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.080
thousands of people contributing their data back to us and we were able to

198
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:12.880
measure which days,
uh,

199
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.390
activities were more effective and which ones sort of we're not.

200
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.100
So the first time around in 2015,
I was totally winging it.
I just made every,

201
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:23.920
all the experiments up.
I was like,
I don't know,
let's try this.

202
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.610
But what we were able to do is go back and look at all the data and the stories

203
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:32.350
and codify it into what is now the book.
Of course.
Um,

204
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.090
so in the end we had 20,000 people that one week,
all 50 states,

205
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.800
we measured that 90% of them cut down on their phone time,
which,
you know,

206
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:43.420
I kind of feel like,
okay,
that's great.

207
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.560
But really the more important thing was that 70% felt as though they had more

208
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.650
time to just think,
which,
I mean it's,
I just did a tedtalk.

209
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.910
Um,
and they were like,
yeah,
so I don't know,

210
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:58.150
is that gonna be enough that like your messages that people need to think?

211
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.870
I was like shocking.
Right?
Liam got back in touch,
uh,

212
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.780
two weeks ago because I did a shout out to my listeners and I was like,

213
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.710
do any of you remember the project that we did in 2015 I've got this book coming

214
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:13.660
out.
They totally remembered.
Um,
Liam got back to me and he said,
actually,

215
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:17.680
I never put the apps on my phone.
After that week,

216
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.190
I just decided that I liked things better without them.

217
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.510
So here's what he told me.

218
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.290
<v 4>I'm currently on an incredible trip to Europe and I've stayed off Facebook this</v>

219
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:31.240
whole time.
Every time I pound you're posting a photo from my adventures,

220
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:33.090
I think about how I keep checking to.

221
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.050
He liked it and I think about how seeing other people's adventures on Facebook

222
00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:42.880
nine times out of 10 and doesn't making me feel depressed by comparing my life

223
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.830
to my perception of theirs.

224
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.930
There's something about sharing my life very sparingly now that makes my

225
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:52.540
experience a little richer and more introspective.

226
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.270
<v 0>So I was like,
okay,
Liam's the extremist.
Of course he's going to be all dramatic.</v>

227
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.850
He's an actor in la by the way,
so of course there's drama there,

228
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.170
but it turns out a lot of people made changes that stuck with them.

229
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.880
Okay,
note to self.

230
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.170
My name is Naomi and I did the bored and brilliant projects back in 2015.

231
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.180
One thing I did was delete the Facebook app on my phone and two years later I

232
00:14:17.181 --> 00:14:18.620
still don't have it.
And you send,

233
00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:21.320
they studied the use meals as my boy them tights.

234
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.660
It feels a little uncomfortable,

235
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.050
but I think letting my thoughts run though is important to take charge of my

236
00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:27.884
life.

237
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.630
I leave the phone downstairs and turned off and when I go on walks with my wife,

238
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.523
I don't even bring it.

239
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:38.530
I deleted the Instagram APP because I was noticing every time I logged on I

240
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:44.690
would get kind of a stomach ache,
like that anxiety stomach gig.
And I thought,

241
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.080
I don't need this as a time waster and it doesn't bring me joy.

242
00:14:48.081 --> 00:14:52.640
So I'm deleting it.
But I just want to tell you one of my favorite stories.

243
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.630
This is from Vanessa in Wisconsin.
So the bored and brilliant project happened.

244
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:57.950
She was going through a breakup.

245
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.760
She had to decide what she was going to do about the farm that she owned with

246
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:03.060
her partner.
Um,

247
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.400
she did the project and then at the end she decided that she bought her,

248
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.390
they broke up,

249
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:13.450
she bought the farm full of outright and then decided that she needed to do

250
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:17.990
something with the farm for the community.
So she renamed it,
make time farm.

251
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:18.831
And now,

252
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:22.850
once a month she has a day where she invites people to come and just kind of

253
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.970
hang out.
There's a basket if they want to put their phone in their people,

254
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:30.530
bring their sewing machine there.
Watercolor,
they do all kinds of things.

255
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:34.550
They nap.
I would like to go to Vanessa's farm and take a nap.
That would be nice.

256
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.990
They also like think about like goal setting and things like that.

257
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:42.140
So Vanessa sort of decided that this was something that she wanted to have in

258
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:45.470
her life and for the community,
which was great.
Um,

259
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.140
and so now with the book,

260
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.460
I am reaching a whole different category of people who,
um,

261
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.990
it's interesting.
What kind of reactions?
Some people are podcasts,

262
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:00.260
people who know the show and know sort of the things that we talk about on the

263
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:02.880
show,
which are a lot of ethics related.
Um,

264
00:16:02.881 --> 00:16:04.550
and other people have never heard of it at all,

265
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:07.790
but this is something that's sort of been on their mind and they want to
explore.

266
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.511
Um,

267
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:13.511
so I'm going around the country and I'm having lots of fun and I'm making people

268
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:17.540
take selfies because as I said,
this is not an all or nothing sort of thing.

269
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.620
There are moms going out drinking before they come to hang out with me,

270
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:24.260
which has been great.
And I thought this review,

271
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:28.160
it's really funny that this could do for unplugging what Marie Kondo is the life

272
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:32.570
changing magic of tiding up did for decluttering.
Um,
I mean,

273
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:35.420
I love that.
That would be great if I was as big as Marie Kondo.

274
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.890
But to me what's more interesting is really since I finished writing this book,

275
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.080
um,
a lot has changed in this country.

276
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:47.081
It is really hard not to continually refresh the headlines or Twitter just asked

277
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:49.430
the president.
Um,

278
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.170
but I think perhaps it's time for us to collectively rethink some of our tech

279
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:54.950
habits.

280
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.030
Because the other thing that happens when you ignite the default mode is you do

281
00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.840
empathy.

282
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.590
You imagine what other people around you are thinking and how they're feeling.

283
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.490
And if there is one thing this country could use right now is a little empathy,

284
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.360
um,

285
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.360
and some creative problem solving to sort of find solutions to some huge

286
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.700
economic,
racial and environmental issues.

287
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.700
And so I think particularly for young people to understand that a quickness

288
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.910
isn't necessarily a virtue.
Um,

289
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.670
or as the ex checker of the Bank of England said,

290
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.770
he's worried that quick thinking could make for slow growth.
So this is not just,

291
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.260
um,
a,
you know,
self-helpy sort of thing.

292
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:40.160
But I think really an economic thing that we need people to take a minute and

293
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:44.060
let a mediocre idea that they might want to share.

294
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.200
Just sit on it for a little while,
let it turn into something bigger,

295
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.600
let it turn into big solution.
Um,

296
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.820
which a lot of young people are not used to doing.
Um,

297
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.510
so I'm just telling people to get bored.

298
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:01.500
That's all I want them to do on this big a book tour that I'm on right now.

299
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.860
And,
um,
you heard about the podcast,

300
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.500
you've heard about my listeners experience some of the new people that I'm

301
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:11.640
meeting and I would love to talk to you guys because you're the first tech

302
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:14.130
company that I've gone to to make this presentation.

303
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:18.840
So I would love to hear like what your thoughts are on this,
your comments,

304
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.920
any questions,
um,
personal experience.
That would be great.

305
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.210
And thank you for having me.

306
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.803
<v 5>Great.</v>

307
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.290
<v 6>Mike over here is open for questions for anyone who would like,</v>

308
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.500
<v 0>I also love,
I mean,
I'm sure you're all like,
oh my God,
another anti-tech person.</v>

309
00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:41.600
But like,
really,
I really want to hear what you guys think.

310
00:18:41.601 --> 00:18:45.320
One of the people in the book is a Tristan Harris.
Have you heard of,

311
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:50.270
he was a Google ethicist for a little while and now he's created his own sort
of,

312
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.370
I'm starting to think about ways that the tech could build in ways of making

313
00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:58.200
people communicate more.
Um,

314
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.630
sort of in tune with sending expectations of other people.

315
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.580
So I'd love to know what you guys think.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay.

316
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.700
<v 6>So I would be,</v>

317
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.660
I'd be curious to know how much this affects someone's work life balance if

318
00:19:13.971 --> 00:19:17.810
they're checking their work email and other work applications on the phone.

319
00:19:17.811 --> 00:19:21.480
And I wondered if you looked into that.
Um,
definitely.
Yeah.
So,
um,

320
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.630
there's one chapter in particularly in particular focused

321
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.830
<v 0>on workplace reasons because what I hear from a lot of people who come to these</v>

322
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:31.110
events as they're like,
well,
I work in social media.

323
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:35.910
How am I supposed to take time off?
Um,
so from a personal perspective,

324
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.710
I think having in the book,
I really tried to lay out how,
um,

325
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.210
being productive we have to reimagine what being productive is.
So for my,

326
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:49.770
in my own personal,
uh,
when I'm riding the subway home,
I used to think like,

327
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.820
great,
this is my time to just jam through email,
right?
Like I'm going to hit it.

328
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:56.190
But now I realize,
actually,
no,

329
00:19:56.191 --> 00:20:01.020
this is 30 minutes of me where I can actually do some solid thinking about

330
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:05.340
something that's been bothering me all day long or a work issue that I haven't

331
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:08.490
had time to sort of really drive into.

332
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:13.491
So I've had to rethink what productivity actually means and what I'm hoping.

333
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.603
So.

334
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:19.320
So there's a whole chapter about specifically how we define productivity and

335
00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:24.260
problem solving and um,
and then there's also,
um,
uh,

336
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.360
so,
so the,
the challenge that day is to take a vacation,

337
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.370
which is to reset the expectations of the people who are hoping to hear from
you.

338
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:35.790
Right?
Because I think that's the other thing that we've found is that we're,

339
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:39.000
when we're waiting in line for coffee,
you're like,
oh,
this is an opportunity,

340
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:43.740
these two minutes or an opportunity to show my spouse how I'm thinking of them

341
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:45.600
or that I'm on top of like,
you know,

342
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:49.550
what's for dinner or my coworkers that I know that we,

343
00:20:49.551 --> 00:20:51.680
we needed to follow up on x.
Um,

344
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.850
so resetting expectations by setting outgoing messages,

345
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:58.780
which I think a lot of people don't do.
Um,
and so I tell people like,
you know,

346
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.090
even if it's for a half an hour,
it's if,

347
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.990
if your outgoing message says I'm working on something,
um,
and,

348
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:06.670
and that's why you're not hearing from me.

349
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.310
It's resetting their expectations and other people are like,

350
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:11.560
my boss will never accept that.
And I'm like,
okay,

351
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:14.560
so you have a stomach virus for one hour.
You know what I mean?

352
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:16.960
Like do what you gotta do.
Cause it's really important.

353
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.570
But then the other thing that I've done is I joined a silent workspace.
We're um,

354
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.270
there's no talking,
there's no eating.
So no crinkle crinkle with like,

355
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:28.420
I love my snacks,
but none of that.
And for me,

356
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:32.260
like I realized the most important work I do every week is my writing,
right?

357
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:35.650
So I need,
and I know that I need that three to four hours.
It's really,

358
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.550
I've tried to write the show and last or I've tried to do it while I'm jumping

359
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:43.390
in and out of meetings.
It doesn't work.
I need the three to four hours.

360
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.340
And so I joined this workspace.

361
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.220
I don't get there more than like once or twice a week,

362
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.380
but I think it's worth it for me.

363
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:55.381
So my fantasy is that every company has a silent workspace where,

364
00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.090
you know,
it's seen as productive that you're going in there and not talk.
Yeah,

365
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.340
right.
We are with clapping in the front.
Wouldn't that be amazing?

366
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.330
Like if you were like,
no,
I've got serious work to do and my,

367
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.270
because I don't know about you guys,
but like in my office,
first of all,

368
00:22:10.271 --> 00:22:12.760
radio people,
oh my God,
they never stopped talking.

369
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.310
And there's a lot of this like,
oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

370
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:19.150
I'm totally interrupting you.
And then they start talking and you're like,
no,

371
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:22.210
like I'm,
I'm,
yes,
you were interrupting me.

372
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:26.380
So that's my big fantasy.
And like Susan Cain,
she's,

373
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.290
I definitely quote her in the book,
the quiet revolution,

374
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.410
but I think we need to codify it and,
and it's not just for introverts.

375
00:22:33.411 --> 00:22:37.330
It's extroverts need to like,
be quiet and do the hard work too.
Um,

376
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:38.530
so does that,

377
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.250
<v 6>lots of thoughts.
I think it makes a lot of sense.
Uh,
the,
uh,</v>

378
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:47.170
one of the things I found was I recently took my corporate account off of my

379
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:51.220
phones.
I just have my personal account on those benches.
And how's that go?
I,

380
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.350
I was,
um,
I had difficulty with it at first because it was something I was just

381
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.140
constantly,
you just trust him to having their on them on the phone.

382
00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:00.340
But I found that a,

383
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:04.150
my battery lasts longer on the fund is not constantly updating high volumes of

384
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.230
email be,

385
00:23:05.231 --> 00:23:10.030
it's something where I don't just compulsively start checking the work email and

386
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.830
getting engaged in,
in to the workload related tasks.

387
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.620
<v 0>I'm kidding.
I'm so guilty.
Like,
I mean,
I always use thinking about my podcast.</v>

388
00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:20.660
It's all I do.
And if it were up to me,

389
00:23:20.661 --> 00:23:25.520
I'd be emailing and pinging my producers all day long and like,

390
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.370
you know,
I gotta like walk the talk here,
right?

391
00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:33.371
So I try to save up and like make my communication with them meaningful and

392
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.140
constructive as opposed to like,
what do you guys think about Yada Yada.
Um,

393
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.710
Gloria mark that wonderful informatics professor.

394
00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:42.770
You guys were like the only audience I think I've ever had that actually knows

395
00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:46.820
what an informatics person is.
By the way.
Um,
she tried out,

396
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:47.870
was kind of cracked me up.

397
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.760
She tried out a Japanese many Japanese zen garden.

398
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.380
Where is she in an office where everybody had a mini Japanese zen garden.

399
00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:01.900
And depending on the formation of the rocks,
it indicated to your,
um,

400
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:06.200
coworkers whether you were in deep work or whether you were willing to be in

401
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:11.090
conversation.
So my team got me a mini zen garden.
It doesn't work,

402
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:16.070
but,
um,
it looks pretty though.
Um,
but Tristan,
the person that I mentioned,

403
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:19.300
he was talking about this idea of like,
what if we could have,
um,

404
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.390
Google docs where you had like a pause button that was like,
Hey,

405
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.790
I'm in the middle of working on this.
Give me an I'll pay,

406
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.420
it'll ping you when I'm ready for you to come and look what I do.

407
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.020
Because as a podcast person,
we run on Google docs.

408
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:37.280
I mean everything is in Google docs and it drives me bananas when I'm in the

409
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:38.330
middle of writing something.

410
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:42.920
And I see my producers face show up and like get outs,
I am doing something here,

411
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:45.380
you know,
but how do you like,
Hey,

412
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.740
can you come back later basically is what I have to say.

413
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:51.380
So it'd be so nice to like snooze it or something or,

414
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.200
and I think it's resetting expectations.
You know,

415
00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.070
<v 6>one final question about this is are there any companies that you're aware of</v>

416
00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:05.071
that are doing the analytics feedback to the employees so that they are given a

417
00:25:07.421 --> 00:25:11.530
nudge to,
to separate their work life?
Um,

418
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.540
environment?

419
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.540
<v 0>Yeah,
so the,</v>

420
00:25:13.541 --> 00:25:17.550
the big example that I use is Boston consulting group where they did,

421
00:25:17.551 --> 00:25:22.050
it was part of a study that was done by Leslie Leslie Perlow at Harvard where

422
00:25:22.051 --> 00:25:27.051
they tried different ways of setting up groups where one person was in a group,

423
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.000
um,
was told to take time off,
like specifically.
And they were told to like,

424
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.700
like cook,
hang out with your family.

425
00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:39.900
And they knew that another group member was covering for them.

426
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:45.200
And BCG had been experiencing really rapid turnover and burnout.

427
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.750
And so they want it to see if this would make a difference in their retention

428
00:25:48.751 --> 00:25:53.310
levels went way up.
Um,
so that's the example I use.

429
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:58.320
Um,
I think there are,
I don't know a ton of people trying it out,

430
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.820
but um,
but I think if we start to think of it as a way to,

431
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.930
you know,

432
00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.960
cut back on costs because we don't have to hire as many people deal with the

433
00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:10.260
burnout that so many places are seeing because we're working all the time.

434
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.770
But also think of it as like,
you know,
working smarter,

435
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.500
not necessarily harder.

436
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.470
So thanks for your question.

437
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.830
<v 6>So I'm also guilty of the,
of,</v>

438
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.240
I call it like micro efficiency where I tried to extract every thing I can at

439
00:26:27.241 --> 00:26:28.830
every minute of the day.
I love that.

440
00:26:28.831 --> 00:26:33.270
Can I use that micro efficiency and a as kind of last year as a way to kind of

441
00:26:33.271 --> 00:26:36.360
help myself,
um,
not do that anymore is a,

442
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.110
I joined the meditation group at Google and they encourage that by donating

443
00:26:40.111 --> 00:26:44.010
money,
mangoes in the book.
Oh really?
Yeah,
totally.
He's been on the

444
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.100
<v 0>show.
He's awesome.
I asked my question was,
um,</v>

445
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.230
do you do in the course of writing the book,

446
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.970
did you find that meditation also helped with this with increasing creativity

447
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.890
and kind of,
yeah.
So if I pause for a little bit,
it's a different thing.
Um,

448
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.530
meditation ignites in different parts of the brain.

449
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.510
It is completely different than the mind wandering part.
Um,

450
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.590
so the mind wandering thing is when you are doing nothing.

451
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:13.890
So it could be like repetitive folding of laundry,
um,

452
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.640
or it could be walking to work or something that doesn't require active focus on

453
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:18.930
what you're doing.
Um,

454
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:22.560
the idea with meditation is that there's active focus on thinking about nothing,

455
00:27:22.561 --> 00:27:25.890
right?
Or the clearing of the mind.
That is what you are focused on.

456
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:27.270
And so that is its own thing.

457
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:32.271
But this is truly letting the mind wandering part goes into daydreaming and it

458
00:27:32.581 --> 00:27:35.850
can also go to some bad places.
I mean,
let's make no mistake,

459
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.120
just because you let your mind wander,
it doesn't mean like,
Holy Shit,

460
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:42.200
you have the next great startup idea,
right?
It's,
um,

461
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.230
there's a dis dysphoric thinking,
which was a rumination,

462
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:50.430
which is going to be me tomorrow going over this talk and how some of the

463
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.440
PowerPoint slides fired themselves and how much that annoyed me and thinking it.

464
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:57.360
And you know,
if only I could go back to Google and give that talk over,
you know,

465
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.730
I'm going to be thinking about that.
Okay.
So that's not good.

466
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.800
Then there's also the distraction kind,

467
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:06.080
which is people who just ping all over the place when your mind is wandering.
Um,

468
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.470
I'm certainly guilty of that as well.
But then there's the,
the wonderful kind,

469
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.510
which is positive,
constructive mind wandering.

470
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:16.560
This was a Jerome singer who did some of the most,
the,
the deep,
uh,

471
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.670
pioneering work on mind wandering and that is when we start to do that wonderful

472
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:23.310
constructive type of mind wandering.
Um,

473
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.370
but teen maintain the guy who you,
I think you're,
um,

474
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.710
referring to who started the Google,
um,
inside yourself.
Of course.

475
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.890
Is that something that like everybody knows about it?
Google or is that like,

476
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.380
yeah,
say that again.
Oh,
okay.

477
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:46.290
Okay.
Have any of you done it?
Anyone?
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.

478
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:50.130
So the sense I got is like,
it's relatively popular.
Um,

479
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.390
so he talks about the different kinds of meditation that there are.

480
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.310
And I think if you're getting positive benefits from those and um,
it's,

481
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.840
it's great.
I mean,

482
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:05.070
no reason not to continue to do it and this would just mind wandering would be a

483
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:08.670
separate but also equally wonderful time.
Nice.
Cool.
Thanks.

484
00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.510
<v 7>So this idea of kind of default mode and in urological basis for this is really</v>

485
00:29:14.511 --> 00:29:19.250
interesting.
So I'm curious,
I guess,
what is the sort of definition of boredom?

486
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.150
So like for example,

487
00:29:20.151 --> 00:29:23.240
the experience of like walking down a nice trail is very different from the

488
00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:25.720
experience of,
you know,
walking down New York City or yes,

489
00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.950
even running versus walking,
if you will,
kind of different.

490
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.250
So I'm curious if there's certain activities or environments that are more

491
00:29:31.251 --> 00:29:34.940
boring than others or matters.
So I got a lot of pushback,
right?

492
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.730
<v 0>Um,
when I first used the word boredom on the show,
people were like,</v>

493
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:43.840
can you call it something a little nicer,
please?
Like daydreaming?
And I was like,

494
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:45.850
no,
actually,
um,

495
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.110
boredom is the perfect word because I think that is really what we're seeing is

496
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:54.460
that why,
why do we distract ourselves?
Because we feel uncomfortable.
Um,

497
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.590
and if you look at the history of boredom,
it's,

498
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.710
I mean there's a really nerdy chapter on that too,

499
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:03.460
which is that the word didn't appear until 1853,

500
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.060
Charles Dickens' bleak house boredom and it makes sense,
right?

501
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:11.740
Industrial Revolution.
People have more free time,
they have time to be bored.

502
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.870
Um,
but if you look back even further,
Kierkegaard preferred the word idol.
Uh,

503
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:20.700
the French called it on.
We,
uh,
hi.

504
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.700
I'm thinking of other philosophers who described it as this sort of existential

505
00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:27.610
angst that we have.
What,
what is my purpose here on earth?

506
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:31.990
Heidegger in particular.
Um,
so for me,
using the word bored,

507
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:37.150
I think there are those of us who find mind wandering.
Wonderful.

508
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:39.820
Or maybe we used to think it was boring,
but now we think it's great.

509
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.840
I think parents in particular who are,
you never have time to get born like it.

510
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.913
Um,

511
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.820
but I really specifically wanted to use that word because I think some people,

512
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:50.920
particularly I see this with young people,

513
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.250
think that they can skip straight to the good original thinking stuff.

514
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:56.980
That there's like an Apple's going to drop on their head and they're going to

515
00:30:56.981 --> 00:31:01.570
have a great idea.
And I feel like,
no,
actually you're going to,

516
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:03.760
it's going to hurt.
It's going to be painful.

517
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:07.360
It's going to suck until the good stuff comes.
Um,

518
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.250
I gave the book earlier this summer to a chemistry major,

519
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:16.260
a student at American University and had him record his experience and you hear

520
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:19.750
him just like,
oh my God,
I don't want to do this.
I really don't want to do this.

521
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.140
Just really struggling.
I don't recognize this feeling.

522
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.190
Normally I would just look at my phone whenever I have these feelings and then

523
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:29.050
you get to like day five,

524
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:34.570
and he goes for this walk in Rock Creek Park and he,
he's like,

525
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:38.680
I'm just going to do it.
I'm just going to succumb to the mind wandering.

526
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.350
And he comes up with this amazing idea,
um,

527
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.560
related to solar panels and the home town that he grew up in in Puerto Rico,

528
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:51.510
which has a disproportionate amount of churches that have a lot of roof,
uh,

529
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.930
square footage that could be,

530
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.930
I mean he just goes off on this crazy tangent and like,

531
00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:01.630
like what kind of heard like an epiphany happening on there.
So I think,
um,

532
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.140
particularly teenagers said to me when they did it like,
oh,

533
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:09.370
I don't like this feeling.
I don't recognize it.
I was like,
yeah,
that's boredom.

534
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.720
So just like stick with it,
lean into it.
Um,

535
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.310
but it's however you kind of define it,
um,

536
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.200
it's as personalized as your homescreen,
I would say.

537
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:27.060
Anybody else?
All right,
well thank you so much for joining us and sharing.

538
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.030
Yeah,
it was a pleasure.
Um,
anybody thinks that,
I mean I really want to know,
like,

539
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:34.330
do you think this is total bullshit?
Like I really,
really like,

540
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:37.810
I'm really open to it.
Um,
cause I think,
you know,

541
00:32:37.811 --> 00:32:40.550
I was at Powells last night in Portland and I was like,
oh,

542
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:43.130
I'm going to Google to tomorrow.
And some people in the audience were like,

543
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.710
I was like,
Whoa,
really?
Should I be nervous?
But then I had a lot of,
um,

544
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.000
like a guy from apple came up afterwards and was telling me about all these

545
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:57.410
great hacks that he has to like keep people from bugging him on his phone.

546
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.330
I was like,
dude,
you should tell us.

547
00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:02.810
I didn't know that you could do like some of the things that you're telling me,

548
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.950
like we should all know about these little hacks because I think it would make

549
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:11.600
people feel a lot better about their tech use.
I mean,
I love my phone,

550
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.860
I love my phone,

551
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:18.220
but I see that it really plays into some of my weaknesses.

552
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.513
My,
my,

553
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.840
I'm a human and I am deeply flawed and my phone knows it and it just knows how

554
00:33:23.841 --> 00:33:26.330
to like bring it out in me.
So,
um,

555
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.860
so it's been a really interesting conversation that I'm having with people and,

556
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.460
and I'm really grateful for any feedback you can give me.
I really am.

557
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.970
So thanks again for having me.
I'm going to hang out.

558
00:33:37.971 --> 00:33:39.410
If you have something and you're like,
don't want,

559
00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:41.570
if you don't want to shame me in front of your colleagues or something like
that,

560
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:42.404
that's cool too.

561
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.400
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>
