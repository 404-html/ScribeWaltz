1
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.650
Thank you,
Gretchen,
for making time for us.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.680
<v 2>Well,
thank you so much.
I wish I could take credit for the timing.</v>

3
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:15.480
I mean I guess in a,
in a more subtle way,
I can in a,

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:20.481
in a way that coming forward 15 months ago has started this floodgate of other

5
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.060
women feeling the confidence and the bravery and the courage to do the same.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.790
<v 0>Okay.
Yeah.
So,
um,
I don't know if we,
I imagine maybe,
maybe not,
we have a,</v>

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.700
some Fox News viewers in the room or watching on live stream,

8
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.380
but for those who had didn't watch Fox,
um,

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.300
and this is really maybe your first time seeing Gretchen.
Can you tell everyone,

10
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.150
um,
you know what motivate you?
Write the book.

11
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:46.920
Obviously last year you were in the middle of a crazy media storm and now here

12
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.040
you are,
um,
you know the public face of this issue.

13
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.540
<v 2>So after I jumped off the cliff by myself on July six,</v>

14
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:58.541
2016 where my story broke and I filed a lawsuit against my former boss at the

15
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.190
company where I was working.
I mean,

16
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:05.630
I had no idea what would happen to me the next minute or the next day.

17
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.760
So it was really an out of body experience as it started to unfold and develop

18
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:15.450
really quickly with the results of my boss Pitney,

19
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.010
I'm being forced from the company and other women coming forward.

20
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.140
I could have never ever predicted that.

21
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.580
And also it started having it at the same time was that I started hearing from

22
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:29.060
thousands of women all across the country who started sharing their own personal

23
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.370
stories of pain and shame with me as well.

24
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.740
And I soon realized that this was a pervasive epidemic in our country,

25
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.360
that it wasn't just sexual harassment in the television industry or in
Hollywood.

26
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.400
This was from all walks of life,

27
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:47.060
from single moms who are working two jobs to make ends,

28
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:52.040
me as a waitress,
to members of our military,
to teachers,

29
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.510
to accountants to,
I mean it was every profession.

30
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.250
I grew up in the Midwest where my parents always encouraged me to write back to

31
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.230
people and correspond and write thank you notes.

32
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:04.670
So I started responding to all these women.

33
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.180
And what I found out was that they all felt so grateful that I was giving them a

34
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.780
voice because nobody had ever listened to them or to their story.

35
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.330
And from that,
I felt a sense of duty to put together a book,

36
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.520
not only to honor these voiceless women,

37
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.420
but also to give practical advice and move the ball forward on this issue.

38
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.830
And look where we are today.
You know,
in a short period of time,

39
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.460
as you just said,
this is the national dialogue right now.

40
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.920
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
so I know you can't discuss the specifics of your time at Fox,</v>

41
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:43.000
but can you take us a little bit inside your state of mind?
Um,
the,

42
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.430
when you filed the lawsuit against Roger Ailes,

43
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.050
who we should remember was the most powerful man in media.

44
00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:52.960
He had helped elect three presidents,
uh,

45
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.540
was a kingmaker in the Republican Party,
uh,

46
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.030
and presided over a ruthless.

47
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.980
A media company was known for attacking anyone inside and outside the company

48
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:03.940
who questioned Fox.

49
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:07.840
And here you were going to file a lawsuit naming him personally.

50
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:08.830
What was going through your mind?

51
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.730
<v 2>Well,
courage building is not something that you do overnight.</v>

52
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.550
I think it has a lot to do with how you're raised.
Uh,

53
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.520
fortunately I had parents who told me I could be anything I want it to be every

54
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.640
single day and that helped me to build courage from a young age.

55
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.620
Still when you decide to do something like this,
it's a process.

56
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.100
And the final nail in the coffin for me was when I realized that my job was

57
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:40.801
coming to an end after 25 years in the business and it was coming to an end.

58
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.000
That wasn't my choice to come to an end

59
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.500
that I decided if I don't step up and speak up about this issue and have

60
00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:50.600
conviction on it,
then who else is going to do it.

61
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.540
And most important than me gave,
and you're a new father,
is you know,

62
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:00.680
I have a 12 year old son and a 14 year old daughter and I don't want them to

63
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:04.310
face the same indignities that I've gone through in my career.

64
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.970
And I was shocked that it was,

65
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.040
it was still existing in 2017 but I wanted to eradicate it for them or at least

66
00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:13.664
do my part to do.

67
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.990
<v 0>I think one of the things that was,
um,
unique to your situation is that,
you know,</v>

68
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:22.140
a lot of women when they come forward are worried about their stories being

69
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.880
questioned or shamed or doubted.

70
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.510
And I think what was unique in your situation is that your colleagues,
uh,

71
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:31.170
that there was an orchestrated campaign to discredit your story.
What was that?

72
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:34.470
What did that feel like when people that you worked with were casting doubt on

73
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:35.304
your claims?

74
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.220
<v 2>Well,
you find out who your friends are.
I mean,
not only you know,
coworkers,</v>

75
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:45.420
but you find out in life.
Uh,
it was really fascinating.
You know,

76
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.480
some people who hadn't heard from in 30 years reached out to me.

77
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.290
And that meant a lot to me.
Some people who lived on my street never did.

78
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.710
<v 3>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.250
<v 2>So it was interesting because as time went on,
people would approach me and say,</v>

80
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:00.250
well,
I didn't want to bother you,
or I didn't know what to say.
Yeah.
You know,

81
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:02.740
it's kind of like when somebody dies,
um,

82
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.170
people feel tongue tied and it would have been just nice if they just would have

83
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.950
sent one little line in an email like thinking of you or whatever because trust

84
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:15.980
me,
when you do something like this,
you have a lot of incredibly dark days.
Yeah.

85
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.133
And

86
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.690
the only other thing I would add to either the trolls on social media or however

87
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:26.380
you want to describe those people that you just brought up,
um,

88
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.270
you can't waste too much time worrying about those who malign you.

89
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.040
Because you know,

90
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.160
really what I wanted to do with this mission was moved the ball forward and it

91
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.680
doesn't do any good to sit around and worry about people who said really bad

92
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:41.940
thing.

93
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.940
<v 0>Just this week we had more revelations about Harvey Weinstein,</v>

94
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.540
uh,
other prominent members in Hollywood and your former colleague,

95
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.330
bill O'Reilly,
sorted from the 30,000 foot view.

96
00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:58.160
Where are we in this conversation that,
um,
your,

97
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.470
your book helping your story and now you're booked helping.
Yeah.

98
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.880
<v 2>So I think it's absolutely horrifying that any company would protect a harasser</v>

99
00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:11.700
or a serial harasser for 30 plus years.
Yeah.
I mean,
listen,
you know,

100
00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:15.330
harassers don't continue to be able to do that in the workplace unless they have

101
00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:19.260
help.
So enablers,
lawyers,

102
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.620
assistance.
I mean,

103
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.560
these were all people who helped in the coverup and the shutting up of the

104
00:06:25.561 --> 00:06:29.940
victims.
And we should all believe that that is absolutely outrageous.

105
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.270
So from 30,000 feet,

106
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:36.750
what I'm saying now is that women are finally feeling the courage and the

107
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:41.130
bravery to say enough already.
We're not going to take this anymore.

108
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.480
And looking at that,
me too.
Hashtag for me was just,
I mean,

109
00:06:45.481 --> 00:06:49.610
that was so empowering just for me,
even though the stories were so awful.
Yeah.

110
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.450
It showed that every woman,
number one has a story,
unfortunately,

111
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.290
but also that we're,
we're not ashamed to speak up about it.
Yeah.

112
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.900
And we're shifting the shame from the woman where it never should have been to

113
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:06.450
the harasser where it belongs.
I mean,

114
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:09.450
I've been fascinated by the fact that we're still having this national

115
00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:10.470
conversation.
Yeah.

116
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.390
<v 0>And do you think,
um,
you know,</v>

117
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:16.800
we were just talking before we sat down about Anita Hill and in a certain

118
00:07:16.801 --> 00:07:20.490
respect,
you know,
sexual harassment in the workplace is not a new thing.

119
00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:24.820
It's been something our s our culture has been grappling with for decades.
Um,

120
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.430
but sadly here we are in 2017 and you know,

121
00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:33.060
we realize that someone like Harvey Weinstein,
you know,

122
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:35.730
who was exposed to be a serial Predator,
you know,

123
00:07:35.731 --> 00:07:39.660
quote people knew and this was going on for years and it didn't stop.
I mean,

124
00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:44.520
to me as a reporter,
you know who,
who covered ales,
his downfall and you know,

125
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.140
am always shocked that this behavior could have gone on with such high profile

126
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:51.590
people.
And no one said,
wait a minute,
this isn't right.

127
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.800
<v 2>I know.
In fact,
in Weinstein's contract,</v>

128
00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.050
allegedly the board allowed him to go on harassing.
Yeah.

129
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.470
They knew it was happening and they just said,
well,
if another case comes up,

130
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:08.420
you'll have to pay us a fine.
Let me really,
the board of directors,

131
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.130
by the way,
none of them were women.

132
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:16.170
You allowed that kind of pervasive misogyny to continue

133
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.380
that is absolutely outrageous.
Yeah.

134
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.470
<v 0>I mean that's where as is the focus in my reporting.
A lot of,</v>

135
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.800
a lot of it has been on the,

136
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.840
the systems and the power that allowed this behavior to go on.
And,

137
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:33.700
and at Fox it was,
um,
a lot of it was a system that all set up to,

138
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.030
uh,
silence victims through legal settlements,

139
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.630
out of court settlements and Da's,
which we've talked about.

140
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:45.400
So to me that this is like with the Catholic Church,
um,
abuse scandal there,

141
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:49.960
this is the focus should be on the power,
not,
you know,
not the individuals.

142
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:53.840
It's the system that allowed,
uh,
this abuse to take place.
Um,

143
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.590
can you talk a little bit,
um,
uh,
Riley,
um,
to the degree that you can,
you know,

144
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.640
we learned according to the New York Times that Fox new signed him to a new

145
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:06.780
contract after knowing he made multiple out of court settlements,

146
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:11.550
does that indicate that the company was taking seriously protecting women or

147
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.650
were they willing to look the other way for ratings?

148
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.380
<v 2>So if you read in the newspapers after my story,</v>

149
00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:21.790
there was going to be a new beginning.
Yeah,
and I mean I guess that would,

150
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.590
I'll let you make your own assumption about that since they reassigned him well

151
00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.270
after my story had broken.

152
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.690
You know what I can say about that is that for any company to resign an

153
00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:38.941
individual who had been dismissed for sexual harassment allegations and known

154
00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:43.690
settlements already and then invite him to come back on the air just last month,

155
00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:46.270
that is,
that is absolutely horrifying.

156
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.830
And to think that there was a cleanup on the way I,

157
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.840
I don't think I call that a cleanup

158
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.430
<v 0>and the number itself,
I mean at $32 million private settlement,</v>

159
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.353
I mean that,

160
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.380
I know Riley has been out there saying it's all bs and it's not true.

161
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:03.210
And I think the numbers speaks for itself.

162
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:07.800
I mean nobody spends that amount of money to settle a claim if there's not some

163
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:09.000
merit to it.
And I think

164
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.990
<v 2>that's exactly what I tweeted at night.
You know,
I just said no,
nobody,</v>

165
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:14.010
I don't care how much money you have.

166
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:19.050
Nobody pays $32 million for false allegations.
And it was,

167
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:23.110
I think the most retweeted tweet that I've ever sent.
Yeah.
Entire,
you know,

168
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.930
in my entire life.
I didn't even intend for that.

169
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:29.160
It was just my general reaction that,
you know,

170
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.020
and here's part of the problem,
and I know you know this game,

171
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:32.490
but I want to make sure we're clear about this.

172
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.970
When you sign a settlement or you're forced into arbitration,

173
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:37.440
which is also a secret chamber,

174
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:41.760
these are the two ways in which our country has deemed that we resolve these

175
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:44.010
issues.
They're both in silence,
right.
For Women,

176
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.570
what happens is that the perpetrator can go out and say whatever they want

177
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.273
<v 3>publicly</v>

178
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:56.240
<v 2>and the women can't respond.
So is that fair?</v>

179
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.520
I mean that,
that's just biased.

180
00:10:58.521 --> 00:11:02.780
Like you've never even heard of before where the harasser can go out and say,

181
00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:07.040
we know whatever this is,
you know,
none of the allegations are true and,

182
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.030
and the woman can't speak up because if she does,

183
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.670
then she'll lose the settlement that she received.
Yup.
You know?

184
00:11:15.671 --> 00:11:18.530
Or she'll get in troubles some other way legally.
Yeah.

185
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.210
So it's a flawed system and none of it benefits the women at all.

186
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.280
<v 0>You talk a little bit about that,
we'll circle back to your story,</v>

187
00:11:27.281 --> 00:11:30.400
but you're touching on kind of the public policy aspect of this,

188
00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:34.270
which I find really fascinating in the work that you're doing.
Um,
you know,

189
00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:38.220
to the degree that you know,
there are laws in place,
um,

190
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.940
how can we change the system so that women in the workplace who experienced

191
00:11:42.941 --> 00:11:47.941
harassment have a safe venue to both air these claims and,

192
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.950
um,
get some sort of justice or recourse.

193
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.920
<v 2>So one of the things I on in the book be fierce is should we really have these</v>

194
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:59.290
claims and complaints going to human resources?

195
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.350
And when I started talking about this,

196
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:06.550
I did hear from a lot of great people who work in HR departments.
So I don't,

197
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.100
I don't want to say negative things about all of them cause they said,
look,

198
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:12.580
we're trying to help.
And so I,
I,
I see that.
However,

199
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.790
I think we need to really be cognizant of the fact that when the harasser could

200
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:20.680
be the top person at the country who signing the paycheck,

201
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.560
is it really the safest place to go to HR?
Isn't that a conflict of interest?

202
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.280
I say that it is.
So in be fierce,

203
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:35.230
I advocate a couple of new measures that would maybe help more women to come

204
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:38.590
forward and keep it a more independent process.

205
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.540
So one of them is to hire an ombudsman who would be an independent safe person,

206
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:47.530
maybe even anonymously that you would go to and you wouldn't feel like you're

207
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:51.040
walking down your hallway looking over your back knowing that you just filed a

208
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:55.060
complaint with somebody who many times the HR people go right to the harasser

209
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:59.380
and tell them that you filed a claim to make your life even more miserable.

210
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.340
So that's one thing that I proposed.

211
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:06.610
The second is after the Anita Hill case.

212
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.120
Actually that was the first story I covered as a journalist.
Ironically,

213
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.390
and shortly thereafter I was harassed on the job

214
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:20.210
buy a camera man in a rural part of Virginia who talked to me when we got back

215
00:13:20.211 --> 00:13:23.660
in the car about how I felt when he touched my breasts by putting the microphone

216
00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:24.494
on me.

217
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.100
And I actually envisioned myself rolling out of the passenger side door B,

218
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.930
this is before cell phones because I was so panicked to get away from him.

219
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.100
So I've had other experiences in my life where I was sexually harassed before
my,

220
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.850
my last place of employment.
But basically in a nutshell,

221
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.620
it drains you of all the self confidence you've built up in your entire life to

222
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:52.360
be known as a sex object instead of for your brain and for your,

223
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.343
for your talent.

224
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.270
So what I think happened after Anita Hill is that a lot of companies decided to

225
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.270
incorporate sexual harassment training,
you know,

226
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:02.860
have that be part of their policy.

227
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:05.980
But what I have found out in my research is that a lot of times it's just a

228
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:10.360
cover your ass facade for litigious reasons and otherwise for the company to be

229
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:12.310
able to say,
we provide this.

230
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.050
So one of the things I propose in be fierce is we should really take the focus

231
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:22.051
of sexual harassment training and move it to more bi standard training.

232
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.090
How do we encourage other employees who know that this is happening,

233
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.620
may witness it or have been told by a colleague that it's happening to also have

234
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:37.060
the courage to come forward and not feel that they will also be retaliated

235
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:37.894
against.

236
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.260
We should really refocus the training on how do we celebrate the people who have

237
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:47.260
the courage to come forward and say it's not a safe working environment.

238
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.720
Instead of just focusing on,
hey,

239
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:52.700
here's some case studies of sexual sexual harassment and,

240
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.850
and sign on the dotted line so that we know for sure you came to this training

241
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.730
so that we're off the hook,
right?
I mean,

242
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:03.410
let's really put effort into getting enablers and bystanders to become our

243
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:04.340
allies

244
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.780
<v 0>or in,
in,
in,
in,
in some many cases,
uh,
the harassers themselves,</v>

245
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:12.830
use the HR departments as a foil to say that,
you know,

246
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.140
will no one came forward to make allegations.

247
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:18.530
How could these claims be true because there's never been a formal process.

248
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:19.910
But I think that speaks to,

249
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.890
you know what Gretchen is talking about that a lot of people don't feel that HR

250
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.590
is a safe place to,
to make these claims.

251
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:31.040
So instead they bottle them up and then the only recourse they have is through

252
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:34.460
litigation.
And,
um,
and that obviously has its own

253
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.101
<v 2>problems.
Well,</v>

254
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:39.330
because most of the time you don't take a sexual harassment case to an open

255
00:15:39.331 --> 00:15:40.710
court.
Why?

256
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.630
Because prevalent now in employee contracts are these arbitration clauses.

257
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.140
<v 0>Yeah.
So talk about,
um,</v>

258
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.040
secret corporate courses as you call them and the way in which,
um,

259
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.820
our employment contracts and perhaps a lot of people here at Google have them as

260
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:56.960
well.
Um,

261
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.730
when you work for a big company a and you have a claim that you ha you can't sue

262
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:05.510
them in court,
you have to deal with it in a secret off the record court.

263
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.930
<v 2>Right?
And so this was never the intention of an arbitration clause.</v>

264
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:11.090
When Supreme Court ruled on this over 20 years ago.

265
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.690
It really was to not clog the courts,
uh,

266
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.190
but not intended for sexual harassment claims or discrimination claims.

267
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.310
And then that's where they're being utilized though.

268
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:26.510
So what happens is that you basically sign away your seventh amendment right to

269
00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:29.300
an open Jerry process when you start your job and listen,

270
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:33.320
nobody starts a job and thinks to themselves,
wow,
I expect to get into a dispute.

271
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.430
I mean,
I know I didn't,

272
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.630
but it's a dark day when you find out in a dispute that you can never tell

273
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:46.550
anyone what happened ever.
And that's what arbitration is.

274
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.630
So it's secret first and foremost.
So here's a hypothetical.

275
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.870
The woman's being sexually harassed on the job.
She files a complaint.

276
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.990
They immediately put her into arbitration.
The company's going,

277
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.750
we don't have to tell anyone
the woman loses her job

278
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.910
in arbitration.
You don't get the same amount of witnesses or depositions.

279
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.370
The company usually picks the arbitrator and only 20% of the time does the

280
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:16.700
employee actually win.
And there's no appeal.

281
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.430
Does that sound fair?

282
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.720
So what ends up happening is the woman's out of the job.

283
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.680
She can never tell anyone what happened or that she went through this process.

284
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.600
And the harasser many times gets to stay and nobody knows about it.

285
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.260
And that's been going on for the last couple of decades.

286
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.100
It's why even I didn't realize how pervasive this issue is in the workplace

287
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.870
because we don't hear about these cases.

288
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.530
But the reason we don't hear about these cases is because they're being forced

289
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:49.364
into secrecy.

290
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.730
<v 0>And,
um,</v>

291
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:55.260
when I was reporting on the Fox News sexual harassment scandal last summer,
uh,

292
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:59.960
one of the women I interviewed,
Rudi Bakhtiar,
who was a,
a correspondent,
uh,

293
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.930
at Fox News,
uh,
s years ago,
she broke her NDA.
And,
um,

294
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.030
she was very courageous.

295
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:09.990
She was the first woman to come forward on the record and give an interview to

296
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:14.370
me about her experience of harassment after signing an arbitration settlement.

297
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.780
Um,
and she told me,
uh,
the,

298
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.740
the night before interview that she needed to transfer money to her,

299
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.850
uh,
save at,
you know,

300
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:26.910
basically take all of her life savings and move it to a different bank account

301
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.930
because she was so terrified that Roger Ailes or Fox News would come,

302
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.260
come after her after my,
her interview with me.
Um,

303
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.830
and she thankfully was brave enough to share her story and that really helped

304
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.120
catalyze and,
and uh,
bring the Fox News scandal into the light.

305
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.230
But I think that speaks to the fear that these NDAs have,
um,

306
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.130
that they inspire in,
in victims.
And I guess what I wanted to ask you is,

307
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.910
do you think companies should,
now that we're in the middle of this conversation,

308
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.560
basically say if you've experienced harassment,
um,

309
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.870
we think this is an important public issue to discuss and we should release you

310
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:01.704
from MDA.

311
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.980
<v 2>That would be very big of companies to do that.</v>

312
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.750
I think we should all demand that.

313
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.190
Let me just say a little bit about Rudy because she was so brave and doing that

314
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.280
and she was an amazing reporter.
She was from Iran.

315
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:19.260
She was covering foreign policy,
uh,
for us at Fox and did a great job.

316
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.760
And suddenly she wasn't there anymore.

317
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.750
And I always wondered what happened to Rudy.
You know,

318
00:19:24.751 --> 00:19:28.170
10 years later when she came out to defend me and tell her own story,

319
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:30.990
I guess I found out what happened to Rudy.
And she's just,

320
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.280
I tell that story because she's the microcosm of the macrocosm of all these

321
00:19:35.281 --> 00:19:40.281
women who've had the American dream taken away from them for no reason except

322
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:44.580
because of some random jerk.
And,

323
00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:48.450
and that's why we should all be concerned about this as far as Ndas.

324
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.930
There's now a national call for the Weinstein Company and for other companies to

325
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:55.650
release women from them.

326
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.300
I urge all of you to join that mission.
Um,

327
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.380
because I'm not asking for businesses to not have NDAs for business secrets.

328
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.030
We all understand that.

329
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.470
I feel comfortable signing an NDA that I'm not going to talk about,
you know,

330
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:18.471
some new technology that you're developing or some big news story that we were

331
00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:21.900
only privy to at our place of employment.
That makes sense,

332
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.940
but not about issues that are violating a human being.

333
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.730
So I think that we should all have a national call for Ndas to not exist

334
00:20:33.731 --> 00:20:35.730
anymore.
Let's see if companies will do it.

335
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.730
<v 0>Yeah.
But I agree.
I mean I think companies have twisted,
uh,
the,</v>

336
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.530
the use of Ndas to cover up,
you know,
violations of human rights rather than,

337
00:20:44.531 --> 00:20:47.980
you know,
protecting corporate secrets or trade practices.
That's,
yeah,

338
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:51.850
I think that clearly is something that hopefully would galvanize support.
Um,

339
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.180
I want to talk about,
circle back to Kinda your story.
Cause I think,
um,

340
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.490
I've had the privilege of learning more about you and your life and for all of

341
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:04.750
you out there,
I mean,
Gretchen is a remarkably impressive woman.
Uh,

342
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:08.480
she was trained as a concert violinist,
uh,

343
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.500
and she was obviously famously Miss America and she went to Stanford University.

344
00:21:13.571 --> 00:21:16.570
I mean,
she is somebody who has set her goals on things and achieve them.

345
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:21.571
And I want to talk about how you approached your lawsuit and making sure that

346
00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:27.970
your claims would be serious and taken seriously and to advice you have for

347
00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:31.300
other women who are possibly thinking about coming forward,

348
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.830
what steps they can take to make sure that they're protected and find,

349
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.820
sort of be disciplined in how they do it.

350
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.030
<v 2>Well,
thank you for bringing that up by the way.
We should mention that.
Um,</v>

351
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.320
I was always forbidden from ever knowing Gabe.

352
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.340
I was never supposed to ever meet Gabe.
No.
Gabe was,
um,

353
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.920
cause he was doing a lot of investigative work and I do think it's ironic that

354
00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:54.940
we have become friends.
Yeah.
Um,

355
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.950
whoever thought I'd be sitting on stage with Gabe Sherman.
Um,

356
00:21:57.951 --> 00:21:59.270
so that in and of itself,

357
00:21:59.271 --> 00:22:04.100
thank you gain for all the work that you have that you have done in chapter four

358
00:22:04.101 --> 00:22:05.210
of my book.
Be Fierce.

359
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.590
I want it to make sure that I laid out a playbook for women and for men who go

360
00:22:09.591 --> 00:22:13.940
through this.
So it's my 12 point plan.
I don't think it's ever been done before.

361
00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:17.570
And what I'm encouraging women to do is just take it right out of the book and

362
00:22:17.571 --> 00:22:18.650
put it in your back pocket.

363
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:24.610
Because oftentimes what happens to women in these situations is we think we can

364
00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:29.150
beat this if we just work harder,
we think the harassment will stop.

365
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.180
They'll finally really appreciate us for our brains.

366
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.700
And so we keep persevering and we keep persevering and putting up with it.

367
00:22:37.701 --> 00:22:41.030
And one day we finally just combust and we might go file a complaint.

368
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.030
And you know what the problem with that is?
We don't have a plan.

369
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.560
So my playbook is a plan.

370
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.920
You can't put the genie back in the bottle once you go and make that complaint.

371
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:56.080
I'll tell you my,
my top three things in the plan of 12 points.
Number one,

372
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.730
you have to call a lawyer first.

373
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.280
There are resources in the back of my book that can show you exactly where you

374
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:05.530
can call somebody.
They'll take a call for 10 minutes,

375
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.850
tell them what your situation is.

376
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.970
They'll let you know the laws in your state because they're different.

377
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:15.700
And what your statute of limitations are and also other really important things

378
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:19.730
like can you have evidence,
can you record?
You know,

379
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.720
in 11 states it's illegal to one party consent record,

380
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.490
so you need to know what the laws are in your state.
Number two,

381
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.340
document,
document,
document,
document.

382
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.360
I talked to a bunch of women in my book who had done just that.

383
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.060
They wrote a journal about what was happening to him.
They saved emails,

384
00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:41.480
they save texts so that they had evidence and then they were fired and they

385
00:23:41.481 --> 00:23:45.740
couldn't go back to their office where they kept all that stuff.
So it home.

386
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.480
Number three,
I know it's so hard,

387
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.530
but tell at least to trusted colleagues because you're going to need the

388
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:58.160
witnesses.
We still live in a,
he said,
she said culture,

389
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.090
even though we've seen a lot of change over the last 15 months that I'm so

390
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:06.410
appreciative of your still not going to be believed and you're probably going to

391
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:09.470
be called a liar and a troublemaker and you just can't take a joke.

392
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.790
So tell to trusted colleagues and I would recommend telling a man,

393
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.270
because I hate to say it,
that's going to probably carry more weight.

394
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.200
If in fact the man says I saw it or I heard it or she told me on December 5th,

395
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.080
2017 that this happened to her,

396
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.280
at least then you have people you know,

397
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:39.410
defending you instead of feeling like you're 100% alone.
Anyway,

398
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:43.220
there are nine other tips that are in chapter four,
my playbook,
uh,
be fierce.

399
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:45.920
I think it's essential that you know,

400
00:24:45.921 --> 00:24:50.420
women and men get this into their hands and that you pass along this same gift

401
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:52.040
of courage to other people that you know,

402
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:54.860
that may be facing any injustice in their life.

403
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.600
This is not just about sexual harassment.

404
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:00.380
This is about being fierce and standing up and speaking up about any way in

405
00:25:00.381 --> 00:25:02.330
which you don't feel you're being treated fairly.

406
00:25:02.331 --> 00:25:07.070
Whether that's pay inequity or bullying in school for our kids or not getting a

407
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:09.470
seat in the boardroom or not getting the promotion you deserve.

408
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.500
This is about a movement of standing up and speaking up for you to be the best

409
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:17.300
person you can be.

410
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.970
<v 0>We've seen obviously the,</v>

411
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.220
the swiftness of the downfall up say a Harvey Weinstein.

412
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.460
Do you think now we're at a place where companies do have a zero tolerance

413
00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:34.060
policy when a powerful executive has been exposed for this behavior or do you

414
00:25:34.061 --> 00:25:39.061
think unfortunately this may be kind of a a fleeting moment and will revert to

415
00:25:39.521 --> 00:25:40.600
the kind of the status quo.

416
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.620
<v 2>I am surprised based on how our new cycles change so quickly now and our</v>

417
00:25:44.621 --> 00:25:49.600
attention spans are so limited that we are still talking about this three weeks

418
00:25:49.601 --> 00:25:50.860
after the Weinstein story broke.

419
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.460
But I am so heartened that we are because it means that all of the work that

420
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.640
I've been doing and others have been doing for the last 15 months,

421
00:25:57.641 --> 00:25:58.600
it's paying off.

422
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.980
You know when you think about cultural shifts with race relations or you know,

423
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.530
gay and lesbian and transgender issues,
they don't have an overnight.

424
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.210
So the idea that we have come this far in 15 months gave,

425
00:26:13.211 --> 00:26:16.330
I mean I really feel,
I tend to be an optimistic person,

426
00:26:16.331 --> 00:26:21.331
but I really think that this is amazing and I don't think we're going to turn

427
00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:25.420
back.
I mean you look at what happened.

428
00:26:25.421 --> 00:26:28.750
Now you have the Amazon studios executives,
you have the other,
you know,

429
00:26:28.751 --> 00:26:31.030
Hollywood director with all those complaints.

430
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:32.990
<v 0>That was,</v>

431
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:37.490
I was just blown away when I saw that La Times headline where the director James

432
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.190
Toe back,
um,
had been accused originally,
uh,

433
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.920
in an article by 30 women.

434
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.770
And then several days later the newspaper had heard from,
uh,
you know,

435
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.940
more than a hundred more.

436
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:52.530
And I think the total was over 202 things as I felt as a reporter that it was

437
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:56.820
shocking that this was out there and he wasn't in jail.

438
00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:59.700
I mean the guy seems like a straight up sexual predator.

439
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.470
And then secondly that now women have the courage to just come forward and call

440
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:09.300
it out.
I think men will not be able to sort of do that.

441
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:14.580
A pervasive,
uh,
behavior without the fear of exposure.
Now.

442
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.320
<v 2>Well in ones who have already done it,
they're in the fetal position.
Right?
Yeah.</v>

443
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.481
You know,
they're,

444
00:27:20.481 --> 00:27:25.460
they're just waiting for the women to be emboldened at their place of
employment.

445
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.240
So I do,
I do see this as a cascading effect.

446
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.300
What my hope is is that media will continue to cover this and cover the stories

447
00:27:35.001 --> 00:27:40.001
of the women that are not famous because that's the majority of the women,

448
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.990
you know,
a young woman in Boise,
Idaho.

449
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.070
You know,

450
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.880
<v 0>talk a little bit about,
um,
some of the women you've heard from,
uh,</v>

451
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.350
who again are everyday Americans working either in the service industry and the

452
00:27:54.351 --> 00:27:57.970
restaurant industry,
um,
and what their experiences have been like in,

453
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.500
and how they've tried to seek justice.

454
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.670
<v 2>Yeah.
So basically all of their stories where nobody would ever listen to him.</v>

455
00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.480
I never had a voice.
Uh,
you know,
I was maligned.
I mean,

456
00:28:07.481 --> 00:28:11.890
it's the same sort of story and I would just wait for it as I would respond to

457
00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:14.650
all of these women and then eventually get on the phone with them for the book

458
00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.640
without failure.
All of them would say,
my industry is an old boys' club.

459
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.640
It didn't matter what it was,

460
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:26.670
even female oriented business areas like retail or the cosmetic industry.

461
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:29.843
<v 3>And</v>

462
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:35.530
<v 2>I think the one thing that they felt so fearful of was can I really come forward</v>

463
00:28:36.621 --> 00:28:40.700
because I need my paycheck?
And one of the questions that really not at me,

464
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.710
Gabe and gave me a lot of sleepless nights was how do I help the single mom who

465
00:28:47.001 --> 00:28:50.600
can't afford to do this?
Right?
It doesn't have the resources that I had,

466
00:28:50.601 --> 00:28:52.670
doesn't have the national platform that I had.

467
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.950
And so through my fund that I've set up gift of courage,

468
00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.220
um,
I've now started the Gretchen Carlson leadership initiative,

469
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.360
which will kick off next month,
November in Dallas Fort Worth.

470
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.710
It's a nine city tour,

471
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.550
three days of workshops in each city for underserved women.

472
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.690
They can come for free and learn about sexual harassment,
domestic violence,

473
00:29:16.691 --> 00:29:21.691
give legal advice and learn how to have a voice civically and politically in

474
00:29:22.091 --> 00:29:22.924
life.

475
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.800
Because what tends to happen when you are going through something like this in

476
00:29:26.801 --> 00:29:29.830
your life,
you feel alone and you feel like you don't have a voice,

477
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.860
not just on that issue.
You feel like you don't have a voice on anything.

478
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:38.380
And I want to be able to provide these women the opportunity to become involved

479
00:29:38.381 --> 00:29:41.860
in their communities and get out of the shadows of a victim.

480
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:47.590
So I'm incredibly proud to be financing that leadership initiative as the start

481
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.320
to helping more women to have a voice.

482
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.171
<v 0>And you know,</v>

483
00:29:52.171 --> 00:29:56.760
obviously we can't have this conversation in a vacuum.

484
00:29:56.761 --> 00:30:01.410
And I think we have to look at,
um,
the national,
um,
uh,

485
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.200
political landscape that we're all living in.

486
00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:07.000
And we have a president of the United States,
um,

487
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.580
who himself has been accused by multiple women,
um,
uh,

488
00:30:11.581 --> 00:30:16.140
very similar types of,
of unwanted advances and himself was caught on tape.

489
00:30:16.141 --> 00:30:20.600
They famous access Hollywood tape,
you know,
boasting about what he does,
uh,

490
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.533
with women.

491
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.260
Are you surprised or I guess what I'm trying to get at is,

492
00:30:27.631 --> 00:30:30.090
do you think,
you know,
the election in November,

493
00:30:30.091 --> 00:30:34.200
was the sort of the last gasp of that old culture where that behavior was,

494
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.280
was tolerated?

495
00:30:35.281 --> 00:30:39.420
Or do you think somehow politics is different than corporate America where

496
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:42.960
people are willing to look the other way because they care about x,
y,

497
00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:44.970
or z issue and they just want to vote for their party?

498
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:45.851
<v 2>Uh,
well,</v>

499
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:50.851
I think that until recently it was similar in the sense that you had a lot of

500
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:54.260
people covering up and also that,
uh,

501
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.410
people put political policies ahead of human decency.
Hmm.
I mean,
for me,

502
00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:01.870
listening to that tape,
sorry,
it was really personal.

503
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.490
<v 0>Well,
you know,
I mean,
you know,</v>

504
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.350
<v 2>I know Donald Trump,
I'd known him for 27 years and,
and you know,</v>

505
00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:08.520
a week after my story broke,

506
00:31:08.521 --> 00:31:13.521
he came out against me and said that from everything he had read

507
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.520
that he didn't believe me.

508
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.820
So it was personal for me when I heard the access Hollywood tape and I feature

509
00:31:23.821 --> 00:31:27.840
actually Natasha Stone off the people magazine writer who accused him of

510
00:31:27.841 --> 00:31:30.360
unwanted advances in my book be fierce.

511
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.520
I felt it was important to give her a voice.

512
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.653
<v 3>Okay.</v>

513
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:39.070
<v 2>You know that access Hollywood tape.
I think if you're a parent,</v>

514
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:44.020
I hope you used it as a teachable moment for your kids.
I know I did for mine.

515
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.210
And again,
forget political policy.

516
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:54.190
It's my opinion that the way in which we treat human beings supersedes that.

517
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.440
And that's all I cared about with that tape.

518
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.960
I wanted my kids to know this is not how you treat people.

519
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.470
Now here's the difference.

520
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.920
When powerful people in private companies are exposed,

521
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.580
they can be fired.

522
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.310
But we can't fire politicians who've been elected.

523
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.510
That's just up for the next vote.
So I guess in a way you can,

524
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:25.450
but um,
it's not something that would happen as swiftly.

525
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.363
So,
you know,

526
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.370
I guess we'll just have to wait and see how this all flushes out and how,

527
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.250
what reaction that will have them on.
See American people.

528
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:34.630
Everyone still has a boat.
Yeah.

529
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.840
<v 0>Um,
so I would love to open it up to the audience.</v>

530
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:43.250
If anyone has questions.
Um,
you can please step two.

531
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:47.870
I think there's two microphones,
um,
and just,
um,
say your name and uh,

532
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:49.910
you're free to ask questions if you have them.

533
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.850
<v 2>There's our first brave soul.</v>

534
00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.220
<v 4>Gretchen,
thank you so much for being here today.</v>

535
00:32:57.221 --> 00:33:01.630
Your words are incredibly inspiring and I'm so appreciative you've taken the

536
00:33:01.631 --> 00:33:05.500
stand to represent women who really do need this voice.
Thank you.

537
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:10.530
One question I had for you in chapter four was the idea of training incivility.

538
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.990
Can you give us some examples of companies that have done this and have been

539
00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:15.760
successful with that effort?

540
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:17.170
<v 2>Um,</v>

541
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:22.170
so there is an international cosmetic company which has really gone way beyond

542
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.320
and being progressive about this bystander training.
Uh,
and,

543
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.020
and that's really what I mean about civility.

544
00:33:29.021 --> 00:33:34.021
It's about let's teach employees what to do instead of what not to do.

545
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.500
Right.
That is the essence of it.
And the interesting thing that I learned from,

546
00:33:38.501 --> 00:33:43.030
from this company was that there's 70% female employed around the world.

547
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.020
And even though they have these incredibly progressive ways to report it,

548
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.130
and once a week this committee gets together and listens to all the complaints

549
00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.770
and they handle them immediately,
but here's what they told me.

550
00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:58.330
They don't really have a lot of sexual harassment complaints and I was like,
wow,

551
00:33:58.331 --> 00:34:01.060
how simple is that?
I said,
why?
They said,
well,

552
00:34:01.061 --> 00:34:03.250
we have 70% of our company is women.

553
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.530
So that led me to really start thinking about,
wow,

554
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.540
wouldn't it be fabulous if we just started employing more women as we should be

555
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:18.610
into these roles and put them into positions of power so that this type of

556
00:34:18.611 --> 00:34:21.880
activity doesn't happen.
You see,
this is how it prospers,

557
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.560
is that we don't have enough women in those positions being able to say,
stop,

558
00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.600
but it's why I'm calling on men,

559
00:34:28.601 --> 00:34:33.601
especially to help us with that because as long as men dominate running the

560
00:34:34.241 --> 00:34:36.340
fortune 500 companies right now,
what is it,

561
00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:40.240
94% we need them and we want them,

562
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:41.920
and by the way in be fierce.

563
00:34:41.921 --> 00:34:46.540
I have an entire chapter on men because I found so many great men already out

564
00:34:46.541 --> 00:34:51.490
there doing fantastic work.
It's my longest chapter.
So most men want to help us.

565
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.650
Most men want a safe work environment for women.

566
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.830
We just have to convince them to take that little extra step of courage and stop

567
00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:04.831
being the bystander and stop being the enabler and help us in and being an ally.

568
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.810
Thank you.

569
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.510
<v 4>Yes.
My name is Kelsey.
I'm,</v>

570
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.920
I just wanted to thank you so much for being here and sharing your story and

571
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.510
sharing us,
telling us how to be fierce,
I guess.
Um,

572
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.880
and you spoke a lot about harassment in the workplace.

573
00:35:18.881 --> 00:35:21.730
Obviously that's what your book is about and that's what your story is.
Um,

574
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.120
and speaking with the women about,
um,

575
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.940
the industry's being a boys club and my experience,

576
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.250
I feel like our society is a boy's club.

577
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.400
And I was wondering if you have any advice or,
um,

578
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.030
for women that are harassed in public on the street?

579
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.180
I know every day I face that and it's really hard to be cat called and harassed.

580
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:46.440
I'm just going home or coming to work or anywhere that I go and then I feel like

581
00:35:46.441 --> 00:35:48.620
I'm losing my power.
And I know that you,

582
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.840
your book is all about taking your power back.
Um,

583
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.790
so I feel safe at work obviously.
Thanks Google.

584
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.010
But what advice do you have for women to take their power back in public or in

585
00:35:59.011 --> 00:35:59.640
the street?

586
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.570
<v 2>Right.
And that happens just because they feel like they can write.
It's like,</v>

587
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:08.660
to me it's the insecurity of that person calling out and trying to take away

588
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:10.800
your confidence.

589
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.590
So I mean it's one of the things that I say in the playbook that you can also do

590
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:16.980
in the workplace is to take offense.
I mean,
not that I'm not a funny person.

591
00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:20.370
Listen,
I like to have more fun than anyone that I,
that I really know.

592
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.720
It's not that I can't take a joke,

593
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.610
it's that you need to take back your self esteem and your pride and just say,
oh,

594
00:36:26.611 --> 00:36:29.130
thank you so much.
I don't really appreciate that though.
I mean,
you can say it,

595
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:31.200
you know,
in a nonthreatening way.

596
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.640
But the other really central thing that I think changes society is the way in

597
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:39.120
which we choose to raise our children.
And at the end of the book,

598
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:40.620
I have a whole chapter on parenting.

599
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.430
And really what I think is crucial is how we raise our sons.

600
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.530
I think it's imperative that we teach gender equality within the family unit,

601
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.440
whether that's a husband and wife together or partners or single parents or

602
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:59.610
whatever the case is.
They're watching us and they're hearing us.

603
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.540
And if you're showing respect for gender at home,

604
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.270
that's what they're going to carry through when they get to the workplace.

605
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.310
So I think it's really central.

606
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:12.060
I think we should be doing sexual harassment training and classes for middle

607
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:15.060
school kids and moving on up into high school.

608
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:18.420
I'm doing a college campus tour with my book be fierce because I think it's,

609
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.190
especially on college campuses,

610
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:24.630
one in five women are going to face sexual assault and what is the Greek system

611
00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:28.620
do?
What kind of messages?
Not to narc on them completely,

612
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:33.030
but what does that teach our young men about how to be,

613
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:36.480
and then they go right from there to the workforce,
you know?

614
00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:41.481
So I really think that getting to our young people is essential and crucial to

615
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.820
moving the needle forward for our ultimate respect for women once we get into

616
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:51.930
the workplace and on the streets.
Thank you.
Thank you Kelsey.
Thanks.

617
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:53.611
<v 5>Hi.</v>

618
00:37:53.611 --> 00:37:57.240
Thank you so much for coming today and for and for so bravely sharing your story

619
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.190
because this is a system that perpetuates in secrecy and shame.
Um,

620
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.460
and I guess I don't know how much you can answer this question and I don't mean

621
00:38:05.461 --> 00:38:09.030
it to sound politically pointed,
but having spent time at a,

622
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:13.620
at a media environment,
which arguably has,
um,

623
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.400
actively perpetuated objectification of women and a very rape,

624
00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:22.401
supportive culture with the active endorsement and promotion of our now

625
00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:26.970
president who's advocated sexual violence against women,
um,

626
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:32.430
how do you reflect on your time and participation in that system and your

627
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:35.080
experience of them being so publicly rejected from it?

628
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:41.500
<v 2>But what I can say is that to a certain extent,</v>

629
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.240
all people can fall into cultish behavior.
I've always been a supporter of women,

630
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.270
always call my mom up.

631
00:38:49.271 --> 00:38:53.500
She used to get so bugged by me calling her early in my career and throughout

632
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:56.830
and saying,
you know,
women aren't paid fairly,
et cetera.
And she'd be like,

633
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:58.990
why do you always have to talk about women's rights stuff?
And I'm like,

634
00:38:58.991 --> 00:38:59.940
because I'm living it.

635
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.840
And then when she started running the company late later in her life in her

636
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.890
sixties and still today at 76 she calls me every day and says,

637
00:39:08.891 --> 00:39:11.610
now I know what you're talking about.
Um,

638
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:15.760
that's the extent of what I can say about my last 11 years.

639
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.750
But please know that I have always been an advocate for women.

640
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.970
<v 0>Well,
you mentioned just a on,
on that point on Twitter,</v>

641
00:39:22.971 --> 00:39:27.230
I think recently I saw you said you don't know what my parameters were.

642
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.460
So I guess that was alluding to how even within the system at Fox you were

643
00:39:31.461 --> 00:39:34.310
trying to carve out your own space.
Yes,

644
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.260
<v 2>you can say that.
Yeah.
Thank you.</v>

645
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.620
<v 4>Hi.
Thank you so much for being here.</v>

646
00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:43.610
Your words are very inspiring and I think we're in a moment right now where more

647
00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:45.230
women are feeling the courage to come forward.

648
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.470
I was struck by your comment around,
um,
you know,

649
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.860
finally the day when you're recognized for your brain's not your beauty.
Right?

650
00:39:51.861 --> 00:39:55.370
And I am sure many women in the room and men can relate to that of being

651
00:39:55.371 --> 00:39:58.500
complimented on your looks instead of your talents.
Um,

652
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.600
I had a colleague toast a big project and in front of 40 people comment on how

653
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.950
good I looked as well as being talented on the project.

654
00:40:06.951 --> 00:40:08.900
And at that moment I realized,
wow,

655
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.970
no one would ever say that to a male colleague.

656
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:14.030
You wouldn't say he's so great at his job and he looks so great,

657
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:15.800
you would never hear that.

658
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.160
So how do you think we can more proactively model emphasizing talents overlooks

659
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.590
in the worth of women in the workplace?

660
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.661
<v 2>I mean,
again,</v>

661
00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:29.230
it starts young gear story reminds me of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand from,

662
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.310
from this state actually.

663
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:33.730
I interviewed her for the book and she was telling me a story about how when she

664
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:38.690
was at her law firm before she ran for office,
that similarly she had,
you know,

665
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.510
won this huge case and at the toast they talked about her great new haircut.

666
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:48.220
Yeah.
She was like,
wait a minute,
I just had this huge win,
you know,

667
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.110
and it was so demoralizing and your,
your self worth just drains,
you know,

668
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.150
in quick fashion.
I don't know,
there,

669
00:40:55.190 --> 00:41:00.190
there's something in our society that doesn't allow us yet to honor a woman who

670
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:03.640
happens to be attractive,
smart and talented.

671
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.590
There must be something wrong with her,
you know?
So we,

672
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.490
we focus then on the looks first.

673
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.790
Now I'm going to be the first to tell you that I think media plays into that.

674
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.590
I don't really watch TV that much.

675
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.640
I just really have been a news junkie and over the last couple of months when I

676
00:41:20.641 --> 00:41:22.710
turn on Primetime TV,

677
00:41:22.711 --> 00:41:25.980
I'm like horrified that my kids might be watching this stuff and the

678
00:41:25.981 --> 00:41:28.800
sexualization of women.
So I think that's where it comes from.

679
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:33.770
And his parents.
I don't know how we completely control,
I mean,

680
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:36.440
you can control it in your house as much as you possibly can,

681
00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:39.170
but they go to school and they do live in the outside world.

682
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.180
And Are we really going to be able to change the imagery that we're putting out

683
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:47.900
to our kids,
not to mention porn.
So to me,

684
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:52.670
the way to really try to combat that is to raise our sons differently.

685
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.470
I come back to that point.

686
00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.510
<v 0>Well,
I,
you know,</v>

687
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:59.490
I just want to jump in on that because I noticed in a lot of the news accounts

688
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.150
of the Weinstein and these other scandals,
you know,

689
00:42:03.151 --> 00:42:06.240
people would come forward and say,
oh,
well for my daughter I'm going to do this.

690
00:42:06.241 --> 00:42:09.030
And as a father of a,
a new daughter,
I think that in it,

691
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.310
I know the intention is there.
But to me,

692
00:42:11.311 --> 00:42:15.960
I also find that language diminishing of women because it shouldn't just be for

693
00:42:15.961 --> 00:42:20.040
daughters.
It should,
I mean,
they're equal to men.
It should be a human issue.

694
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:25.020
Whether you have a son or a daughter,
you should,
I want to raise my,

695
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.381
uh,

696
00:42:25.381 --> 00:42:29.580
my children to be respectful and I'm not speaking out or I don't report on this

697
00:42:29.581 --> 00:42:32.520
issue because I have a daughter.

698
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.070
<v 2>Right?
I mean,
I will give credit to,
uh,</v>

699
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.460
the men who stopped me on the streets of New York and shake my hand and do say

700
00:42:38.461 --> 00:42:40.740
thank you for my daughters.
I think it,

701
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.880
it hits home for fathers more when they hear these stories and they do have

702
00:42:44.881 --> 00:42:45.714
daughters at home and if,

703
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.230
and if that ignites them to be part of this be fierce movement.
Fantastic.

704
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.320
But you're exactly right.
I,

705
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:55.560
I've often said that I worked more for my son than I did for my daughter.

706
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.760
And what I meant by that was that I wanted him to see what I did every day and

707
00:43:02.671 --> 00:43:06.180
respect his eventual female colleagues in the workplace in the same way in which

708
00:43:06.181 --> 00:43:10.370
he looked at his mom.
So I do agree that,

709
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:12.450
that the parody is,
is essential.

710
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.530
And actually more of the focus should be on the sons and the daughters.

711
00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.960
<v 4>So actually I as a mother to a daughter and my question was about,
um,</v>

712
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:26.920
just the conversation with,
with a daughter,
she's eight years old.

713
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.960
And I think one of the most difficult times for me as a parent was election

714
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.200
night.
Just knowing that in the morning I would have to,
you know,

715
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.730
break this news that this like horrible,
you know,

716
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:41.790
bully that she'd come to kind of understand a was now like elected popularly or

717
00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:47.500
not popularly whatever
is the leader I left cause right.

718
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.750
<v 0>Constitutionally he was elected.</v>

719
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.860
<v 4>Yeah.
Well,
uh,
so I had to explain all this to her.</v>

720
00:43:52.861 --> 00:43:57.861
I never felt so much like fear and like just devastation and trying to explain a

721
00:43:58.891 --> 00:43:59.990
sub,
you know,
uh,

722
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.660
happening to her and I was just trying really hard to like not to break down in

723
00:44:03.661 --> 00:44:06.900
front of her and to tell her like,
this is going to be okay.
Um,
but anyway,

724
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.310
so just listening to this and having had my own experiences and watching all of

725
00:44:11.311 --> 00:44:14.070
this,
you know,
um,
come forward,

726
00:44:14.071 --> 00:44:19.071
I wonder about how to talk to her about what may end up unfortunately being her

727
00:44:19.861 --> 00:44:24.600
experiences in the future.
And I just wanted to get your thoughts and you know,

728
00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.490
what would you say to a daughter,

729
00:44:26.491 --> 00:44:28.230
I don't know actually know if you have a daughter or not,

730
00:44:28.231 --> 00:44:32.370
but like what can we do?
What can we do protect our girls

731
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.230
<v 6>and help them to protect themselves.</v>

732
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.570
<v 2>So I have a 14 year old daughter who actually I just took with me on my la part</v>

733
00:44:38.571 --> 00:44:41.480
of my book tour because I thought it was really important for her to see me.

734
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.950
Well,
she also thought La was cool but uh,
to,
to,
to even take her out of school,

735
00:44:45.951 --> 00:44:50.450
to show her what mom was doing,
you know,
um,
and,

736
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:55.160
and I think it's imperative that our kids see us standing up and speaking up and

737
00:44:55.161 --> 00:44:59.330
being courageous because I can tell you what it transferred to my kids almost

738
00:44:59.331 --> 00:45:04.220
immediately.
My greatest concern was how will my kids fare through this?

739
00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:09.080
And I've seen the bravery in my kids transplanted.

740
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.340
It's contagious.

741
00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.720
So my daughter finally had the courage to speak up at school about some kids who

742
00:45:14.721 --> 00:45:18.200
were bugging her and came home and said,
mom,
I did it cause I saw you do it.

743
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.180
I mean that is how it starts.
Right.
And as far as you know,

744
00:45:23.181 --> 00:45:25.430
being however you felt about the election,

745
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.720
<v 3>okay,</v>

746
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.800
<v 2>I really want to turn it around and say that it's a positive.</v>

747
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:35.720
This is our chance to be able to have a voice on these issues and speak about

748
00:45:35.721 --> 00:45:36.560
them more openly.

749
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:42.080
I mean I have to look at it optimistically and currently where we are right now,

750
00:45:42.081 --> 00:45:46.010
I do think it's optimistic that we're talking about these issues so much.

751
00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.810
And third I would just say,

752
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.110
<v 3>okay,</v>

753
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.450
<v 2>that is eight years old,
may be a little young.</v>

754
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.810
But I played the access Hollywood tape for my kids.

755
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.730
<v 3>Okay.</v>

756
00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.730
<v 2>On purpose because I wanted them to hear how you don't treat people.</v>

757
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.960
And I think that's the way in which we move forward on this issue is to be open

758
00:46:05.961 --> 00:46:06.810
and honest about it.
Right.

759
00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.590
<v 6>Hi Steph off.
Thank you for being here.
Um,
so my question for you is,
um,</v>

760
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.850
I feel a greater sense of urgency then just the role modeling for our children.

761
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.150
I couldn't agree with you more.

762
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.410
I have a four year old daughter and eight year old son and I believe so strongly

763
00:46:23.411 --> 00:46:27.860
in the best thing I can do is role model the behavior I want to see in them.
Um,

764
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.090
but to the point of urgency because it's gonna be a long time until they're in

765
00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:33.760
middle school and high school and in the workforce.

766
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.650
You talked about parameters and I'm sure you can't share specifically.

767
00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.230
Maybe you can talk about it hypothetically bring abstract.

768
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.800
What guidance would you have with feel very privileged working at Google?

769
00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.990
I'm not saying we're perfect,
but I feel very privileged.

770
00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:51.991
So I'm curious to hear from you perspective on parameters or grassroots things

771
00:46:52.871 --> 00:46:57.790
that we could do.
I'm just,
I'm horrified by what you're describing,
you know,

772
00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.390
in contracts that people sign and an awareness that you would,
you know,

773
00:47:01.391 --> 00:47:04.510
you hope to bring to this movement.
What I would call a movement.

774
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.070
What can we do from a grassroots standpoint to help catalyze change

775
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.920
<v 2>saints,
especially at progressive companies like Google.
I think it,</v>

776
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.180
it's really important to put together group discussions of employees and talk

777
00:47:17.181 --> 00:47:20.690
about whether or not you have arbitration clauses and whether or not you can

778
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.550
work with HR to possibly,
you know,

779
00:47:22.551 --> 00:47:26.090
let's talk about amending these or at least taking the secrecy out of

780
00:47:26.091 --> 00:47:28.520
arbitration or at least giving,
uh,

781
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:33.430
your employees the choice of whether or not they want it to be secret or not,

782
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:34.060
right.

783
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.320
Start Group discussions about that in progressive companies that are willing to

784
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:41.320
really listen to their employees.
I think that that is,

785
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.850
is one way to start and to also look at your sexual harassment training
policies.

786
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:46.660
You know,

787
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.590
I know that what happened to me over time was that they eventually just came

788
00:47:50.591 --> 00:47:53.410
through compliance on your computer,
right?
And you just had to,

789
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.030
instead of actually going to the training,

790
00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:59.200
we just had to like check off boxes and everyone pretty much to just did it as

791
00:47:59.201 --> 00:48:00.040
fast as I could,

792
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.240
but really lobby within your company for changing the way in which you are

793
00:48:04.241 --> 00:48:08.770
training people specifically to what we were talking before about bystander

794
00:48:08.771 --> 00:48:09.604
training.

795
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.420
Don't just teach us about what sexual harassment is and give us case studies and

796
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:14.740
say,
here's what bad people do.

797
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:19.720
Teach us about how do we empower people to come forward and help.

798
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.630
That's really the essential training.

799
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.080
So those two things I would encourage,

800
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.630
encourage you to have just like you might have a book club,

801
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:30.280
but to have to come together.

802
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:32.860
I've already heard from young people all across the country since I've been on

803
00:48:32.861 --> 00:48:33.370
tour,

804
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:37.450
that they're starting these kinds of movements within their own companies and

805
00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:41.410
also I would have thirdly,
the discussion about the confidentiality clauses.

806
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.340
Yes,
let's protect business secrets,
especially at a place like Google.

807
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.850
I know you're on the cutting edge and nobody wants to to violate that,

808
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.190
but do we really have to be secret about everything?

809
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:56.080
Let's give a voice back to our employees because that is so incredibly

810
00:48:56.081 --> 00:49:00.730
empowering and that only makes the employee want to work here more and stay here

811
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:04.690
for a long time if they know that they're in a safe environment.
Thank you.

812
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.230
<v 0>Um,
well,
I think this is all the time we have today.
Thank you so much for,
um,</v>

813
00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.750
participating in this very important discussion.

814
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.140
And let's all give a round of applause for Gretchen.
