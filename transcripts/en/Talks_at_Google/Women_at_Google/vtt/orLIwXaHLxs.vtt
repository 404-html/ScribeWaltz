1
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.593
Okay.

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.900
<v 0>Thank you very much.</v>

3
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:15.490
Thanks for that introduction and thank you all for coming on this very hot

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.110
Monday afternoon.

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.610
The subject of Nazi looting has been in the news a lot lately.

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.670
It seems as if every week there's some sort of new Nazi looted object that has

7
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:31.990
resurfaced.

8
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.820
There's been two feature films made about the subject,
the monuments,

9
00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:38.590
men and woman in gold.

10
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.690
There've been countless documentaries and books about this as well.

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.320
It is a complex subject,

12
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:52.321
so I'm going to attempt to demystify it a little bit by talking about theft and

13
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.634
recovery.

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.960
We're going to break the lecture up into three parts.

15
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.870
The first part will be the theft,
Bart.

16
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.350
We'll look at how the Nazis looted art and the vast mechanations that they use

17
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:12.310
to carry out the looting and the second part of the lecture,

18
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.690
we'll look at recovery.

19
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.410
We'll look at postwar recovery with the allies,

20
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.100
and then we'll look at contemporary recovery.

21
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.490
Then in the final part of the lecture,

22
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.730
we're going to get personal and I'm going to talk about a story of Nazi looted

23
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:35.500
art that involved my family.
Through this story.

24
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:39.610
You'll be able to see all the nuances of looted,
art,

25
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.420
theft,
and recovery.
Okay.

26
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.220
Why did the Nazis,
Leah,

27
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:51.070
to art at all started at the very top with Adolf Hitler?

28
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.290
Hitler wanted to create a monument to his legacy.

29
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.530
He got the idea for doing this.

30
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.070
When he visited Italy on a state visit.

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.370
He was always interested in art,

32
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.240
but it wasn't until he saw these amazing museums in Rome and Florence and was in

33
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.300
awe by the artwork that he saw there,

34
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.640
and so he decided to create a monument to his regime.

35
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.580
What he was going to do was build a huge complex of galleries and museums.

36
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.060
This complex would be known as their future.
Our Museum,

37
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.120
Hitler chose to,
how's the museum in his hometown of Linz,

38
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.253
Austria?

39
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.980
Linz was a small industrial town and it doesn't seem like it would be the ideal

40
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:50.980
place to how's this massive cultural monument.

41
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.270
A more logical place would be Vienna,

42
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.140
but Hitler hated Vienna,
Vienna,

43
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.100
the city that rejected him as an artist.

44
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.260
He was actually a failed artist.

45
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:09.430
He applied to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts,

46
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.650
not once but twice,

47
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.610
and he was rejected both times.

48
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.120
So he wanted to diminish the cultural importance of Vienna as a city.

49
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.560
He felt that by putting it in his hometown of Lynn's,

50
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.590
that Lynn's would become the third Reichs capital for the arts and eventually it

51
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:36.250
would become the cultural capital of Europe.

52
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600
While Hitler applied for admission to the Vienna Academy,

53
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.950
one of the members of the board felt sorry for him and they told him that he had

54
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.530
some talent and architecture,

55
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.540
so perhaps he should go on to become an architect.
He obviously never did that,

56
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.810
but he did put his architectural training to youth in that he made architectural

57
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.410
drawings of the fear of museum.

58
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.400
Then he got an actual architect to create a scale model,

59
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.200
which is what you're looking at here.

60
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.490
This picture was taken in March of 1945 Hitler committed suicide in April of

61
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.901
1945 so by this time it was all this that the Nazis were going to lose the war,

62
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.580
but Hitler was still obsessed with the idea of creating this fear of museum.

63
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.560
Part of the sub session as well was to filled the museum and fill it with the

64
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.640
greatest treasures of the western world.

65
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.170
He hired someone for the specific purpose of acquiring art to fill the museum.

66
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.330
A man named Hans Pasa.

67
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.870
He had credentials because he was the former director of the Dresden Gallery and

68
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:09.961
pastas mission was to acquire art from all over Europe to fill the fear of

69
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.950
museum.
Not only that,

70
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.951
but Hitler created a mandate telling all state and party officials that they

71
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:25.060
needed to assist Dr Partha in his mission.

72
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.400
As a result,

73
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.550
the Nazis looted art from every territory that they occupied.

74
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.750
Now this isn't anything new.

75
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:41.050
Looting of art through wars,
throughout history,

76
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:43.780
it's always been to the victor,
the spoils.

77
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.750
Pillaging has gone on for ages,

78
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.060
but what makes this different is that it was highly systematic.

79
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.770
The Nazis actually had looting organizations.

80
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.560
These organizations employed hundreds of people.

81
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.570
There were art experts,

82
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.070
there were people that would come in and take things out of other people's

83
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.770
houses.
There were record keepers.

84
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.450
The Nazis kept very good.
Records believe in are not,

85
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:19.451
and ironically this is what the allies used and what we use today to help find

86
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:20.750
looted art.

87
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.820
It's actually very prestigious to be a member of this organization.

88
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.840
There were several high ranking Nazi officials that consider themselves not just

89
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:39.530
great art collectors,
but art connoisseur sewers as well.

90
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.930
So if you were in a looting organization and you could create a pipeline of art

91
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.600
to the likes of Gurgling or Gerbils,

92
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.430
you would be in good stead with Nazi elite,

93
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.610
the Nazis to have lists of what they wanted.
Even before the war,

94
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.860
they targeted both public and private collections and they aimed high.

95
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100
They targeted the Louvre in Paris and the Rights Museum in Holland in terms of

96
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:12.380
private collections.

97
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.800
They targeted families that were known throughout Europe as having amazing

98
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:22.130
private collections such as the Rothschilds and the Rosenbergs,

99
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.360
but the Nazis didn't stop at art.

100
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.650
They stole just about anything that you could think of.

101
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.790
They still books,
they still musical instruments.

102
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.500
They stole wine.

103
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.810
Here is a picture of bells that the Nazis stole from churches throughout Europe.

104
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.140
Many of these bells have been damaged beyond repair because the Nazis didn't

105
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:53.750
quite know how to store these.
As you can see,

106
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:57.590
I don't think it's a very good idea to stack bells one on top of the other.

107
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.800
Whatever the Nazis didn't want,
they sold.

108
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.760
They sold this to fund the war effort.
In fact,

109
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.690
the door Tam auction house in Vienna,
which still exists today,

110
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.600
was a Nazi clearing house.

111
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.860
If you look at all Dora Tam records from this time,

112
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:22.640
you can see how the Nazis went into somebody's home.

113
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.640
They listed everything in their house.

114
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:30.641
They started with the most valuable things in the house such as paintings or

115
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:33.860
sculptures and jewelry,

116
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:39.130
and they went down the list and included intimate personal items that nobody

117
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:43.940
would really want to buy such as underwear,

118
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.750
but these were still on the list of sales.

119
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.940
The Nazis ended up amassing hundreds and thousands of works of art and they need

120
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.850
a place to store all of this art.

121
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.710
One of the key places that they chose was in the museum.

122
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.630
Did you deport him and Paris?
Have any of you been to the desert upon?

123
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.523
Okay,

124
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.180
this is what it looked like when it was a Nazi repository.

125
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.550
And if you look through this,
you can almost play spot the famous artist.

126
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:23.280
We have a degas over here.

127
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.860
We have a laissez here.

128
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.210
There's a Picasso here and on and on.

129
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.290
What was really interesting about this was Reich's Marshall Herrmann Gehring

130
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.060
came to these Uda palm 20 times in the course of the war.

131
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.170
Garing was an obsessive collector,

132
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.060
but he considered himself not just a collector,
a connoisseur as well.

133
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.660
When Hitler would send into his dealers to get things green light to come in and

134
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.730
look at the works of art and touch them and make sure that they were personally

135
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:05.550
sent to his castle in Bavaria.

136
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.370
And so here we have the head of the lift Rafa we should be spending his time

137
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.000
thinking about the war,

138
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:20.001
but instead he spending in an ordinate amount of time obsessing about art

139
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.460
as the allies gained favor during the warm,

140
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.390
the Nazis literally went underground to hide art and they had art in salt mines,

141
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.930
believe it or not,

142
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.760
salt mines were ideal for storing art.
First of all,

143
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.420
they were underground so they were protected from bombing.

144
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.540
Second of all,
they were cool underground.
It was cool,

145
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.400
it was dark,
it was dry,

146
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:58.401
so you didn't have to worry about fluctuations in temperature or humidity and

147
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.940
you didn't have to worry about sunlight destroying the works of art.

148
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.800
There are two salt mines that I want to take a look at.

149
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.300
The first one is in markers Germany.

150
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.240
When the allies came in here,

151
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:19.380
they found art for more than a dozen Germans date.

152
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.310
Museums.

153
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.840
Here is a picture of general Eisenhower behind him as General Patton and you can

154
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.840
see they're looking through stolen art.

155
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.620
This picture was taken the same day that journal Eisenhower went to a

156
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:42.021
concentration camp for the first time and he became sick to his stomach.

157
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.220
And it's really interesting about this photograph.
As you can see,

158
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:51.780
that the effects of war are actually starting to take their toll on this great

159
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:52.614
general.

160
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.030
The other thing that the allies found in here was

161
00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.223
<v 1>gold.</v>

162
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.060
<v 0>Literally tons and tons of gold.</v>

163
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.940
So if you see here,
we've got some gold bars and then just bags of gold.

164
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.830
Gold was stolen from banks.

165
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.010
Jewelry was taken and melted down,

166
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.520
but what was most disturbing was the allies found bags of gold teeth from

167
00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:28.200
victims of the Holocaust.
Okay,

168
00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:32.760
we're going to look at another salt mine.
It is an out,
I will say in Austria.

169
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.080
This has an interesting story to it because this salt mine was wigged with

170
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:44.970
explosives.
The Nazis felt that if they couldn't have the art,

171
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.350
the nobody else should have it.
So they put bombs all over the entrance.

172
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.130
We have some unlikely heroes to this story as well.

173
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.120
Austrian miners who were part of the resistance.

174
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:03.050
These miners were able to thwart the Nazis the 10th to try to bomb this or

175
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:08.400
explode this and tell the allies could come and save the works of art.

176
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.660
There were some pretty amazing treasures that they found in this particular salt

177
00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:20.310
mine,
so let's take a little journey,
shall we?
First,

178
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.930
you go down a long tunnel,
a whole mile deep,

179
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.130
and what the allies found amazed them.

180
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:35.060
They've found workstations for cataloging and even restoring art and you can see

181
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:40.770
on the wall just all sorts of paintings.

182
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.540
Here is another corridor with paintings.
In fact,

183
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:49.290
the allies found over 6,500 paintings.

184
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.150
The majority of these were earmarked for the furor museum,

185
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.520
and I do want to look at a couple of paintings at the allies found because

186
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.900
they're pretty famous
right over here.

187
00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:07.290
This is a frowns halls,
but it's this one I want to look at.

188
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.700
That is called the astronomer by Johan Vermeer.

189
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.460
Here it is and it's all it's beautiful.

190
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.570
Glory for mere was a Dutch master.

191
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.230
He only painted 34 works of art.

192
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.570
Every single one of these is a masterpiece.

193
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.970
Every now and again you'll hear about a Vermeer being stolen and it's a really

194
00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:37.971
big deal because it's a huge loss to society and to think that that could have

195
00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:41.760
been destroyed.
It's just astounding.

196
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.170
You can visit this painting.
It is in the Louvre in Paris,

197
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:49.770
and honestly the slide does not do it justice.

198
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.420
It's really spectacular.

199
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.170
The other famous work of art I want to look at is this,

200
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:00.530
does anybody know what those panels are from

201
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.240
again to altarpiece?
Again,

202
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:09.680
to alter piece is this massive alter.

203
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:13.940
It is 11 by 15 feet.
In fact,
here we see in,

204
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.860
it consists of 12 panels.

205
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.460
It's by another Dutch master named Jan Van Eyck.

206
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:25.490
If you look at it,
you could see all sorts of Nice detailing and me.
See,

207
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:28.550
it was this panel,
this panel,
and this panel.

208
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:30.680
If we go back right there,

209
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.340
many people consider this to be the greatest treasure of the Western world and

210
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:42.320
it's just shocking to think that this could have been gone forever,

211
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.290
right?
That is a bit about the theft.

212
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.780
Now let's talk about recovery.

213
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.180
In 1943 the allies set up the monuments,

214
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.460
fine arts and archives unit,

215
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.000
also known as the monuments men.

216
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.990
This was set up in an effort to protect monuments from being damaged during the

217
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:13.730
warm.
So the military recruit.
It all starts,
uh,

218
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.240
art historians and architectural historians to point out monuments of cultural

219
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:24.761
significance and make sure that these monuments were not destroyed during

220
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.104
bombings.

221
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.340
This was also done to help with the war on propaganda.

222
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.800
The Nazis were painting the allies as barbarians of culture.

223
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.830
They sat that the allies would come in,

224
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.860
the Americans in particular and start bombing monuments that had been around for

225
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:45.891
hundreds,

226
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:50.891
possibly thousands of years without a care in the world about their historical

227
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:55.700
significance.
The monuments.

228
00:16:55.701 --> 00:16:59.060
Men wanted to make sure that this didn't happen,

229
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.170
but this wasn't without controversy.

230
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.640
There were some monuments that were in key strategic location.

231
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.800
So you sometimes see monuments,
men,
bookish,

232
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:16.400
art historians arguing with five star generals.

233
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.940
But for the most part,
the art historians one out.

234
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.740
And as a result,

235
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:25.880
we still have all of these famous monuments in Europe today.

236
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.770
The remit of the monuments men was extended when the ward became a ground war

237
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:39.550
and it became obvious just how massive the scale of Nazi looting was.

238
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.490
So there when that was changed to find and recover looted art.

239
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.360
But there is another agreement that they had and you don't hear much about this

240
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:56.361
in the history books and it was to make sure that allied soldiers didn't take

241
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:59.640
anything home with them for souvenirs.

242
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.740
And so on the one hand they're trying to return art that the Nazis looted.

243
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.030
But on the other hand,

244
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:09.060
they're trying to make sure that the allies don't loot anything.

245
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.710
And that did happen.
The monuments,

246
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:18.711
men collected vast amounts of data and they were astounded by just how much art

247
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:23.070
was looted throughout Europe.

248
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.750
This is one of my favorite slides.

249
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.200
This was taken out of Chariton Ellyn Guinn,
Germany.

250
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.710
And here we see a soldier and he's completely overwhelmed by these stacks of

251
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:41.940
stolen art.
Two stories high.

252
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.940
The allies were finding repositories like this throughout Europe.

253
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.860
In fact,
they found over 1000 repositories.

254
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

255
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.240
<v 0>So they created their own central collection point to catalog the works and try</v>

256
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:00.600
to return them.

257
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.560
The allies agreed that identifiable works of art should be returned to the

258
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:09.360
countries from which they were taken.

259
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

260
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:16.290
<v 0>Here we have the picture of looted art being returned to Florence.</v>

261
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.420
You can see there's a bit of a celebration going on.
It's just a nice day.

262
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.010
Everybody's really happy,

263
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.120
but this is only half the story.

264
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.350
Once the works of art were returned to these countries,

265
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.530
it would then be up to agencies in the countries to return the works of art to

266
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:39.030
their rightful owners.

267
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.750
This is where it gets more complicated.

268
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.860
If the works for from a state museum,

269
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.730
that's a lot easier because those could be returned,

270
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:55.680
but if they were from a private collection,
it becomes very difficult.

271
00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.210
First of all,
they might not know who the works belonged to,

272
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.930
but even if they did know who the works belonged to,

273
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.600
the odds of them actually finding that person,
we're very low.

274
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:14.490
A lot of people had fled the country and in the worst cases,

275
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.020
people had perished in the Holocaust.
As a result.

276
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:24.050
There are museums all over Europe that are holding onto what are considered

277
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.320
airless works of art in their museums.

278
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

279
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.580
<v 0>Okay.
Let's talk a bit about contemporary restitution.</v>

280
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.240
After the war.
Family is filed,

281
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.960
claims for missing art works and it wasn't just art works.

282
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.750
It was a real estate.

283
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:49.060
It was jewelry insurance claims were filed.

284
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:54.510
This happened a lot in the 1940s but started dying down in the 1950s this wasn't

285
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:59.500
really the priority for families.

286
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.530
The priority was to find surviving family members and get on with their lives.

287
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.840
The issue pretty much died down in the latter half of the 20th century until the

288
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:20.161
1990s and then all of the sudden there was a resurgence in interest in this

289
00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:22.774
subject.

290
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:28.150
This had to do with more information becoming available.

291
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.870
There are three factors that contributed to this.

292
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.780
One was the fall of the Iron Curtain,

293
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.170
so all of the sudden all sorts of information from former eastern bloc countries

294
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:45.511
was opening up to was that 50 or privacy laws and archives were expiring,

295
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:52.530
so all sorts of archival information was becoming available and three was the

296
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:55.120
rise of the Internet.

297
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.770
So all of a sudden people were putting information online and you could do

298
00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:04.330
research from your computer instead of having to travel to archives.

299
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:11.610
Conferences were held throughout the 1990s to talk about what to do with the

300
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:14.470
outstanding looted art.

301
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:21.030
This culminated in a conference that took place in Washington DC in 1998 called

302
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.090
appropriately enough the Washington conference on Holocaust era assets.

303
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.640
During this conference,

304
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:35.641
delegates from 44 nations got together and came up with a set of principles of

305
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:40.480
how to deal with looted art and again,

306
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:44.830
they were called appropriately enough the Washington conference principles.

307
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.960
It's a lot of text for one slide,
so I will summarize it for you.

308
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.620
Essentially it says every effort should be made to find and return art to their

309
00:22:57.401 --> 00:23:01.810
prewar owners.
It gets interesting.
Again,

310
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:08.010
these principles were primarily written by the US State Department and delegates

311
00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:14.221
from Europe weren't too pleased with the fact that America was telling them how

312
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:17.050
to deal with Europe,
with PE and art.

313
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:22.570
So in order to make sure that everybody signed these principles,

314
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.110
they were made non binding.

315
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.240
So that means ethically you should do the right thing and return looted art.

316
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.690
But legally you don't have to have followup conference was held in Prague in

317
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:45.031
2009 where a similar set of principles was ratified by 46 nations called the

318
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:49.490
Terezin declaration.
But again,

319
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.000
these principles for non binding,

320
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:55.623
<v 1>Eh,</v>

321
00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.860
<v 0>fortunately a substantial amount of art has been returned,</v>

322
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.260
but there are still thousands of works that are out there that are missing.

323
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.620
The latest estimate is that there are 350,000 works of art that are still at

324
00:24:14.801 --> 00:24:19.450
large families that are searching for them.
And as I mentioned,

325
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:25.260
museums throughout Europe have works in their collections that they know were

326
00:24:25.301 --> 00:24:28.690
looted by the Nazis in France,
for instance,

327
00:24:28.691 --> 00:24:33.220
in museums such as the loove,
the Pompidou,
the d'orsay,
uh,

328
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:38.290
and other state museums are over 2000 works of art hanging on the walls.

329
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:39.940
This have an official name,

330
00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:44.941
they're called MNRS or museum national recuperation and they're waiting for

331
00:24:45.221 --> 00:24:49.030
families to come in and claim them.
In the meantime,

332
00:24:49.031 --> 00:24:54.031
they are considered airlifts and the states are displaying them.

333
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.153
Okay,

334
00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.470
so what do you do if you are a claimant and you want to search for looted art?

335
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.870
Probably the easiest thing to do is contact a claim,
an organization.

336
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.640
There are several good Clayman organizations out there and many of them are

337
00:25:14.641 --> 00:25:16.020
charities as well.

338
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.400
There are also law firms that specialize in restitution of looted art.

339
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.140
This was not a specialty 20 years ago,

340
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.220
but as high value works of art are being returned to families,

341
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.950
there's a lot of money involved in this.

342
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.000
So now there are law firms that specialize in this.

343
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.030
If you don't want to go through a claim,

344
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:44.400
an organization or a law firm and do your own research.

345
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:49.080
What I always tell people to do is start by getting a family history.

346
00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:53.520
Know what happened to your family members before the war,

347
00:25:53.521 --> 00:25:55.620
during the war and after the war.

348
00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.280
Then get an idea of what objects were taken and if you have any documentation it

349
00:26:02.491 --> 00:26:05.280
helps a great deal.

350
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.560
Documentation could be photographs,
photographs,
especially of the works in situ.

351
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.610
I came across a picture of um,

352
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.460
people looking for a painting and there are these lovely elderly ladies playing

353
00:26:17.461 --> 00:26:22.000
cards with this beautiful painting behind them and that did help.
And how you,

354
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.930
there are also paintings are left to people in wills,

355
00:26:24.931 --> 00:26:27.810
so they're mentioned there if they're famous works of art,

356
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.840
they could be in catalog raisonne A's which lists works of art by a particular

357
00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:38.070
artist or even past insurance claims.

358
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.260
The other thing to do is once you find out an object is stolen,

359
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:47.940
eluted is register it on a stolen art database.

360
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.380
The biggest stolen art database is called the art loss register.

361
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.730
And if you are a dealer or an auction house that has a good reputation,

362
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.230
you do your due diligence and you check the our loss register before you sell

363
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:08.460
anything to make sure the works of art are not stolen or looted.

364
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:14.370
There are lots and lots of databases of Nazi looted art.
Now,

365
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.700
unfortunately,
there isn't a Google for alluded art,

366
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:22.440
so you can't look at everything in one place.
You do have to know where to look,

367
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.570
but hopefully something like that we'll be imminent and one thing you're

368
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:29.820
probably thinking is,
okay,

369
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:34.050
let's say you put something on a stolen our database and there's a match.

370
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.760
Then what happens if it's from a dealer or an auction house and they're

371
00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:43.440
reputable,
then they won't sell it,
but then it becomes really,

372
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:45.630
really tricky because for the most part,

373
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:50.250
the person who was putting it up for sale bought the work of art in good faith

374
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.390
and they feel really bad for the family that this was looted from,

375
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.550
but they're thinking,
well,
yes,
this is horrible,

376
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:59.910
but I paid good money for this and I had no idea it was looted.

377
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.410
Then on the other hand,

378
00:28:01.411 --> 00:28:05.370
you have the family that wants to get back a piece of their heritage.

379
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.820
So you start to talk about some sort of settlement and settlements can be tricky

380
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:14.130
and they can take a while.

381
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:19.131
Usually they take several years to try to get both parties to agree on something

382
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:21.540
that they can both be happy with.

383
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.500
Now it is complex as searching for alluded art,

384
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:30.530
but it is something that happens as is evidenced by all of these cases that

385
00:28:31.291 --> 00:28:35.970
we've seen in the last 10 to 20 years.
Okay.

386
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.050
Well that brings us to the third part of the lecture where I'm going to talk

387
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:44.310
about uh,
uh,
restitution case that my family was involved in.

388
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:50.280
It is a work by an artist named Egon Sheila.
It's called portrait of Wally.

389
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.040
This was a landmark case.

390
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.910
It's changed the way that museums looted art and it's also caused Austria to

391
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:02.160
create a restitution law.

392
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.970
This was one of the first major cases to put Nazi looting in the headlines.

393
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.230
Prior to that,
a lot of people didn't even know that the Nazis looted art.

394
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.080
Me being one of them.
I had no idea.

395
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.720
And then when I found out that this happened to my family,

396
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:22.860
I became really interested in this and start at working in the field.

397
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.470
My great,

398
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:30.471
great aunt was a art dealer in 1930s piano.

399
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.870
Her name was Leah Bondage,
Ira.

400
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.380
She owned her own gallery and she championed modern art and in many respects

401
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:41.250
it's very forward.

402
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.500
You don't have too many female gallery owners and 1930s Vianna and there aren't

403
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:49.690
too many that champion modern art.

404
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.960
She a delt and works by clamped by Sheila and by Kokoschka she owned quite a few

405
00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:00.310
works by Egon Sheila,

406
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.570
but by far her favorite was portrait of Wally.

407
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.400
In 1938 in Austria on Sloss occurred and the fate of Jewish families changed

408
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.250
dramatically.

409
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.300
All Jews who were ordered to give up their businesses.

410
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.950
So my aunt had to hand her business over to a Nazi,

411
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.100
a Nazi named Friedrich Belts,

412
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:32.820
acquired her gallery and he came to her house one day to get her to sign some

413
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:33.820
paperwork.

414
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:38.620
He saw a portrait of Wally hanging on her wall and he said,

415
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.570
I want that.
Give it to me and she said,
no,
you can't have it.

416
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:47.290
It's mine.
It has nothing to do with Mike Gallery.

417
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:51.910
It's part of my personal collection.
He said,
I don't care.

418
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.260
Give it to me.

419
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:59.100
They argued for a good half hour and finally her husband said,

420
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.880
just give it to him.
You know what he's capable of.

421
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:05.770
So we'd Lectans Lee.

422
00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:10.771
She handed Wally over to him and one of the things that he was capable of would

423
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:15.580
be revoking their exit visa.
So they fled for London.

424
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:20.200
The next day when my aunt moved to London,

425
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:22.840
she actually set up her own gallery here in London,

426
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.520
another modern art gallery when she was actually one of the first people

427
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:32.410
credited for bringing German and Austrian expressionism to the UK.

428
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.110
After the war,

429
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.930
she started searching for Wally and and to found that it was in the Belvedere

430
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:42.970
museum in Vienna,

431
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.570
the Belvedere was the Austrian state museum.

432
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.060
So my aunt wrote the museum.

433
00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.800
She explained the circumstances of loss and she asked for her painting back.

434
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.960
What do you think the museum said?
Ooh,
you can't have this.

435
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:03.250
This belongs to us.
Sorry.
She wrote letters.

436
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:08.110
She hired lawyers,
but she had no luck.

437
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:14.230
In 1953 a young via knees,

438
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.260
ophthalmologist named Rudolph Leopold sought her out in her London gallery.

439
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.710
Leopold was obsessed with Egon Sheila.

440
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:31.090
He thought that he was the reincarnation of Sheila.

441
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.450
He touched up works by Sheila even though he didn't have any artistic training.

442
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.080
His goal was to amass the largest collection of works by Sheila ever.

443
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.680
He knew my aunt's reputation as a dealer in works by Econ Sheila,

444
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.160
so he asked her to help him find works by Sheila to build his collection.

445
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.280
She said she would,

446
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.690
but in return could he help her get back portrait of Wally.

447
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.790
He said that he would.

448
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.930
She hadn't heard from him for a little while.

449
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.110
Then the next thing he knew,

450
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.060
he ended up owning Wally again.

451
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.610
She wrote letters.
She hired lawyers,

452
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.250
but to no avail.

453
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.760
She died in 1969 having never gotten back her beloved portrait.

454
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.570
The story's not over.

455
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.770
Let's fast forward to 1997 by this time,

456
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:50.390
Leopold had amassed the largest collection of works by Egon Schiele lie in the

457
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:55.340
world.
In fact,
he has his own museum in Vienna called the Leopold Museum.

458
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.070
Have any of you been there?
Okay.

459
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.980
In 1997 he agreed to loan several key pieces from his collection to the Museum

460
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:11.780
of modern art or a Moma in New York.
This was a big deal.

461
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:17.010
Sheila was becoming a very fashionable artists by then and this was the first

462
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:22.370
time that some many works would by Sheila would be seeing on that side of the

463
00:34:22.371 --> 00:34:23.204
Atlantic.

464
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:28.330
So it helped to raise Sheila's reputation as well as the worth of the Leopold

465
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:29.774
collection.

466
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.400
Several key pieces included portrait of Wally.

467
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:36.500
There was another piece called dead city.

468
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.830
All sorts of amazing works are going to be seen for the first time our family

469
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:46.931
decided the best thing to do was to talk to the press about how Leopold acquired

470
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:50.330
works of art in his collection.

471
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.850
Portrait of Wally was not the only looted work of art in his collection,

472
00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.210
and Leah pulled used less than upstanding methods to acquire a lot of works.

473
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:08.350
So we spoke to a reporter from the New York Times and she ended up writing this

474
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:13.510
big article about how Leopold used dastardly methods to acquire works of art.

475
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.750
They interviewed my family.
They focused on two paintings,

476
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:19.790
portrait of Wally and dead city.

477
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:22.880
When the article came out,

478
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.310
it caused a sensation.
Citizens of New York,

479
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:33.610
Jewish citizens in particular were aghast that Momo would harbor Nazi lute.

480
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:41.230
So we took this opportunity to contact the chair of the Museum of modern art to

481
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:47.211
see if he could keep Wally in America before it went on to its next stop in the

482
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:50.400
exhibition,
which was Barcelona.

483
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.820
We knew that if it left America and we couldn't prove the ownership in America,

484
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.490
we would never get it back.

485
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.810
The chairman for the Museum of Modern Art at the time as a man named Ronald

486
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.500
Lauder,
you might not have heard of him,
but you'll have heard of his mother,

487
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.760
Estee Lauder.

488
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.040
Ronald Lauder has a lot of ties to Austria.

489
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:22.041
He was the Austrian ambassador in the 1980s he was also,

490
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:28.071
or is also an avid collector of Austrian expressionists arts such as Clinton,

491
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.200
Tula in fuck.

492
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.910
The rumor is that he used his bar Mitzvah money to buy in Egon Schiele a

493
00:36:34.911 --> 00:36:38.550
painting.
Not only that,

494
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.760
but he chairs a recovery company that helps Jewish families get back works of

495
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:49.350
lose at art.
So we thought he would be sympathetic to our plate,

496
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.730
but guess what?
He wouldn't help us.

497
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:59.540
He was indebted to the museum community and making sure that this work went to

498
00:37:01.651 --> 00:37:05.760
its next stop on the exhibit.
While this was going on,

499
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.790
museums were taking notice of this.
In fact,

500
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.880
all sorts of museums wrote a joint letter saying that Moma had to move this

501
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:20.460
painting to its next stop in the exhibition.
This is because museums,

502
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:24.630
we're realizing that if this works stayed in America and there was an

503
00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:29.100
investigation into the provenance or ownership history of the work of art,

504
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:35.050
if they loaned works abroad,
other families could claim for looted artists.

505
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.940
Well,
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

506
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:44.540
Museums do not like to give back works of art from their collections.

507
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:50.510
My feeling is if these museums consider themselves paragons of culture,

508
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:55.860
they wouldn't want stolen or looted art in their collections in the first place,

509
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.120
but that was not the way that these museums fell to at the time.

510
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.040
We spoke to lawyers,

511
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:10.041
we spoke to government organizations and about keeping the work in the country

512
00:38:10.231 --> 00:38:14.790
and they were all trying to help us,
but things were looking bleak.
In fact,

513
00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:18.870
while he was getting packed up and it was getting ready to be shipped off,

514
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.180
but at the 11th hour,

515
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:26.210
the Manhattan district attorney swooped in and subpoena the painting under the u

516
00:38:26.451 --> 00:38:28.260
s stolen property act.

517
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.170
As you could well imagine,
officials at Moma were livid.

518
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.110
Visuals at the Leopold Museum were livid.

519
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:43.480
Eight lawsuit in sued.
Now during this lawsuit,

520
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:45.730
a couple of interesting things happen.

521
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:51.420
Museums began looking through artworks in their collections and looking for gaps

522
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.270
and again,
the provenance or ownership history from the years,

523
00:38:55.271 --> 00:39:00.271
1933 to 1945 and they would place these works online so that people could begin

524
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:03.880
researching them.

525
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.310
The other thing that happened was that Australia was getting a bit of a bad

526
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:14.311
reputation for having looted art and the culture minister in her,

527
00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.170
um,

528
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:21.750
knowledge and why snus decided that this was just really not a good way for

529
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:26.110
Australia to be perceived and wanted to make a big gesture.

530
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:31.510
So they ended up writing a law saying that works of art that were looted by the

531
00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:35.470
Nazis that were in Austrian museums would be returned.

532
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.080
Unfortunately,

533
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.830
Wally was exempt from that because the Leopold Museum was not fully a state

534
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:42.664
museum.

535
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.560
So this lawsuit went on for 12 long years.

536
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.320
Finally,

537
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.320
in June of 2010 we came up with the settlement.

538
00:39:55.750 --> 00:40:00.750
The Leopold Museum ended up paying our family $19 million for the painting,

539
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:03.820
which was the market price at the time.

540
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:09.160
And they would get to display it again in the Leopold museum,

541
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.430
but there would be a plaque next to it,
uh,

542
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:16.120
stating the ownership history and my aunts all rolling it.

543
00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:21.760
Just a couple of other pictures.
This is Egon.

544
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.780
Sheila's China self portrait with Chinese red lanterns.

545
00:40:25.781 --> 00:40:27.690
And this was,
uh,

546
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.880
when he painted as a companion piece to portrait of Wally.

547
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.600
Those two are now hanging together in the Leopold Museum.

548
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.460
And this is a painting of my aunt,
uh,

549
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.060
by a Hungarian artist named Felix Horton.

550
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.820
And talking to family members.

551
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:50.170
The general consensus is if she'd known all the fuss made over her little

552
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:55.120
painting,
she would have laughed and laughed.
All right,
well that is the lecture.

553
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:59.050
Hopefully I've helped to demystify this a little bit and I'm happy to answer any

554
00:40:59.051 --> 00:40:59.884
questions.

555
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.300
<v 2>Thank you.
Um,</v>

556
00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.520
I'm just wondering if this has immediately what comes to mind is art that's been

557
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.940
sort of alluded through the centuries through war,

558
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:28.100
basically everything in the Louvre and the British Museum.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

559
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.340
so I'm just wondering if this,
I mean,
I understand this is more recent.

560
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:35.900
It's probably,
you know,
um,
a different set of circumstances to a degree,

561
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:40.060
but I would imagine this is something also impacting norms for that,

562
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.730
those works of art.
So just wondering if you can talk about that.

563
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:46.280
<v 0>Sure.
Yeah.
Well in the UK for example,
um,</v>

564
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.340
it is the illegal to d session works of art from museums.

565
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.030
So that means you can't give them back unless there's an act of parliament,

566
00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.140
which is why the elegant marbles have not been given back.

567
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:03.530
There has been an exception for Holocaust looted art and what you can give it

568
00:42:03.751 --> 00:42:04.500
back.

569
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.500
They put a sunset clause in it which is going to be ending very soon.

570
00:42:09.661 --> 00:42:11.280
You might've even seen that in the news.

571
00:42:11.281 --> 00:42:15.150
Somebodies government official said that there were not going to put a sunset

572
00:42:15.151 --> 00:42:17.820
clause in it.
There won't be a statute of limitations,

573
00:42:17.821 --> 00:42:19.560
but somebody is trying to block that.

574
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.420
And this seems to be the case with a lot of museums throughout Europe.

575
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.673
Are there any

576
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.920
<v 2>rules on um,</v>

577
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.980
time and so I'll try to claim any artwork back on their,

578
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:37.780
um,
what they wish to do with the all going forward,
if that,

579
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:38.820
if that makes sense.

580
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.680
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
my feeling is once they get the art back,</v>

581
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.150
they could do whatever they want.

582
00:42:45.151 --> 00:42:48.600
Sometimes it's part of the settlement and a lot of people think,
well,

583
00:42:48.601 --> 00:42:52.680
you fight tell long and so hard to give back or get back these works of art.

584
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.140
Why are you then turning around and selling them?

585
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.480
There are a couple of reasons for that.

586
00:42:57.481 --> 00:43:02.250
One is because oftentimes it's just one work of art and there are a lot of

587
00:43:02.251 --> 00:43:04.530
errors.
You can't divide up the work of art,

588
00:43:04.531 --> 00:43:09.180
but you can divide up money too.
Is that,
um,

589
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.740
if it is a work of art worth a lot of money,

590
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.710
a lot of families can't even afford the insurance on the yard.

591
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.120
But my feeling is once they get it back,
they can do whatever they want with it.

592
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.100
<v 1>Does that,
does that even mean,</v>

593
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.010
<v 2>does that even mean if,
um,</v>

594
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:32.990
if they want to keep it in their private collection and that there aren't any

595
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.750
rules on that?
Absolutely.
Yeah.

596
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.230
<v 0>They could do whatever they want with it.</v>

597
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:38.990
They could keep it in their private collection.
They could give it away.

598
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.870
They could hide it in a vault somewhere.
It's theirs.

599
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.270
<v 1>Awesome.
Preston?
Um,</v>

600
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.390
<v 2>the differences between Ah,</v>

601
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.900
it was liters by individuals and that was sort of in the more sort of state

602
00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:54.970
sponsored looting.
In terms of recovery.

603
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.600
Are there big differences in the way you see people trying to provide evidence?

604
00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.770
It must be much more difficult when it was a person who just saw something like

605
00:44:02.771 --> 00:44:04.420
that and took it off the wall.
Um,

606
00:44:04.421 --> 00:44:07.510
and it didn't go into the sort of Nazi administration system.

607
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:08.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

608
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:13.000
I'll oftentimes it is a lot easier when it is something that's gone through the

609
00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:15.160
state system then when it's a person.

610
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:16.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

611
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.480
<v 0>And the rules and laws for different,
for the countries are different.</v>

612
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:25.481
So somebody might be living in one country and find a work of art that's another

613
00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:28.610
country and you're dealing with different laws in each country.

614
00:44:28.611 --> 00:44:32.880
So that's where it gets very tricky and very complicated and it's like that with

615
00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:34.950
individuals versus the states as well.

616
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:36.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

617
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.760
<v 3>Hi,
thanks.
That was,
that was really,
really interesting.
Um,</v>

618
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.470
it sounds like there was an opportunity at,
you know,
back in the past from yours,

619
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.020
from your slides at with the international community could come,

620
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:48.840
could have come together and made binding rules and didn't do so.

621
00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:52.790
And then you gave a couple of examples how individual countries created rather

622
00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:54.810
restricting rules on actually preventing,

623
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.510
maybe there's haven't even within the Austrian example where there was a

624
00:44:57.511 --> 00:44:59.630
loophole in there that the printed,
um,

625
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:04.590
are there any plans to create sort of more international binding rules and if

626
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:06.900
not,
do you have any hope that the,
that there will be

627
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.520
<v 0>funny you should ask that.</v>

628
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:13.521
I was at a conference in September here in London and there were government

629
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:19.350
officials from,
Gosh,
I dunno,
Austria,
Germany,
the Netherlands,

630
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:20.184
the UK.

631
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:24.450
Somebody brought up the question of are we going to make the Washington

632
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:25.950
conference principles binding?

633
00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.590
They couldn't say no fast enough and there are actually legitimate reasons for

634
00:45:31.861 --> 00:45:35.460
that.
Uh,
it's good to have this as a framework,

635
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:39.870
but then each country has its own laws and they want to work within their own

636
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:41.930
laws.
Uh,

637
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.950
but in terms of making some sort of binding legislation,

638
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.440
I don't hold out much hope for that.

639
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:52.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

640
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:57.190
<v 3>Hi there.
Uh,
when was the last time a large,
I guess shit man or,</v>

641
00:45:57.191 --> 00:46:00.710
or a mountain of our work has been found in caves because you read a lot in the

642
00:46:00.711 --> 00:46:03.900
news that people think they found the amber room and they're in the mind

643
00:46:03.901 --> 00:46:07.160
somewhere in Germany.
But has there been recently in the past five years,

644
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.490
are people still finding salt mines worth of artwork?

645
00:46:10.491 --> 00:46:13.040
And do you have any hope that they're still out there?

646
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.340
<v 0>You hear about Nazi trains,</v>

647
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.770
but for the most part,
those end up being false.
The last big,
big,

648
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.980
big stock of looted art that was discovered was in 2012 I believe with the girl

649
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:34.050
at collection.
Have you heard about that?
Um,

650
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.520
Cornelia Scarlett was the son of a notorious Nazi dealer.

651
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.990
German customs officials were wondering why he had so much money when they saw

652
00:46:42.991 --> 00:46:43.480
him on a train.

653
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.970
They went to his flat and Munich and they found over 1200 works of art in his

654
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.350
flat in Munich.

655
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.360
That was probably the last massive hall that was found.

656
00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:00.110
What sort of conditions are those?
There is pretty good condition.
In fact,

657
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.130
they are on exhibit right now.
There's two exhibits going on.
Uh,

658
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.200
there's one in burn because for some convoluted reason gorilla passed away and

659
00:47:10.521 --> 00:47:13.640
he left all these works to the Clinton Museum Bern.

660
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.850
So Berns doing an exhibition now.
Um,

661
00:47:16.851 --> 00:47:20.660
and there's also one that I believe just closed in Bonn,
Germany,

662
00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:25.400
but it's going to reopen in Berlin in September if he wanted to visit them.

663
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:29.740
The hope is that families will come forward and claim these works of art.

664
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.560
So we'll see.
Some are very valuable,
some aren't that valuable.

665
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:36.423
Um,

666
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.580
but it did cause a huge stir when this came up and they're also restitution

667
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:46.240
researchers in Germany or who are going through the provenance of all of these

668
00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:49.840
objects trying to determine whether or not they're alluded because Garlits said

669
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:54.730
that none of these were alluded and they were all acquired legitimately and

670
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.300
there have been a few claims made on them and people have gotten 10 back works

671
00:47:58.301 --> 00:47:59.134
of art from there.

672
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:05.180
<v 4>I was just wondering if there's like maybe a positive or a negative correlation</v>

673
00:48:05.181 --> 00:48:09.440
between the type of artists versus like a gallery looking to recover a certain

674
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:14.300
type of artist does not have a positive effect or negative effect would you say?

675
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.920
<v 0>It seems like there's some artists that uh,</v>

676
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.040
tend to be looted more than others and most of them would be modern artists such

677
00:48:24.171 --> 00:48:26.120
as clamped and Sheila,

678
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.340
and it depends on who you're talking to as to whether or not it's a positive or

679
00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:32.390
negative effect.

680
00:48:32.391 --> 00:48:36.620
And how many of you have seen the movie the woman in Gold with the KLIMT

681
00:48:36.621 --> 00:48:40.760
painting that was restituted to the era of Adela block power?

682
00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.320
That was a really positive effect for the family and for the lawyer that worked

683
00:48:45.321 --> 00:48:48.890
with her.
But it had a really negative effect on the Belvedere,

684
00:48:48.891 --> 00:48:50.840
which had to give all these works back.

685
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.530
So I think it really depends on who you're talking to.

686
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.260
What was the works that Hitler was collecting?

687
00:48:58.261 --> 00:49:02.100
Where is it they the same ones that he was sort of condemning his degenerate?
No.

688
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.760
Oh No.
The works that Hitler were condemning his degenerate.

689
00:49:05.761 --> 00:49:09.180
We're either going to be destroyed,
but fortunately the Nazis Really,
oh,
hey,

690
00:49:09.181 --> 00:49:11.070
we can sell these works of art.

691
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:16.370
The types of work that Hitler and by Association the Nazis liked were

692
00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:22.280
renaissance works,
works that were ancient Greek or ancient Roman.
Um,

693
00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.390
you could show nudity,

694
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.080
but it would have to be nudity without sensuality.

695
00:49:28.081 --> 00:49:31.230
So they were much more provincial type of works.

696
00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:34.770
So was was Sheila one of the degenerative?
No,

697
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:39.590
Sheila would have been a degenerate oh,
big time.
She climp Kokoszka,

698
00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:43.460
Picasso,
Chagall,
they were all considered degenerate artists.

699
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:47.660
And I could give a whole other lecture on that.
So Hitler was condemning.

700
00:49:47.661 --> 00:49:50.150
All of those is degenerates and yet all of his sort of,

701
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:51.330
<v 1>okay.</v>

702
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:55.110
<v 0>High ranking sort of officials where we're collecting them on the side</v>

703
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.070
somewhere.
It's always more complicated than that.

704
00:49:59.071 --> 00:50:03.390
Some were collecting a modern arts.
I'm somewhere big fans of modern art.

705
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:08.220
But when the decrease went down that this type of modern art was labeled

706
00:50:08.221 --> 00:50:11.610
degenerate,
the Nazis couldn't openly collect that.

707
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.560
<v 1>Interesting.
Thank you.</v>

708
00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:18.190
<v 0>I think with that,
we'll close.
Thank you so much,
your honor.
That was fascinating</v>

709
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:19.280
<v 1>right.</v>
