00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.210
Peach,
join me and welcome Catherine

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.310
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.800
Thank

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.450
<v 1>you so much victor,
and it is so good to be with you all here today.</v>

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.673
Um,

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.010
we are delighted to be here at Google during Google gives week and I know coming

7
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:31.150
from a nonprofit and technology background how much the community here at Google

8
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:35.260
has done to support important efforts around the world and we're so appreciative

9
00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:39.520
at the Wikimedia foundation of all of the support that you have shown and given

10
00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:40.900
to us over the years.

11
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.890
And thank you so much to victor and the whole team for reaching out.
Uh,

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.950
so it's a funny story about how I got here today.

13
00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:52.510
As many of you probably know Wikipedia is written by volunteers.

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.980
What you probably don't know is that our helpline is also operated by

15
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:57.970
volunteers.

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.300
And when victor reached out last year to see if we were able to attend that

17
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.051
request,

18
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.110
didn't quite make it through the queue in time for us to be here in December.

19
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.990
But we are delighted that he reached out again this year.

20
00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:14.770
And then I'm here with you today.
So thank you so much.
All right,

21
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.890
so I'm here to tell you a little story about Wikipedia since it started in 2001

22
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.020
Wikipedia has grown into one of the world's most popular and beloved websites

23
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.100
used by hundreds of millions of people and hundreds of languages all over the

24
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:31.900
world every single month.

25
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.200
We're a little unusual in that we are a nonprofit and always will be around

26
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:38.194
Wikipedia.

27
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.260
We have a popular saying that the problem with Wikipedia is that it only works

28
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:48.820
in practice because in theory it would be a total disaster.

29
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.090
Think about it.

30
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.770
How on earth would you get all of these people from all of these backgrounds,

31
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:57.461
languages,

32
00:01:57.461 --> 00:02:02.461
and perspectives to come together to agree on anything much less a neutral

33
00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:06.670
version of truth?
Um,

34
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.850
it's a good question and I'm going to tell you a little bit about how we do that

35
00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:17.110
over the course of my talk.
But first,
before I do that,

36
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:22.111
I want to tell you a little bit about how we came to be in 2001 this guy,

37
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.280
Jimmy Wales,
had an idea.
He's a bit of a nerd,

38
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.370
bit of a Geek,
and then somebody who has always loved learning.

39
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.210
One of my favorite images of Jimmy is actually from when he was a child,

40
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.620
four years old with an encyclopedia in hand.
Unfortunately,

41
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:43.150
I can't show it here because it's not freely licensed and I will explain a

42
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:44.800
little bit about our passion for that,

43
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.930
but this photo is so Jimmy little bit of a nerd was fascinated by the way the

44
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:53.980
internet worked back in the 80s and he'd been observing the open software

45
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:58.840
movement and he'd also been thinking a lot about how he could think how to,

46
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.130
with knowledge and thinking about how a resource like Wikipedia could begin to

47
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:06.970
grow at this,
or sorry,
an encyclopedia could grow at the scale of the Internet.

48
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.460
As I mentioned,

49
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.480
he was also a little bit of a Geek and fascinated by the open source movement,

50
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.860
particularly interested in Linus is law given enough eyeballs.

51
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.360
All bugs are shallow.

52
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.590
He was interested in how you could bring a project that wasn't software but

53
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:27.940
information into being with many participants and no owners.

54
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.030
So I'll tell you a little secret.

55
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.390
His first effort failed new pedia was the precursor to Wikipedia.

56
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.460
It was also an encyclopedia based on a traditional peer reviewed model that

57
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:47.461
anyone could contribute to subject to a rigorous seven step approval process in

58
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.950
the first year 12 articles where creative

59
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.300
if failed,
Jimmy will be the first to admit this.

60
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.800
Well Jimmy and his team were trying to think about how to accelerate the

61
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.420
contribution of articles too.

62
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:06.280
We are too new pedia they created this side site.
It was a Wiki.

63
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.420
They thought people could add articles there and continue to work on them over

64
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:15.280
time.
It was based on Wiki technology,
which at the time was really new.

65
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.700
It was trying to solve for a problem that at that point in time hadn't been

66
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.610
solved for.
How do you publish quickly to the Internet?

67
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.940
I mean today that sounds like a relatively easy thing.

68
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.680
We've gotten come a long way,

69
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.460
but at the time this was a pretty exciting thing and so they created a Wiki is

70
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:35.050
sort of a holding pen for articles where people could add and improve and
update.

71
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.240
Uh,
the Wiki bus is wiki comes from a Hawaiian word Wiki Wiki,
which means quick,

72
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.430
I'm like editing quickly on the web.
And so that,

73
00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:46.840
that is actually the bus that gets you from Honolulu airport to anywhere you

74
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:48.220
need to go pretty quickly.

75
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.950
So this Wiki was a smashing success in the first year,

76
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.800
18,000 articles were created,

77
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.830
which is probably why you've never heard of new pedia.

78
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.780
Jimmy and his team recognizing a good thing quickly pivoted.

79
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.680
And by the end of the year Wikipedia had been born.

80
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.000
This is the homepage in December,

81
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.890
2001 it looks kind of the same
but a little different,

82
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.240
a little different.
Um,

83
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.070
as you can see it has articles about very high minded encyclopedic type stuff

84
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.670
like mathematics,
astronomy,
philosophy.

85
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.500
But it wasn't all science and it wasn't all traditional encyclopedic content.

86
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.000
It in the early days Wikipedia,
it was pretty wild.
And Willy and as you know,

87
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.200
anyone could add anything.

88
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.730
This is one of my favorite first drafts of history.

89
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.590
This is the article for the standard poodle,
and I know you can't see it,

90
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.150
but it is a dog by which all others are measured.

91
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.960
So today this is the article for the standard poodle,
actually just a poodle.

92
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.740
And as you can see,
it's like most Wikipedia articles.
It's well sourced,

93
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:07.730
it's well cited,
it's comprehensive,
it has a tremendous amount of knowledge.

94
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.720
It's updated over time and,
and,
and the UX has changed somewhat.

95
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.940
So the idea took off rather quickly.

96
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.540
In January of 2001 Wikipedia started with English.

97
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.170
And thanks to the efforts of polyglot editors around the world.

98
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.370
It grew by March,
2001 it was in German,

99
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.000
[inaudible] and Japanese
by May,

100
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.540
2001 it was in some of the world's largest and smaller languages.

101
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.120
And today we support nearly 300 languages in Wikipedia is large and small from

102
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:44.600
English Wikipedia,

103
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:48.800
which has 5 million articles and growing to some of the smaller Wikipedia is

104
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.830
like also Wikipedia,
which has about a thousand articles.

105
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.560
And over the course of an average month,

106
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.650
we receive a lot of visitors today about one and a half billion unique devices

107
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:03.830
come to Wikipedia every single month.
Now,

108
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:08.660
I don't have an exact unique user count,
which I think is a little unusual.
Um,

109
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.381
at Wikipedia,

110
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:13.370
we're very conscious of privacy and so we just track the devices as opposed to

111
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.570
the new unique users.

112
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.340
But we know that that represents a really significant portion of the world.

113
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.820
So I've told you a little bit about where we come from,
but how does it all work?

114
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.120
Getting back to that idea that it's a disaster in theory,

115
00:07:27.121 --> 00:07:28.650
but somehow it works in practice.

116
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.810
<v 1>I think what underlies Wikipedia at the very heart is this fundamental idea that</v>

118
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:37.520
more people want to do good than harm.

119
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.240
More people want to create knowledge,
then destroy,

120
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.200
and more people want to share then to contain.
At its core,

121
00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:48.690
Wikipedia is about human generosity.

122
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.520
But of course there are some really specific things that make it possible to,

123
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.190
the first is keeping it open.
Famously,

124
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.220
Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that everyone can edit and over time a very

125
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:09.480
significant portion of the population has on English,
Wikipedia alone.

126
00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:13.680
We know that 6 million people have contributed to articles over its 15 year

127
00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:18.000
history and that is just registered users.
As you may know,

128
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:20.520
you don't even have to register to edit Wikipedia.

129
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.350
All you have to do is click edit.

130
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.070
<v 0>Okay,</v>

131
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.010
<v 1>you can come,
you can fix something and you can move on.</v>

132
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.240
We'll never know who you were or where you came from and that's a huge part of

133
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.350
why it works.

134
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.880
It's also open in the sense that everything that we do in terms of our engine,

135
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.160
our platform underlying it is open.

136
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.220
It's based on open source technology and someone,

137
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.550
anyone can come along and add a patch or a contribution.

138
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.290
We really appreciate this.

139
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.820
It's the only way that we could scale to the number of users that we support in

140
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:51.660
the way that we do.

141
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:52.910
<v 0>Okay,</v>

142
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.950
<v 1>and it's open,
licensed.
Anybody can use the content,</v>

143
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.570
reuse the content or remix the content on any of the wiki media sites.

144
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.260
It's why you see content from Wikipedia all over the Internet.

145
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.830
No matter where you go for commercial and noncommercial purposes,

146
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.110
it's core to who we are.
We also believe in letting people make the rules.

147
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.390
No one owns Wikipedia.
Literally.
As I said,
all of the content is open.

148
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:22.430
All the licensing is open,
so I'm here from the Wikimedia foundation.

149
00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:23.910
Then we'll chat a little bit about that,

150
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.390
but what most people don't know is we're not in charge of editorial policy.

151
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.350
The people are volunteer.
Editors have set the policies over time.

152
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.610
They decide who's in,
who's out,
what's notable,
what's not,

153
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.800
what gets to stay on Wikipedia.

154
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.900
They set the standards for how to uphold our mission and what are the cores of

155
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:46.800
those policies.
If you want to edit Wikipedia today,

156
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:51.060
these are the three core policies that you need to know.
There are a lot,

157
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.410
there's a lot more to it.

158
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:56.250
Of course there are five pillars of Wikipedia and there were more than 70 pages

159
00:09:56.251 --> 00:10:00.030
of essays and things that you can learn about best practices for every

160
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:02.520
conceivable type of article you might want to write,

161
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.470
but these are the three that gets you started.
The first is verifiability.

162
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.140
Every single piece,

163
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.190
every single statement on Wikipedia needs to be cited to a secondary source.

164
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.330
You need to be able to find out where it came from and go back and verify it.

165
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.370
This is critical to who we are.

166
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.140
If Wikipedia was just an article with no way to check the citations,

167
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.300
you wouldn't know how to trust it,

168
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.620
but Wikipedia makes an implicit promise that if it's on there,

169
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.450
you can go and check and make sure that it's real neutral point of view.

170
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.850
Many of the subjects that Wikipedia covers are controversial from climate change

171
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:43.680
to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.

172
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.340
How do you write about these things in such a way that brings people together

173
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.970
and finds common truth and fact mutual point of view.

174
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.690
It means that you can cover controversy but you don't engage in it.

175
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.970
On the article about climate change.
I always find it fascinating.
It's about

176
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.850
nine tenths of the articles about science.

177
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.550
And one 10th of the article is about the controversy.

178
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.230
Wikipedians don't believe in objectivity.
Both sides have equal standing.

179
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.430
They believe in neutrality,
they present the facts as they exist in the world.

180
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:22.040
And of course no original research while knowledge is being created every single

181
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.700
day until it has been published by reliable secondary source.

182
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.590
It doesn't belong on Wikipedia.

183
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.250
There's also this rule to ignore all rules,

184
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:35.460
but that's like very advanced Wikipedia stuff.
So,
uh,

185
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.450
if you want to get into editing Wikipedia,

186
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:40.880
I suggest strongly by starting with these three and,

187
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:42.230
and working your way up to that one.

188
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.690
And then there's this aspect of Wikipedia that I love and I don't think it gets

189
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:49.460
nearly enough attention.

190
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.570
It's that we are completely relentlessly embed our,

191
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.910
um,
transparent.
I was going to say embarrassingly transparent,
but that is true to

192
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.770
all of our errors.
I think there's an article about hoaxes on Wikipedia.

193
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.000
We are tremendously transparent in everything that we do.

194
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.420
Every edit that has ever been added to Wikipedia.

195
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.410
Every revision that has ever been made,
every piece of code,

196
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.480
every patch that's ever been submitted,

197
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.720
it's all there in public because transparency is a promise to our users that

198
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:24.880
they know who we are and where we're coming from.

199
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.250
Transparency allows us to easily ferret out bias,
subtle or otherwise,

200
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.040
and address it effectively and in time.

201
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.420
It allows us to account for when we fail in our mission,

202
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.370
transparency is critical to preserving trust between us and our users.

203
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.200
And we would never have it any other way,

204
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.560
even if it does mean sometimes some of those ugly bits hangout.

205
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.630
So I mentioned earlier,
nobody owns Wikipedia and so if nobody owns Wikipedia,

206
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.900
who am I?
And what am I doing here?
Good question.
Right?
Um,

207
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.980
I am the executive director of the Wikimedia foundation.

208
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.550
The Wikimedia foundation is a nonprofit organization.

209
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.530
We're based in downtown San Francisco.

210
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.250
That's our office right down on new Montgomery Street.
You're welcome to come by.

211
00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.510
Anytime we were established in 2003 or as we like to say,

212
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:18.511
joined Wikipedia in 2003 after it was created to support and steward the sites

213
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.110
and make sure that we could support the contributors all over the world that

214
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:26.560
make them possible.
We are 277 people,

215
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.510
which is a lot for a nonprofit,

216
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.130
but very small for an organization that serves the number of people that we do

217
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.900
at the scale that we do.
So what did we do?

218
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.880
Some of this will be familiar to you.

219
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.460
I was chatting with victor before coming onstage and he said,
Oh yeah,

220
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:44.080
your breakdown of engineer's to other people.

221
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:47.380
That sounds like about right for any tech company.
Well,

222
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.350
we operate the technology that makes Wikepedia possible.

223
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.110
We run our own servers and roll our own DNS.

224
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.770
We do it all and contribute our part to the free and decentralized web.

225
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.310
It's critically important to us.
We engineered privacy,

226
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:04.840
security and speed into everything that we do.
As I mentioned,

227
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.610
we don't collect a lot of user data.

228
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.490
We want to make sure that whenever you use Wikipedia from,

229
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:13.240
no matter where you are in the world that your browsing history is secure and

230
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:17.470
private.
We want to make sure that it's fast no matter where you are.

231
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.460
If you're sitting here in mountain view on your smartphone or if you're on a

232
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:25.240
dial up connection with an old desktop box running IEE six,

233
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.610
we need to make sure that Wikipedia works for you.

234
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:29.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

235
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.570
<v 1>And a lot of people do use it.
Old dial up connections in desktop boxes.</v>

236
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:33.404
Let me tell you,

237
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.480
you guys probably know we build new features for users.

238
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.080
So I showed you the standard poodle article earlier and you can see that it has

239
00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.100
evolved over time.

240
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.060
We've also evolved from editing in Wiki text into editing with a beautiful new

241
00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:50.630
visual editor that allows you to write just as you were on a word processor.

242
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.980
We've introduced new uploaders to make access to content easier for folks to

243
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:56.990
share,
new editing interfaces,

244
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:00.440
messaging and collaboration tools and viewing experiences.

245
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.580
There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes and I love this one because I think

246
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:06.800
it's critical to who we are and our values.

247
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.910
We defend our contributors and we defend our content against legal threats.

248
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.660
We have a fund that supports contributors off from all,

249
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.670
all over the world when they are subject to harassment or threats,
we fight,

250
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.960
take down an alteration notices for content and for lawsuits that would be

251
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:28.490
frivolous or unjustified or otherwise infringe upon freedom of expression and

252
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:30.530
freedom of the right to access information.

253
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.110
It's critical to who we are and what we stand for.

254
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.050
<v 0>Okay?</v>

255
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.970
<v 1>And we support the communities that make Wikipedia possible.
As I mentioned,</v>

256
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.870
we've been edited by millions of people over the world.
Every single month,

257
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.540
tens of thousands of people edit Wikipedia.

258
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.230
On average it's about 80 to 85,000 but that number goes up and down.

259
00:15:50.231 --> 00:15:53.620
Over time people stop in,
we'll make an edit,
they'll come back.

260
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.940
But we have a really passionate core community of people who make Wikipedia

261
00:15:57.941 --> 00:16:02.710
possible.
We have 37 stewards give or take with sudo access to our sites,

262
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:04.030
which sounds crazy and it is,

263
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.110
but it's also core to who we are and we support them through training and other

264
00:16:08.111 --> 00:16:08.944
resources.

265
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:13.150
We have a hundred affiliate organizations made up of users who are passionate

266
00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:17.980
about Wikipedia all over the world.
They engage in partnerships and outreach,

267
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.510
edit Athens,
uh,

268
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.830
collaborations with museums and in educational institutions and rerun,

269
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.920
we run workshops and trainings and give away 10% of our annual budget in grants

270
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.750
every year to support their efforts.

271
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.290
And of course,
we raised the funds to support with a media.

272
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.560
We're in the bit middle of a big fundraiser.
As you may have noticed,

273
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:44.680
if you've been on our site lately,
you've seen the banners,

274
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.290
they persist until you give.
So thank you for your contribution.

275
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.110
Every year we raised the money to keep Wikipedia going.
Um,

276
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.990
the support of donors is critical to who we are.

277
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.300
And actually this year we launched an endowment campaign,
uh,

278
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.120
for $100 million in order to keep Wikipedia safe and thriving and growing in

279
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:07.990
perpetuity because we know that Wikipedia is more than just this year.

280
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.460
Wikipedia is an incredible human accomplishment that deserves to be safe
forever.

281
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.950
And who are these incredibly generous people who give to us?
Well,

282
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.611
as I mentioned,

283
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:23.960
we're a hundred percent donation funded and we receive if received donations

284
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:27.800
from around two and a half million people all around the globe every single
year,

285
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.060
literally all around the globe from very small donations in places you wouldn't

286
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:36.110
expect to significant contributions from generous folks in your,

287
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:40.820
our own backyard.
Our current operating budget is around $63 million,

288
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.770
which is,
as I said,

289
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:43.980
<v 0>okay,</v>

290
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.610
<v 1>we're a small nonprofit,
particularly for one that runs such a large website.</v>

291
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.540
And of course it's not just Wikipedia.
So you,

292
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.850
Wikipedia is probably the project that you've heard of.

293
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:55.950
It's the largest and it's the most popular,

294
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.010
but we run 12 other free knowledge projects as well.

295
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.680
Some of these you might be familiar with wiki quote,

296
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.310
which is a quote resource which scenary a free dictionary.

297
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.870
Wikimedia Commons.

298
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.550
These are incredibly important to the infrastructure of the wicked media

299
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.140
ecosystem of knowledge.

300
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.890
We can media Commons is where you find all of those beautiful images that

301
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:21.780
illustrate we compete IA articles and we can media Commons er's are just as

302
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.610
enthusiastic and passionate as the editors of the encyclopedia.
In fact,

303
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.530
they run the world's largest photo competition as recognized by the Guinness

304
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.820
Book of World Records every single year to bringing in incredible images from

305
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:39.180
wiki loves earth and Wiki loves monuments that document our shared human

306
00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:43.740
heritage and then we have other projects like Wiki data which are a little bit

307
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:47.400
newer and into my mind,
incredibly exciting wiki data.

308
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.610
You could think of it as a structured data backend to all the knowledge that is

309
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:53.670
contained within Wikimedia media.
We've begun developing it.

310
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:59.090
It's also all volunteer developed and contributed to and we see it as the future

311
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:00.030
for beginning.

312
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.680
Being able to run increasingly complex queries and ways finding ways of

313
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:07.560
engagement for all the knowledge that's on Wikipedia today.

314
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.260
We think that this is the future of where we're going.

315
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.320
And then of course there's MediaWiki.
As I've mentioned earlier,

316
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:20.010
it's a free and open source wiki software.
It's an application that we,

317
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.210
that we run and maintain.
It's built on a big sticky ball of PHP,

318
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.240
which we love and hate all in equal measure but is also core to our mission

319
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:30.870
because as you probably know,

320
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:33.960
PHP is an incredibly easy language for folks to learn.

321
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:37.440
That's taught all over the world,
which I don't know about,
incredibly easy,

322
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:42.150
but it's the language,
it's a language that is taught all over the world,

323
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.720
which is core to our mission because it means that no matter where you are you

324
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:50.250
can contribute back to who we are and the and the underlying platform that runs

325
00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:53.250
us.
And it runs a number of other projects as well,

326
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.090
including ones you may have heard of such as knowledge sharing projects in NASA

327
00:19:57.091 --> 00:20:01.800
and SF Moma.
So I've told you a little bit about where we come from.

328
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:04.650
I've told you a little bit about how we work and I've told you a little bit

329
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:06.690
about who the Wikimedia foundation is,

330
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.320
so now I want to share where we're going or where we hope to go in the future.

331
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.680
I want to tell you about that great big vision that keeps we comedians coming

332
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:14.760
back every single day.

333
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.490
Our vision statement at the Wikimedia media in the Wikimedia movement as we call

334
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:25.491
ourselves is to imagine a world in which every single human can freely Sha share

335
00:20:25.831 --> 00:20:30.600
in the sum of all knowledge.
Personally,
I think this is pretty profound.

336
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.790
I also recognize that we may never get there,

337
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.240
but that's part of the reason that makes it so compelling.

338
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:41.241
It's part of why we keep working against it and as I was preparing to come in

339
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:42.234
today,

340
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.750
I spent some time looking at Google's mission statement and I was reminded of

341
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:47.280
how much we have in common.

342
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.130
We all believe that information should be available to the world.

343
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.230
We also believe that knowledge is alive and growing and that it is most useful

344
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.060
when it is used,
not just static,
but engaged with built upon,

345
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.650
expanded on.
That's the share in our mission statement.
It's the useful in yours.

346
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.220
We also know that there's so much further that we have to go.

347
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.070
We're nowhere near yet achieving that incredible vision.

348
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:13.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

349
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.390
<v 1>As I said,
there's so much more to do.</v>

350
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.400
Wikipedia often feels like the universe constantly expanding outwards.

351
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.160
When you dip into an article and start clicking through links,

352
00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:27.240
do you find yourself very quickly expanding outwards,

353
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.810
particularly with your tabs?
Um,

354
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.650
you can find almost anything and it feels like as far as you explore,

355
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:37.920
it just keeps going.
It feels like we have an article for everything,

356
00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:42.270
but in fact renewer even close.
So English Wikipedia,

357
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.200
which is widely regarded as the most complete,
has 5 million articles,

358
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.320
which sounds like a lot,
but it is not a lot.

359
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.980
So one car,
as I mentioned earlier,

360
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:55.950
there are a number of different policies as to what goes in and out of
Wikipedia.

361
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.700
But a critical criteria on is the criteria of notability.

362
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.330
Is something notable for whatever it is.
It doesn't mean that it's famous.

363
00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:07.410
It just means is it notable for its contribution to the field that it is in.

364
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.990
And one Wikipedia user user Emi Jrp.
I've never met them,

365
00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:14.040
don't know who they are,

366
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.420
but they keep this wonderful running tally of things worth knowing in the world.

367
00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:22.620
Notable things.
Every major work of art hanging in every major museum,

368
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:27.510
every village ever settled.
Every scientific discovery,
every book ever written,

369
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.130
every animal or plant that has lived.
Every notable human user.

370
00:22:32.131 --> 00:22:35.970
Emi JRP estimates that there are 17 million notable humans alone.

371
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.120
<v 0>Okay?</v>

372
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.780
<v 1>We only have 1.6 million biographies of notable people on Wikipedia,</v>

373
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.280
and this doesn't include all the knowledge that's created every single day

374
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.720
altogether.
User Emi JRP estimates.

375
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:52.540
There are 104 million and notable things in the world,

376
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.050
and last year this was 91 million.
So the number keeps ticking upwards

377
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.670
as of today.

378
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.880
That means that there are 99 million articles missing from Wikipedia,

379
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:05.850
<v 0>okay?</v>

380
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.140
<v 1>And that's just an English.</v>

381
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.730
That's only 20% we only have 20% of the world's knowledge in English.

382
00:23:11.731 --> 00:23:14.790
Wikipedia today we've barely gotten started

383
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.650
so we know that there is more to do in terms of the knowledge that is being

384
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.970
collected and shared.
We also know that the world is changing.

385
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.290
Our vision doesn't just call on all us for all the world's knowledge and also

386
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:33.070
Kale calls on us for every single human to freely share in that knowledge.

387
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.310
What does the world look like when we think about every single human,

388
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.880
so we could,
pedia is really big in Russia,

389
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.980
we get about a billion page views every single month and we're huge.
In Japan.

390
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.070
It's the second largest Wikipedia in terms of traffic.

391
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.040
We're also wildly popular in Germany.

392
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.640
We're nearly 80% of German users use us on a regular basis.

393
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.130
These represent some of the biggest and most vibrant of our Wikipedia shows and

394
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:05.210
yet in 30 years they also represent the places where people,

395
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:10.340
populations are declining around the world and this is where the world is

396
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:11.174
growing.

397
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:16.580
By 2100 the population of the content of the continent of Africa is going to be

398
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:20.210
around 4.4 billion for our point of reference.

399
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:24.980
By 2100 the population of the entire world will be just over 10 billion,

400
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.440
which means that the population of Africa,

401
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.340
the continent will be roughly half the population of the world.

402
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.700
And where's Wikipedia on this?
Well,

403
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.270
only 2.2% of our page views come from this continent.

404
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.750
Only 2.5% of content in English.

405
00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:46.550
Wikipedia has anything to do with the African continent.
It's geography,

406
00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:47.960
it's people,
it's history.

407
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.770
And outside of English we have an even bigger distance to make up the largest of

408
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:58.940
the,
um,
the largest of the solely African languages.

409
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.710
And Wikipedia is,
is your Ruba.

410
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.310
Ruba has about 32,000 articles you but also has about 31 or sorry,

411
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.350
uh,
30 million speakers.
So 31,000 articles for 30 million speakers.

412
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.680
Another enormous African language is Hausa,

413
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.750
which is spoken widely across west Africa.

414
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.800
It is spoken by 44 million people and it only has about 1.4.

415
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.690
Well actually not even one point 1,400 articles and Wikipedia.

416
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:29.560
That is incredibly what you would think would be incredibly large PR,

417
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.411
which is Arabic.

418
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:35.411
Wikipedia also spoken on the continent of Africa has only 350,000 articles.

419
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:40.010
I'm sorry,
450,000 articles for 420 million speakers.

420
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.380
So there is a really big gap between where we are today and where we need to go

421
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:49.490
in order to actually start to meet that vision statement of every single human.

422
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.040
And why does this all matter?

423
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.100
I mean not just because we're Wikipedia and we want it to matter,

424
00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:56.780
but why does this actually matter?

425
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.850
When we firmly believe that knowledge creates understanding and that in today's

426
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:04.010
world,
understanding is sorely lacking.

427
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.370
It's something that we should double down on it.
Something that's important.

428
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.920
It's not just for us about learning,
which you can do on every Wikipedia article.

429
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.700
It's also that discourse and finding truth together.

430
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.700
We need spaces for public discourse.

431
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.800
Wikipedia is one of these spaces when multiple viewpoints are shared alongside

432
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:27.170
of each other for the reasons of why they're there,

433
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:31.730
we get a clear picture of the truth,
which is exactly how Wikipedia works.

434
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.490
Most people don't realize that when they come to Wikipedia,

435
00:26:34.491 --> 00:26:38.600
they're seeing only about re like roughly 50% of what Wikipedia is.

436
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.280
You're visiting the article,

437
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.520
but behind the article there's something called a talk page and a talk page is

438
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:48.240
like a public forum on everything that Wikipedia contains.

439
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.400
It's where editors hash it out from the citations to notability to truth to

440
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:58.110
emerging details of sciences and when things should be incorporated in to what

441
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:03.111
is common knowledge and science and studies have shown that this process

442
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:07.260
actually hasn't profound impact on those who participate in it.

443
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.990
It's not just about the content on the article,

444
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:13.080
but it's about the discourse that goes into the process.

445
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.120
Slanted Wikipedia editors,

446
00:27:15.121 --> 00:27:19.320
people who come in with a bias actually become more neutral over time.

447
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.490
Wikipedia literally can create understanding through editing.

448
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.900
<v 0>Okay,</v>

449
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.600
<v 1>and we believe that this is what the world needs today,</v>

450
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.280
that the world needs free,

451
00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:34.930
unbiased knowledge that we need truth and understanding as you know.

452
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.450
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

453
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.810
<v 1>information and its reliability has been in the news a lot lately.</v>

454
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:44.610
Wikipedia has certainly been aware of this conversation.

455
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.590
People are making real life changing decisions based on what they read on the

456
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:51.960
Internet.
That's kind of scary

457
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.490
as we could pedia.

458
00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.380
We want to make sure that the information that you're receiving is accurate,

459
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:06.300
reliable,
and trustworthy and that we're a place to go to have conversation,

460
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.670
but it's not just about us.

461
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.160
There is an urgency and responsibility to all of our work here in this room.

462
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.830
We know that the web is becoming less open.

463
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.350
We know that privacy is increasingly losery.

464
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.520
We know that the window of public discourse is narrowing globally and that

465
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:25.800
reliable sources of truth are up for debate.

466
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.030
We believe that what Wikipedia and free knowledge stands for is more important

467
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:33.540
than ever and the access and participation are our commitment.

468
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:35.550
Verifiability and neutrality,

469
00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:40.230
discourse and communication resolution perspective in history.

470
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.060
This is what we do and we do it with all of our human flaws because we are

471
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:47.250
created by people.
We do it pretty well.

472
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.773
<v 0>Okay?</v>

473
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.740
<v 1>We also know that we have a lot of work to do.</v>

474
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:54.170
I showed you some of those trends in the world.

475
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.970
This means that there are great challenges but extraordinary possibilities
ahead.

476
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.630
We will continue to fight for that truth and that understanding and that

477
00:29:02.631 --> 00:29:06.680
knowledge,
but we also want to do it together,

478
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.150
not just in this room,

479
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.480
not just with the folks here at Google and not just at the Wikimedia foundation.

480
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.951
At our core,

481
00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:16.940
we believe that every single human needs to participate in this process.

482
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.210
The premise that given enough eyes,
all bugs are shallow.

483
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.060
That human generosity that I referenced earlier,

484
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.080
that more people want to do good than harm.
That together,

485
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.800
if we work together and if we come to it with commitment to openness that we can

486
00:29:30.801 --> 00:29:35.150
freely share in the sum of all knowledge and increase understanding around the

487
00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:35.984
world.

488
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.700
So we'd ask you to join us in whatever way that makes sense.

489
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.780
We'd ask you to contribute code,
we'd ask you to make an edit,

490
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.550
we'd ask you to make a donation.

491
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.050
We believe that we're in this together and that and together we will find

492
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:53.500
ourselves in that world in which we imagine so.
Thank you.

493
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.280
<v 0>Thank you very much.
No,
I'm good.</v>

494
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.490
<v 1>I know you all have a lot of questions for Catherine invites Katherine to have a</v>

495
00:30:04.491 --> 00:30:08.450
seat here and I will start a few questions to warm up and that you ask your

496
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:09.284
questions.

497
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.970
So just now you said,
uh,

498
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.620
like a fun fact is when you mentioned QHP was a very easy to learn language,

499
00:30:20.631 --> 00:30:24.960
a lot of people until laughter and yeah,
just like,
uh,

500
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.550
there's a lot of opinions here and I want to start with a little one.

501
00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.580
Like what's your favorite Wiki page?
Oh my gosh.
Oh,

502
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.300
so my favorite one?
Well,
my favorite Wiki page is a good question.

503
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.810
My favorite Wikipedia article is the overview effect.

504
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.640
As anyone here familiar with the overview effect?
No,

505
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.540
the overview effect is a phenomenon that,
uh,

506
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.040
affects astronauts when they go into space.
The,

507
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.903
um,

508
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.740
as far as sort of reported and described it is the sense sensation when you're

509
00:30:56.741 --> 00:31:01.540
floating above Earth in orbit that the world is very small and very fragile and

510
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:04.480
that the differences that divide us are much smaller than the differences that

511
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:05.980
bring us together.
And I,

512
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:10.720
I've always thought of it as this incredibly beautiful analogy for the world.
Um,

513
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.600
and I also was a really practical one.
You're out there,

514
00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:17.470
you're vulnerable and you're looking at home and home is,
that's it.

515
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:20.200
It's just home.
It's all of our home.
So that's my favorite article.

516
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:24.490
My favorite Wikipedia page is a page that it's an essay.
Um,

517
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.980
I mentioned there are 70 pages of essay is probably more,

518
00:31:26.981 --> 00:31:30.250
a lot more books worth of them that Wikipedia editors,
right?

519
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.450
So that 104 million articles,
that's an essay,
the notable things in the world.

520
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.290
But my favorite is actually one that says there is no such thing as a reader.

521
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.420
And what the author meant by that is that there is no such thing as somebody who

522
00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:48.250
reads Wikipedia and comes away with just a transactional interaction because

523
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:50.530
every reader can become an editor and a contributor.

524
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.870
And we're all changed by the experience of learning.

525
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.770
So that's probably my favorite.
Wow.
That's okay.
Yeah.

526
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:59.480
So my second question is,

527
00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:04.490
I bet a lot of Google areas will have this same question.
Yeah.
Is that,
uh,

528
00:32:04.491 --> 00:32:05.810
we know that,
um,

529
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:11.590
Wikipedia we can media foundation is completely based on donation and each year

530
00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:15.890
as I put in my campaign for fundraising,

531
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:21.130
we could media foundation was one ed almost a one 70th of fun in compared to a,

532
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.470
uh,
a website with a similar traffic.

533
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.560
So how would it be possible for such a large side run on such an efficient fund?

534
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.300
Ooh,
a duct tape sticks.
Glue.
No,

535
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.930
in seriousness,
it is,
it is because first of all,

536
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:45.470
it's because of the contribution of the many donors who make it possible.
Um,

537
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:49.070
Wikipedia would not be able to have scaled to the size that we are today without

538
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:52.190
support.
When we first ran our very first fundraising campaign,

539
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:55.970
it was practically to keep the servers from overheating and keep the thing on,

540
00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.000
um,
as we grew.
But in reality,

541
00:32:59.001 --> 00:33:02.270
I think that it's because everyone who comes to work with the Wikimedia

542
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:05.510
foundation is just hugely passionate about what they do.

543
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:09.180
They're there for the mission and they give their all to it.
Um,

544
00:33:09.181 --> 00:33:10.730
and because we are so open,

545
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.630
we get support from folks who are outside of the foundation as well.

546
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:18.320
So I mentioned the 37 stewards who have pseudo access to the sites.

547
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:19.710
That's not a joke.
Um,

548
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.420
we actually have people all over the world who are volunteers who are trusted
in,

549
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:27.890
uh,
uh,
in terms of maintaining and managing the sites with us.

550
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:30.770
And so it's actually through open collaboration with the community that makes it

551
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:31.604
possible.

552
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.330
But of course we're also just really thirsty because every donor dollar matters

553
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:38.900
a lot and we have to think a lot about how we prioritize in order to keep the

554
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:43.250
site's up.
Yeah.
And uh,
another question from me is,

555
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.210
um,
like s such a successful project,

556
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.240
what do you think people can learn from the Wikipedia project nowadays?

557
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.700
I do believe that it is to have faith in people.

558
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.990
I know that that sounds hopelessly simple,
but I think it's true.

559
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:03.530
I do believe that Wikipedia actually is evidence that more people want to do

560
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:07.310
good than harm.
It's also evidence that if you give people information,

561
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:10.850
they can do really good things with it.
We haven't had these challenges that,

562
00:34:10.851 --> 00:34:14.970
for example,
fake news as has it has been in the discourse because we compete,

563
00:34:14.971 --> 00:34:16.010
he is completely open.

564
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.910
If you give people context and the ability to find out where information comes

565
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:23.540
from,
they generally tend to use that information to make good decisions.

566
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.140
So have faith in people,
be open to collaboration,

567
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:31.100
be transparent about your intention.
And definitely one that we talk about a lot.

568
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.780
Own it up when you make a mistake.

569
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.680
That's pretty critical in terms of having trust with your users and your

570
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:37.514
community.

571
00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:42.510
<v 2>As you talk about like the Wiki data and our [inaudible] team,</v>

572
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:48.030
like my team is actually the liquid was like knowledge graph indexing system.

573
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.740
And as you mentioned the north data.
I'm just like curious,

574
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:56.060
curious about is there any ongoing efforts or plan to work with Google?

575
00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:59.790
Because I saw lots of like similar like epilepsy,

576
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.960
dom [inaudible].
Okay.
Pedia and also by Google.
So I'm curious,

577
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:08.310
is there any efforts or we can do together rather than separate finish up by

578
00:35:08.311 --> 00:35:10.260
Google and by Wikipedia,
right,
sure.

579
00:35:10.261 --> 00:35:14.950
And I think Google can also contribute a lot of data back to Wikipedia.
See?

580
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.110
So will you cure it?
Lots by lots of data from Wikipedia.

581
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.560
<v 1>So I mean we are really open and interested in finding ways to work with Google.</v>

582
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.250
We've found that we've had a lot of successful collaborations in the past and

583
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:30.810
actually wiki data,
um,
about two years ago.

584
00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:35.640
Do you remember freebase?
Yes.
Familiar with it.
Right.
So a freebase was,

585
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.900
was I think shut down as a,

586
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.620
but all of the information or the data is the data is still living.

587
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.510
And in fact Wikipedia editors or sorry,

588
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:46.620
Wiki data editors have been working to take a significant portion of that data

589
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:50.460
that was contained in freebase and integrated into Wiki data solving for some of

590
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:53.850
the challenges that freebase hot in terms of building a community and handling

591
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:57.960
some of the more difficult challenges of taxonomy for the different formats of

592
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:01.470
data.
So I think I would certainly be interested in thinking about how we could

593
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:03.480
collaborate together and I'd love to chat afterwards.
Yeah.

594
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.200
<v 3>Wikipedia has done a great job at curating knowledge and giving an accurate view</v>

595
00:36:08.201 --> 00:36:09.640
of knowledge to the,
to the world.

596
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:14.110
With the advent of fake news,

597
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:19.180
do you think there's an opportunity of doing wiki news as a curated method of

598
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.940
offering reliable,
accurate news to the world?

599
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.680
<v 1>So,
uh,
well full disclosure because it's,
as I mentioned,
we're super transparent.</v>

600
00:36:26.681 --> 00:36:30.970
We can use exists and it has never taken off as a project for a variety of

601
00:36:30.971 --> 00:36:33.230
reasons.
Um,
you can go to new,

602
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.130
like I think it's [inaudible] dot org and you can find different language

603
00:36:36.131 --> 00:36:40.320
versions of it.
My guess is it has a combination to do with um,

604
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.000
some of the challenges that you would see in lesser traffic,

605
00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:45.070
Wikipedia articles you need sort of a critical mass.

606
00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:49.120
But I do think is really interesting is that we could [inaudible] just outside

607
00:36:49.121 --> 00:36:52.720
of Wiki news back on Wikipedia now cause there are different projects have

608
00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:57.810
developed a way of writing articles about breaking news that is tremendously

609
00:36:57.821 --> 00:36:59.140
well trafficked.
Um,

610
00:36:59.141 --> 00:37:04.000
so the first two that I'm aware of as a breaking news story that really sort of

611
00:37:04.001 --> 00:37:09.001
hit the mainstream was unfortunately the shootings at Virginia Tech many years

612
00:37:09.551 --> 00:37:11.050
back.
But,
um,

613
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.860
over the course of time Wikipedians have developed protocols for how to write

614
00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:19.630
breaking news articles that are often cited within sort of the mainstream press

615
00:37:19.631 --> 00:37:21.910
and shared among journalists on Twitter and the like.

616
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.640
And what we have found have been incredible resources,

617
00:37:24.641 --> 00:37:29.470
particularly in times of uncertainty and lack of understanding and in a emerging

618
00:37:29.471 --> 00:37:30.304
news event,

619
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.760
because what we compete Ian's do is they curate from all across all these

620
00:37:33.761 --> 00:37:38.260
different news sources.
So if you imagine in let's say a natural disaster,

621
00:37:38.261 --> 00:37:41.860
you've got all these different news sources on the ground and everybody's

622
00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:43.360
reporting their one perspective on it.

623
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.830
Wikipedians are taking that and making that into holistic survey of all the news

624
00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:51.190
that's out there.
So I've always personally having,
uh,

625
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.220
just based on my own interest in,
in the fourth estate and the,

626
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.150
and the importance of journalism is an entity with an open societies have been

627
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:00.910
very interested in what we could do to help surface that.

628
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:05.710
As a reliable resource that is almost like a compliment to individual stories as

629
00:38:05.711 --> 00:38:09.180
they occur.
So I think like a pedia has a role to play and I think it in the,

630
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.540
at the moment editors are very interested in how exactly do we navigate that

631
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:17.960
without necessarily moving away from sort of the core of who we are.
Um,

632
00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.080
in terms of our policies in the like,

633
00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:26.020
<v 3>would there be any way to like highlight that as a on a newsfeed that sort of</v>

634
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:26.850
not

635
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:30.260
<v 1>yes,
and we've actually been working on developing that.
Uh,</v>

636
00:38:30.261 --> 00:38:33.870
so we now have an API to pull from breaking news events and if anybody is

637
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:38.770
interested in talking about that,
another product.
So nowadays,

638
00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:40.690
nowadays if you've got the APP downloaded,

639
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:44.050
you can actually receive alerts when things start breaking because we'll see

640
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:47.530
based on the surge in traffic and the increase in editors and the creation of a

641
00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:49.840
new article when something is happening in the world.

642
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.660
<v 3>So it's an app that just does news without the rest of the Wikipedia.</v>

643
00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:58.520
<v 1>Not yet.
The 277 people makes it really hard to spin off product.</v>

644
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.390
Although certainly it would be something that is actually under the terms of

645
00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:06.350
what we do,
would be open for folks to work on with us and develop it.

646
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.950
You just got to be some alerts.
Media,
sorry you said alerts.
Uh,
yes,

647
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.560
it's,
it's in Beta.
So I'm sorry,

648
00:39:13.561 --> 00:39:16.050
the question was can you actually receive alerts from the Wikipedia App?

649
00:39:16.051 --> 00:39:18.730
And the answer is yes,
it's a,
it's a Beta feature that you can turn on.

650
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.600
<v 3>Um,
you mentioned that we can,</v>

651
00:39:20.601 --> 00:39:24.210
media is a nonprofit and will always be a nonprofit.
Yeah.
So I was interested,

652
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.020
how do you,
um,
you know,
deal with monetization and um,

653
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.130
what's the guiding principle that keeps you from monetizing at some point down

654
00:39:32.131 --> 00:39:35.940
the road?
And second question was,
um,
you mentioned that a lot of editors,

655
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.560
a lot of articles or an English,

656
00:39:37.561 --> 00:39:41.760
a lot of editors come from the western part of the world and sometimes even

657
00:39:41.761 --> 00:39:45.270
though people will try to be objective,
there's unconscious biases.

658
00:39:45.271 --> 00:39:48.050
And even when you present the facts,
there is a way to promote,
you know,

659
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.240
cause that the facts that promote a,
an opinion that you would favor.

660
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.830
So how do you go about,

661
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.730
I'm just making sure that we have editors from all parts of the world.

662
00:39:56.731 --> 00:39:59.070
So in some way these unconscious biases balanced out.

663
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.770
<v 1>So the first question is actually the easy one to answer.
Uh,</v>

664
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.090
so back in 2001 when Wikipedia was first created,

665
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.490
there was conversation about should we run ads,

666
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:11.170
should it be monetized in some way?

667
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:16.240
And the community of editors at that point were very clear in,
in,
um,

668
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.790
in their decision that it shouldn't be.
In fact,
again,

669
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:20.890
the skits ins are sort of like the history of Wikipedia.

670
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:25.810
The Spanish Wikipedia threatened to fork and take all of Spanish Wikipedia away,

671
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:31.000
um,
with them and less Wikipedia was committed to being a noncommercial nonprofit

672
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:34.510
organization.
And that's where the history of that comes from.
Uh,

673
00:40:34.511 --> 00:40:37.960
I think that in terms of monetization or at running ads,
you know,

674
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:40.540
we say never say never,
but no.
Um,

675
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.190
basically because it's really core to the values of our community that they

676
00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:49.420
believe that if we start moving in that direction bias might be introduced

677
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:51.160
because we might not want to offend an,
you know,

678
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:54.760
an advertiser or the leg and we would start to grapple with some challenges that

679
00:40:54.761 --> 00:40:56.080
we currently don't have today.

680
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.890
So not running ads for us as core to our independence and independence is what

681
00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:02.120
we believe is core to our model.
Um,

682
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:06.220
which actually gets a little bit to your second question in terms of how do you

683
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.800
confront bias?
And I think you're absolutely right,

684
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.610
unconscious bias and implicit bias.
It's something we think about a lot,
um,
at,

685
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.410
at the Wikimedia foundation and it's something many of our editors think about

686
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:19.660
as well.
So in the last year alone,

687
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:24.490
we've set aside around half a million dollars to a in community grants,

688
00:41:24.491 --> 00:41:28.990
small grants to community members to address issues of,
um,
culture,

689
00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:29.980
toxic behavior,

690
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:34.340
which might increase prefer example by driving out certain certain contributors,

691
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.900
certain forms of contribution that could address by us ways of encouraging

692
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:42.200
editors to run events and edit a thons to address bias.

693
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.890
I think that there are now we comedians when they edit Wikipedia,

694
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:48.370
when they do it as a social event,
they do this thing called an edit.
Ethan,

695
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.460
like a Hackathon,
right?

696
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:53.960
They're an entire edit Athens that now bring people together to focus on editing

697
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:57.350
within an article as opposed to creating new articles in order to look for

698
00:41:57.351 --> 00:41:59.780
unconscious bias on a variety of subjects.

699
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:05.020
We at the foundation are deeply committed to improving diversity in the

700
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:05.721
projects,

701
00:42:05.721 --> 00:42:10.580
and I don't just mean that in terms of diversity of demographic,

702
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.880
in terms of ethnicity for example,
but diversity of viewpoints,

703
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:15.650
diversity of backgrounds.

704
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.220
We actually at our conference in North America this year had a cause.

705
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:22.790
We have these conferences for community members had this wonderful track that

706
00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:27.080
included someone speaking on the importance of supporting Haitian creole as a

707
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:28.130
Wikipedia language.

708
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:32.720
Somebody speaking about Trans bias and a ratio of trans people on Wikipedia and

709
00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:37.721
how to edit in sensitivity to that and how to address the persistent gender gap

710
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.730
that exists.
So on Wikipedia today,

711
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.810
I mentioned we have 1.6 million biog million.
No one point,
sorry.

712
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:48.800
1.3 million biographies of living or notable people,

713
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.670
only 16% of that,
uh,
of those biographies are about women,

714
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:57.500
which is a huge gap.
It also record reflects a gap in broader society.

715
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.650
So implicit bias is not just something we could pedia deals with.

716
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.640
We rely on secondary sources and if secondary sources aren't written about other

717
00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:07.790
perspectives,
if they are entire swathes of people,

718
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:10.160
our ma or missing from popular discourse,

719
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.290
then they're probably missing from Wikipedia too.

720
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.240
So we start with our own community,

721
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:18.320
but we're deeply invested in making sure that folks know that this is a
priority,

722
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:19.260
not just for Wikipedia,

723
00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:23.000
but advocating for this as a priority around the world and in other forms of

724
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:26.060
publication and media as well.
That's a great question.
Thank you.

725
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.340
I'm very passionate about it,
so I appreciate you asking it.

726
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.210
<v 4>All right.
So,
um,
there's a couple of,
I guess,</v>

727
00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:35.580
issues that I know you have to deal with.
So one is controversial pages where,
um,

728
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.210
I mean,
you know,
that they're,
you know,
some,

729
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.330
some particular articles when they were sort of freely editable,

730
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.080
people would just,
you know,
you would get completely one sided things there.

731
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.750
There were problems with that.
And then,
um,

732
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:51.220
so I know that some pages have to have sort of restrictions on editing and the

733
00:43:51.221 --> 00:43:52.120
other,
um,

734
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.890
sort of similar issues that I notice a lot of pages have a have comments at the

735
00:43:56.891 --> 00:44:00.580
top that say that they need cleanup and they need to cite citations and so on.

736
00:44:00.581 --> 00:44:03.310
So for those two sort of issues,
I'm wondering,

737
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.080
do you have sort of plans for dealing with them?

738
00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:08.170
Do you feel like they're getting better over time?
Are they less of an issue?

739
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.223
Are they getting worse?

740
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.600
<v 1>So a couple of different sort of themes in there.
Uh,</v>

741
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.720
we in a good sort of rule of thumb for Wikipedia article is the more popular it

742
00:44:18.961 --> 00:44:22.750
is,
the more accurate and well cited and um,

743
00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:27.300
and neutral it is going to be,
it's,
it's akin to the formation of a diamond,

744
00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:30.210
right?
You start with carbon and with tremendous amount of pressure,

745
00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:34.290
all those eyes on all those bugs,
it becomes something Krystallynn and clear.

746
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.240
That's kind of how Wikipedia articles work.

747
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:40.290
So you have the most popular articles tend to be like 300 citations,

748
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.830
350 citations for the article and Barack Obama,
for example.
Um,

749
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:49.110
the smaller articles that get less traffic,
this,
this remains a challenge.

750
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.510
What we have seen though is if,
for example,

751
00:44:51.511 --> 00:44:56.400
some random smaller article does for some reason end up as part of the public

752
00:44:56.401 --> 00:45:00.970
conversation,
the quality improves very quickly to those articles.
Uh,

753
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.460
we do have Wikipedians who are very focused on improving like citation cleanups,

754
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.660
but we at the foundation have also been working to support this from a product

755
00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:10.261
perspective.

756
00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:14.370
So recently we've collaborated with the Internet archive to clean up every dead

757
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:17.920
citation on English,
Wikipedia.
And over the course of the year replace,

758
00:45:17.921 --> 00:45:22.920
I think it was a million plus citations that were dead links in order to improve

759
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.780
that verifiability of content.

760
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.460
We've also been working with editors in building and supporting editor created

761
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.140
because we could then we immediate foundation,

762
00:45:31.141 --> 00:45:35.550
we'll build sort of advanced tooling for editors to track new articles and their

763
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:36.384
creation.

764
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.900
But our community members also build these tools and then we host them in our

765
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:43.010
own cloud.
It's not,
I know it's not Google cloud,
but we have,

766
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.660
we have our own cloud service called called Wikimedia labs.

767
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.890
And so we work with our editors who build these tools in order to support them

768
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:53.850
and make sure that we've got a sort of robust systems for ensuring their support

769
00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:57.030
over time.
And those will look at things like how do you improve the,

770
00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:59.040
the triage workflow for new articles?

771
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.180
How do you identify articles with citation issues so that editors can improve

772
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:04.800
their workflows and automated ways.

773
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.370
We're very passionate in fact about embracing things like machine learning,

774
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.610
which we think are going to really be able to take help Wikipedia editors take

775
00:46:11.611 --> 00:46:15.420
that next step forward.
We talk about doing the things that we talked about,

776
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:18.310
introducing machines to do the things that humans can,
um,

777
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.180
to do the things that humans can do.

778
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.590
But take away some of those efforts from those more boring sort of wrote

779
00:46:25.591 --> 00:46:28.650
functions in order to allow humans to focus on the really sort of advanced

780
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:30.720
capacity of the creation of knowledge.

781
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:34.140
So that sort of a couple of different approaches that we're taking to it.

782
00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:35.580
But it remains,
I mean,
as you said,

783
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:38.550
it remains something that is a challenge for us over time,

784
00:46:38.551 --> 00:46:40.650
but it's sort of how the model works.

785
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.900
<v 5>Okay.
So my next question is more about like numbers.</v>

786
00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.400
So you pretty much talked a lot about how we keep Edr grown like in the past

787
00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.950
where it should be like where the gap is,

788
00:46:51.951 --> 00:46:56.951
but what's your expectation will be the growth rates the next five years and how

789
00:46:57.291 --> 00:46:59.060
do you expect to impact your budget?

790
00:46:59.061 --> 00:47:02.690
I think you mentioned a 63 minutes per year now.
Right?

791
00:47:02.691 --> 00:47:04.890
So what's your expectation?

792
00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:09.870
So for essentially liquidation is like how would you expect,
um,

793
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:14.090
how efficient do you expect to have a tron by the nation's?
Pretty much,
right?

794
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.570
It depends on the growth rate and what would be the impact on the budget.

795
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.600
<v 1>Sure.
So,
I mean,</v>

796
00:47:18.601 --> 00:47:23.280
every additional user for us is a net positive in terms of being somebody who

797
00:47:23.281 --> 00:47:25.410
may become a supporter in terms of the budget.

798
00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:30.070
But we recognize that it has to be balanced by both growth in of the overall

799
00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:34.180
base of supporters,
but also increase efficiency on our backend.
Right?

800
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:38.740
So wiki media Commons,
35 million free images,
I mean that,
that is a lot for us.

801
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:43.120
We recognize that,
um,
that puts us in the top echelon of media sites,

802
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:46.570
but it's not nearly the number of photos that other sites handle on a daily

803
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:49.750
basis.
We would love more rich media on Wiki media.

804
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:52.330
We also recognize that should that come to pass,

805
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.540
we have a whole new set of exciting challenges in terms of how we,
uh,

806
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.500
support in scale for that.
In terms of our overall projected growth,

807
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.840
we're a little bit unusual in that the only thing that we have to sort of

808
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:07.180
measure for is our progress against our mission.

809
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:12.210
So we're not necessarily tracking about how we enter into markets or how quickly

810
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:15.490
we're growing as,
um,
as,

811
00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:18.520
as sort of a main metric for,
um,

812
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.910
for our shareholders or anything like that.
Uh,

813
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:25.450
we have tried more aggressive approaches into entering into new markets and

814
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:28.390
found that really it actually from our perspective,

815
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:32.950
because we are a combination of community content and readers,

816
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:36.310
it has to be something that's more organic.
It doesn't work,
for example,

817
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.560
to try to do a big push in Nigeria,

818
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:41.620
which is a hugely interesting market of individuals,
right?

819
00:48:41.621 --> 00:48:44.290
It gets incredibly middle income.
It's growing.

820
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:47.050
It's a quarter of the African Po continence population.

821
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:51.100
If we don't have content that people can read in the languages in which they

822
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:54.280
prefer to read.
So I mentioned how's a,
I mentioned Jaruba.

823
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.910
These are two very popular languages in Nigeria.
Igbo is another one.

824
00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.380
We've got English,
Wikipedia,

825
00:48:59.381 --> 00:49:03.010
but English Wikipedia to the previous question about implicit bias doesn't

826
00:49:03.011 --> 00:49:05.730
necessarily contain all of the things that folks would want to read.

827
00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.980
So for us it's sort of this,
this,
um,

828
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.810
art rather than science and how do we grow communities so that they're writing

829
00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:16.240
the articles that folks are interested in,

830
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:18.910
the articles that are notable to a community,
a while.

831
00:49:18.911 --> 00:49:23.530
Also thinking about how do we reach out into places where we're not yet in order

832
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:27.550
to grow.
So right now we have a team that's focused on going into,

833
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:30.880
I'm focused on what we call our new route new readers project,

834
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:34.810
which is looking at places where we know we have content in the languages,

835
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.110
but we would like to see greater growth in terms of reader adoption.

836
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.480
So no hard numbers per se,

837
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.990
but it's something we're very focused on because it's part of the core mission

838
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:47.920
and then the growth.
Um,
in terms of financial support,

839
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.990
we're just going to keep working on reducing,
reducing the server load.
I mean,

840
00:49:52.991 --> 00:49:54.520
in reality we're actually quite small.

841
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:56.230
I don't think folks necessarily realize this.

842
00:49:56.231 --> 00:50:00.700
We're just a couple racks in a colo down in,
in Texas and Virginia.
Right?

843
00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:03.310
I know everyone's like,
Whoa,
just a couple of racks.

844
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.250
Yet we're really just in terms of the Vac,

845
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:09.590
the fact that we're tech space content,
we're pretty lightweight.
Um,

846
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:12.700
so that would be a great problem for us to have.
We'd like to have that problem.

847
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.150
I just would also really just want to say thank you.

848
00:50:16.151 --> 00:50:17.800
You've been an incredible audience.

849
00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:21.490
I've really appreciated all the questions and your attention as I've been

850
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:25.540
talking and your offers of support and help.
So thank you so much.

851
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:28.270
We really were.
We're just greatly appreciate it to,

852
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.880
we have a lot in common and we're glad to be able to have these conversations.

853
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.970
I think that's,
uh,
thank them again for coming.
