1
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.771
Um,

2
00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:11.720
so I'd like to thank you all for showing up here today in person and those of

3
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.550
you on the live stream for showing up to support each other.

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.330
Um,

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.650
I think many of us have been affected either directly or indirectly by suicide.

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.460
Um,
and it's something that we want to make sure we're addressing specifically so

7
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:29.090
everyone knows that they're not alone.
Um,

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.350
before we get started,
this is kind of a challenging topic to navigate.

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.650
There are tons of resources available to all of us here within Google and

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.660
beyond.
Uh,
before we get started today,

11
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.690
we think it's very important to understand a little bit of the statistics around

12
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:50.960
suicide and why this is such a critical topic for us to be discussing.

13
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.860
It is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600
We will lose 40,000 Americans who will die by suicide this year and there will

15
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:06.080
be approximately 500,000 attempts this year.
Today alone,

16
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.170
we will lose a 117 Americans to suicide.

17
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.900
These are very shocking statistics and it's alarming and it's why we're bringing

18
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.610
people together today to discuss the importance of this topic and discuss the

19
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:23.630
importance of finding a space for those talks.
Um,

20
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:26.060
I'd like to welcome Jessica to Vento,

21
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:29.700
Dr Jessica de Vento who worked very hard for that title.
Um,

22
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.740
she is going to be moderating the discussion today with the wonderful folks from

23
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:34.820
the s word film.

24
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.250
She is an employee mental health program manager and business advisor at Google.

25
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.390
Prior to Google she worked primarily in university health and corporate employee

26
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:49.370
assistance and she specialist that specializes in crisis management and critical

27
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:53.210
incident response as well as treating anxiety,

28
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.490
trauma and young adult professionals.

29
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.810
She has over a decade of experience treating hundreds of suicidal clients and

30
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:03.290
has been affected by this issue.
Personally,
please welcome Jessica.

31
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.850
<v 1>Thank you</v>

32
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.640
<v 0>very much.</v>

33
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.660
I'm very happy to be here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce our

34
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.540
panelists up and then we're going to roll the trailer for the club.

35
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.980
And just as a reminder,

36
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:19.550
we do have a Jana here for those of you if you want to talk.

37
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.200
And as we set the tone and intention a day just for folks to be mindful that

38
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:28.100
since it is a sensitive topic,
please have laptops and screens down.

39
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.190
If you're able and be mindful if you have a reaction,

40
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.090
totally normal human reaction.
Um,
to this topic,

41
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:37.640
feel free to do what you need to take care of yourself,

42
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.580
but be mindful and respectful of those around you when you do so.

43
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.840
So first I'd like to introduce Lisa client.
She's the director of the film.

44
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.520
<v 1>Lisa.
Lisa is an all</v>

45
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.240
<v 0>Lisa is an award winning documentary rest and she's done multiple films focused</v>

46
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:57.710
on mental health and uh,
it's a passion project for her,

47
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.760
the s word as she both her brother and father,
uh,

48
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.800
die from suicide.
And Lisa also cones mad picks,

49
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.090
which is based locally in La.
And it she runs it with her husband,
right?
Yup.

50
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.730
Thank you.
And now I'd also like to invite Anne Taylor to the state.

51
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.290
Thank you.
And is featured in the documentary and she's a suicide survivor.

52
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.930
And so she'll be talking about her experience today.

53
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.410
She's a single mother of two adult children now,
right?

54
00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:33.411
Two adult men and she has attempted suicide four times between the years of 2009

55
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.800
and 2012 and I'm so grateful she can be here with us today.

56
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.010
And thankfully she supported by a therapist and a psychiatrist.

57
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:46.011
She also currently works as a crisis counselor and as a peer facilitator from

58
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:48.480
the Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services Center locally.

59
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.970
So if we go ahead and roll the trailer please.

60
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.570
<v 3>I remember thinking I just hold on cause somehow some way this is going to make</v>

62
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:13.164
sense.

63
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.380
<v 4>The reaction of people around me,
let's just shut up.</v>

64
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.040
Anybody who has lost anyone through suicide,
you always say,

65
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:39.610
what did I miss?
Why couldn't I say,
Yep,

66
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.420
suicide.
That's scary word,
isn't it?

67
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.990
I just always felt like an alien,
like a burden.

68
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.990
I started to look for other people like me and I couldn't find anything.

69
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.970
Like where were these people

70
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.500
<v 3>to say I'm an attempt survivor.</v>

71
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.400
Even say the word suicide is a racket stopper.

72
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.860
<v 4>I just want people to look into these people's eyes because we've always looked</v>

73
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:17.490
away,
you know,
Hashtag [inaudible] suicide.
So white.

74
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.580
<v 0>My name is Leah Harris and I am</v>

75
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.550
<v 4>survivor.
When I grew up the,
I'm an activist and I'm a nice seven advocate.</v>

76
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.760
It's a project about suicide,
but I'm focusing on life.

77
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.420
It's not the word suicide.
That is the problem.

78
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.200
It is the deafening silence around it.

79
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.290
We lose a hundred to 12 people every day.

80
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.260
That's bigger than a small jet airplanes.

81
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.160
I'm not doing well.
I find myself wanting to hurt myself.

82
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.790
I just don't really know how to handle it.

83
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.920
A revolution in mental health is happening and we are at the forefront,

84
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.890
so it's still an option for you.
I don't want it to be,

85
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.850
we're changing a culture more and more.

86
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:16.630
It becomes clear to me that I am never alone,
that we are never ever alone.

87
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.530
What would you say to suicide?
What was a thing?
If it was a person,

88
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.750
I'd say suck it
s word.

89
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.820
It's only scary if you give it this sort of boogie man.
Wait,

90
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.630
I used to think,
man,
maybe in life just isn't for everybody.

91
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.960
I was done and I was wrong.

92
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.820
<v 5>It's here.
It's not coming soon.
It's already available.</v>

93
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.820
So please watch the film if you haven't done so already.
Um,

94
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.910
I just appreciate that trailer so much.

95
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.810
I'm so glad that we're here having this conversation and I'm so grateful for

96
00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:17.430
both of you being here.
I just want to say that.
Lisa,
why did you make the film?

97
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.740
That's a great question.
And,
um,
there were several reasons,

98
00:07:22.741 --> 00:07:25.470
but so when I was in college,

99
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.920
both my father and my brother died by suicide,
as you said.

100
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.600
And it wasn't an immediate,
I,
okay,
I need to do something.
But you know,

101
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:37.940
over the years just writing about it,
trying to process it,
seeing a therapist,

102
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:40.470
you know,
going through all of,
you know,
all of this stuff.

103
00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:45.471
And prior to this film we did a film about bipolar and there was somebody in the

104
00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:51.840
film who had lost her daughter to suicide.
And I thought,
okay,
I'm done.

105
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.010
I've dealt with it,
I'm good.
And then I realized in two seconds I just wasn't.

106
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.780
And um,
so as altruistic as this may seem like,

107
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.380
Oh wow,
you really did this great.
Part of it was for me,
you know,

108
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:05.550
it was my process.

109
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.080
And I started researching and I started,
um,

110
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.760
as you know,
coming from a place of loss.
So I was,
you know,
googling,

111
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.210
um,
this,
you know,
I was,
I was on the Internet and I was,

112
00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:21.470
I was looking for people and,
and all of that.
And,
um,

113
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.950
what I found was sort of this just amazing kind of,
I like,

114
00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:28.020
I found Deseret first,
you know,
I found,

115
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:30.660
lived through this and then I went to the American,

116
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.070
so American Association of suicidology conference and I started this whole

117
00:08:35.071 --> 00:08:40.071
process and I realized there's just this like vibrant group of people who are,

118
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.430
who had attempted suicide and survived these,
these people with lived experience.

119
00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:47.790
And I was like,
well,
these are the people I need to talk to.
I mean,

120
00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:49.890
these are the people who can tell me,
you know,

121
00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:52.950
who can tell the world about their experiences and all of that.

122
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.800
And I just thought it was really to,

123
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.230
<v 2>the silence is just not helping anything.
If anything,
the silence is killing,</v>

124
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.220
you know,
as many people as,
as suicide,
you know.
I mean,
because you know,

125
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:09.540
by not talking about you're taking something so difficult to deal with and then

126
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:13.890
you're trapping it even more by not talking about it.
And it just didn't seem,

127
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.410
it seemed wrong to me.
And I want it to get the conversation going so well.

128
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:20.400
I'm so glad you did.

129
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:24.510
Cause I know this has really prompted not just this conversation but so many

130
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.540
more and the work that you do with schools and things like that around the

131
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:31.920
country.
So powerful.
And why did you agree to be in the film?

132
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.750
Uh,
I was approached to be in this film if I was interested in sharing my

133
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:41.550
experience.
Um,
I was very,
very hesitant.
I was very scared.
Um,

134
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.760
what I was feeling myself with a lot of shame,

135
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.980
feeling isolated,
feeling alone,
feeling like I'd done something terribly wrong.

136
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.353
And,
um,

137
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:57.530
and it was that shame for myself that I wanted to express to people what I was

138
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:00.450
going through and what I was feeling and how,

139
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
I know there's other people that are going through this too.
So,
um,

140
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.130
so I agreed to do this.
I was very hesitant,
but I did agree to do this and I,

141
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.910
it was for me to help me to spread the word of what I was going through,

142
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.290
but also to,
um,

143
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.370
allow other people to possibly be able to talk about their own situation.

144
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:25.020
And it's very,
very isolating and there's a lot of shame that goes with it,
so,

145
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.850
yeah.
Yeah.
I hear you.

146
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:31.080
And I'm just so glad that you did choose to speak out and break that stigma of

147
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:32.480
shame that's around it.
Yeah.

148
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.280
And it sounds like Lisa gave you that space to be the container,

149
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:39.180
but also to have a voice now for the world.
Right,
exactly.

150
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.550
And that kind of started everything.
And then I realized,
Gosh,
you know,

151
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:43.440
I've been given a little bit of a platform here.

152
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.820
I'm not much of a public speaker and really don't like to share these things so

153
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:51.780
much,
but I was given that chance to say something to the world.

154
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:54.420
And so I'm trying to do that as best I can.

155
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:59.190
So I thank you for having us here today and allowing that discussion.
Yeah,

156
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.380
thank you so much.
Very,

157
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:04.260
very powerful that you all are here with us today.

158
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.740
Can we go ahead and roll the clip of an,

159
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.780
there are parts of me

160
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.880
of which I'm glad I'm alive,

161
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.880
but there's many parts of me that I really wish I wasn't.

162
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.680
I don't know if I'm really safe.
I don't know if I'm out of the woods yet.

163
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.370
<v 1>When was your last attempt?
Two and a half years ago.</v>

164
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.470
<v 2>I have two really amazing kids.</v>

165
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.040
That's the reason I'm still alive.

166
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

167
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.140
<v 2>I mean,
when you first told me I was just,
that was a curve with shock to begin,</v>

168
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:51.310
but I think you're taking your own life.
That's scary and sad.

169
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.320
<v 6>Shouldn't happen.
Sorry.</v>

171
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.590
I mean like hearing that it,
if I'm in my heart,
drop in like

172
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.630
is Kevin and I'm catching up with him.
You don't even want to think about,

173
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.650
but I know I needed to.

174
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.170
I never ever would want to leave you or hurt you.

175
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.703
I don't know.

176
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.143
<v 1>Cool.</v>

177
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.410
<v 6>I'm really glad you did.
Tell me this.</v>

178
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.910
I think you're stronger than I did before because you're going out and reaching

179
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:26.450
out and telling me,
okay.
I want to be there for you.

180
00:12:26.451 --> 00:12:27.284
If you need help

181
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.850
<v 2>on wake up and see the day go,
it's a new day.
This is awesome.</v>

182
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.320
<v 1>This is what I want.</v>

183
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:47.960
Okay.

184
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.310
<v 2>I just want to say I'm so touched by the bond you and your son have and that</v>

185
00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:55.160
special moment.
Yeah,
we are.
We are very close.

186
00:12:55.161 --> 00:12:58.160
So we talk about these things and yeah.
Um,

187
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.060
that was an incredible moment that the two of us were able to share together

188
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.980
that Lisa captured that Lisa captured.
So yeah,
the three of us.
Yeah.

189
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.150
Yeah.
That's amazing.
And that makes me teary every time I watch it.

190
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.610
And just the thoughtfulness and insightfulness that he had at such a young age.

191
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.460
He was 18,
18 at the time.
Yeah.

192
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.790
How is it to watch yourself on film?
No.

193
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:25.663
Um,

194
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.280
well then at the time I was obviously very nervous and very scared and,

195
00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:33.920
and I think when you look at yourself on film,

196
00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:37.490
you don't really see what you think you look like and what you sound like.

197
00:13:37.491 --> 00:13:40.310
So it felt very strange and very awkward.
Um,

198
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.450
I've watched it enough times now that I'm comfortable with it.

199
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.410
And as difficult as that conversation was,
uh,

200
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:52.370
I'm so glad that we had that and I'm so glad that other people have been able to

201
00:13:52.371 --> 00:13:56.750
see that.
Um,
so I look at myself on the film and I feel very proud.

202
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.920
I feel like I've taken some great steps forward and two,
um,

203
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.670
hopefully decreasing that stigma of suicide.

204
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.080
<v 1>Yeah.
Thank you.</v>

205
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.300
<v 2>I'm curious,
Lisa,</v>

206
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:13.480
how was it for you to be in the room as people are sharing these stories?

207
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.840
Either watching,
I know Deseret interviewing folks and some,

208
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:20.320
and then it looked like a,
your conversation with them and others.

209
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.510
Are you talking about like,
yeah,

210
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.010
like in the room as we're interviewing and we're talking and all of that.
Yeah,

211
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:28.620
it was,
it was really important.
And,

212
00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:33.190
and just like the first time that we talked to Anne for example,
was,

213
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.720
um,
we had her psychiatrist sitting behind me because it was,

214
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:41.170
it was one of those things that like whatever is going to make you comfortable

215
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.330
and if he's here,
you know,
I mean,
we really tried to,
you know,
make it a,

216
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:50.470
a comfortable situation and it,
what was really important and what I realized,

217
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:51.920
like I may have had my,

218
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.680
<v 5>uh,
my questions,
like,
you have your,
your questions there,</v>

219
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:58.010
but it becomes a dialogue,
you know,
it's like,
okay,

220
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.630
so if I just sit there and say,
you know,
and I want you to tell me this,

221
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.070
you can ask me whatever too.
I mean,

222
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:07.820
I've been in a different space in suicide.
Um,

223
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.900
but please,
let's just talk about this.
Let's just talk about it.

224
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:16.190
So it was pretty emotional a lot of the times.
I mean the,
the,

225
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.640
the clip that you saw,
like when she was sitting with Sam,
I mean,

226
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:23.450
that was really beautiful.
I am sure that I was tearing up behind the camera.

227
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:24.290
We were,
you know,

228
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:28.580
both of us where the camera person in me and talking to as I as I told you

229
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:32.090
before,
like,
like Brandon's mother,
you know,
I mean there were some,

230
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:36.770
some moments that were um,
real like,
wow,
this is really happening.

231
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.750
I mean these people are talking about the probably the scariest,

232
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:45.890
most difficult moments of their lives and their interesting this and we better

233
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.220
not screw this up.
You know?
I mean it was,
there was pressure to,

234
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:52.070
it's like how do we handle this?
And when,
when we were cutting it too,

235
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:57.071
it's like we've got these people literally their live not to sound so dramatic

236
00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:00.440
but their lives in our hands a little bit,
you know.
And um,

237
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.370
we really wanted them,
like for an to say,

238
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:09.140
I feel proud of myself watching it means the world because that's what we wanted

239
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.200
to do,
you know?
And when the truth comes out,

240
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.080
<v 0>what's coming up for me right now and what resonates with me,</v>

241
00:16:16.081 --> 00:16:20.880
it's like our ability to tolerate the discomfort of sharing our story or of

242
00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:24.150
holding the space for folks so that we can have the conversation.

243
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.310
Because the conversation is just so taboo and so stigmatized in our society and

244
00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:34.311
for those of us that can take that on and hold space for that really allows us

245
00:16:35.611 --> 00:16:39.240
to move forward because we're not going to get the traction we need otherwise.

246
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.980
Right,
right.
Exactly.
Yeah,
that's very cool.

247
00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:47.640
Something that stuck out to me in the film was the language that was used around

248
00:16:47.641 --> 00:16:50.340
suicide and myself as a mental health professional,

249
00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:52.920
I reflected a lot about that kind of during and after the film.

250
00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:55.440
And I've heard it a bit and the site community,

251
00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:58.680
but seeing it on film was just really powerful to get that message out

252
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.840
specifically around the phrase committed suicide,
uh,

253
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.110
versus died by suicide.
If you want to either of you want to speak more to that.

254
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.280
<v 5>I had started and then you pick however you want to do it.
But,
um,
yeah,</v>

255
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:14.680
I mean I learned as,
as we were doing this and then,
I mean,

256
00:17:14.681 --> 00:17:18.740
I can't remember ever saying committed suicide when I think about when I,

257
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.720
when I talked about my brother and my father,
but I'm,
I must have I guess,
but I,

258
00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:26.360
I don't know,
like now it's completely out of my vernacular I guess.

259
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:28.280
But in talking to Desiree,

260
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:30.890
like when we were talking that day and even prior to that,

261
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:34.550
like Layo very much educated me about a lot of stuff.
Leah,

262
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:37.190
who's in the film as well.
But when we were talking about it,

263
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:41.390
I mean Desiree's whole point and a lot of people in the,
um,

264
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.350
suicide prevention,

265
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:47.030
mental health community talk about commit being such a wasted word.

266
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.010
You know,
we commit murder,
commit rape,

267
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.150
<v 2>but as,
as,
um,
fell Dez,
his wife,</v>

268
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.170
now wife says,
you know,
we also,
you know,
commit to marriage commit,
you know,

269
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:00.930
so it's,
it's a thing,
you know,

270
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.840
like there were some people on the side that say,
you know,

271
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:05.300
once you start getting rid of what,
you know,

272
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.190
pretty soon we're not going to be able to talk at all because all the words are

273
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.340
going to be gone.
So when somebody,
you know,

274
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:14.280
so it's,
uh,
it's,

275
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:18.960
it's definitely a thing and I do prefer to say died by suicide.
I mean,

276
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:23.700
it's clear,
you know,
commit really does.
Again,
it's,

277
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:28.590
it's very strong and it's very like I decided that I am going to commit this

278
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:33.480
action and you know,
so you might have a more,
well,

279
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:38.170
I think also that a long time ago,
I don't even know how many years ago,
um,

280
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.220
suicide was considered a crime and was considered a sin and that has kind of

281
00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:46.830
carried through where people have just said committed suicide.

282
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.160
It's just gone on for so long that it's carried through into now.

283
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.740
And that's just a term that's been used.
And,
um,

284
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.340
really it's when I hear committed suicide,

285
00:18:56.341 --> 00:19:00.210
it makes me feel like I'm a felon or I've done something terribly wrong and I

286
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:04.450
should be abolished or band or whatever it is.
But so,

287
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.830
so I cringe when I hear that word.
And I would prefer to say that,
you know,

288
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:12.240
they died by suicide.
You know,
it's,
it's more what it is,

289
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.410
you know,
committed as a very hard,
strong word.
I can see both sides of it,

290
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:19.660
but to me I think it's just something that's carried through the years and

291
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.730
gotten rid of.
Yeah.

292
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.780
<v 0>It sounds like it also enhances and increases the shame around it.
Absolutely.</v>

293
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.850
And,
um,
I just want to acknowledge too,

294
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:31.851
in some countries it is still criminalized and a very difficult to address it in

295
00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:37.250
some,
some ways because of that.
Yeah.
And it's not a crime.
Yeah.

296
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.040
And Desiree has been mentioned a couple of times in our conversation.

297
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:43.690
I know that she was in the clips.
She's the one for those of,

298
00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:47.760
you haven't seen the film yet taking the pictures and uh,
she,

299
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.770
she had her project live,
lived through this.
Right.
This,
yes.

300
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.880
I'm curious to know your experience working with Desiree cause she's highlighted

301
00:19:56.881 --> 00:19:58.260
a lot in the foam.
Both.

302
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.710
I know Lisa you said she's the first one you found and kind of reached out to

303
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:04.920
for her project and then she took photos at you.
Right.

304
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.680
So I'm curious about your experiences working with her.

305
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.510
<v 2>Sure.
So my experience with Dez is I'm doing the interview,
what you saw,</v>

306
00:20:13.511 --> 00:20:16.870
she asked me a series of different questions and we talked about suicide,

307
00:20:16.871 --> 00:20:18.980
what it means to me and um,

308
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.260
and my different experiences with the hospitals or whatever situation I was put

309
00:20:23.261 --> 00:20:27.640
in.
Um,
for me,
Dez was,

310
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.100
um,
appear.
She was somebody who has been there,
who is,

311
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:38.101
who understands what it feels like to reach that awful point and to actually

312
00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:42.220
cross the line and try to take her own life.
There's like this line there.

313
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.970
And I think people who have attempted in gone that far have some sort of

314
00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:50.971
internal connection with other and immediately I felt connected to does and was

315
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:53.120
willing to tell her anything.
And um,

316
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.290
I kind of feel like we're walking through this journey together and you know,

317
00:20:56.291 --> 00:21:01.000
she's my traveling partner in a sense as with other people who have attempted
to,

318
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.990
there's definitely a tight bond.
So does,
is an amazing person.

319
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.760
Amazing person.
So I'm lucky to have gotten to know her.
Yeah.

320
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.990
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean when I,
when I saw her project,
the fact that,
I mean,</v>

321
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.930
because who are you going to talk to again about the,

322
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.050
the most difficult time of your life written him somebody who's,

323
00:21:21.051 --> 00:21:26.051
who's been there and she has been there and what's really struck me in talking

324
00:21:26.931 --> 00:21:31.931
to her was her idea of the way she does her portraits,

325
00:21:32.121 --> 00:21:36.680
which we'll,
we'll see at some point is she has this whole thing about,
look,

326
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.050
you know,
look into my eyes,
look into the Lens.

327
00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:43.820
Because oftentimes with something like suicide,
something like,
you know,

328
00:21:43.821 --> 00:21:45.140
somebody who has attempted suicide,

329
00:21:45.141 --> 00:21:50.141
we tend to look away and she didn't want them to look away.

330
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.120
You know,
her whole point is let's look at these people.

331
00:21:53.121 --> 00:21:56.410
Let's listen to them when she interviewed and talked to them and,

332
00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:59.780
and all of that.
And then we realize somewhere,
you know,

333
00:21:59.781 --> 00:22:03.350
I think I was a little slow on the uptake because I realized as we were going,

334
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.380
it was probably a year in that,
oh,
you know what,

335
00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.580
this is probably going to be the center piece because she's taking pictures and

336
00:22:10.581 --> 00:22:14.870
were photographed and like,
we're doing this together.
And,
and it really did,

337
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.050
it did become kind of a partnership,
like even sharing,

338
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.460
like we introduced her to Ann and she introduced us to,
um,

339
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.050
let's Craig or whoever,
you know,
I mean,
so it really did become a partnership of,

340
00:22:27.051 --> 00:22:30.440
of,
um,
who we were talking to and how we were doing it.

341
00:22:30.441 --> 00:22:34.490
And we just sort of converged on that.
And I just want to acknowledge,

342
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.400
correct me if I'm wrong again,
but she took this photo here,
right?
Yeah,

343
00:22:37.401 --> 00:22:40.430
she did take that photo.
Yeah.
It's a very serious picture.

344
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.950
But if you look in my eyes,
you can see that there's something in there.

345
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.710
<v 2>There's some pain in there,
some hope that I could be supported or,</v>

346
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.410
or helped or I dunno.

347
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.680
But it's like you can make everything up and do your hair all fancy and put

348
00:22:56.681 --> 00:23:01.680
makeup on everything.
But when you look in people's eyes,
you see a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.

349
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.700
She captured the essence of it.
Yeah.

350
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.290
And in a really cute [inaudible] it right.
Having you here,
you know,

351
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:10.280
to give that extra voice to it.
It's,

352
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.740
and I look at that picture and that's what I felt like at the time.

353
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:20.290
<v 4>So,
yeah.
Whatever that means.
Yeah.
It's amazing.</v>

354
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.490
<v 2>I'm curious,
as we're talking about suicide,
um,</v>

355
00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:27.510
and we're talking about the shame about suicide.

356
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.510
I know there's a lot of myths behind suicide,
um,

357
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.121
that the,

358
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:36.930
that are propagated just kind of through everyday talking to people who do

359
00:23:36.931 --> 00:23:37.830
choose to talk about it.

360
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:43.220
Are there any myths that you want to debunk here today or anything you wish

361
00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:46.190
people knew about suicide that you think lot of people don't know?

362
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.350
<v 5>Well,
the coward myth,
um,
I think,
um,
you know,</v>

363
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:55.520
that it's such a cowardly thing to do because I mean,

364
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.360
I was,
um,
18 I was just,

365
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:02.810
just about 18 when my father died.
And,
um,

366
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.970
I didn't know right away.
I mean,
it was hidden from it.

367
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.560
There was a whole family of shame thing.
And then when I,

368
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.370
when I found out and the,
and the idea of,
you know,
God,

369
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:16.910
you know what a cowardly act he left,
he left his family,
he left his kids,

370
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:21.210
he left his thing.
And that was the narrative that I sort of learned.
And I,

371
00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:25.550
I never wanted to embrace it because I really did hold my father on a pedestal.

372
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:29.930
And so what I've sort of learned or what I've chosen to learn,

373
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:34.931
because I can create my own narrative because he's not here to tell me anything

374
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:38.480
at this point.
And so I tried to,

375
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:43.430
I think that I look at it as more co,
I mean,
I don't want to say,

376
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:46.220
you know,
well suicide,
that's,
that's the most courageous thing you can do.

377
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:48.380
But in a,
in a way for him,

378
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.500
he waited until I was the youngest of three kids and he waited until I was in

379
00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:58.080
college.
So,
I mean,
I tried to flip it,
you know,
to,
um,

380
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:03.280
him thinking it through and realizing that,
you know,
I would be okay.
You know,

381
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.760
again,
it's kind of ridiculous,
but still,
you know,
in his own mind of how he,

382
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:10.490
you know,
how he did this and,
and then wondering,
wow,

383
00:25:10.491 --> 00:25:13.700
he must have been struggling for a long time.
Because when people think,
wow,

384
00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:15.620
well that's an impulsive act,

385
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.640
or this person is killing themselves because they broke up with their boyfriend,

386
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:24.380
or you know,
whatever it is,
it's like realizing that it's,
it's kind of like,
um,

387
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:29.360
that suicide itself is kind of like Jenga or whatever,
you know,
I mean,
you,
you,

388
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:33.470
um,
I'm not always great at metaphors,
but when you,
um,
you know,

389
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.350
there are a lot of pieces,
there are a lot of pieces to this puzzle.

390
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.820
So it isn't just,
you know,
you failed the test so you went out and killed you.

391
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:41.211
You,
I mean,

392
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:45.650
because people do want to simplify it because it's easier to say that this

393
00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:50.410
person,
this,
this must have,
this happened.
So this,
you know,
so I mean that,
that,

394
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.200
that's another myth.
But yeah,
and,
and sometimes it is spontaneous with,

395
00:25:55.201 --> 00:25:56.870
with people a suicide attempt.

396
00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:59.750
And other times it's something that has been building up for a long period of

397
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:04.640
time.
I would say for me,
um,
I,
I was overwhelmed.

398
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:08.990
I had a series of losses that happened very suddenly together and I became very

399
00:26:08.991 --> 00:26:12.080
overwhelmed and my,
my head was foggy.

400
00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:16.670
And spinning and I couldn't think,
I couldn't act the way I should act.

401
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.080
It just came up on me and I attempted suicide.

402
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.180
So I don't look at it.

403
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:28.100
I look at it as more of something that was just so terribly overwhelming and

404
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.000
that I felt like if I continued on with this life that I would be a burden to

405
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:36.380
everybody else and that I would be harming my kids if I stayed alive.

406
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:41.480
So it's some of those distorted thoughts that happen in that moment.
Um,

407
00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:43.200
I think another thing,
um,

408
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:46.470
another misconception is that you shouldn't talk about it.

409
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:49.140
You shouldn't ask people how they're feeling.
Um,

410
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.740
if you're worried about someone who you think might be suicidal,

411
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.370
the most important thing you can do is to actually talk to them and ask them

412
00:26:56.371 --> 00:26:59.100
questions and listen to what they have to say.
And you know,

413
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.430
ask them specifically,
are you having suicidal thoughts?
You know,

414
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:05.820
that opens a dialogue for that person to say,
okay,
maybe I can share this.

415
00:27:05.821 --> 00:27:09.300
Maybe I could get help.
But if you just walk away and pretend it's not there,

416
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:12.300
it's going to isolate us even more.
And put us more at risk.

417
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.720
So talking about it is very,
very,
very important.
Yeah.
Because there's a myth,

418
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:18.250
I'm sorry.

419
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:22.080
There's a myth that if you bring it up then somebody is going to think about it

420
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:26.340
and if you really think about it,
um,
if you're going along,

421
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:29.370
life is fine.
You're doing your thing and somebody says,
you know,

422
00:27:29.371 --> 00:27:33.030
are you thinking about suicide?
And it,
you know,
you can be like,
no,
you know,

423
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:35.610
I wasn't.
But now that you mentioned,
I think it's a great idea,

424
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.590
that doesn't usually happen that way.
No,

425
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.670
that doesn't have so no inception that happened.
No,
no.
Oh,

426
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:42.780
let me plant that thought.

427
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:43.871
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

428
00:27:43.871 --> 00:27:47.560
I really appreciate that you bring that up because I'm just being able to broach

429
00:27:47.561 --> 00:27:48.394
the conversation,

430
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.540
opens the door for people to get help if they want it at that time.
Yeah.

431
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.030
And if we don't have the conversation on the door,
might not be open.
[inaudible]

432
00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.540
<v 5>oh,
I did think of one other thing.
The other,
the other thing that I learned from,</v>

433
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:02.880
from you,
from people who had been there,

434
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.680
the idea that because we all,
I think our nature is we want to help.

435
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:11.070
We want to fix it.
We want to fix that.
We want to fix whatever the problem is.

436
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:15.690
So the nature,
our nature would tell us,
um,
you know,
somebody who's telling you,

437
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.780
because we do say,
you know,
talk to somebody or whatever.

438
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:20.370
And oftentimes it's like,
okay,

439
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.660
well here's what you do so you can go to the hospital or you can take medication

440
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:28.170
or you can see a therapist or you can eat keenwah or you can run or you can,

441
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:32.040
you know,
it's like,
yeah,
I've got the solution for you.
And oftentimes not quite.

442
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:32.760
That was like,

443
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.720
how about turning it the other way and listening to what they have to say and

444
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:40.050
what they need.
So that was a big learning thing.

445
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:41.870
<v 0>Yeah,
it's so hard.</v>

446
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.190
Both that like the the desire to want to control and help can be so difficult

447
00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:47.390
for the person supporting,

448
00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:50.660
but if they really want to support to have that open ear,

449
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.830
listen with their judgment,

450
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.670
listen without judgment and when people tried to tell you what to do to eat keen

451
00:28:55.671 --> 00:29:00.440
law or whatever it is,
it almost hurts because it feels like

452
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:01.151
<v 5>they're not listening.</v>

453
00:29:01.151 --> 00:29:04.900
They're just trying to just get rid of the problem to push it under the rug.

454
00:29:04.901 --> 00:29:09.400
So yeah,
listening I'm listening is the most important thing I could say.

455
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:10.950
I appreciate it

456
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.540
<v 0>that,
that you will bring in that here.</v>

457
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.310
I also wanted to address that the myth of the coward.
I'm just,
I don't know.

458
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:18.420
I had this thought of,
you know,

459
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:23.421
maybe that's driven by folks who get so angry after people killed themselves and

460
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:29.130
if they do it that way,
then they don't have to deal with all the other emotions.

461
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:32.610
Like you said,
they simplify it.
It can,
they can draw it and put it in a box.

462
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.280
But when I appreciate you when you're talking about your dad for example,

463
00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:38.670
is you're shifting to a place of having empathy for the pain that he was in in

464
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:42.820
that moment.
And I imagine that can be a very powerful place for listeners

465
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.110
<v 5>porters to be into,
well,
if you look at like,</v>

466
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.040
like somebody who has died of cancer and you know,

467
00:29:50.041 --> 00:29:53.780
this person just fought for the,
you know,
they,
they fought for their life and,

468
00:29:53.781 --> 00:29:58.140
and you know,
here they are and if you have somebody who dies by suicide,

469
00:29:58.141 --> 00:30:03.120
particularly somebody who's in their sixties or fifties or you know,

470
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.810
who they could have been struggling for 30 years,
you know,
and,
and you know,
it,

471
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.570
it is in cancer,
it's whatever is going on that could be,
you know,

472
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:17.550
unbelievable pain.
So,
you know,
to,
to kind of,
um,

473
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.330
you know,
vilify them or it is,
you know,

474
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.400
kind of minimizes what somebody is feeling.

475
00:30:23.401 --> 00:30:28.260
And I think that that really takes away from what's going on.
And again,

476
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:28.760
I do think,
yeah,

477
00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.590
<v 2>in that specific moment when you decide to act.
I don't think anybody,</v>

478
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.150
I'm not,
I don't know.

479
00:30:35.151 --> 00:30:38.870
But I don't think anybody could be thinking logically and clearly at that point.

480
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.820
I think you've reached a limit where

481
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.920
you're just acting on whatever is telling you to act and it's not,

482
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.630
you're not thinking clearly.

483
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:52.810
So I want to point that out that I honestly don't think it's a selfish thing.

484
00:30:53.691 --> 00:30:55.850
I can see why people get frustrated and angry with that,

485
00:30:55.851 --> 00:31:00.851
but there's more to it than just trying to end your life because you lost your

486
00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:04.910
job.
There's more to it than that.
There's a lot of layers.

487
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.830
<v 5>It's usually not layers.
The surface,</v>

488
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.840
the selfishness thing is reading because there is that whole sort of burden

489
00:31:10.841 --> 00:31:15.790
thing.
Like sometimes it's,
it's weirdly selfless in that,

490
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.030
you know,
well,
I'm going to,
I'm going to really,
you know,

491
00:31:19.031 --> 00:31:22.420
relieve this person of their burden.
And I can say,
you know,

492
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:26.860
the one thing that I would say to that is the,
the,
the so-called burden.

493
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.340
I think most people who've lost anybody to suicide would say,

494
00:31:30.341 --> 00:31:34.630
I would take that burden any day of the week over losing the person.

495
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.250
So it's,
yeah.

496
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.120
<v 2>Yeah.
And that's another thing too is I think on my end of it,</v>

497
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.680
I don't realize the impact that I would have if I took my own life.

498
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:50.570
I'm not aware of how intense that pain would be for other people and the ripple

499
00:31:50.571 --> 00:31:54.110
effect.
I'm starting to learn that,
but I really don't get it.

500
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:59.090
So there's,
there's two different completely different sides that were just,

501
00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.690
yeah,
we need to come together on

502
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.351
<v 0>amazing.</v>

503
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:07.000
You can hold space for both of those truths and perspectives at once and trying

504
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:08.110
to integrate the two.

505
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.680
And we talk about the listener kind of being that opportunity to just to open

506
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:13.330
the door to hopefully get people help.

507
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.530
But I also just want to acknowledge that it can be very hard once people start

508
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:22.450
that process.
Um,
and that the,
there's a lot of barriers of access to care,

509
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.550
not only in the US,
but globally.
Um,
and to give credence to that.

510
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:30.610
I'm hoping we can roll the clip of collection and then we can talk about that a

511
00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:31.444
bit.

512
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.740
<v 2>Anytime you attempt,</v>

514
00:32:37.741 --> 00:32:40.940
you first have to go to village medical hospital where they like make sure

515
00:32:40.941 --> 00:32:45.050
everything's okay.
I have this nurse told me,
you know,

516
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:50.060
don't let yourself get raped again.
I'm in a psych ward and I'm like,

517
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.320
Oh,
I want to react to this and you have power over me.

518
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.280
And you think the helpful thing is to tell me not to get raped again.

519
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.120
Meanwhile we're watching like they're actually showing silence of the lambs in

520
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.220
the mental hospital and I'm like I telling the nurses,
the Lincoln,

521
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.770
<v 7>you guys think this is like our appropriate ookay shows.
Make that,</v>

522
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.890
make that shit up.

523
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.960
<v 2>What I learned from being in the hospital was how never to be in a hospital</v>

524
00:33:19.961 --> 00:33:24.280
again.
You know,
there are still ups and downs.
I mean,
you know,

525
00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:27.310
I find ways through music,
through my Karaoke,

526
00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:30.910
through my poetry to live better.

527
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.400
It was a big smashing this mask of I'm going to make you laugh and make you look

528
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:40.840
that way.
Oh my God,

529
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.700
secrets made me sick.
That's what I really think about it.
Oh,

530
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.050
I want more of your hand in that,
but look at that shit.
That's my faith.
Hey,

531
00:33:49.051 --> 00:33:50.940
it's okay.
It's not bad.

532
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.520
<v 0>I'm just struck by the picture of her again at the end.
Collette,
you,</v>

533
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:06.130
you can really just see in her eyes.
Right.
Um,
I'm just,

534
00:34:06.131 --> 00:34:07.360
it's being in the system,

535
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:12.140
me as a mental health professional and having also personal experiences with,
uh,

536
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:16.900
folks in my family who,
um,
have had issues with suicidal thoughts and such.

537
00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:19.210
It's so hard the system.

538
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.990
And I just want to acknowledge as part of the system itself,
um,

539
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:27.840
it is broken and I'm just curious to hear from you all,
uh,

540
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.360
what barriers you noticed both interviewing folks in going through it yourself.

541
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

542
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.940
<v 5>I just want to say one thing I learned recently,</v>

543
00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:40.600
I was just at this conference in Santa Fe and this woman stood up,

544
00:34:40.601 --> 00:34:45.190
she was a social worker and she said,
we always say the system's broken.

545
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.720
I mean the system is a mess.

546
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.910
But when you say the word broken because we all say that cause it really,

547
00:34:50.911 --> 00:34:54.550
it is pretty easy to say and it,
you know,
it's kind of clear,

548
00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:58.060
but like what other word was speaking of words and terminology,

549
00:34:58.061 --> 00:35:01.990
what other word can we use?
The chose like,
okay,
we're on it,
we're working,

550
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.410
we're making it better.
We're doing something to make it better rather than,

551
00:35:05.411 --> 00:35:08.590
oh well it's broken because it does seem like a throwaway thing.

552
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.670
But having said that,
yeah,
no,
you,
you should talk about your,
um,

553
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.900
your experience but,
but yeah,

554
00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:18.600
like talking to collect tea and talking and layer layer.
Oh my God.
I mean she,

555
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:21.490
I'm in fact,
we were just talking today about something else and she's like,

556
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.110
I think psychiatrists,
I think there'll be gone in 50 years because,
yeah,

557
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.180
that's not real science.
And you know,
and me,

558
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:31.540
she's had such bad experiences when she was 15.

559
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.170
She was told you will be,
she was in a,
um,
an uh,

560
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.280
she was at a psychiatric hospital and she,
you will be here for the rest

561
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.230
<v 2>of your life.
You will never get better.
So,
you know,
this was her experience.</v>

562
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:45.200
Obviously that doesn't happen with everybody in there.

563
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.110
Some really good psychiatrist and there are others who say things like that.

564
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.220
So it's uh,
yeah.
But your experience,
yeah,

565
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:56.580
as far as psychiatrists go,
I do have one that I think is fabulous.

566
00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.830
There's only a limit to so much that he can do.
You know,
um,
you know,

567
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:05.880
there's medications,
there's tms,
there's all these different things you can try,

568
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.600
but sometimes they don't always work.
But,
um,

569
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.690
I think my experience with the medical system,
uh,

570
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:18.510
when you're 51 50 and you're taken away for a suicide attempt or at risk of

571
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:22.440
attempting,
um,
they will take you by ambulance.

572
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.130
Hopefully if you're lucky,
sometimes an ambulance doesn't come.
So the police,

573
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:29.280
we'll handcuff you and take you,
which is very demeaning.

574
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.840
That did not happen to me.

575
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.560
But they'll take you to an emergency room generally first,

576
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.720
and you'll be evaluated and then you'll end up in a bed.
And,
um,

577
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.180
my experience with that was very uncomfortable.
Um,

578
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.000
generally the nurses at the time,

579
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:46.710
and I'm hoping things have changed a lot better,

580
00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:51.711
but my experiences that they disapproved of what I had done and so did not want

581
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:58.050
to give me the care that they would give other patients.
Um,
at the same time,

582
00:36:58.051 --> 00:37:01.980
there is a security guard sitting in a chair looking at you the whole entire

583
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:04.230
time because you're at risk to society.

584
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.480
So it makes you feel like you're a criminal after you go to the emergency room,

585
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:13.530
then you go to a psychiatric Atrik hospital and it's locked down.
You know,

586
00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.130
you're,

587
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.850
you're stripped of shoelaces and ties and you know,

588
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.900
hairdryers and jewelry and you're stripped of everything and um,

589
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:30.510
and then you just,
you just have to accept that and,
and you can't leave.

590
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.210
You're locked.
You're,
you're treated as a criminal.

591
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.980
And I don't know what the solution is.

592
00:37:34.981 --> 00:37:39.030
I don't know how to prevent that from happening,
but it's a horrible experience.

593
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.100
Now,
once I realized that it was locked down and I,

594
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.480
and there were times when I knew I needed to protect myself because I was not

595
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:52.740
safe.
I would voluntarily checked myself into a psychiatric hospital and I have

596
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:56.850
probably done that 10 times beyond my suicide attempts because it's the only

597
00:37:56.851 --> 00:38:00.090
safe place I can be.
So that's,

598
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.860
that's what is given to us and unfortunately it's not a very good situation.

599
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.280
Yeah.
It's,
it's so hard.
And as a clinician,

600
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:12.120
I always really struggled with making that decision because I know it was going

601
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:16.990
to be a hard process,
but I knew that's where somebody would be safe.
And,
um,

602
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.593
you know,

603
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.400
but it's interesting because now I still struggle with suicidal thoughts.

604
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:27.720
Sometimes I am at risk.
Um,

605
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.210
but I think jumping to the conclusion,
I've,

606
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.760
the therapists and psychiatrists that I work with,

607
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.130
the last thing they want to do is to put me in the hospital because

608
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.900
<v 5>that could be more detrimental at times.</v>

609
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.050
<v 4>Okay.</v>

610
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:43.760
<v 5>Um,
so it's really knowing what that limit is.
I can say I have suicidal thoughts.</v>

611
00:38:43.761 --> 00:38:48.500
I can say I have a means of how to do it right next to me.
And,
and I,
you know,

612
00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:53.480
they're not gonna send me to the hospital unless I've already taken something or

613
00:38:53.481 --> 00:38:57.020
done something to hurt myself.
But they know,
they know that limit,

614
00:38:57.021 --> 00:39:01.310
how far to take it because it is a bad experience to be in a hospital in a

615
00:39:01.311 --> 00:39:03.170
psychiatric hospital and the stigma,

616
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.950
I'm glad you have that relationship with your providers so you can work together

617
00:39:06.951 --> 00:39:10.340
to know what that line is.
I'm very lucky.
I'm very lucky.

618
00:39:10.341 --> 00:39:11.990
I even have a psychiatrist and therapist

619
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:13.483
<v 4>so,</v>

620
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.910
<v 0>and Lisa,
I really appreciate you challenging the language around that and I was</v>

621
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.870
reflecting on that,
FDA said that and it's like maybe the system is developing,

622
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.780
maybe,
maybe,
I don't know.
It's going through growing pains,

623
00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:28.770
something so that it still is kind of this necessary part of the process,

624
00:39:28.771 --> 00:39:33.120
but maybe we can tolerate the tension or those hiccups where it doesn't work so

625
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:36.840
well knowing it's hopefully going to inevitably,
and I don't know,

626
00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:41.820
maybe this talk is going to inspire somebody to go out and to continue to

627
00:39:41.821 --> 00:39:45.420
improve what's there.
We've come so far in 50 years,

628
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.970
I can only imagine what the next 50 is going to bring us.

629
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.390
<v 4>[inaudible].
Yeah.</v>

630
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.350
<v 5>Cause you know,
the one thing that I've heard and you would know about this,</v>

631
00:39:56.351 --> 00:40:00.850
the idea of when people talk about people with a diagnosable mental illness

632
00:40:00.851 --> 00:40:05.650
dying younger,
and do you think you think,
oh well suicide or you know,

633
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:08.950
whatever.
But apparently there is a whole thing and you may know about this,

634
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:13.951
if you go in for heart palpitations or whatever it may be and somebody looks at

635
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:18.910
your chart and sees,
oh,
bipolar disorder,
you're okay.
You know,

636
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.030
go home.
So I mean I've heard that like,
like somebody in our,

637
00:40:22.031 --> 00:40:23.020
in our previous film,

638
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:28.021
she went in for a Migraine and they saw that she had a history and that she had

639
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:31.030
bipolar disorder and they sent her home.
I mean,
you know,

640
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:34.270
when you hear about things like that,
that's sort of the flip side of this.

641
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.550
That is pretty upsetting.

642
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.730
<v 0>That's,
yeah,
very upsetting.</v>

643
00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:43.060
And I have heard stories like that and it is not best practices,
but I,

644
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.550
but I acknowledge that,
I've heard stories like that too.
Yeah.
And,
um,

645
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.630
if you are struggling,

646
00:40:48.631 --> 00:40:52.920
please know that there's hope and that you can get help and please reach out for

647
00:40:52.921 --> 00:40:56.250
help.
We have some resources here.
Um,
and to end,

648
00:40:56.251 --> 00:40:59.190
we're going to go ahead and run the clip of Brandon please.

649
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.990
<v 4>Okay.
Suicide Prevention Center crisis</v>

650
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:10.830
lost your job and your

651
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
plan of how you would do what we have to do is help people feel safe and

652
00:41:25.291 --> 00:41:28.560
comfortable to talk about something that scares the hell out of them.

653
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.160
And if somebody can connect with you in that moment where feeling like there's

654
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:35.600
no reason to live,

655
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.250
that takes them out of the aloneness and the moment that they're not feeling

656
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:44.480
alone,
they're already safer than they were before they spoke with you.

657
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:53.270
That
she's fine.
I ended up,
well,

658
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.780
I this had to make sure that you had the support that you needed for that too.

659
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.270
Okay.
Now not everybody can do this.
A lot of people care,

660
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:06.710
but it's sometimes really difficult to put that care and that passion and

661
00:42:06.711 --> 00:42:09.080
compassion into,
um,

662
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.960
different kind of skillset to talk to people who are thinking about suicide.

663
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:19.210
<v 2>Brandon proud of was on of our own.</v>

664
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.900
<v 4>He was a very,
very good counselor.
I think he saved many lives.</v>

665
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.250
<v 2>How long has it</v>

666
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:30.140
<v 4>been since you've had any kind of psychiatric,
oh,
this was way off saying a life,</v>

667
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:31.900
I think for a number of years.
Are you

668
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.920
proud of?
Was the only shift supervisor I've ever had who had groupies.

669
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.940
<v 8>Don't want to see the La Cosa.</v>

670
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.160
Don't feel
he was a rockstar.

671
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:55.610
And,
and that's when he grew his hair really long.

672
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.180
So look like a rock star.
Don't wanna wake up

673
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.380
<v 2>asking him,
are you suicidal?</v>

674
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:11.600
I couldn't ask him that early on.
I couldn't even face that.

675
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.740
It was really that side of me that this is all going to end.

676
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.910
He's going to be okay.

677
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.260
<v 1>Oh,</v>

678
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:33.670
<v 2>anybody who has lost anyone through suicide,
you always say,</v>

679
00:43:33.671 --> 00:43:37.600
what did I miss a what?
Why couldn't I say?
Yep.

680
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.480
<v 1>What did I do wrong?</v>

681
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.620
<v 2>And who doesn't have one right now?</v>

682
00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.530
I really don't have an answer to that.
And you know,

683
00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.960
the last thing we want,
I think this is true with everybody,

684
00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:04.990
is to forget our loved one.

685
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.430
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you guys so much.
