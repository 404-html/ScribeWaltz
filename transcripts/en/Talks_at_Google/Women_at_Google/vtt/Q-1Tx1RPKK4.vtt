Please help me welcome Samantha Lichens.

25
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.920
<v 3>Hi,
good afternoon everyone.
Uh,
thank you so much for joining me here.</v>

26
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.340
My name is Samantha Laken and asking the tough said.
Um,

27
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.170
I am a current phd student at the strats are center for Holocaust and genocide

28
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:40.730
studies at Clark University.

29
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.950
And what I want to do today is give you a little bit of information and insight

30
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:47.540
about my journey.
Um,

31
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.690
working with survivors of genocide and conflict and also looking at issues of

32
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:58.481
transitional justice and how societies recover from a conflict and genocide to

33
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:02.970
peace.
And I'm going to do that in um,

34
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.590
a very special way.
What I feel is very special.
Um,

35
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:12.260
I'm going to do that by taking you through a number of themes and stories that

36
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:13.600
kind of highlight,
uh,

37
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.470
the post conflict and post genocide landscape in Rwanda today.
Um,

38
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.710
to give you a sense of those types of places and spaces that I've been able to

39
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:28.230
enter a while doing this work for the past six years.
Um,

40
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.280
and to help you rethink and reframe your own conceptions of post genocide and

41
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:36.050
postconflict justice,
whatever that means to you.

42
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.820
And I'm hoping that by the end of this talk you'll have seen some new things,
uh,

43
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.620
seen some new sites through the photos,
most,
most of which I've taken.
And also,

44
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:46.454
um,

45
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.060
learn to think a little bit differently about the successes and challenges that

46
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:52.890
we often experience through the media,
um,

47
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.350
or through other stories that we've heard sitting here in Cambridge and how they

48
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:02.020
affect people,
um,
in Rwanda and in around the world at large.

49
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.720
Um,
so the talk today is called from genocide to dignity and justice.

50
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.410
And basically the main questions I want to address are these.

51
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.670
I want you to think about what themes make up the landscape of post genocide

52
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.480
Rwanda.

53
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.480
And don't worry if you don't know too much about Rwanda right now cause I'll be

54
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.520
giving you a bit of information in a minute.

55
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.190
And the second thing I want to do is challenge us to rethink our framing,

56
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.473
um,

57
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.980
and assumptions about conflict and recovery and to use the stories that I'm

58
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.080
going to tell you.
And the experiences that I'm going to share with you,
um,

59
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.810
to understand these realistic goals,
developments,
challenges,

60
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.690
and areas for future and involvement.
And a while,
you know,

61
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.570
I was speaking with Madoff beforehand.

62
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:50.080
This subject sounds like something about genocide and death.
Um,

63
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:55.000
my goal is actually to get us thinking differently and reframing our ideas and

64
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.860
conceptions about what recovery means to a place where we're not sitting

65
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.861
depressed thinking about how Rwanda was in 1994 but we are thinking about ways

66
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:09.820
that transitional justice and others justice initiatives can really help

67
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:14.290
societies recover and thinking about that in a realistic and focused way.

68
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.580
So when we think of post genocide Rwanda,

69
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.120
what comes to mind is it's something like this.

70
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.820
<v 3>Or is it something like this?</v>

72
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.140
<v 3>The first photo is from one of the national memorial sites to genocide in Rwanda</v>

74
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.690
and show us some of the scars and the bullet holes.
For example,

75
00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:43.940
on the skulls of genocide victims.

76
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.380
This and image speaks about,
um,

77
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.480
three women who graduated from Aga Hosel Shalom youth village,
uh,

78
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:57.980
running and having fun in their village on the day of their graduation.
In there,

79
00:04:57.981 --> 00:05:01.790
a cap and gown.
So very contrasting images to get us started.

80
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.590
So I want to give you a snapshot of Rwanda.
Um,

81
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.570
so basically Rwanda is a country in um,
eastern Central Africa.

82
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.160
Um,
and I'll show you a map in a minute where there are about 12 million people

83
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:19.520
living the languages are Kenya,
Rwanda,
English,
French,

84
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.380
and some Swahili spoken.

85
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.640
Most of the country is Catholic or Protestant,
um,

86
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.880
with a small minority of Muslims and non affiliated religious.

87
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.230
It borders Burundi,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
DRC,

88
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.000
Tanzania and Uganda.

89
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.480
But what's amazing is it's approximately the size of the state of Maryland.

90
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.630
So when you look at the map,
if you haven't seen where Rwanda is,

91
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:46.631
you'll be pretty amazed that little red.in that kind of the central east of

92
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:50.210
Africa is the country of Rwanda.
Uh,

93
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.130
looking at the entire continent of Africa,
that small mat,
that small dot,

94
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.880
the red,
uh,
is the country of.
So it's very small.
Territorially

95
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.130
and I'm,
I want to give you a little bit of history about the genocide in Rwanda.

96
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.740
I don't want to focus too much today on the history.

97
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.920
That's not what I'm here to do.
What I'm here to do is really,
um,

98
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.810
help you bring you into some spaces about the reconstruction and a

99
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.650
reconciliation processes in Rwanda.

100
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.050
So I'm going to go through this a little bit quickly.

101
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.270
If you have questions in the end,
please let me know.

102
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.700
But I just want to give you a background so you can kind of have an

103
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:27.260
understanding of what happened.
So,
um,
in 1994,

104
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.950
um,
there was a genocide that took place in Rwanda.
Um,

105
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.951
the population at the time was about 84% who to about 15% Tutsi and about 1% of

106
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:39.380
indigenous trois people.

107
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.370
And the story goes that the history goes that,
um,

108
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.420
the Belgian colonial powers helped,
uh,

109
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.470
construct these identities,
uh,
who to the majority Tutsi,

110
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.240
the minority,
um,

111
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.300
and also had put Tutsi in power as kind of indirect rulers during Belgian

112
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.350
colonization.

113
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.040
And this created a lot of conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi communities.
Um,

114
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.450
and I'm saying communities because Hutu and Tutsi are not exactly ethnic

115
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:13.100
identities.
Uh,
in Rwanda,
everybody speaks the same language.
Kenya,

116
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:15.530
Rwanda,
I had come from similar backgrounds.

117
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.540
So these divisions were not particularly salient or meaningful until,

118
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:24.140
uh,
the Belgian colonizers came to power.
So again,

119
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:29.141
they favored the Tutsi who basically they gave a lot of positions to in,

120
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:33.050
in government and in education.
And,
um,
after that,

121
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:37.370
the Hutu extremist government came to power in the first and second republic

122
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.660
and,
um,

123
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.720
started to persecute the Tutsi population between 1959 and 1994 in 1994 on the

124
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:51.320
6th of April,
that,
that who to hardliner,
President Habyarimana,

125
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.120
um,
his plane was shot down on the 6th of April.
And on the seventh,

126
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.690
the Rwandan Armed Forces and the Interahamwe militia,
uh,

127
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.010
started the systematic killing of Tutsi and moderate Hutus.
Um,

128
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:05.120
and as we know,

129
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:08.450
many of us who were alive during this period or who were watching the news,

130
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.660
the international community really abandoned Rwanda.
Um,

131
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.540
we've even seen recent articles come out in foreign policy that,
um,

132
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.530
heads of state in the United States knew what was going on.

133
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:22.100
And we're concerned about calling it a genocide because of what intervention

134
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.760
would mean.
And so these debates are ongoing,
but in Rwanda,

135
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:29.870
people generally feel that United Nations and international community let them

136
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:30.704
down.

137
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.980
So the killings began and there were about 100 days of genocidal killings all

138
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:39.530
throughout the country with very popular involvement.
So,
um,

139
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.210
killings on the ground,

140
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:44.940
we call it low tech killing with machetes and clubs at other,
um,

141
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.960
other kind of household and farming,
uh,
weapons.

142
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.260
And I'm on the 4th of July.
In 1994,

143
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:56.290
the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Rwandan Patriotic Army who been an exile and

144
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:01.890
Uganda,
uh,
came in,
took control of the capital city of Kigali,

145
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.750
uh,
liberated the country and started to form a transitional government.

146
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.640
So that's kind of the history we've got of what happened during the genocide.
Um,

147
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:12.960
so the current RPF,

148
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.370
Rwandan Patriotic Front love led government and the state in general has really

149
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:22.371
attempted to rebuild social order and social fabric in Rwanda since 1994.

150
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.240
And the goal of the state with regard to survivors,
which is specifically what I,

151
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.170
uh,
what I research,
um,

152
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.310
is threefold as identified by the state to provide security to combat genocide

153
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.711
ideology and denial and to reunite the country under the bonding in Rwanda that

154
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:41.010
we are all Rwandans.

155
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.040
We are all one Rwandan people and these ideals are very prevalent and have been

156
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:50.640
there since the end of the genocide in 1994 and are heavily present in the

157
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:52.170
reconstruction that we see today.

158
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.390
So just some statistics about survivors before we get into the meat,

159
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.140
the kind of good stuff,
uh,
where we're going to enter into these spaces.

160
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:04.500
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about these themes that I've identified

161
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:06.240
in the stories that go with them,

162
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:09.690
the experiences that I've had being in Rwanda and being with,

163
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.070
with different people.
Um,
but we have about 1 million genocide victims,
uh,

164
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.080
to see on moderate who to massacred in 1994 about 300,000 survivors with 58%

165
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:25.620
women.
I'm 64,000 or 65,000 orphans,
widows,

166
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.410
rape victims,
children born of rape,

167
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:32.610
which is a major issue right now in Rwanda and also handicapped.

168
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.480
So these are kind of some of the um,

169
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.170
scars that have been left after the genocide.

170
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.750
So these are the spaces of healing that I wanted to speak about and I've

171
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:44.970
identified basically five categories,

172
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:49.500
broad categories that I've really experienced that are taking place in Rwanda

173
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:54.360
today.
And as I said,
they have their challenges and their successes.
Um,

174
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.050
and what I really want to do is to introduce you to those challenges and

175
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:02.520
successes so that we can gain a really comprehensive understanding of how to

176
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:04.950
even start thinking about post conflict development.

177
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.140
You won't be experts by the end of the day,

178
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:12.141
but I'm hoping to give you something to take away that will allow you to think

179
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:17.871
about how you envisioned post conflict societies and what you might think after

180
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:24.030
this lecture.
So the spaces of healing,
development,
recovery,

181
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.290
truth and grief and Rwanda I've identified as memory,

182
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.890
justice,
youth and education,

183
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.840
psychological health and trauma,
healing and technology and research.

184
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.770
I'm also not going to try to give you kind of the standard examples today.

185
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.410
The ones that you've read in the news are the ones that you've seen a million

186
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.160
times.

187
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.340
What I'm going to try to do is take you through my experiences over the past

188
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:51.300
four years and help again enter into these spaces that are little known and that

189
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:54.610
you might not otherwise be able to see your access to help us broaden our

190
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:55.444
understanding.

191
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.770
So I want to take a deep breath and look at this really beautiful photo of a

192
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:03.880
sunset and a PA,
Eastern Province,
Rwanda,
uh,

193
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.280
where my God brother is from and survived from.

194
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:10.880
And I want you to just take a minute before we enter into these themes and I'm

195
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.410
think to yourself,
what does postconflict mean or look like?

196
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.890
Like we saw those two photos.
Does it look more like the skulls?

197
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.670
Does it look more like the graduates,
the women who have graduated high school?

198
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.880
What does it look like to you right now before we enter into this moment?

199
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.650
Okay,
I think we're ready.

200
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.290
The first thing I want to address his memory and I want to introduce you to
Omar.

201
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.070
Um,

202
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.070
this is Omar who is standing in the Yamato Memorial church where nearly 335,000

203
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.880
Rwandans were massacred in early April,
1994.

204
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.040
And Omar at 10 years old was only one of very few survivors,

205
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.650
um,
as he was a child,
um,

206
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.480
he was able to hide under other people who had already been killed and,
um,

207
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.920
even,
uh,

208
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:07.640
was beaten on his legs and had to remain silent to a show that he was,
you know,

209
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.080
basically to prove that he was dead before they enter,

210
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:14.770
how my left and had escaped out of the church and into the community of Amata.

211
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.270
But,
um,

212
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.420
what was amazing is I have known Omar professionally through the Ngo world and

213
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.710
never really knew about his survival story.

214
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.630
But a one day we were eating lunch and Kigali and he said to me,
Samantha,

215
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:33.190
I know a lot about your work documenting testimonies and I'd like you to come

216
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:38.191
with me to knee Amata and to actually walk through the site with me and document

217
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:42.790
my story.
And I thought to myself,
oh great,
this is wonderful.

218
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:46.780
It will be good for my research.
It'll help my friend Omar go through his story.

219
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.560
Um,

220
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.670
but I didn't really realize how incredibly difficult and emotional it would be.

221
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.420
Um,

222
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.010
not only returning to the site but also returning to the site with a survivor of

223
00:13:57.011 --> 00:13:59.230
the site who was also my friend.

224
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.060
And so these kinds of issues of memory were at play,

225
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.320
not only the surface issue where I can go in as a researcher and document

226
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:10.270
people's memories of the place.

227
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.810
The second element is not only am I documenting the memories,

228
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:17.890
but it was in the physical space itself,
which is a very intense.

229
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.710
And the third element was,
this is my friend,

230
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.560
this is someone I know and care about and work with.

231
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:28.890
So those three things were at play in my mind as we began driving out of Kigali

232
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:34.141
toward a bogus Sarah where the Amato memorial churches and in this photo Omar's

233
00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:38.080
and the church,
the gray banner as a memorial banner.

234
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.680
And he's looking down at the benches which contained victim's clothing.

235
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.010
So those are clothing that were either left in the church,

236
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:49.090
are brought to the church,
uh,
from victims who had died during the genocide.

237
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:53.990
And you can see he's kind of thinking and he's actually standing in the place

238
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:58.310
where he survived.
He survived,
uh,
on the bench that he is right in front of.
And,

239
00:14:58.311 --> 00:14:59.144
um,

240
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.090
what was pretty amazing about documenting Omar story is,
um,

241
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.210
the kind of liberation had had for both me and for him.
Um,
for me,

242
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:10.540
I was trying to be professional and uh,

243
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.580
not to cry when my friend was telling me about his experiences,

244
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.180
which included listening to the children and women who are kind of at the

245
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:24.950
backside of the church by the altar,
who were crying.
And screaming for God.

246
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:28.940
He was hearing all of this and was recounting this to us.
And,
um,

247
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.250
I felt like I was causing him pain.

248
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.990
I felt like I was kind of poking him with something sharp and hurting him and I

249
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:37.580
didn't want to cause them any more pain,

250
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.050
but he had asked me to do this and he wanted to document the story and continue

251
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.620
to take us throughout the church and tell us about these experiences.

252
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:48.770
And there I was trying to be completely professional for my friend,

253
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.100
but inside feeling like I was really causing him pain and that was really hard

254
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:56.090
to deal with.
Um,
and so we ended up recording this.

255
00:15:56.091 --> 00:16:01.091
I'm in a video form and a Omar now has it to share with his future family,

256
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.570
future children,
et cetera.
And uh,
it ended up being a really powerful experience,

257
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.600
but it took me really out of my element where I usually interview,
um,

258
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.420
individuals who I haven't met before and who I don't know and don't have a prior

259
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:18.920
relationship with trying to understand their relationship to memory and justice

260
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:21.740
issues in Rwanda.
Um,
so this was very different.

261
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.570
And what it showed though was how important the memory was to him.

262
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.350
That he wanted to do this as a way to honor his own memory,

263
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.860
but also to keep it for the future.
And so,
um,

264
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.440
one of the themes that,
um,

265
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.980
I wanted to go through with memory is that,
um,

266
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.390
this mia motto memorial site is one of the six national memorial sites in
Rwanda.

267
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.270
Um,
and there are also many local memorial sites.
Um,

268
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.560
they're often like this with survivors clothing,
skulls of survivors,
uh,

269
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.910
caskets and other things left behind.
Um,

270
00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.010
but to bring in some of these good things and the challenges,
you know,
um,

271
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:05.180
I wanted to talk about the purpose of having these memorial sites and having a

272
00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:07.040
annual commemorations around them.

273
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.780
So commemoration period begins in Rwanda on April 7th,
um,

274
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.780
every year and lasts for about a hundred days.

275
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.850
And there are many local and national commemorative events.
And,
um,

276
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.190
during the commemoration we have testimonies,
poetry,

277
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:26.870
read a official speakers from government and from other communities,

278
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.120
uh,
often a comparative Lens.

279
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:33.290
And most of the population in Rwanda take part in these commemorations.

280
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.710
And so to get us thinking it's really about what is the purpose of the

281
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:37.610
commemoration.

282
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.960
At one point it brings survivors together and it provides validation of the

283
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:45.410
harms they've suffered.
It can educate people.
Um,

284
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:48.440
but sometimes there's also this view traumatization.
Um,

285
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:52.680
sometimes there are state goals or other goals that are at odds with survivors

286
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:53.514
goals.

287
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.720
And one survivor who I spoke with last week when I was preparing this told me

288
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.520
that people can be in the same physical commemoration space and be commemorating

289
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:04.110
and remembering different things,

290
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.650
which I think is something really interesting to think about how people can be

291
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:11.400
experiencing the same event yet be remembering it and,

292
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.020
and having different reactions.

293
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.980
So that's one of the challenges is how to make commemoration inclusive and bring

294
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:21.870
everyone in.
So this is for example,
something that happens at the commemoration.

295
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:25.620
This is a photo I took of some of the candles that are lit as people sit in

296
00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:27.240
these kind of white plastic chairs.

297
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.800
And you could have anywhere between 500,000 people at one commemoration.

298
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.530
Sometimes there could be 30,
it depends on the type,

299
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.750
but I just wanted to give you small perspective.

300
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.130
The next thing I wanted to talk about is justice.

301
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.080
Justice is a huge,

302
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.700
huge subject and part of the benefit of justice is that it is a large subject.

303
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:52.440
So we don't have to be limited in the ways in which we think about justice.
Um,

304
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.910
and I know I'm not going to do justice to the subject of justice today,

305
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.350
but I do want to give you a little bit of history and take you into these
spaces.

306
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.570
So again,
this isn't Yamato Memorial Church.

307
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.810
You could see those benches and you can see the reeds that have been laid on the

308
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:12.870
ground there.
Um,
so this is kind of a bigger picture of the church.

309
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.310
Um,
so memorial sites are a form of symbolic justice,

310
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.000
which is one way to bring justice,
especially to survivors.

311
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.510
So in transitional justice,
we often think about courts.

312
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.830
We think about international criminal tribunals.
We think about local courts.

313
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:30.480
We think about the court system.

314
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.690
When we think about justice automatically when we say justice,

315
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:37.320
our mind goes to the lawyers.
And to the judges,
to the court systems,

316
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.390
which is good.
And there are many,

317
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:43.950
many positive benefits from court systems including holding perpetrators

318
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.470
accountable.
Um,

319
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.740
one of the things though that is that I focus on is what happens when the courts

320
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:53.160
close and when there is no longer a tyrannical justice.

321
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.390
And that's where the symbolic efforts such as apology and memorialization and

322
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:58.890
commemoration come into play,

323
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.100
which really focused less on perpetrators and more on survivors.

324
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.690
I just want to go through a story of a woman,

325
00:20:06.691 --> 00:20:11.040
Bernadette who I met,
um,
interviewing,
uh,

326
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.010
during my fifth research trip in Rwanda.
And um,

327
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.690
we were sitting on the grass at the back of the knee motto Memorial Church.
Um,

328
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.410
it had been an hour long bus ride and we really,
um,
had come,

329
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:25.260
my interpreter and I adjust to interview Bernadette.

330
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.850
Now Bernadette was a caretaker,
uh,

331
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.910
at the memorial and most people didn't pay attention to her.
Uh,

332
00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.270
they didn't know about her story,
but when I met her and started speaking a bit,

333
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:41.040
if you can in Rwanda with her,
I realized she had a lot more to discuss then,
uh,

334
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.180
might have led on a,
with her basically being a janitor,
a cleaning,

335
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.070
having a cleaning role.
And we basically,

336
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:52.300
I remember this day sitting barefoot on the grass there.
Uh,
the three women,
me,

337
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.880
my,
uh,
interpreter and Bernadette,

338
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:59.060
I'm asking questions about memory and justice and,
um,

339
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.210
she told me basically that she had been hiding,
um,

340
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.690
and in place that was unfit for any human being.

341
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.080
She was hiding in a hole in the ground underneath some large banana leafs.

342
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.540
And the Rwandan Patriotic Front eventually found her,
um,

343
00:21:18.541 --> 00:21:23.170
and she remembers them kind of picking her out of there and bringing her to a

344
00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:27.940
safe spot and picking the bugs and the close up bugs out of her clothes and
hair.

345
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.270
And she defines this as her sense of justice,

346
00:21:31.271 --> 00:21:35.650
which is the human decency that she was treated with in that moment of despair.

347
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:38.740
What she thought that the world had forgotten about her.

348
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.970
And so it's kind of from that perspective that I take,
uh,

349
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:47.110
an understanding of justice that justice could have multiple meanings for people

350
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:50.350
in the aftermath of genocide and conflict.
Um,

351
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.470
in addition to those legal forms of justice,

352
00:21:53.471 --> 00:21:57.640
we also have many other forms of justice that we may not even know about or

353
00:21:57.641 --> 00:21:58.870
might not even know to ask.

354
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.970
And one of the things I do in my research is trying to get at those other forms

355
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.120
and other definitions of justice that may provide more meaning for policy and

356
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:14.320
reconciliation programs.
Then kind of the traditional forms of justice.

357
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:16.150
So just something for us to think about.
Again,

358
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.170
these are children at the Naea Mata Memorial Church,
uh,

359
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.260
who are going on an official commemoration,
um,
bringing their wreath,

360
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.840
which is a really a common thing in Rwanda.

361
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.310
Um,
the next thing that I want to talk about his youth and education,

362
00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:38.200
so this is gut cure.
Did a Nigga Kire and a I met [inaudible] through a friend,

363
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.750
a got curious is the author of a dreaming child,

364
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:45.751
which is this phenomenal book about a young people's experiences during the

365
00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:48.890
genocide in Rwanda.
And I bring up,
um,

366
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:54.060
got curee because he is quite representative of the roles that young people had

367
00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:57.430
to take.
Um,
in the aftermath of the genocide.

368
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.270
Now not every young person is interested in the history of genocide and that's,

369
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.090
that's normal.
But there are many people in Rwanda,

370
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:08.050
especially young people who are truly interested in trying to make sense and

371
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:12.730
have some the psychological process of meaning making of the experiences they

372
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:16.180
had,
whether they were two years old,
four years old,
10 years old.

373
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.930
They're still trying to make sense of what happened to their families and also

374
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:24.730
educate others.
And they really take this as a personal goal and got curious.

375
00:23:24.731 --> 00:23:27.130
Book is an example of that.
Um,

376
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.430
the Curie was actually invited to Bogota Columbia to attend the international

377
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.590
book fair there.

378
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.220
And I had been working with him on getting grants and thanks to a number of

379
00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:40.480
sponsors,
he was able to fly for the first time out of Rwanda to,
we'll go to,

380
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.070
and a,
I remember being on,
on Facebook messenger and I said,
how did it go?

381
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.790
How was the lecture?
And he said,
um,
there were 400 people there.

382
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:55.310
And I thought to myself,
400 people from Columbia and other places,

383
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.610
um,
asked,
came to hear you speak about your book,

384
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.340
that's pretty incredible and that impact is pretty amazing.

385
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.680
And I'm just to provide a statistic.

386
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:08.210
60% of Rwandans living in Rwanda are under the age of 25,
like a puree.

387
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.550
And so we have this,
um,

388
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.770
heavy burden but also opportunity put on the youth in Rwanda.

389
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.310
Um,

390
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.100
and there are other incredible things that they're doing that can tell you about

391
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:22.880
as well.
Um,
I also want to introduce you to Henry.

392
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.350
Henry is one of those graduates of Algos are Shalom youth village in Rwanda.

393
00:24:27.351 --> 00:24:31.970
You can see his green cap and gown.
And I met Henry on my first visit,

394
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.240
first weekend in Rwanda where I was invited to the youth village to um,

395
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.310
attend their science fair.
And uh,

396
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.440
Henry was actually put in charge of the welcoming committee and he welcomed me

397
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:47.960
as a guest.
He didn't know me,
I didn't know him.

398
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.590
You know those relationships you think,
okay,
they're passing,
I'll meet him,

399
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:54.380
I'll go back.
I'll start my work,
that'd be fine.

400
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.440
It turned out that I gave Henry My,
uh,

401
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.220
email address and he started to write to me as he began to apply to colleges and

402
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:04.970
ask me advice.
And uh,
I was very apt to work with him.
He was a,

403
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:09.710
he's an incredible young men and,
uh,
basically,
um,

404
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.970
three years later,

405
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.680
Henry is now a second year student at Mcgill University.

406
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.600
Not only did he gain admission,

407
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:22.580
but he gained scholarships from Miguel and from private families and we work

408
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:24.590
together in order to make this dream come true.

409
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:28.490
And it was pretty amazing because I can't tell you the amount of times that I

410
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:32.120
said,
Henry,
I'm not sure this is going to happen this year.
I said,

411
00:25:32.121 --> 00:25:36.800
maybe in future years.
But as you know,
a college and the West is very expensive.

412
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.950
And coming from a background where it,

413
00:25:38.951 --> 00:25:41.750
both of his parents were killed during the genocide,

414
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.070
a while his mother was actually breastfeeding him and had his twin brother on,

415
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:50.450
on the back,
he has a twin.
And a,
what was amazing was,
um,

416
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.130
I was sitting with these two boys on their birthday having dinner and his

417
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:59.300
brother,
Eric said to me,
do you believe in miracles?
I thought to myself,

418
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.630
I don't really know,
I don't think about miracle set often.
And he said,
well,

419
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:06.560
can you imagine that a boy from this background in Rwanda growing up with a

420
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:11.561
grandmother in a pretty poor neighborhood is a heading off to McGill and a few

421
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.420
weeks with his visa,
his scholarship,
uh,
his apartment,
everything sorted out.

422
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:21.110
And I said,
yeah,
it's pretty incredible.
And he looked at me and said,
no,
this is,

423
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.890
this is a miracle.
It's not just pretty incredible.
And so,
uh,

424
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:26.690
he really changed my perspective.
But a,

425
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:29.300
Henry and I are in touch on a weekly basis and,
uh,

426
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.790
I'll be working with him throughout his entire college experience.
And,
uh,

427
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.820
I'm excited for the opportunities that youth have both in Rwanda and out.

428
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.590
The last thing I want to mention about youth as peace education.
And very,

429
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:44.281
very briefly,

430
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:48.390
the organization I used to work for a ages trust and the Kigali genocide

431
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:50.250
memorial started this,
uh,

432
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.450
educational program around peace and critical thinking for youth.

433
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:59.040
And this is another aspect of post genocide and postconflict recovery is how to

434
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:04.041
reeducate and help youth really understand the power of their decisions and make

435
00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:07.760
sure that they could both understand their past in order to go forward toward

436
00:27:07.761 --> 00:27:08.580
the future.

437
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.500
So this shows the story of Eduardo who is one of the upstanders during the

438
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:17.370
genocide and kind of through pictures on this mobile exhibit.

439
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.530
And these are graphic designs,

440
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.810
take students through his story and then afterward they sit with facilitators

441
00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:29.340
and go through some of the main themes about,
as I said,
critical thinking,

442
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.660
the power of individual choice and the power of a kind of living together in the

443
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:34.950
aftermath of conflict.

444
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:42.470
So the next thing I want to touch on is a psychological healing and trauma

445
00:27:42.511 --> 00:27:43.890
healing.
And as I said,

446
00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:47.800
I'm not going to tell you completely the standards stories.
Um,

447
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.310
this is a picture I took when I saw at met.
Um,
the all female drumming group,

448
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.060
um,
whose name is,
um,

449
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.150
in Goleman's Shah,
which means a new drum.

450
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.530
And so I'm drumming and Rwanda traditionally reserved for men,

451
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.470
uh,
and,
uh,

452
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.610
prohibited from women who are usually prohibited from even touching drums or

453
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:14.820
even approaching the drummer who used to perform for the king.

454
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.380
But this drum group came about after the genocide with Hutu and Tutsi women

455
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:24.060
coming together of all different ages of different backgrounds of socioeconomic

456
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:28.980
backgrounds.
Um,
other backgrounds came together to learn this and actually,

457
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.540
um,
to show that they are strong both physically and picking up the drums and

458
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:37.230
actually drumming and also that are strong mentally and emotionally.

459
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.890
And this is a very interesting example of psychological health because it's not

460
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:44.790
what we usually think of where people sit and counseling groups or individual

461
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:45.990
counseling,
uh,

462
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:50.370
which takes a long time and is very slow and there is also costly and expensive.

463
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:55.530
There are amazing things about,
uh,
this kind of trauma counseling.
But in Rwanda,

464
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:58.220
many people don't access it.
And so,
um,

465
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.830
these kinds of groups which bring people together are pretty incredible.

466
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.900
And after I saw this performance,

467
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:07.260
I spoke to one of the drummers and she basically said,
you know,

468
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:09.780
the group is like a new family,
a Rwandans,

469
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.100
a lot of them lost family if not entire members of their family during the

470
00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:14.934
genocide.

471
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.870
And these newly constructed social groups and social networks are incredibly

472
00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:22.860
important for psychological health and trauma healing because the women also

473
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:26.730
talk about what's going on in their lives.
They celebrate together,
weddings,

474
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.290
births,
deaths,

475
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.010
everything that you would expect a family or a broader community to do,

476
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:33.150
these women do together.

477
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.110
And there are others examples of these kinds of groups around economic

478
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:40.010
development and other development that,
um,

479
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.430
how have this benefit of psychological healing.

480
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:48.450
This is a photo that was actually taken by a very close friend of mine who was a

481
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:52.150
professional photographer and Rwanda.
And if you look closely,

482
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:56.440
the photo is of a scar on the stomach of a,
someone in Rwanda.

483
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:02.010
And I interviewed this person about a year and a half ago and he was very shy,

484
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.910
very quiet.
Uh,
the interview didn't last very long,

485
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:12.900
but one of the things that really struck me was this discussion of scars.
And,
um,

486
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.250
I spoke to him and said,
he told me he was captured by Interahamwe land,
um,

487
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.790
and had some scars.
And I said to him,
can you,

488
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:23.590
can you tell me a little bit about your scars?

489
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:28.650
And what he did was he stood up and he lifted up his shirt and showed me the

490
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:31.180
scar on his stomach.
Um,

491
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.180
after meeting him the first time I went back to interview him again,

492
00:30:34.181 --> 00:30:39.181
but I was shocked at the kind of vulnerability of showing this like a white

493
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:43.750
woman in Rwanda,
this scar on his stomach.
Um,

494
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.150
but he wanted to make a statement,
which is,
um,
that some of the scars,

495
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:53.890
you can see both the psychological and the physical scars and some you can't,

496
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.280
some are hidden under your clothes somewhere hidden in your mind.

497
00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:02.320
Some are hidden until something triggers them and comes out.

498
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.540
But the scars are living with these people are living with Rwandans and we don't

499
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:11.980
know necessarily when they're going to know,
manifest themselves or in what ways.

500
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:16.360
And so when working in post conflict societies,
we have to be very,
very,

501
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.320
almost vigilant to the point of,
um,

502
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.480
respect that we can understand coming from kind of non survivor perspectives,

503
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:30.841
how to work with survivors and others including perpetrators who have trauma of

504
00:31:31.691 --> 00:31:33.850
what happened and what they've done.
Now.

505
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:37.900
I personally believe that all of us have suffered some form of trauma or some

506
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.310
negative thing.
And it's not about comparing hierarchies of suffering.

507
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.300
What happened to me is not necessarily as bad or you know,

508
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:49.420
it doesn't feel as bad as what happened to you or what happened to a survivor.

509
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.560
But the point is figuring out what is the human level that we can connect on,

510
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.640
just show the most basic level of respect for someone who's been through these

511
00:31:57.641 --> 00:31:59.260
experiences.
And,
um,

512
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.980
I've been very lucky to have had the opportunity to see scars like these,

513
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.030
um,
which definitely make you uncomfortable to have them photographed and use for

514
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:14.740
educational purposes for teaching.
And also to understand that,

515
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.070
um,
again,
the scars don't always comment at the same time.

516
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.840
And so one thing I wanted to mention about scars as well as during the 1994,

517
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.140
I'm sorry,
during the commemoration period that starts on April 7th,

518
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:30.130
every year I often get texts on whatsapp or on,
uh,

519
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.120
on text message and say,
you know,
Samantha,
I'm not doing well.

520
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.880
And I got a little concerned and I think to myself,
well,

521
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:41.330
I'm not a counselor and I've met people in Rwanda and they're telling me that

522
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:43.700
all of a sudden something happened and they're not doing well.

523
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.750
And so it's very surprising the ways that people in which people will reach out

524
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.340
to their friends and uh,
other people who they've met.
And sometimes you feel,

525
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:54.170
I don't have a strong connection with that person,

526
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:57.710
but for some reason they felt they could trust me or maybe I was the only one

527
00:32:57.711 --> 00:32:58.790
online.
Right?

528
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:01.340
Maybe I was the only one online in that moment and they wanted to speak to

529
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:04.670
someone.
But you know,
letting them know I'm not a counselor,

530
00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:07.340
but I'm here as a friend.
I can advise you in that capacity.

531
00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:11.210
But it's amazing the amount of text messages and messages I get during this

532
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:15.650
period.
Um,
and the emotional stress both on the individual and myself,

533
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.610
uh,
just being very completely honest and vulnerable with you.
Um,

534
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.810
but that's the responsibility of working in,
uh,
in this sector

535
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:30.350
is to accept these relationships as they are and to try your best to do what you

536
00:33:30.351 --> 00:33:32.150
can do.
Um,

537
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:38.030
and none of us is perfect,
but,
uh,

538
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.670
even just being there for someone is sometimes enough.

539
00:33:40.671 --> 00:33:44.630
I had someone write to me very late at night and in the morning wrote back and

540
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:49.530
said,
um,
I was thinking of um,
basically drinking over drinking.
Um,

541
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.410
and after I spoke to you,

542
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:54.740
I went to sleep and I realized that I would wake up tomorrow and feel maybe a

543
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:59.180
little bit better and all I did was take a minute to communicate with him and I

544
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:01.880
didn't know about any of these thoughts in his mind,

545
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.120
but it was pretty incredible.
It was just taking that moment to say,
yes,
I'm here.

546
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:05.954
Tell me what's up.

547
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.120
I'm going to have to go in a couple of minutes to get back to work.

548
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:09.900
But whatever it is,
uh,

549
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.400
sometimes you don't know the impact of the people who you are interacting with.

550
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.990
So the last point I want to touch on is kind of an uplifting point and it's

551
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:21.800
definitely appropriate for those of you working at Google and working in this

552
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:24.800
sector,
um,
is technology and research.

553
00:34:24.801 --> 00:34:29.801
And one of the things that has been happening in Rwanda is the startup company

554
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:30.800
of safe motos.

555
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.090
So safe photos has helped Rwanda separate good drivers from what they call the

556
00:34:35.091 --> 00:34:38.630
crazy ones.
Um,
motorbikes are,
and,
uh,

557
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:42.500
a very common way to get around in Rwanda,

558
00:34:42.501 --> 00:34:44.240
especially in the capitol city of Kigali.

559
00:34:44.241 --> 00:34:48.260
And most of the motorbikes are unregistered and most accidents also happen on

560
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.950
motorbikes.
And so safe Motos,
uh,

561
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.960
has an APP that's very similar to Uber that encourages a motorbike taxi riders

562
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:59.630
to contact safe Motos who's I'm a Modo.

563
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:03.530
Drivers are trained in safety and there's also a record given on how many

564
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:07.070
accidents they've had and um,
what kind of driving record they have.
So,

565
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.650
not only are you able to be picked up in a safe place,

566
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.030
but you're also able to know kind of the rating of your driver.
Very,
again,

567
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:18.090
very similar to Uber,
the two founders,
Peter car,
Yuki,

568
00:35:18.091 --> 00:35:21.790
and they're at Nash.
Peter is actually a close friend of mine,
uh,

569
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.780
and they're doing amazing,
amazing work.
Um,

570
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.690
and they also are interested because I'm belonging to safe.

571
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:34.040
Motos not only helps the rider but actually helps the driver and Modo drivers

572
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:35.270
are one of these,
uh,

573
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.520
kind of segments of the population that you don't really know a lot about them.

574
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.380
You don't know if they're a survivor,

575
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.450
you have no idea if they were a former perpetrator.

576
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.020
Oftentimes they don't speak English or French.
Uh,

577
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.340
it's hard for Westerners to communicate with them,

578
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.190
but they are a huge segment of the population.

579
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:53.940
Many of them are coming from villages or other places to the capital city of

580
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:56.730
Kigali to drive a motorbike and make money.

581
00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.660
And so they're one of the people that we really don't know a lot about.

582
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:04.050
Groups of people that we really don't know a lot about but are heavily prevalent

583
00:36:04.051 --> 00:36:08.810
in society in Kigali.
And so one of the amazing things is that I'm,

584
00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.810
authorities are often ambivalent towards moto drivers,
um,

585
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.270
as they associate them with crime and disorder,

586
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.550
but showing but becoming part of safe motos helps them,
um,

587
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.370
show that they're legitimate people just trying to make an income and really

588
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:26.880
helps them gain legitimacy in the eyes of authorities and the eyes of the rest

589
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:27.714
of society.

590
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:31.620
So it's actually has a dual purpose and helping people ride safely and reduce

591
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:34.530
accidents,
but also helping in societal recovery,

592
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:38.670
showing that these Modo drivers are not young men coming to create problems in

593
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:39.091
the city,

594
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:41.910
but they're actually just trying to make a living and the best way that they
can.

595
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.730
And you can even see this as a free concert,
uh,

596
00:36:45.731 --> 00:36:48.660
an advertisement that says red with safe motos there.

597
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.510
So they're doing their advertising and saying,
you know,

598
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.140
you want to come to this concert,
great ride with safe motos.
Be Safe on your way.

599
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:57.120
And,
uh,
it's an amazing initiative.

600
00:36:57.121 --> 00:36:59.620
There's been a lot of press on safe motos and uh,

601
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.560
they'd become a pretty incredible startup.

602
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.730
But I think what's amazing about them is their commitment to developing the

603
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:07.850
sector of Modo drivers,
um,

604
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:12.480
within the post complex society to kind of get rid of this concept of,
you know,

605
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:16.200
the,
the young men trying to cause problems in this city,

606
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:20.460
which is a theoretical concept in post conflict societies that the young men

607
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:24.270
come to the cities and they want to cause problems and they don't have homes or

608
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:27.210
education.
And this is kind of combating that stereotype.

609
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:33.620
And the last thing I want to mention kind of bringing it back to um,

610
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.500
to memory and technology is I'm the genocide archive for Wanda's new web page.

611
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.830
And so the genocide archive of Rwanda,
um,

612
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.870
is able to bring access and knowledge to individuals around the world.
Um,

613
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:54.020
they have pre scan and prescreened all of their data that they put online where

614
00:37:54.181 --> 00:37:58.410
people can watch videos,
they can watch propaganda videos of the,
uh,

615
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.030
of the Hutu hardline regimes before 1994.
They could find documents,

616
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.320
they can take a virtual tour of the memorial sites,
which is pretty incredible.

617
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.090
Um,
and these are some of the positive things about this,
this a website.

618
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.260
Um,
and some of the questions also exists,
which is,
um,

619
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:21.240
how or in what ways can they be meaningful for the local community on the
ground.

620
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.640
They have a huge reach for people who are international.

621
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.710
But what about survivors,
perpetrators,

622
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:27.690
ordinary citizens who are living on the ground,

623
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:31.770
who might not have Internet access or who might not be interested in this kind

624
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:33.210
of education,
um,

625
00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:37.180
who was their primary audience and do these issues reconcile themselves in the

626
00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.080
same platform?

627
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:43.060
The issue of catering to a number of communities and a number of individuals.
Um,

628
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.450
and so that's one of the things that I think about when looking at these online

629
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:50.140
platforms or these virtual tours of sites is that yes,

630
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.190
a lot of people cannot travel to Rwanda and see these sights firsthand or

631
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:55.580
understand what happened firsthand.

632
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.680
So they're getting wonderful education through a platform like the genocide

633
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:02.710
archive of Rwanda.
But at the same time,
we don't want to do that.

634
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:06.780
At the expense of a understanding and making memorials,
uh,

635
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.440
and other,
other archives meaningful for survivors and former perpetrators.

636
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.450
So I'm going to end there for a minute and I know I've given you a lot of

637
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:19.960
information,
a lot of stories,
a lot of food for thought.

638
00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:24.400
But what I'm hoping is that this kind of has given you an understanding of

639
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:28.210
Rwanda as an example for post conflict societies writ large.

640
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.390
And one of my main,
uh,

641
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.360
kind of the core tenants of my research is that,
um,

642
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.420
we have to go deep and we have to go broad,
right?

643
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:41.740
So we have to go deep to understand that each context is different and that

644
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:43.720
Rwanda,
what,
what works in Rwanda,

645
00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:47.980
what doesn't work in Rwanda might be different from another place.

646
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.720
But at the same time,

647
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.580
there are themes that cut across post conflict societies and can help us rethink

648
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:55.840
wherever we are.

649
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.470
And so I want you to think back about what you knew and believed about post

650
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:04.210
genocide Rwanda or post conflict societies writ large and what you've learned

651
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:07.450
that might complicate or compliment your initial thoughts.

652
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.960
This was not meant to be a talk that will clarify everything for you.

653
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.620
Rather talk to get you thinking about these issues,

654
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:17.770
about the range of issues and about how you might be able to fit in.

655
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.570
So I want to close with a quote from,
uh,

656
00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.110
one of my idols in the world.
Um,
Desmond Tutu,

657
00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:28.900
which is do your little bit of good where you're at.

658
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.160
It's those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world.

659
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:38.320
And so start our responsibility,
the ability to do it all.
But,

660
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:38.651
um,

661
00:40:38.651 --> 00:40:42.490
I hope that today this kind of compels you to think about where you fit into the

662
00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:43.780
post conflict society.

663
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:48.100
Even if you are sitting at your office here in Cambridge or even if you travel a

664
00:40:48.101 --> 00:40:52.030
little bit to some places that might be considered postconflict to delve into

665
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:56.200
their history and look and think about what you can do in that very,

666
00:40:56.201 --> 00:40:59.680
very small way.
Just as I said,
staying up at night for five minutes,

667
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.320
whatsapp conversation kept a friend from,
uh,

668
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.160
over overdrinking and kept him waking up the next morning.

669
00:41:06.161 --> 00:41:08.680
And I'm glad to say he's doing really well.
Uh,

670
00:41:08.681 --> 00:41:13.510
what are those things that you can bring to the table?
Um,
with that,

671
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.980
I want to say thank you.

672
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.340
I want to say thank you to the Google office at Cambridge,

673
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:22.690
to everyone who came today.
Um,
I'm happy to take questions and comments,

674
00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:23.111
but again,

675
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:27.220
I really hope this opened your eyes to a subject that I really care about and

676
00:41:27.221 --> 00:41:32.221
that's that I'm passionate about and that I want to share with people who are,

677
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.890
um,
hopefully also interested in these kinds of issues.

678
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.210
So once again,

679
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:42.800
thank you to all of you to Google and,
uh,

680
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.040
I hope you enjoyed the talk and I'm very happy to entertain questions.

681
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:54.110
<v 2>Hi.
Um,</v>

682
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:59.490
can you talk a little bit more about transitional justice and,

683
00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.080
uh,
in the context of the Rwandan genocide,

684
00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:06.640
what maybe just giving us more details of what happened with tribunals and the

685
00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:09.720
historical facts?
Yes,

686
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.770
<v 3>absolutely.
So,
um,
as I mentioned,
I'm,</v>

687
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.810
I'll give you kind of the transitional justice one o one,

688
00:42:15.811 --> 00:42:20.610
which we do have a Clark,
a seminar on transitional justice at Clark University.

689
00:42:20.611 --> 00:42:23.010
I'm actually going to give it to in like a minute.
Um,

690
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.580
don't tell any professor who teaches that class that I've done this.
No,

691
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:31.260
I'm just kidding there.
My advisor,
um,
so basically transitional justice,

692
00:42:31.261 --> 00:42:31.951
as I mentioned,

693
00:42:31.951 --> 00:42:36.951
is a type of justice that accompanies states and societies from conflict to

694
00:42:37.561 --> 00:42:39.300
peace.
It's,

695
00:42:39.301 --> 00:42:44.100
I'm employed in the case of extraordinary crimes and extraordinary grievances.

696
00:42:44.101 --> 00:42:47.760
Mass violence,
mass atrocity is,
that doesn't only mean a number,

697
00:42:47.761 --> 00:42:51.810
but it also means in scale of participation and of targeting.

698
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.460
So it's not.
Um,

699
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:58.050
so basically the concept is that ordinary justice or ordinary legal courts

700
00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.800
cannot really,
uh,

701
00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:04.110
provide justice for these extraordinary crimes like genocide,

702
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.750
crimes against humanity,
war crimes,
et cetera.
Um,

703
00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:12.130
so transitional justice has been this array of mechanisms,
um,

704
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.740
kind of found it and used by the international community since the 1970s or

705
00:43:16.741 --> 00:43:20.970
eighties to address some of these issues that ordinary legal justice cannot

706
00:43:20.971 --> 00:43:23.310
address.
So in Rwanda,
um,

707
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.700
we see kind of the two,

708
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.330
two forms we see legal justice,
which I said again,

709
00:43:30.331 --> 00:43:35.130
focuses mostly on perpetrators,
on punishment and what we call symbolic justice,

710
00:43:35.131 --> 00:43:38.940
which focuses more on victims and survivors.
And this more future looking,

711
00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:44.330
both are important and both kind of must be there in a post conflict society for

712
00:43:44.641 --> 00:43:48.590
transitional justice to do with job in Rwanda.
We have,
um,

713
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.490
three main cases that I'll mention.

714
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.780
One is the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,

715
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.920
the ICTR,

716
00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:01.220
which was established by the United Nations Security Council in 1940 in 1995.

717
00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:06.770
And this basically was a implemented kind of like the International Criminal

718
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:11.790
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and in the legacy and tradition of Nuremberg

719
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.230
tribunals,
ah,
after World War II to try the perpetrators,

720
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.800
but not only the perpetrators,
but the big fish,

721
00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:21.630
the ones who were the organizers,

722
00:44:21.631 --> 00:44:26.631
the masterminds who were instrumental and planning and carrying out the,

723
00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:30.720
uh,
1994 genocide in Rwanda.
And so the ICTR,

724
00:44:30.721 --> 00:44:35.190
I was an operation for 20 years.
It closed in 2015.
Um,

725
00:44:35.191 --> 00:44:39.900
I do have statistics on how many people they tried,
but it wasn't too,

726
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:40.910
too many.
Um,

727
00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:43.710
and it was also very difficult because it operates with the bureaucracy of a

728
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:46.710
tribunal,
right?
So you have trials,
you have appeals,

729
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:51.270
you have a whole mechanism dedicated.
Uh,
the court was also in Urrutia,
Tanzania.

730
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.980
It was not in Rwanda,
so there was outreach,
uh,

731
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:56.670
about the happenings of the court in Urrutia.

732
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:01.440
There was outreach into Rwanda.
Um,
but you know,

733
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:06.540
reviews are pretty mixed,
so it goes for the big fish and a closed in 2015.

734
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:07.390
Um,

735
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:10.560
and there were some very well known trials that came out of there including the

736
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:15.180
[inaudible] case,
which,
uh,
proved that genocide is a form,
I'm sorry,

737
00:45:15.181 --> 00:45:19.720
that rape is a form of genocide.
Rape is a systematic form of genocide and uh,

738
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.630
it was the first person convicted of rape during genocide.
Uh,
it's Okayso.
Um,

739
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.760
so in addition to the ICTR,

740
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:31.740
we have a form of local justice called the good chacha tribunals now.
Gotcha.
Um,

741
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.750
we're typically,
um,

742
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.040
tribunals employed in Rwanda for land disputes where people would come together

743
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:42.450
and kind of elders are trusted members of society would decide what would happen

744
00:45:42.451 --> 00:45:46.590
in a dispute.
And in 2002,
I think,

745
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.760
or 2005,

746
00:45:47.761 --> 00:45:52.761
this was readopted in Rwanda where there was a local selection of judges and

747
00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:55.830
local individuals would come together kind of in their communities,

748
00:45:55.831 --> 00:45:58.230
literally on the grass.
Um,

749
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:03.450
perpetrators would confess what they had done and survivors would kind of

750
00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:06.540
forgive them or would then have more knowledge.

751
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:09.900
Maybe a lot of one thing came out of Gattaca was where the people were buried,

752
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.310
which was a huge deal.

753
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:16.410
And so these cutoffs of courts were kind of localized forms of justice.
Um,

754
00:46:16.411 --> 00:46:19.920
they also have their critiques in which,
uh,
the judges were not trained judges,

755
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:23.130
there were no lawyers or representation,
so the questions of due process,

756
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:25.340
but basically the purpose was,
um,

757
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.620
that the ICTR and the national courts couldn't try the large number of

758
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:29.454
perpetrators.

759
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.730
The prisons were overflowing and there had to be some practical form of

760
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:33.990
transitional justice.

761
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.950
And so the cutoff courts were formed in order to kind of try the lower level

762
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:42.780
perpetrators.
People involved in a property theft,
people involved in assisted,

763
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.710
uh,
Kelly,
good murder,
things like that.
So those were the good chacha courts,

764
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:50.850
which clothes and stuff.
And 12.
And then we have this third section,

765
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:52.320
which is the symbolic justice,

766
00:46:52.321 --> 00:46:55.890
which are kind of more what I discuss and absolutely more what I study,

767
00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.210
which are,
um,
memorialization ans commemorations,

768
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:04.350
creation of memorial sites,
burial,
um,

769
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:09.660
creation of families,
artificial families in the aftermath of the genocide.

770
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.510
Um,
official apologies,
security.

771
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:15.120
These are all the things I would put under symbolic justice.

772
00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:18.780
So that's kind of the range that transitional justice take specifically in

773
00:47:18.781 --> 00:47:20.940
Rwanda.
Hey,
uh,

774
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:25.230
how do you think our understanding of post conflict societies and recovery

775
00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:29.830
affects how we look at ongoing conflict?
It's a great question.

776
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.521
Thank you so much.

777
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:34.450
So I think it's interesting because I was actually speaking with my father

778
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:39.250
yesterday who's here and,
um,
he said,
haven't we learned anything?
Right.

779
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.670
Um,
and I think a lot of people ask that,
right?
Haven't we learned anything?

780
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:47.560
The 20th century is a known as the age of genocide,
of the age of conflict.

781
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:48.310
You know,
uh,

782
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:53.310
how about we learned anything in how we have seen and viewed post conflict

783
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:57.310
societies and the challenges they have.
Don't we want to prevent that?

784
00:47:57.311 --> 00:47:58.270
And of course we do.

785
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:03.610
I think the difficulty though is that there are so many factors at play that

786
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:07.300
when a new conflict arises,
what worked or didn't work,
for example,

787
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:12.301
in Rwanda in 1994 in terms of intervention may or may not work in Syria today.

788
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.990
It may or may not backfire.

789
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:18.991
And that's why those local a specialized analysts are just as important as the

790
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:23.230
ones working at the broad level.
I think the what,
um,

791
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.970
what's particularly important is fact finding and postconflict is when we're

792
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.610
able to win,
the conflict kind of subsided.
Now of course,

793
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:33.070
conflict doesn't end when the fighting ends,
right?

794
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.430
There's elements of protracted conflict that continue long,

795
00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:40.610
long after a ceasefire agreement is,
is a signed or,
or,

796
00:48:40.611 --> 00:48:42.190
or fighting physically ends.

797
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.790
And so I think looking at the complexities and also the fact finding,

798
00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:49.330
understanding what really happened,
what were the patterns of violence,

799
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.560
what were some of the triggers and analyzing these things,

800
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:56.980
analyzing propaganda,
dehumanization,
tactics,
um,

801
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:02.000
group think and group mentality,
um,
masculinities and,

802
00:49:02.001 --> 00:49:06.100
and a initiation into masculine masculinizing groups,
economic problems,

803
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:10.120
all of these factors at play help us get a really good understanding in

804
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:11.230
hindsight of what happened.

805
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:15.280
Postconflict how do we now apply them to what's going on

806
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.430
in,
you know,
active conflict.
And I think that's $1 million question.

807
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:22.810
So I don't have a great answer for you,

808
00:49:22.811 --> 00:49:27.070
but I do think that understanding the patterns and accurately understanding

809
00:49:27.071 --> 00:49:32.020
what's happening in current conflicts is really important and doing more

810
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:36.070
documentation as the conflicts going on.
One very quick example is Burundi.

811
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:40.790
So we have an ongoing conflict in Burundi,
the country next to Rwanda and um,

812
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.990
some analysts,
analysts from State Department and elsewhere.

813
00:49:43.991 --> 00:49:47.320
Basically trying to figure out what's happening on the ground now and to

814
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:52.321
correctly identify what kind of violences is and what factors are happening so

815
00:49:52.601 --> 00:49:56.830
that when they are deciding how to intervene,
which has been taking a long time,

816
00:49:56.831 --> 00:50:01.831
but I'm hoping will happen soon when UN and other western states at other

817
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:05.080
African states and Aau are deciding what to do,

818
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:08.980
if they correctly more or less identify the elements of the problem,

819
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:12.370
they can create better solutions.
And so that's where I'm hoping we're going,

820
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:16.330
which is being able to kind of disaggregate and then bring it,
build it back,

821
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.970
you know,
does aggregate into themes and build it back up to prevent.

822
00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:22.540
But unfortunately what works in one place might not work in another place.

823
00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:25.450
And we've seen that a lot.
So I'm not trying to be pessimistic,

824
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:27.560
I'm just trying to say that,

825
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:28.390
<v 4>okay,</v>

826
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:31.330
<v 3>it's a lot of work and we have to do it well.</v>

827
00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:33.391
<v 5>Oh,</v>

828
00:50:33.391 --> 00:50:38.391
why did I create a presentation as a in north London who went deep in the

829
00:50:42.451 --> 00:50:45.600
subject?
Not only you read the books,

830
00:50:45.601 --> 00:50:48.940
like any other person could read the book,
but,
uh,

831
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.000
you made an impact.

832
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.890
And do we make an impact because you have met those,

833
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.120
like Shawna's,
um,

834
00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.610
who is victimized during the genocide.

835
00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:04.893
<v 4>MMM.</v>

836
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.490
<v 5>In your experience,</v>

837
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:12.360
it's really sad to get to the point of justice.
As you,

838
00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.570
you have explained transitional,
you know,
any orders,

839
00:51:17.571 --> 00:51:18.230
phases,

840
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:23.230
three phases of it or what do you think of bringing justice?

841
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:26.570
When we hear the whole wall,

842
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:31.630
he had people who denied the existence of this genocide the most,

843
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:38.440
let's say the [inaudible] the United States and there's a way in Europe,
um,

844
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:43.450
some of the perpetrators have fled the country and that all over the world.

845
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.841
And uh,

846
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:49.841
they have come about this denial that the genocide has not taken the place.

847
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.680
Others as we come to say,
uh,

848
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.840
well we accepted that,

849
00:51:56.841 --> 00:52:01.700
that the genocide had taken place,
but there was a double genocide.

850
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.510
Um,
another group will come and say,
well,

851
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:10.460
this is the group of the denials of genocide,
yet they're not,

852
00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:16.280
is one dance in that two group of Rwandan perpetrators and the have not been

853
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.360
even the country.

854
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.900
They go ahead and if I could use the word preach here and there about that kind

855
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:25.070
of denial,

856
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.090
<v 4>uh,
how,</v>

857
00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:29.431
<v 5>oh,</v>

858
00:52:29.431 --> 00:52:34.431
what do you bring that into being or bringing a sort of justice to these kind of

859
00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:40.650
stories around the denial of justice.
Thank you.

860
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.270
<v 3>Thank you professor buying Ghana.</v>

861
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:46.020
A professor buying Anna brings up a really great point,
which is,
um,

862
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.760
what forms is denial take and what do we do about it?
Um,

863
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.200
denial is a problem and it's not a new one.
We've seen it with Armenia.

864
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:57.460
We've seen it after the Holocaust.
After almost every major conflict,

865
00:52:57.461 --> 00:53:00.100
we have people who,
uh,
for some reason,

866
00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:05.040
whether it's political or personal cannot handle the truth of what happened.
Um,

867
00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.960
and try to kind of give another,
another example.

868
00:53:07.961 --> 00:53:12.430
So one way this happens is by completely denying one way is by manipulating the

869
00:53:12.431 --> 00:53:17.320
facts and saying it was not a genocide.
It was a civil war or um,

870
00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:19.960
yes,
Tutsi were killed in 1994,

871
00:53:19.961 --> 00:53:24.550
but also there were crimes against who to in 1995,
96,
97.

872
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:29.700
Um,
and that,
um,
is that,

873
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:32.730
that concept of double genocide,
that it was not only Tutsi who were killed,

874
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:36.150
but after that who too were killed as they were exiting the country and were

875
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:40.860
targeted.
Um,
that's the theory of double genocide.
And to that,

876
00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:44.280
I would say two things about,
about dealing with deniers.

877
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.100
One way we can deal with deniers is to ignore them,

878
00:53:47.101 --> 00:53:49.630
is not to give them a platform to speak,
um,

879
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:54.150
because when deniers are interviewed on television or they have a chance to,

880
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.740
uh,
right.
You know,

881
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:59.160
in media and of course there's free speech and in these countries you mentioned

882
00:53:59.161 --> 00:54:02.700
people can publish anywhere they want,
but if they're known denialist,

883
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.620
if they're causing harm to people,
um,
there are ways to choose someone else.

884
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.690
Someone who maybe has a more balanced perspective.

885
00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:13.800
And it's not considered a now outright denialist.
When,
uh,
when,
uh,

886
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.520
when any news outlet interviews people,
um,

887
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:22.230
one survivor told me that denial feels like the genocide is happening over again

888
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.070
because basically you're,
their family was killed during the genocide.

889
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.930
And then when someone denies it,
they deny your right of acknowledgement.

890
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.730
They deny your right to grieve,

891
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.460
they deny your right to feel how you want to feel.

892
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.690
They deny what happened to you and they're harming your ability to move forward

893
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:41.040
because you cannot be recognized.

894
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:45.270
And we see this kind of in limbo situation in Armenia where people are very hurt

895
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:49.170
because I'm their situation and their reality is not being recognized.

896
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:53.250
And so I think,
um,
but besides kind of this,

897
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:56.490
this ignoring and not engaging because denialists will keep,
as you said,

898
00:54:56.491 --> 00:55:00.090
preaching regardless of what factual evidence comes.

899
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.850
I think the second point is,
um,

900
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.820
is this categorization that's really helpful.

901
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.180
I think the legal crime category is genocide,
war crimes,

902
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:14.181
crimes against humanity and all that has been put into developing these very,

903
00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:18.750
um,
thorough categories is helpful.

904
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.630
So when the UN deemed that Rwanda was a genocide,
um,

905
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:26.430
there are facts and evidence in terms of fact finding missions in terms of

906
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:31.080
intent,
intent to destroy a group in whole or in part intent to destroy the two t

907
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:35.820
people.
Um,
these were present and proven in the case of Rwanda.

908
00:55:35.821 --> 00:55:40.350
And so it is a genocide according to international legal order,

909
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:43.590
if that's what you respect.
And most people,
I think most countries do.

910
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.210
And so sticking to those definitions and the facts is where you can't go wrong.

911
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:48.781
You know,

912
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:53.370
at a certain point if you start getting into the emotion and trying to convince

913
00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:54.930
people that can get very messy,

914
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.950
but the facts of the matter are the ones that stick there and the ones that are

915
00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:01.770
grounded in international law,
international theory,

916
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.710
that's where I think we can really keep continuing with,
uh,

917
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.950
helping to fight denial.
But denial is very harmful for,
for everyone.

918
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:15.750
And it's a big,
big issue in Rwanda right now.
So thank you so much.
Well,

919
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.680
thank you everyone.
