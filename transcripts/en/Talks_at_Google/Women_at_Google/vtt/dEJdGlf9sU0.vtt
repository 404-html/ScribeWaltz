1
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.600
All right guys.
Well,

2
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:10.050
thank you so much to coming to this talk at Google where we have the amazing

3
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:15.051
Hannah heart with us today who we know is everything from my drunk kitchen to

4
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:19.830
your hashtag no filter,
live series and countless other things.
Um,

5
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:24.660
I myself am an image irritative business partner at our alphabet company.
Verily,

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050
uh,
my name is Brenna and it's so exciting to be here today.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.220
Thanks for having me Brenna.
Ah,
the crowd goes wild.

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.150
It's not that way to send a Friday at Google,
right?
No,
I mean,

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.040
I mean for all of us,
we've got the weekend ahead of us.

10
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.300
So those true feeling good.
I mean,
weekend we weekend,

11
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.830
it's when we take off work for like 20 minutes and then we start up again.
Oh,

12
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.950
okay.
Someone's got to run the cadet.

13
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.300
He's the one downside of like living with your boss in your head because there's

14
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.170
no,
like,
there's no passage of time.
You're always at work.
I mean,

15
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:56.250
you gotta make your own clock.

16
00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.630
Is that just like the hardest thing in the entire world?
Yes.
It's very hard.

17
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:01.740
I have a big God,

18
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.830
I have a team that helps me structure myself because structure is not something

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.650
I was born with.
An innate ability to do.
Oh my goodness.

20
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.080
And when you get into that in your book,
and I have to say,

21
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.720
I'm definitely gonna dive into doc cause there were some points in your book

22
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:16.730
where I was like,
I need some life advice and she's going to give it to me.
Um,

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.110
but I want to just get to where we are here today.

24
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:23.250
Here we are talking about your memoir and it's so vastly different than your

25
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:27.030
last book.
We had my drunk kitchen.
How did we get from that to buffering?

26
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
Well I would say that,
um,
with my drunk kitchen,
the cookbook,
uh,

27
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.490
it was really just like,
um,
the way I think of my dream kitchen,

28
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.140
cause I actually get asked a lot like,
oh,

29
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.150
are you always going to do my drunk kitchen?

30
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.250
Are you ever gonna stop making youtube videos?

31
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.280
And I always feel like that's like asking someone if they're ever going to stop

32
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.700
like tweeting or something.
It's like,
why?
Why would I like,

33
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.220
it's I love social media.
I love to share my experience.

34
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.370
I love to take snapchat pictures.
I love to post stuff on Instagram.

35
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:57.960
Like I love to make content.
Yeah.
It's,
it's a joy for me.
Um,

36
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.630
and so with my drunk kitchen,
the first book,

37
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.430
it was kind of like paying tribute to the reason that I got into where I was,

38
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.791
you know?

39
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:09.660
And also it was just a lot of fun to make and fill with awesome pictures and all

40
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.840
totally unique.
At the time of making the cookbook,
I was super proud of this.

41
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.910
They were all completely unique recipes.

42
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.690
Like I wanted to come up with new recipes instead of just regurgitating the

43
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:23.250
recipes from the series.
That was very important to me.
But yeah,

44
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:26.220
so my drunk kitchen will always be like near and dear to my heart.

45
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:29.310
I like to think of it as the phrase dance with the one that brought you.

46
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.610
It's like my drunk kitchen brought me to this wonderful ball and I'm going to

47
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.670
have a great time and dance.
A lot of dances with a lot of different people.

48
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.370
But my dream kitchen brought me.
So yeah,
going home with them.

49
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.630
I love that.
But and so you're,

50
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.370
you're buffering is a lot of your journals through the passage of time here and

51
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:50.160
as you're reading it,
you're going through so many different writing styles,

52
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:55.161
whether that's a poem to your first college lover or pros about your childhood

53
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.240
or your short story about you and your sister.

54
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.810
How were you able to bring all of that together into this cohesive memoir?
Wow.

55
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.400
That is a great question.

56
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.780
And also thank you for bringing that up and I really appreciate you reading the

57
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.340
book and like,
fantastic guys.
Read it.
A task book.
Okay,
good.
Okay,
good.

58
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:16.120
We got a good review.
Um,
we connected on a lot of levels.
You don't know this yet,

59
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:21.100
but,
um,
I think that what I really liked,
uh,

60
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.710
in writing the book is that,
you know,

61
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.620
the process of it was really different from how I thought writing a book would

62
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:31.330
be.
It was like,
it was like to allow myself to,

63
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.770
okay,
so let me get something.
You have to start from here.
Being authors,

64
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.030
not my full time job.
Right.

65
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.740
So like I have a day job of like my entire other career,
um,
going to,
uh,

66
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:46.150
Australia for the no filter tour.
Um,
she filming a movie called Dirty 30,

67
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.550
promoting that movie,
selling a TV show on food network,

68
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.080
making two videos a week and maintaining all the systems that run,
you know,

69
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.930
outside of the things that you immediately see about running the brand.

70
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.520
So we're writing though it is like my most near and dear most intimate form.

71
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.480
And the thing I love the most is really hard to carve out time for because when

72
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:05.440
you write,
it's not like,

73
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.860
oh I'm gonna write for four hours and I can guarantee the amount of work that I

74
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:13.150
will have done,
you know,
so I let myself just kind of do whatever I wanted.

75
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.520
Um,
and then with my,

76
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.780
with the help of my fantastic editor structure in a way where we found the

77
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.010
circle,
you know,

78
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.760
cause it was really important and this is something that having an editor was so

79
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.790
crucial for it because I'm too close to the experiences cause I'm trying to

80
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.430
write them as like detailed and like really pull you in.

81
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.370
So it's really hard to get a bullseye bird's eye view,

82
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.690
a bull's eye birds eye of the order that they should go in.
Yeah.

83
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.910
To come to a full loop.

84
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.570
The whole first pass of the book is actually in a different order because I,

85
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:47.890
to the delight of everyone who works with me suddenly realize things and then

86
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:51.010
need to restructure.
And so the restructuring of the book,

87
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.670
the chapter about Naomi was way early.
That's my oldest sister wait earlier on.

88
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.240
And I restructured the beginning journey and the end journey and I really,

89
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.190
really liked the way it turned out.
That's so funny.

90
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.890
I took note of that when I was reading it and got to the last chapter.

91
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:07.120
I was like,
I'm super curious.
And so there's a lot of thought there.
Yeah,

92
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.770
that's awesome.
It's great book guys.
Go Out,
read it,

93
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:13.660
buy it.
And I have to say,

94
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:17.050
so the title alone when you're talking about buffering and um,

95
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.400
for those we'll have the chance to read it.

96
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.150
It's processing and boundaries coming together and that is what buffering is.

97
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.650
When did you like come up with this Aha moment?
That was,

98
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.630
it seems so profound.
It's like,
oh,
thank you.
Well there were 90,

99
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.800
you know,
at around page 95,
um,

100
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.690
of writing of just like word,
gut writing.

101
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.370
I realized that what I was missing,

102
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.750
I was telling stories,
but I wasn't telling my story.

103
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.870
Like I was telling stories from my life,
but I wasn't telling my story.

104
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.980
So I thought,
okay,
how can I get back in?
And so I use,
so that's when,

105
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.950
probably around October I turned to the journals and I was like,
oh my,

106
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.660
like this is a brilliant structure.
This is about,

107
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.680
this is how I processed everything.
Oh my God.
Processing like buffering.

108
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.750
Oh my God.
That should be the name of the book.

109
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.930
Like it was kind of one of those like thought processes where you're like,

110
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.530
this is exactly the perfect name because I wanted to merge the digital and like

111
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:16.970
the tangible and I want it to say these are the unshared stories I've shown you

112
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.170
what I've been comfortable showing you.

113
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:21.710
But these are the things that take more than 140 characters take more than a

114
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:26.240
four to six minute blog,
um,
to talk about.
And so that's,

115
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.300
that's how I came to the title buffering because it's that that wheel is that

116
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:33.500
boundary that allows you to fully process the data of your life before it's

117
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:36.260
something you're ready to show.
I really love that.

118
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.970
And I mean just talking about that,

119
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.880
going from a four to six minute flog or from a tweet,

120
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.320
your book is really intimate and it has a lot of secrets of your past and your

121
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:50.120
present.
How did it feel to just bear that all to your readers?
Ah,

122
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.150
well I think that the last week of my life has been so intense because you know,

123
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:59.240
when I've always used writing as an outlet.

124
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.320
So writing it out has always been really familiar,
you know,
because like I said,

125
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.700
always journaled.
Um,
I studied literature in college,
so I was really good.

126
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:12.701
Analytical writers are turning that analytical mind just inward and using it to,

127
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.290
to,
to,
to realize what the crux of everything was.
And also just frankly,

128
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:21.800
the time in my life,
I've had away from a lot of the issues that are in the book.

129
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.933
Um,

130
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.690
but putting that all together and sharing it as been the most intensely

131
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:33.920
vulnerable experience of my life.
Like it,
we did a whole week,

132
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:36.980
we did a meet and greet before the book came out or assigning like the first and

133
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:39.200
second day of the book coming out.
Nope.
You know,

134
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:43.250
and the only a handful of people at the signing the day of had ad ready yet and

135
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:45.140
the signing the day before and nobody had even gotten it yet.

136
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.110
And then the second people started reading it,

137
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:52.750
it was like the energy of the signings changed.
I felt like,
you know,

138
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.030
people are like,
I read the book and it's like suddenly like someone being like,

139
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.350
Hey,
like I see you.
Yeah.
And it's the most incredible feeling in the world.

140
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.000
I think that anybody that grows up in a household where you have stuff that you

141
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:08.420
have to hide or whether or not,
you know,
you have to hide it.
You know,

142
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.480
inside you're hiding something and processing it and processing it.

143
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.210
Well that comes later in life.
But yeah,
exactly.
Um,

144
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.110
but you don't really feel as seen by other people,
you know,

145
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:21.140
like growing up you were like,
mom's crazy.
And I'd be like,
yeah,

146
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.930
I have no idea.
You know,
or be like this,

147
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.760
the excitement or it's like,
you know,

148
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.050
the holidays are like really stressing me out.
And I'm like,
yeah,
like,
you know,

149
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.480
it's trying to find,
I love connecting to people and I've,

150
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.490
so much of my life I've felt like I could see I'm trying to get in from this

151
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:44.370
side and buffering makes me feel like I,

152
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.740
I am or I'm seeing people that I didn't know we're hiding stuff too.
Absolutely.

153
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.610
Really that shared human experience and like you can feel it when you're reading

154
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:53.690
it.
It's just kind of like,

155
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.590
whether you're talking about coming out and getting responses from your,

156
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.450
your youtube family.

157
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.710
And it really seems like you've gotten an outpouring of just like support and

158
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.180
just like a lot of emotions,
a lot of emotions literally last night,
you know,

159
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:10.860
because it's like,
I like,

160
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.820
it's so intense to have people comfortable sharing things with you.

161
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.820
And I see a lot of it online and it's,
you know,
there's that distance,

162
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:18.541
there's that separation.

163
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:20.460
When you're reading something over text or reading a comment,

164
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.630
you're reading someone writing a blog post and tagging you.
It's,

165
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.730
there's a separation there.

166
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.240
But when you're in assigning line and you know that they know,

167
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.630
they know what you wrote in that book,
Nana,
um,

168
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.070
but people take that like 20 seconds and they tell you something incredibly

169
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:36.510
intimate about your life,
their life,

170
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.160
and then they thank you for helping them with that.
And it's such an honor.

171
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.260
It's just so,
it's like,
wow,
thank you.
I am so glad.

172
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.880
You know what I mean?
And all I did was just like,
really try and work on myself.

173
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.590
Selfishly,
I was here for me.
Yeah.

174
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.670
Or just like really just wanted to share and like it's the most incredible

175
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:59.430
connection last night.
I think it just kind of all hit me cause it was,

176
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:03.240
it had been one week or just about a little over a week and it just all hit me

177
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:07.850
and I just was like,
I was like crying but not like sad crying,
but just like,

178
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.720
like humans are so precious cross.

179
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.140
Like I said that I was like people,
wow.

180
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.190
It's an incredible feeling to be able to look at people and see everyone is

181
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:24.180
special.
Absolutely.
There were our most important resource.
We are.

182
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.900
Um,

183
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.620
and so it seems to be kind of just this trend in your life where it's sharing.

184
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:34.260
It's giving.
Um,
for those who don't know,
um,

185
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.300
my drunk kitchen came out of a love and a desire to help your friend Hannah Gal.

186
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:40.890
I'm just kind of heal,
um,
from across the country,

187
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:45.420
from New York to the bay back to the bay.
And so all of this,

188
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:49.830
all of that giving has reaped such success.
What are you hoping to see with this?

189
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:52.830
I mean,
you're shedding all of yourself.
I mean it's,

190
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.440
we're 10 x in here and the words of Google,
we are taxing.

191
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.750
I don't know what that means.
Doing it 10 times bigger.
Yeah.
Okay.
There you go.

192
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:05.610
I am Tedx thing.
I guess it's like,
I don't know.
Um,
I feel like,

193
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.210
you know,

194
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:11.210
my drunk kitchen created heart doe and buffering is allowing Hannah Hart to step

195
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.570
into the forefront.
And it's interesting because it's like,

196
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.970
I know what heart doe stands for,
right?

197
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:21.210
It's the idea to like practice reckless optimism,
which is,
you know,

198
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.060
I'm taking away all the naivety of optimism.

199
00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:26.280
It's that you can be fully aware of your circumstances,

200
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:30.240
fully aware of the odds that are with her against you and you're choosing to be

201
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:34.230
positive about it.
You're like 70,
30,
huh.
Wow,
that's really hope.

202
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.620
Let's really hope it works out.
Let's do it.
We got 30%.
So yeah,
we've got 9%.

203
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:41.430
Exactly.
It's like,
that's reckless optimism.
I know.
Um,

204
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.810
and so now as like Hannah Hart,
it just kinda feels like,

205
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.710
like I don't know what's coming next,
but I'm really happy to be right here.

206
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.280
And so as long as I stay happy in the present or as long as I continue to pursue

207
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:59.040
like contentment in the present,
I'm voting things work out.

208
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.910
I mean that's all we can hope for the future though.
Right?

209
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.440
Really it doesn't exist.
I let,
let's say,
it doesn't live right now.
Yeah,

210
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.180
just painful.
Painfully existential.
It's true.
Well,
and in that,

211
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.000
in that same vein,
when you have harder,
when you have Hannah Hart,

212
00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:19.230
do you think buffering was an opportunity to bring those two together?
Where you,

213
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.260
and I mean you've had so many life events that have happened recently,

214
00:12:22.261 --> 00:12:24.370
whether it's you're coming out,
whether it's,
um,

215
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.330
really helping to save your mother.
Um,

216
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.570
do you feel that those two worlds are colliding to get now or are they still

217
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.700
separate in,
in,
in nature?
Wow,
that is a great question.

218
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.470
It feels like,

219
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.460
it feels like your childhood friend and your childhood best friend and your

220
00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:47.070
college best friend or your colleague,

221
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.580
coworker best friend or like getting married.
You know what I mean?

222
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.460
And they're like the,
yeah,
it's like that because it's like,

223
00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:56.940
it's definitely like a partnership is forming between those two sides.

224
00:12:56.941 --> 00:13:00.420
If yourself are two different ways of knowing yourself,
you know,

225
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.750
it's when I meet people,
people like I feel like I know you,
you know,

226
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.250
and I'm like,
you do,
you know,

227
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:08.850
the last five years of my life and buffering is everything that happened before

228
00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:11.340
that and everything that happened behind that.
Absolutely.

229
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.100
And so I don't know what this means,
like strategically,

230
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.990
but I do know that I feel,

231
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.410
I feel more like a balanced version might love myself and less like a

232
00:13:22.351 --> 00:13:26.190
hyperbolized version of myself.
That being said,
I'm still gonna get drunk,

233
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.090
make a bunch of jokes.
I mean,
if you stopped,

234
00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:32.270
I think everyone in this room would be very terrified.
Terrified.

235
00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:35.000
I feel like what?
I mean,
there's nights where I tried to do the same thing.

236
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.860
I'm just not nearly as good of a chef.
I go back to that first episode right?

237
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.520
Where it's like,
I forgot I didn't have cheese.
Practice makes perfect.
It's weird.

238
00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:46.730
Like,
I know so much more about cooking now and I've sold a show to food network.

239
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.170
I get to talk about food on it,

240
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.070
but I'm not gonna say anything more because I can't yeah,
shh.
Confidential.

241
00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:56.190
Proprietary information.
Exactly.
Um,
but yeah,
no,
it's uh,

242
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.600
it's amazing what you don't realize you're learning because you're in the middle

243
00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:02.840
of learning it.
That is amazing.
And I mean,
through your book,

244
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:05.890
you talk about kind of this,
this journey to find this balance.
Um,

245
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:09.200
and we have a room,
a company full of overachievers.

246
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.130
What has helped you the most really kind of find that work life,

247
00:14:13.131 --> 00:14:17.590
personal balance,
personal.
No kidding.
Um,
uh,

248
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.080
well therapy obviously is really big.
Finding the right medication is really,

249
00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:24.290
really big.
I use headspace all the time.
It's great meditation APP.

250
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.870
I have that APP as well.
Cause worse,
you should get it.

251
00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:30.680
It's like headspace is really,
really great.
Totally.
Like,
you know,
not from a,

252
00:14:30.681 --> 00:14:33.410
if you,
if you don't have a big spiritual or like you think religion is blah,

253
00:14:33.411 --> 00:14:37.460
blah,
blah.
Headspace is the most like secular,
just like,
here you go.

254
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.220
This is the facts kind of APP for meditation.
Um,

255
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.350
but how do you find that balance?
It fills something I'm really working on.

256
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.100
It's kind of like going to the gym.
It's like sometimes you're like,
man,

257
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.930
I went to the gym three times a week,
month and I felt great and it was great.

258
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:56.990
It's like self care isn't something that ever stops.

259
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.280
And that's really frustrating because it's like you dip,
you're like,
oh man.

260
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.020
Like why do I like,
why do I feel so overwhelmed over here?
Like so sad over here,

261
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.790
you know?
And that's what's going to happen.

262
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:11.390
I think that balance is knowing that there are peaks and valleys and just trying

263
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:14.600
to lesson like the peaks and valleys between them.

264
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.630
Maybe take away the extremeness a little bit.
Yeah.
Eh,

265
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.150
well,
and it seems as though in,
in the past two years,
you've had a lot of,
uh,
uh,

266
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.560
come to truth moments,
uh,
when you're coming out and doing that.

267
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:32.840
So vocally I'm on the Internet.

268
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.200
How has that kind of being an out and proud Lgbtq plus plus plus individual like

269
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.680
help define your,
your next steps are or what's that like how was that for you?

270
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.550
Um,
it was a huge confidence builder.
I mean like it was amazing for me.

271
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.460
Like that's the thing too is that like people like I feel like everybody's like

272
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:52.520
thank you so much.
And I'm like,
no seriously guys,
I'm living my dreams.

273
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.480
I am so happy and I'm so blessed and I'm so lucky to be in the position I'm in.

274
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.070
You know when I did the coming out process was it was long and involved as it is

275
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.610
for many who have to come out about something.
And I also feel,
by the way,

276
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.950
this is just like something I want to say is that there are different things.

277
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:13.670
You can come out with yourself.
It doesn't have to just be your sexuality.

278
00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:15.200
You can come out and be like,
you know what?

279
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.530
I think I might actually have depression.
I'm like,
you can come out and be like,

280
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:21.080
you know what?
I don't really know if this is the career path I want.

281
00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:25.010
Like there's different moments of self realization that you have to have with

282
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:29.690
yourself.
Absolutely.
Um,
literally cause it's self realization but the,

283
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.120
with the coming out series,
you know,
I had my first,

284
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:34.100
I fell in love for the first time I was 19.

285
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.610
I took me like a year and a half to really accept that it wasn't a girl.

286
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:42.140
It was girls.
Uh,
um,
because that meant accepting my own heartbreak.

287
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.710
I would just go off,
I go into a lot and a great chapter called shadow boxer.

288
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.280
Really good title for that chapter.
Um,

289
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.990
and she mentioned that it's a self shadowboxing.
Yeah,
exactly.
Shut.
See,

290
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.550
beautiful analogy here.
It's

291
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.500
really good cause I onwards I loved it so happy so many times cause shadowboxing

292
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.390
is one word.
So many times I just headed back to the copy editor and be like,

293
00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:10.130
it's one more know,
just put it one word.
Um,
so anyway,
the,

294
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.150
so from there it was like coming out to your friends and your immediate circle

295
00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:16.880
of support,
like the people that you know will love you.

296
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.230
And then your extended family,
forget them.
Just kidding.

297
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.110
Um,
then,
and then choose your family.
So,

298
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.830
and then it was moving to New York because when I moved to New York,
I,

299
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:32.870
so I lived in San Francisco right after college.

300
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:36.250
I went to college at cal go bears.
Um,
and then I moved to,
yeah.

301
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.710
And then I moved to New York and when I got there,
you know,

302
00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:42.710
this is the first time I'd ever left the bay area in my life.
When I got there,

303
00:17:42.711 --> 00:17:44.990
they were like,
oh my God,
so do you have a boyfriend or what?
And I was like,

304
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.360
I was like,
no.
Also I'm gay.
Like,
you know,

305
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.430
and what do you New York,
think about that.

306
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.820
What do you person I've never met before and like I'm here on the east coast.

307
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:59.610
What's it like?
I grew up in the bay area,
you know,

308
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:03.690
which is like a very different temperature on a lot of issues.
Um,

309
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.510
and so it was coming out every day and those,
those moments.

310
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.110
But to answer your question,
which is a good one,

311
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.190
I feel so honored and privileged to be an Lgbtq.

312
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.280
I a plus plus plus plus role model and I feel a great responsibility to educate

313
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:24.450
myself and to open my heart and opened my mind to issues that don't only include

314
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.400
my direct experience.
Absolutely.
That's the edit,
edit all that other stuff out.

315
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.460
And I do think,
um,
your experience being a memoirs is so key here and talking,

316
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:36.810
I'm coming out about different things.

317
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.140
One of the things that I find so fascinating and kind of the Zeitgeists of

318
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:43.950
what's going on right now is more and more public figures like yourself who

319
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.120
outsiders see is so gregarious and you're funny all the time and you're always

320
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:49.330
on in,

321
00:18:49.331 --> 00:18:53.400
in this book you really touch on like this very seriousness,

322
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.870
like openly admitting I'm an introvert and Amy Schumer's recently done the same

323
00:18:57.871 --> 00:18:58.920
thing in her memoir.

324
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.090
What is it about this kind of like what seems like a dichotomy to your,

325
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:04.890
to your viewers and everything?
Well,
you know,

326
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:08.640
I'm a big believer in like the Myers Briggs assessment over the introvert

327
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.870
extrovert and assessment because like if I'm an extrovert,

328
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:15.030
then I'm an extrovert that spends a lot of time in their head.

329
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.330
If I'm an introvert,
I'm an introvert that loves the company of others.

330
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.450
You know what I mean?
Because it's,
it's more balanced than that.
So it's,

331
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:25.920
it's tough.
Um,
I guess,
you know,
for like,

332
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.010
you know,
if we judge it by on what recharges your batteries,

333
00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:33.090
like I definitely need time alone to myself.
Yeah.
I really need,

334
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.140
and that's part of my self care.
I need to take walks,
I have to journal.

335
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.270
Like if I'm feeling like overwhelmed,

336
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:42.510
I really need to write it out and I know that I need to just spend time

337
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:45.660
centering.
Um,
I think that for a lot of public figures,

338
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:50.661
you spend so much of your life on export that you have to know what is your

339
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:51.750
version of import.

340
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.680
And there are some of us that work in this industry that their import is being

341
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:59.130
on a stage.
They love applause,
they love live performance.

342
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.770
I know a lot of people who are my friends who are like,

343
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.300
I gotta get back on on the road.

344
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.500
Like they feel stifled by having to spend all their time at home or onsets.

345
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.380
His civilian.
Yeah.
Well,

346
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.270
I want to get on the road like I need to like perform to a crowd.

347
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:16.590
I need to like see people.
Um,
so I think it really just depends on,

348
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.630
it depends on the public figure.
And do you find 'em,

349
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.150
I mean with your Hardo tour or Hello Hardo,
you were doing the habit heart day.

350
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.660
Do you find that that is part of your kind of recharge it,
it's so beautiful.

351
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:31.590
I'm so,
Hannah has this campaign where when she's on tour or she'll be doing or,

352
00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:35.130
and it's continuing on beyond you.
It's continued behind on me.

353
00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:38.940
In 2013 I ran a crowd funding campaign with Indiegogo called hello heart doe and

354
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:43.290
originally I was like 50,000.
It was going to be my goodbye tour for the record,

355
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:44.700
like,
and I go into that more in the book,

356
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.290
but it was going to be my way of being like,
Hey,
you know what?

357
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:50.320
I spent a year in La.
Not sure entertainments for me,

358
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.070
but I want to thank everyone that even gave me the chance to explore this career

359
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:58.600
path.
So I was going to hit 10 cities for $50,000.
And you know,
that's funny too.

360
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:00.910
In the end,
it ended up being 22 cities.

361
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.820
We raised over $200,000 and I,

362
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.710
we went to each of these cities across America and Canada and we'd arrive and we

363
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:12.520
would do a volunteer event at a local food bank shooting episode of Hello Heart

364
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.070
Doe,
the mockumentary travel show,
which is a great,

365
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.280
hilarious show that everyone should watch.

366
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.220
Oh man,
down.
It's okay,
dad.
Love them and leave them.

367
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:29.170
Am I right?
You guys?
Um,
they're called Lavs the uh,

368
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:30.890
and then she would never go to my drunk kitchen.
Yeah.

369
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.800
And in those volunteer days,
we called them,

370
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.380
have a heart days and it was our way of doing the meet and greet in the city.

371
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.140
And what was so amazing is that after hello heart ended,

372
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.890
there were cities that kept volunteering together because it was a wonderful way

373
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:45.790
to meet and make friends.
We have a great,
have a hard day here in San Francisco.

374
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.710
November 8th,
I believe is the next one.

375
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.800
If you're interested in signing up to volunteer.
Oh my God.
Well thought,

376
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.640
Kristen.
Our city captains the best.

377
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.030
We've got like nine countries and 36 cities that are currently active and it's

378
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:01.630
just,
it's,
it's just awesome.
I'm,
I,
it's like,
I'm so proud of it,

379
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.090
but it's not like I'm so proud of it.
I'm like,

380
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.520
it's bigger than we should be proud of it.
I love it.
Okay.
So,
uh,

381
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.440
we are going to break here for a few questions from the audience.

382
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:15.190
If anyone would like to ask a question,
um,
if not,

383
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:19.320
we're going to just close up here so we have anyone from the audience who's

384
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.930
interested.
Next one question.
There's a mic right here on them.

385
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.440
You get shot.
All right.
Um,
I shouldn't talked to

386
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.720
that way.
We can hear you on the interweb.
Yeah,

387
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.080
don't be terrified.
You don't want to forget my question.
Um,

388
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:43.570
my question is how did you find out what recharges you and like what was the

389
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:48.710
best self care?
Was it a lot of trial and error?

390
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.630
Did you like read some awesome books?
Was it three therapy?
That's everything.

391
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.860
That's a great question.
How did I find out what recharged me?
Um,

392
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.780
like what was my best way to recharge?
Huh?
I guess it's like,

393
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.580
how did I find out?
I guess it's just kind of like

394
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.690
partially observation.
Like,
you know,

395
00:23:11.691 --> 00:23:14.780
like when you have people in your life that are like,
that,

396
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.780
that can see you when you can't see you,
you know,

397
00:23:17.781 --> 00:23:22.070
and they like help remind you and you're like,
well,
okay,
like,
okay,

398
00:23:22.071 --> 00:23:24.860
well then maybe I just really need to go take a walk.
Um,

399
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:29.540
I'm trying to think of like how I figured that out.
Oh,
I know how,
this is how

400
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.170
it starts with making your needs matter because your needs are there and so that

401
00:23:36.171 --> 00:23:38.300
voice is always talking.
You're just not listening to it.

402
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.530
So if like we're doing a massive press day and there's going to be 10 outlets

403
00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:46.070
that day and it's back to back to back to back.
I,
if we have a break,

404
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.320
it's like I would hear these needs,
I would just be like,

405
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.910
I really need some fresh air.
Like,

406
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:53.510
I really hope I can take a walk and instead of going shut up,
I would be like,

407
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.460
oh hey guys,
I'm going to take a walk really quick.

408
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:58.400
I'll be gone for like five minutes.
It's,
I think that that's part of it.

409
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.950
You just have to listen to the thing you're already telling yourself.

410
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.020
<v 2>No,
hopefully</v>

411
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:11.150
<v 0>I love it.
So insightful.
It did.
It is,</v>

412
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:15.230
it is.
Well to wrap up,
I mean,
here we are,
we're buffering.

413
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:18.350
What is still buffering?
What's next on the docket for you?

414
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.423
<v 2>Probably</v>

<v 0>like sell probably like,
you know,
everyone,</v>

416
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.020
I think you're always kind of on a journey of buffering.
It just depends.

417
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.520
You just enter into different stages of your life or at least that's what I hope

418
00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:34.570
to do.
You know,

419
00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:39.571
there are certain things that I know have stemmed from certain events in my past

420
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.480
and if I can recognize when that sort of reaction is happening,

421
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.000
I can take care of it.
I can,

422
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.530
I can start to calm it instead of letting it control me.
Um,

423
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:56.110
and so going forward,
you know,
there's the rest of life to live you now.

424
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:58.150
It's not always,
it's not always going to be like this,

425
00:24:58.151 --> 00:25:02.140
so there might not be a future.
Let's live for today,
but we had even for today,

426
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.710
there's only today.
It's only now that that's true.

427
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:09.330
This is the coolest moment I've had.
Oh,
that's awesome.
But yeah,
every,

428
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.020
I guess everything,
you're always kind of processing,

429
00:25:11.021 --> 00:25:15.460
but I'm ready to move into my adulthood and they let my childhood stay in the

430
00:25:15.461 --> 00:25:18.040
past.
Therefore,
yes,
I love it.
Well,

431
00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:21.430

432
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.930
Thank you guys.
