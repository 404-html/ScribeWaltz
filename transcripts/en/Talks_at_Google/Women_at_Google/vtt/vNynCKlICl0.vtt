WEBVTT

1
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.180
Thanks so much.
Thank you rob.
And thank you for having me here today.

2
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:17.120
I'm not quite sure how I'm going to compete with next week's program.
Um,

3
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.220
but having said that,

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.150
I've already spoken at one of the Google event and that was a Zeitgeist a few

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.020
years ago.
Uh,
when I was basically chairing the likes of Stephen Hawking,

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.550
David Attenborough was their Mo Farah was leaving the morning run.
Um,

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.060
so I'm not quite sure how to compete with their mind that I can't really tell

8
00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:36.730
you about the secrets behind quantum physics.

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.420
I'm not sure I'm going to be much use improving your personal best.

10
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.950
Are they 800 meters?
And I've no idea what lies beneath the ocean floor.

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.780
Um,
but instead I'm going to try and tell him the space of half an hour or so,

12
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.320
a little bit about the secrets of the global economy.

13
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:57.130
What are those economic forces,
uh,
that shift around all our fortunes,

14
00:00:57.131 --> 00:01:00.550
what lies beneath and what lies beneath that global power base.

15
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.210
And the way it's changing all of that for the price of a dollar bit of a bug in

16
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:08.450
there for lunch time.
Uh,
but,
uh,
the almost dollar,

17
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.200
the book I've written is about more than that.
In fact,
um,

18
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.940
I was an economist at the start of my career.
I still am.
Um,

19
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.650
but I made the worst economic decision of my career some years ago when I

20
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.160
decided to swap a trading floor for the world of broadcasting.

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.500
Uh,
yeah,
I follow it would mean,
you know,
pretty decent money and better hours.

22
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.610
Neither of those two in case anybody else is thinking of making a similar move.

23
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.830
But the reason I did it above everything else is because I was frustrated at the

24
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:43.000
way the economics was viewed as this,
not just the dismal science,

25
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:47.890
but the distance science that people didn't understand.
It didn't matter to them.

26
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:51.790
It was too complicated.
Why should we try and explain it?
It was worthy,

27
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:56.740
but frankly doll.
Um,
and I'm afraid that image has continued.
So in that sense,

28
00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:00.790
I feel like I've failed.
I feel like entire world's media frankly has felt,

29
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:04.060
because this is what we think about.
Of course,
when we talk about economics,

30
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.320
we think about big players,
big pictures,
big numbers.
Um,

31
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.030
and I'm sure some of you here would have been,
uh,
at Davos in recent years,

32
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:16.360
so you could probably recognize those two photos at the top.

33
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:17.560
There are others there.
The sheer,

34
00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:21.910
and what really struck me as at a time when we're talking about the rise of

35
00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:26.560
populism,
about dissatisfaction amongst people around the globe,

36
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.800
about their lots in life.
What have we got?

37
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:33.820
We've got the world's political leaders and financial leaders running their

38
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:38.821
hands over the issues of inequality and stagnant wages and the rise of the right

39
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.220
all walls sipping their hundred franc glasses of champagne,
determine what,

40
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:48.580
whether or not to have a 50 front,
a Croque Monsieur,
um,

41
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.820
and returned to the thousand francs a night rooms.

42
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.660
None of which is an exaggeration.
It's not a cheap place to be.

43
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.270
It's how I as town in Europe,

44
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.360
it feels a long way from many of the day to day issues that affect people.

45
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.640
But I have a strong feeling,

46
00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:09.280
but those forces shouldn't be viewed in the abstract.
Like that isn't the case.

47
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:13.180
That was big players actually debate and determine our forces.

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.801
The other image,
of course,

49
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.760
we always talk about when we talk about the world's financial systems markets

50
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.090
that I pick thing Wall Street,
the Bulls and the bears,
uh,

51
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.400
trillions of dollars changing hands,
some of the products,
even the people there,

52
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.640
uh,
on the New York Stock Exchange floor don't understand what they're all about.

53
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.200
It's all beyond our understanding.
It's all beyond our control,
isn't it?

54
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.070
That water?
I think because even though that's the big picture,

55
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.760
I think ultimately what we need to talk about is the smallest forces.

56
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.400
And that comes down to frankly the individual dollar.
And it is the dollar.

57
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:48.611
I mean,

58
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.550
because even though we've got all these currencies flying around the globe,

59
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.090
it's the dollar that's king.
You call it what you like in,

60
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.470
call it the dead president.
You can call it a single in call it a green bag.
Um,

61
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.710
but it is the thing as much as I started this,

62
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.640
this is the thing really that is driving all our forces.
Why the dollar?
Well,

63
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:10.030
it is the international currency of trade and we can blame history for about one

64
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.870
more on that in a second.
It's also the security blanket,

65
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.050
but governments and central banks clink to around the world.

66
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:18.640
It's the world's reserve currency.

67
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.020
You have that stored away in case there is a rainy day as well as in case you

68
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.020
need it for trade and things like that.
And again,

69
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.290
there is a reason why they cling to that dollar.
It's seen as being stable.

70
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.880
It's seen as being the globes,
common financial language,
you know,

71
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.470
people will accept it all in the way.

72
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.060
Of course they wouldn't accept a bitcoin just yet.

73
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.200
And because of that image of security and stability,

74
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.430
the dollar is also a common way of holding your deaths as well.
Uh,

75
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.890
loans may between countries loads made a across borders between companies as

76
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.430
well.
So in actual fact,
if you look the American population as well,

77
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.680
5% of the world total maximum,

78
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.020
but the dollar comes up and 40% or transactions around the world,

79
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.440
it's also the currency in which 40% of loans are made as well.

80
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:11.590
So it's punching way above its weight
bit.

81
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.740
Now about the history of the dollar though because,
um,

82
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.570
well that's not the history that although that's a world common language doesn't

83
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.970
matter.
Uh,
and it's really,

84
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.470
it is the common language that is driving everything.
But,
uh,
when you look at it,

85
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.520
it's had a little bit of a checkered past and uh,

86
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.140
let's just talk a bit more about that history then can be a bit of a glimpse

87
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.580
that history of the green greenback from behemoth to the Bronx.
Well,

88
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.880
it all,
uh,
despite the name,
um,

89
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.440
and despite everything we've heard about it isn't actual fact American at all.

90
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.930
There's no more American than I was to start with to be honest.

91
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:48.931
Because what you've got there is originally what was known as a Thaller file,

92
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.910
a coin.
And those were minted in the behemoth as an original wound where,
uh,

93
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.010
you can see that 15,
25 mentored m what was then Bohemia,
now,

94
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.400
what we'd call the Czech Republic and those silver coins.

95
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.010
We used natural fat across Europe for hundreds of years.

96
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.600
And if you look back at popular culture,
they prop up time and time again.

97
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.730
Shakespeare was quite fond of actually talking about dollars and it comes up,

98
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.450
I think it's a second scene in Macbeth,
they talk about $10,000,

99
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.250
which is a little bit odd because that bath for those who like theater setting,

100
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:24.950
the Lemp century,
so dollars weren't even around back then.

101
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:29.951
So a bit of artistic license that then of course we saw the dollar being adopted

102
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.080
as the currency in the u s and again,
we have gentleman over there,
uh,

103
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.970
Alexander Hamilton to thank again,
uh,
storming,
uh,

104
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.800
Broadway and the west end right now.
So there's some kind of connection there.

105
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:46.970
I'm not quite sure between the greenback and a and the stage,
but uh,

106
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.180
we have him to thank and that currency has endured.

107
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.930
So for much we talk about the rise of say the RMB or the euro or even digital

108
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.374
currencies.

109
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.130
The dollar somehow has managed to keep its head high for us all those years and

110
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:05.870
an actual fight.
It's continuing.
Having said that,

111
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.490
there had been various bumps in the road.

112
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.740
This was something that none of us are going to remember.
Of course,

113
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:13.940
this was the great depression when we saw the value of shares dropping by all Mr

114
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:16.910
quarter over the course of four or five days.

115
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.010
And once the investors had finished dumping their shares,
what do they do next?

116
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:23.690
They started dumping their dollars,

117
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.700
exchanging them for gold because they were so concerned about the world's most

118
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:32.870
popular currency as it was back then,
which meant great demand for gold.

119
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.050
The American central bank are very worried about the value of the dollar.

120
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.410
So what does it do to try and prop up that interest?

121
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.820
Keep investors hanging onto them.
It put up interest rates.
It's of course,

122
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:46.550
that's one way of ensuring that people want to buy your currency.

123
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:50.720
They get a better return.
Who pays a price for that?
Well,

124
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.681
this is what happens.

125
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:55.520
You end up with 25% of your working age population out of work.

126
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.300
The people who have got jobs,
uh,

127
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.700
probably are underemployed working part time when they want to work even longer

128
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.280
hours.
So that was the great depression,

129
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.110
GDP output falling by up to a third over that period,

130
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.070
the economy scarred and damaged.
Having said that,

131
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.280
there was actually launched the end of the tunnel for the dollar.

132
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.290
And this is something that we get back to a dollar again and I sort to show you

133
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:24.950
that see flip over a dollar.
Um,
and if you're ever stuck in a,

134
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.420
in an immigration Q at Jfk or fine,
it's a great way to pass the time.
Um,

135
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.670
they go,
there's a symbol on the back there,

136
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.770
which no one quite knows the meaning of it.

137
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.520
And if you look at it that it's 1935 that went on the dollar and many people

138
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.200
looking at it,
that's a masonic symbol,
right?
Uh,

139
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.570
in actual fact when they looked into it,

140
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:46.580
the engravers who put it there weren't masons.

141
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.550
So no one's quite sure what it means,
why it's there.

142
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:52.010
But if you look at it in detail,
there's the,
I've got up there,

143
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.150
God favors are undertaking and at the bottom,
the new world order,

144
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:02.070
and it was on Fdr that that was put on.
Um,
and you know,

145
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.710
straight up,
cause he's psychic.
Nobody quite knows.
But it did actually,

146
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.090
was it quite an accurate predictor of the way things were going to turn out?

147
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:12.900
Because what happened after the Second World War is there was a conference at a

148
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.890
town called Bretton Woods you probably heard of,
which was set up to enable,

149
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.650
there'll be lasting peace,
financial stability around the globe.

150
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.810
What came out of it was in many ways,
the main vector of the Second World War,

151
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.600
and that was the dollar.
It was cemented the,

152
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:32.601
as the international currency of trade and also that currency of last resort,

153
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:38.490
that current c that was being used primarily for the bank's reserves.

154
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.780
It was linked to the value of gold.

155
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.640
It was referred to as being as good as gold and all the other currencies in turn

156
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:47.640
had their values actually linked to that.
Um,

157
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.950
that particular setup didn't last,

158
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.420
but the legacy of all that was that to this day,

159
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.330
as I was saying a little bit earlier,
we still do use,
uh,

160
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.240
the dollar as the currency for doing trade and,

161
00:09:58.241 --> 00:10:03.060
and also as that security blanket.
And what does that mean?

162
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.750
Well,
ultimately,
whether we like it or not,
whether we're using dollars every day,

163
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.020
whether we're seeing them,

164
00:10:08.021 --> 00:10:12.550
whether they electronic and is touching all our lives every day.
Uh,

165
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.010
and through the choices we make that impact on the economic forces around the

166
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:19.980
world and the way the influence and power shifts as well.

167
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.520
So what I thought I do was have a look at the dollar and it's journey around the

168
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:26.040
globe.

169
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.060
Look at a sort of series of episodes of what might happen if you followed a

170
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:34.380
dollar around the globe.
What does that tell us about the,
is there,
and it's not,

171
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:38.040
it's not an unusual journey.
That's $12 billion notes.

172
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.120
Insect classroom is traveling and about half of them are outside of the u s half

173
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:48.630
of them,
which sounds extraordinary when you put it that way.
Uh,
but they are.

174
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:51.330
So it's not an unusual journey by any means.

175
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.950
So in terms of looking at that journey,

176
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:54.950
let's start in the home of the big spender,

177
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:59.951
less store in the US where a one in six of every dollars of GDP,

178
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.120
output income,
however you would look at it,

179
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.440
each year is generated in the form of consumer spending.

180
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.350
So,
you know,
it's a nation of big shoppers.

181
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.550
And even though that's something that people look upon as being a negative,

182
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.560
it's a very important thing indeed.
And this particular transaction,

183
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.960
we're going to look at something that happens every day.
But when I look at,
uh,

184
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.100
a shopper who does what many of us do shopping trip and that you just chucked

185
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:31.220
something in the trolley,
they wants me to Ikea,

186
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.170
you know exactly how this work should come out spending more than you thought

187
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.170
with things you think.
I didn't really need that,
but it's in there anyway.

188
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.960
Am I example,
I looked at a woman who'd been in a Texan Brunch,

189
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.960
but that'd be Texas of Walmart who puts a regimen to hedge,
rolling.

190
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.930
Um,
and uh,
it's cheap.

191
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.350
It's going to give her some German in the kitchen while she's cooking dinner

192
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:56.140
that night.
But the main thing is it's made in China.

193
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.310
And that's something that is a very important relationship and deed because

194
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.300
Walmart,
it's all about piling it high,
selling it cheap.

195
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:09.160
That's the logo it was basically founded on many years ago.
Uh,

196
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.750
and to make that happen increasingly it means turning to China to supply the

197
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:15.400
lines.
You've got to,
uh,

198
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.760
tens of thousands of suppliers in China just making stuff for Walmart.

199
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.150
Walmart actually buys more from China than the whole Germany does.

200
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:27.460
That's how important that relationship has.
Um,

201
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.300
between the both they've come up with the liners that can make the journey

202
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:35.860
across in five days.
Um,
which is,
as you can imagine,

203
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:38.530
a pretty busy route right now.
Of course,

204
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.740
the ships going back the other way on Nina's for which adds up to something

205
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.730
quite different.
This has quite a big impact of course,
on the American economy.

206
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:53.731
I lived in New York about a decade ago and this bridge in New Jersey in Trenton

207
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.580
always fascinated me is the Trenton bridge.
And,
uh,
it's lit up.

208
00:12:57.581 --> 00:12:59.500
Say Trenton makes the world takes,

209
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.650
it's been there for a hundred years and a hundred years ago.

210
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.510
That was true because of course what we saw then was America very much making

211
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.373
what it consumed.

212
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.300
If you put a radio back then it was like to have been built in that factory up

213
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:14.380
there,
which is in Pennsylvania,

214
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.910
that's taken in 1925 so just a couple of hours down the road from the Trenton

215
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.720
Bridge.
But that's all changed since then.
If you're buying a radio in America,

216
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:25.750
chances are it's not made in America at all.
Um,

217
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.990
we've now got much cheaper labor elsewhere.
Of course,

218
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:33.750
if you look at the size of the working age population in China,
uh,

219
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.560
it's my times the size of the hut in the US.

220
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:41.140
So it's no wonder for many other reasons as well that Labor is a lot cheaper

221
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.720
over there.
You got cheaper labor.

222
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.530
You've also got various governments around the world giving their industries are

223
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:48.280
helping heart.

224
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.580
What does the ad up to legal things like that and like that still plant at the

225
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:55.050
bottom.
Lying,
uh,
derelict.
Uh,

226
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.880
the rustbelt has turned very much to dust.

227
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.480
So what does America actually making?
It's making shoppers.

228
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.910
It's making people who are buying goods from abroad.

229
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.490
And that all adds up to a massive big trade deficit that you guys,

230
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.490
her $566 billion.
Um,

231
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.010
president Trump talks about 800 billion.
He actually got that role.
Um,

232
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.290
that's a matter of goods they buy in and this is the goods buying bought 10

233
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.670
minus of goods going out.
Uh,

234
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.280
but what he has actually touched a nerve with obviously is what this means.

235
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.260
The American economy.
The fact that if America's not making,

236
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.920
if it's buying from elsewhere,
that does impact on incomes,

237
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:37.570
it does impact on output,
it impacts on jobs,
hence make America great again.

238
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.590
It's not everything though.
Um,

239
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.580
there are some things that a America still excels and Boeing is saying that over

240
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:50.581
the next couple of decades and expects to get $1 trillion worth of orders from,

241
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.700
uh,
which is extraordinary when you consider the way Chinese manufacturing is

242
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:56.534
evolving.

243
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.070
But that's because America is still excels in the higher tech areas of

244
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:05.000
manufacturing is still has a speciality.
It has a comparative advantage,

245
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.420
but you can't live off airplanes of course.

246
00:15:07.421 --> 00:15:12.020
So we've now got this trade war emerging on the other side of the Atlantic.
Um,

247
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.490
what does that mean?
Well,

248
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.070
it means that tr Trump puts up barriers and things like steel and aluminum

249
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:21.170
saying everybody else is playing on fairly.

250
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:25.610
This is putting my manufacturers out of business,
the likes of retaliate saying,

251
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:25.941
okay,

252
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:29.550
we're going to put charge and things that you still make like Levi's jeans and,

253
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.160
and um,
Harley Davidson's.

254
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.210
No one wins course because what you end up with high prices,

255
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.530
you end up with less business being done.
Ultimately you end up with less output.

256
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.560
The cost of actually making those things goes up as well.

257
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.170
So in many ways it's the populations both who are losers and that's why we've

258
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:53.030
seen trade wars coming down rather than coming up in the last few years.

259
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.180
But what does this mean for China?
Well,

260
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.180
course if America is taking China's making,

261
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.560
so what happening there in the Shins and factories?
Uh,
so many of them now,
uh,

262
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.700
you know,
20,000 suppliers,
they're grinding out stuff for Walmart.

263
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.130
That altogether you've got the Po River Delta,

264
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:13.700
which is the biggest mega city now on the planet.
Um,

265
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.470
but what all those producers have in common is that a then all allowed to hang

266
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:20.510
onto the dollars.
They make,
uh,

267
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.700
those dollars get funneled up instead for the financial system,
uh,

268
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.720
to the central bank who's got a very specific use of mindful than uh,

269
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.650
and all of that is down to what's dictated by the Chinese government.
Of course,

270
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:37.280
they are in the Great Hall of the people that are on the end edge of gentleman

271
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.180
square.
And for many years they've sort of said,
right,
okay,

272
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:42.170
we are all about producing.

273
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:45.140
We are going to become the world's factories and workshops.
In recent years.

274
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:48.900
The cracks are started to show and that policy,
because you've got,
you know,

275
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.380
Vietnam wages and our fifth of what they are in China.
So the likes of h and,

276
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:55.880
m,
they started to look elsewhere and say,

277
00:16:55.881 --> 00:17:00.590
I'm going to buy my garments and Vietnam instead.
What does that mean for China?

278
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.250
Well,

279
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.150
they also had to contend with their optimal for the financial crisis when world

280
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:09.500
trade fell by over 15% in the course of just months.

281
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.490
So they know this isn't a banker,
they have to think about diversifying.

282
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.970
So they're trying to create also a nation of consumers.
Uh,

283
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:21.971
so no wonder the Alibaba has overtaken Walmart when it comes to sales and is now

284
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:26.780
the biggest retailer on,
uh,
but back to what Chinese people do with the dollar.

285
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.430
This is a really fascinating one because
it's got all these dollars.

286
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.450
What do you do with them?
You can't stick.

287
00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:37.190
And we were under the mattress by any means.
One of the things,
of course,

288
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:42.020
one of the reasons why,
um,
China's hung on so tightly to dollars.

289
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.590
It's because it wants to control its exchange rate.
Why is that?
Well,

290
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.140
the cheaper your exchange rate,
the lower exchange rate,

291
00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:50.340
the cheaper your export are,
the more attractive they are.

292
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:54.150
And that is one of the reasons why we have seen all this trade complaints coming

293
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:56.520
up in recent years.
Also,
of course,

294
00:17:56.521 --> 00:17:59.010
it's one of the reasons why you never hear the American government talking about

295
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:02.070
wanting the dollar to be stronger because that's bad news for producers.

296
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.330
So by keeping control of the RMP,

297
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.630
it puts the Chinese government in a very strange position because if you're

298
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.890
controlling your exchange rates,

299
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:13.800
you're controlling the amount of your currency that can fly around the world,

300
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.040
which means that your currency is not going to be able to take on the dollar

301
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:19.260
when it comes to popularity of use around the globe.

302
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.120
So you're giving up some power in that sense.

303
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.760
What it does with all these dollars though,

304
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:26.910
the Chinese is actually quite conservative when it comes to investing.

305
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.800
So they like to go out and buy American bones,
American government bonds.

306
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:35.910
That's the form by which the American government borrows issues.
These bonds,

307
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.750
quite a low rate of return,
but it's a pretty standard,
you know,

308
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.280
pretty stable one,
the Chinese government lost that because,
um,

309
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.540
they know that Uncle Sam is good for the money.
Um,

310
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.500
these are also what's known as liquid.
So you can,

311
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:54.060
you can cash them in quite easily.
Um,
they're also what's known as a deep assets,

312
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.180
which means that if you go and buy,
some of them are,
so some of them,

313
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.360
there are so many of them around,
you're not going to impact the price.

314
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:04.410
There is a sense of stability there as well,
which makes it very popular.

315
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.940
What does that mean for the American people?
Will China owns some of its debt?
Uh,

316
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:13.941
so in theory that means that China could hold America to ransom and practice.

317
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.480
Actually lots of other countries.

318
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.900
Won't those bonds Tuesdays always a buyer for them?
Um,

319
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.350
it does mean however the,
because they're so popular,

320
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.050
the American government comparator,
very low interest rate.

321
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.470
And that means that in turn American people can enjoy lower interest rate.

322
00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:31.050
So there's some payback there.

323
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.240
There's also something else that I'm trying to use as installers for,

324
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.640
and that is,
uh,

325
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.230
to invest abroad something that's become very popular in recent years.

326
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.130
And for China,

327
00:19:41.131 --> 00:19:44.820
it means that donors are the key to growing its economic empire beyond that

328
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:46.860
shows.
This is the old Silk Road,

329
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:49.650
which you weren't remember unless you're around and the times of the Roman

330
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.530
Empire.
Um,
originally used to bring all this,
the new one,

331
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:56.910
but the old one was meant to bring silk to Europe and also bought things like

332
00:19:56.911 --> 00:19:59.070
carrots the other way.
Uh,

333
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:04.170
now the Chinese government is investing billions,

334
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.070
trillions even in building a new maritime and uh,

335
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.220
also the road silk road,
uh,

336
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:16.250
to try and increase its trade passages and also increase its influence as well.

337
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.810
All of those Newbie,
I don't know the companies,

338
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.500
the mergers and acquisitions going on as well.
For the first time in 2014,

339
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.300
China invest more money abroad than means being invested in China.

340
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:30.330
It's an interesting switch of position there.
Why?

341
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.630
Because China is thinking about how it grows.
It's influenced,
uh,

342
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.770
around the globe and it's not just those roots you can see there on the map

343
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.280
because if you're investing at all or as the Chinese government,

344
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.360
you might send it somewhere like Nigeria,
which is what I looked at next.

345
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.860
Why Nigeria?
Well,
this is a very,

346
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.090
very strange one in today because they're building railroad.

347
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.740
Why would you build a railroad in Nigeria?
$12 billion worth of railroad.

348
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.110
It goes from caliber,
which is a port town to Lagos,
the financial capital.

349
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.830
It crosses some oil fields and that's the clear,
uh,

350
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.490
China needs oil to develop.
Nigeria has it.

351
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.190
China wants to have influence over as well fields.

352
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:13.930
It might want to get some of those contracts.

353
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.380
What better way than being a friend of Nigeria is exerting some soft power mean

354
00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:22.950
at that kind of economic diplomacy,
building a railroad,

355
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.210
they're enabling people to get around as well.

356
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:29.350
And for cargo to get around in a country where Roe journeys,
uh,

357
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.190
quite perilous and railroads are currently very underdeveloped,

358
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.100
quite new to Nigeria isn't that they get railroads,
they get infrastructure.
Uh,

359
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.150
China gets some jobs as well through its work as Nigeria gets some jobs as well.

360
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.260
But there's a downside of course,
because by succeeding some of your,
um,

361
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:53.110
territory there by accepting China's dollars,
your lunch without saying well,

362
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.270
but giving up some power as well.

363
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.800
So that's one reason why when we talk about the oil wealth of Nigeria,
very,

364
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:03.910
very little of it actually passes into local hands because it's foreign

365
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:04.241
companies,

366
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:09.160
foreign money that's coming in and actually paying into those things and reaping

367
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.430
the gains at the same time.
And it's more than that as well.

368
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.030
That's the market in Lagos.
Now you can see that some of the local cloth,

369
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.120
they're being sold huge source of income.
They're very popular.

370
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.200
But now you tend to find it's about a dollar a yard I think on average.

371
00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:26.530
But the Chinese imports are on the cutting that substantially.

372
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:29.410
So what you're saying is local traders,
they are being put out of business

373
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.030
and uh,
what we've seen the last few years,
it's investment.

374
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:38.410
They're overcoming the level of aid given to Nigeria,

375
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.980
which is there are lots of questions about what is the answer when you've got as

376
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:46.180
Nigeria has Nigeria had huge problems with the famine,
uh,
not that long ago.
Um,

377
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.790
partly because of conflict in the country.

378
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.100
What do you do in a situation like that?
Is,

379
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:54.250
is it all about investment is about aid?
Well,

380
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.610
both coming strings attached seems to be the answer.
Even aid nowadays.
Um,

381
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.960
there's all sorts of concerns about the right types of products,
projects,

382
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:04.090
the right kind of appropriation funds as well.

383
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.230
So it's one of those debates that keeps going on.
And if you want to develop,

384
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.340
I mean do what infrastructure,
uh,
like Nigeria is getting of China.

385
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.600
If you get it from China,

386
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:16.000
there's gonna be strings attached if you get it through aid as well.

387
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:20.890
Is that the answer?
But the other thing that of course,
uh,
Nigeria,

388
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.440
Nigeria also has to import a lot of food because one of the problems about being

389
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:29.740
an economy that has been subject to so much conflict as it has been,

390
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.960
is that an actual fact,
your national dish,

391
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.620
if it's rice and you can't grow enough,
it's got to come from elsewhere.

392
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.740
So I follow that dollar to India.
Next,

393
00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.570
I have to see exactly what would happen if you then had to buy your rice from

394
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.020
India.
Um,

395
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.260
and that's quite a popular route and nitrify because even though we think about

396
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:51.590
individual countries producing commodities,

397
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.380
that money goes through middlemen.

398
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.620
It goes through four or five major commodities traders and they trade in
dollars,

399
00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:59.810
which is what I was still talking about dollars right now.

400
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.750
So that brings us to India and India is a really interesting example here of how

401
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:12.480
you look at growth and prosperity because you've got the rice balls there and

402
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.490
you're over 165 million tons of rice produced by India last year at secondary to

403
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:19.430
China in that regard.

404
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.630
But on the other hand you've got two thirds of the population of working age in

405
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:28.950
India,
employed in agriculture,
um,

406
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.430
them still live in poverty,

407
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.660
the only about 10% as productive as the American counterparts.

408
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.130
And that's where a number of reasons,
you've got things like a tiny farms,

409
00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:44.940
poor land rights pour you some machinery,
low levels of technology,
um,

410
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.060
and then on top of that,

411
00:24:46.061 --> 00:24:48.700
your infrastructure so bad that even if you manage to produce that killer of

412
00:24:48.701 --> 00:24:52.790
rice,
up to a half of it might have gone off by the time it gets the ports it was

413
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:55.620
destined for.
And then there's the middle man as well.

414
00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.080
There's those big commodities traders.

415
00:24:57.081 --> 00:25:01.280
So the average Indian is not seeing very much of the value of what they're

416
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:02.091
trying to produce.

417
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:05.960
The and then a strange situation where the country can't feed itself.
Therefore,

418
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.330
and also many farmers can't make a living.
That's one side of the engine economy.

419
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:14.270
We know it's the fastest growing major economy right now.
Why?

420
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.320
I don't need to tell you actually in this room,
you probably,

421
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.800
they want to already.
It's all to do with tech.

422
00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:22.490
And the fact that 25 years ago we were looking at a tech industry that was worth

423
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:27.320
about $2 billion now,
well in excess of 100 billion.
Of course.

424
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:27.760
Uh,

425
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.340
I won't go into any more of that because you know all about how successful that

426
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:35.120
has been in terms of propelling the tech industry around the globe.

427
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.840
But it means that in just taking a very strange route to get there,
because

428
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.350
most countries undergo and industrial revolution,
right?
Entered an index,

429
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.570
kind of jumped ahead it.
When I'm not doing industrial revolution,

430
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.570
I'm not to export in like China dead manufactured goods.

431
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.760
I'm going to go straight to tech.
Does it need to have the middleman?
Probably.

432
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:58.880
Yes.
Um,
if you look at what's going on in India,

433
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:00.890
you've got 65 million people living in slums.

434
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.100
People moving out from rural areas say,
I can't afford to live here.

435
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.620
I'm moving to the cities,
but there's nothing for them.

436
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.190
So the government's trying to get a handle on that by saying,
well,

437
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:13.310
we need to think more about investing.
They're trying to attract foreign money,

438
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:17.930
which is quite a departure for the Indian government and also trying to involve

439
00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:19.550
more technology.
Uh,

440
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:24.610
they also tried the strange experiment of doing away with 500,000 prepared

441
00:26:24.971 --> 00:26:27.600
notes,
a demonetization,
uh,

442
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.860
partly to weed out the informal economy tax evaders a dodgy activities.

443
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.820
India is an unusually cash based economy.
Um,

444
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.630
didn't quite work because the people who are professional enough to be dodging

445
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:42.710
taxes and you know,

446
00:26:42.711 --> 00:26:46.350
the big time is we're actually able to put them on until the things as well.

447
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.880
Gold jewelers we're working through the night,

448
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.000
people really suffered and that kind of experiment or housewives,

449
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.150
the people who had money hidden under the bed because they couldn't explain

450
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:57.540
where it came from.
So they couldn't exchange it for the new notes.

451
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.970
So it didn't quite work there.
But on the other hand,

452
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:04.210
one of the things that did happen is you'd see a greater growth or things like

453
00:27:04.211 --> 00:27:07.140
her.
Well,
digital banking took off in a big way.

454
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:11.130
And also you get things like ritual drivers who now except digital payments as

455
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.080
well.
So it did have some impact.

456
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.600
But really the government when it's trying to modernize,

457
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:18.750
has to look at more traditional roots.
It has to look at things like investing.

458
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.330
Um,
it also has to look at building roads.

459
00:27:21.331 --> 00:27:25.170
As I mentioned that an awful lot of produce gets wasted simply because it

460
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.700
doesn't have the rose to connect.

461
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.160
It's 650,000 villages,
uh,

462
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.490
but it wants to change that.

463
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.990
So the government's got very ambitious road building project,
uh,

464
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.930
upwards depending on which estimate they want to quote and which day.

465
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:42.090
It's either 20 kilometers or 25 months.

466
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.760
So it's quite a big difference between the two.
But,
uh,
we'll just,

467
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.910
we'll just accept what they're trying to build more roads.
Uh,
but to build roads,

468
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:56.130
you need oil because oil is what goes into road surfaces as well as into the

469
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:58.350
cars and trucks that drive on them.

470
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.300
We're going to get the oil from if you're in India.
Uh,
how about rock?

471
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.000
So let's follow that dollar on to Iraq.

472
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:08.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

473
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.670
<v 0>Okay.
And that is the,
uh,
miss an oil fields that's near bounce rough</v>

474
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.990
and they put a very particular type of all because even though we talk about

475
00:28:16.991 --> 00:28:18.800
crude oil,
there's different grades of all right.

476
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.740
The stuff that goes into calls is typically light sweet oil,

477
00:28:23.741 --> 00:28:27.890
don't drink it.
It's just called that because of the way it flows.
Um,

478
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.590
and uh,
because of the way it evaporates as well for spelled the stuff you use.

479
00:28:32.591 --> 00:28:36.340
And rose is the heavier grades,
a sour grades.
Um,

480
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.370
it tells me a bit cheaper as well.
And uh,

481
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.980
they all felt embarrassed when they realize that they can actually get away.

482
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.420
We're splitting this into the course of stuff and selling that on a discount.

483
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.810
And India is quite literally lapping that up.

484
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.770
So He'd got already customer that it's not just India.

485
00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.910
If you look across the world,
um,
on average,
each man,

486
00:28:57.911 --> 00:29:01.260
woman and child uses the equivalent of over two liters of crude orcas,

487
00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.450
crude oil per day.
If you look at consumption across the globe,

488
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.500
that's going particularly fast of course in countries like China and India.

489
00:29:08.501 --> 00:29:10.720
So there was a steady supply that I studied.
Amanda,

490
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.670
you would think that equals power,
right?

491
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.380
Not necessarily having oil doesn't always mean you have more power.

492
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.310
Well,
when I go there is dollars.
Uh,

493
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.000
and that's a very specific reason for that.
In the 1970s,

494
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.860
Saudi Arabia and the U s did a deal whereby the US said,
well,

495
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.820
you can use our dollars and in return you'll have the protection of our foreign

496
00:29:34.821 --> 00:29:37.970
policy.
You have our backing.
And Sadie went,
thanks very much.
That's great.

497
00:29:37.971 --> 00:29:40.760
And in return we'll make sure we have a special relationship with you.

498
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.080
You're big gas guzzlers and I'm sure we can make this work.

499
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:48.310
And it has worked ever since.
Uh,
but,
uh,

500
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.350
what Saudi has found and of course last week we saw a great delegation visiting

501
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:58.060
10 Downing Street almost cap in hand because Saudi has discovered that having

502
00:29:58.061 --> 00:30:02.050
oil doesn't necessarily equal riches forever.
Even if demand's going up,

503
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.980
the price can fluctuate from year to year quite a bit.
And,
uh,

504
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.190
those prices are determined on global markets.

505
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:12.070
And even though Saudi Arabia and other countries that got together to form OPEC

506
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:14.950
and try and influence that price,
they don't have much impact.

507
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.920
And it's got so bad.
Now the Saudi Arabia,

508
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:21.790
like many other countries can no longer balance its books based on the oil

509
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:25.260
revenues getting is trying to diversify.
Um,

510
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.530
many countries find that actually having natural resources like that,
um,

511
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.310
can be what's called the paradox of plenty.
You think you've got this rich scene,

512
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:36.760
but it kind of open up your economy to all sorts of vulnerability.
Uh,

513
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:40.540
there is the fluctuation in price.
Um,
there is also,

514
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.210
there's this thing called Dutch disease.
When they found all the North Sea,
um,

515
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.340
the Netherlands thought great fortunes are made and actual fact because the

516
00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:50.050
demand for the currency was like,
right,

517
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.710
the exchange rate shot up or the industry's couldn't cope with that.

518
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.250
And what we saw was the unemployment rising at a time when it's selling a lot of

519
00:30:57.251 --> 00:31:00.760
oil and the economy being in trouble also as a,

520
00:31:00.761 --> 00:31:03.850
if you're in Nigeria or indeed Iraq,
you'd know for well,

521
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:08.240
but where there's all the tends to be conflict and for iis course grabbing oil

522
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:12.310
fields in Iraq was a major source of income for many years.

523
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.600
And that means that,
uh,
the Iraqi government,
all those got many things.

524
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.820
It probably feels it could be doing with our oil income.

525
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:23.821
It's very Alliant on oil income instead has to use parts of it to actually

526
00:31:23.831 --> 00:31:28.330
defend its oil fields.
So what did you do with that?
Well,

527
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:32.740
we're going to go over a well worn path now because,
uh,
heading off to Russia,

528
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.050
a lot of arms,
uh,
that you'll find,
and this is true,
when I s a ripped open bonds,

529
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:42.750
uh,
dating back to times of Saddam Hussein and stole weapons in Iraq,

530
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.110
many of them had basically made in Russia or the equivalent printed on the side.

531
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.060
And there's a reason for this as well.
Okay.
Um,

532
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.660
the Cold War and Russia of course was obsessed with churning out weaponry to

533
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:01.630
show that if you compete with America so much so that it neglects almost all

534
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:04.960
other forms of manufacturing.
It was all about creating the means destruction.

535
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:08.050
And it was all very much along.
So the planning lines,

536
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:12.630
you had quotas for how much you produced,
how it was produced,
father's followed,

537
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:17.230
you know,
their songs fall it on,
uh,
the factory dictated your every way of life,

538
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:21.970
your housing,
what was in your houses.
Thousands Times are now gone.
But,
uh,

539
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.180
Russia then found work.
This was still its area of expertise.
It's still,
um,

540
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.370
very much at the forefront.

541
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:30.530
It's second only to America and the way they sell as well.
Uh,

542
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.090
they sell to their friends.
So America,
suppliers,
the rest of NATO,
for example,

543
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.110
Saudi Arabia,
uh,
Russia,
a lot of the developing world,
but again,

544
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.840
Russia is going to have to about how it,
uh,

545
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:45.470
how that changes over the coming years because China saying he can make this

546
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:50.020
stuff cheaper.
Um,
and,
uh,
also Russian soldiers,
uh,

547
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:54.470
I find himself quite often staring down the barrel of guns that were designed in

548
00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:56.840
their country weapons falling into the wrong hands.

549
00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.790
And that's before you consider all the ethics or the doc site or creating the

550
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.080
means of destruction as well.

551
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.220
There's two things that Russia is dependent on for the money.

552
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:10.220
It gets its weapons and also oil.
Um,

553
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.090
it's economy overall has been pretty unstable and that goes all the way back to

554
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:16.490
the times of the Cold War before.

555
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:21.200
So we'll rush it was churning out arm to protect its border and it's cities.

556
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:25.450
America's currency during the Cold War was actually having a heyday,
um,

557
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:29.990
everyone from hotels to prostitutes and Moscow,
we're accepting dollars.
Why?

558
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:33.410
Because you could use those to spend in hard currency stores,

559
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:37.520
which had stocks well times and shelves were empty elsewhere.

560
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.550
And uh,
you know,
we may think of Russia pulling strings today,
um,

561
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:47.870
in terms of,
uh,
fixing collections or fake news or have we going to look at it.

562
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.440
But,
uh,

563
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.030
America is still holds an economic power and that's still true for this day.
Um,

564
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.770
why?
Because it was all about trust.
People didn't trust the ruble and money.

565
00:33:57.771 --> 00:34:00.770
It's about trust.
You've got to trust its value.
That's going to keep that value.

566
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.280
It's going to be an acceptable means of exchange.

567
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.530
And it's something you can use to repay debt.

568
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.910
The dollar fits the bill a lot better than the ruble throughout the Cold War and

569
00:34:10.911 --> 00:34:12.940
indeed since as well,
a lot of the oligarchs.

570
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:17.870
So they want to keep their money safe,
hold onto it in dollars,
but it comes,

571
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:21.610
the toilet comes with some strange powers attached.
A cartoon that,
um,

572
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.110
that was in a newspaper just after the raids on fifth has headquarters in

573
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:31.550
Geneva,
which was all orchestrated by the Americans.
Why do the Americans care?

574
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.300
They don't even care about football,
you know,
they call it soccer.
Um,

575
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.340
they did care because the whole bribery scandal had touched the American

576
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:41.174
financial system.

577
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.810
It had touched the dollar at anything that does fat means that America has

578
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:49.250
jurisdiction to go out there and take action.
And that's exactly what they did.

579
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:51.800
Another way that Americans tried to,

580
00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:54.350
will's economic power along with Europe of course,

581
00:34:54.351 --> 00:34:58.940
is sanctions after Russia's actions in Ukraine a few years ago.

582
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.350
And that has driven the Russian economy further to its knees into recession.

583
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.550
And of course also created a bit of a crisis in confidence in the robot.

584
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.380
And that too has been good for the dollar.

585
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:13.940
A lot of people who aren't actually affected by sanctions try and keep their

586
00:35:13.941 --> 00:35:17.120
money in dollars and that's quite often elsewhere.

587
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.360
If you don't want those individuals who has been affected by sanctions,

588
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:23.870
what Ma you put your money.
How about uh,
Germany?

589
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:29.570
What?
Germany?
Well,
okay.
Uh,

590
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.140
because partly of the friendship between these two and they didn't always look

591
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:33.680
so friendly.

592
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.730
Apparently at that first meeting Putin brought along his black Labrador.
Uh,

593
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.510
sounds like a friendly thing to do,

594
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.980
but uncle Merkel or has a lifelong fear of dogs after being bitten.

595
00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:46.830
So some saw that as her being terrorized by him,

596
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.400
but since then they seem to have grown a warmer and cozier relationship and

597
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:51.360
there's good reason for that.

598
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.890
40% of gas supplied to Germany comes from Russia.

599
00:35:55.891 --> 00:36:00.690
So effectively Russia is keeping the lights on in Germany over the winter.
Um,

600
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.780
so Germany therefore has been a little bit more reticent about applying

601
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:05.950
sanctions on Russia.
Uh,

602
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:10.770
they've also been a little bit more welcoming to money coming in from Russia and

603
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.040
Germany has a long history of thriving on investment.

604
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.600
The Marshall Plan,
both the money,
those guys,
again,

605
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:20.860
it was not the u s treasury secretary who,
uh,

606
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.190
donated some dollars equivalent of 170 $140 billion,

607
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.500
uh,
in 2017 money after the second world war to rebuild in Germany.

608
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.510
Um,
sounds very altruistic,

609
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:38.280
but it also came about because America was concerned otherwise,
Germany,

610
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:38.880
uh,

611
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.330
would fall into the hands of communists and therefore they'd be facing another

612
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.540
opponent.
I'll also meant ready market for their goods.

613
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.170
That was the idea is that of which Germany grew into a massive industrial

614
00:36:49.171 --> 00:36:53.160
superpower and also created the financial system that you need to enable that

615
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:55.120
kind of growth.
Um,

616
00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:01.110
Russia has a lot of money in Germany stay as well that the refinery,

617
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.280
um,

618
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.960
invested in by the Russian energy supplies and natural fat Russian energy

619
00:37:06.961 --> 00:37:11.430
supplies account about half of Russian money going into Germany today.

620
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.870
But it also means that a,
it's an attractive place.
For example,

621
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:19.350
if you're an arms dealer who's got a dollar that you want to use for your

622
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.950
retirement plan,
what could you do a good buy property in Berlin for example.

623
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:28.200
Um,
and that's the kind of example I looked at in the bank and the book rather,

624
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.480
all that money plowing is Germany means of course the biggest economy in Europe.

625
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.480
Now it's been the architect or the single market and also the kingpin behind the

626
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:42.850
year.
Took a couple of minutes,
talk about the euro because um,

627
00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.780
we are as an interesting one.
Uh,

628
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:49.820
American bankers are really scared about the creation of the euro.
Uh,

629
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.610
they thought it will take over from the dollar as the world's leading currency

630
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:58.750
as most Amerind currency hasn't quite happened via stove and central bank's

631
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:02.610
reserves.
It's still seen as a source of stability,

632
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.160
but some say it with a sense of suspicion partly because of the way the year it

633
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:09.870
came about.
Um,

634
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.350
and that was because there was various entry criteria,
you know,

635
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.860
all the countries joining it had to be basically driving at the same speed in

636
00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:17.694
the same direction.

637
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.770
They fudge some of the rules for that one for Germany as much as for Greece.
Um,

638
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:27.330
so what you ended up with was economies who very quickly became quite clear that

639
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:31.370
one is interest rate wasn't going to suit all their interests.
Uh,

640
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.680
that's quite different cost to America where you've got one currency,

641
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.690
one interest rate on one political system as well.

642
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.330
And those cracks became even clearer during the time of the financial crisis

643
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.940
when it became quite clear.
Like Greece for example,

644
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:50.320
was an all sorts of problems and Germany wasn't that keen on bailing out Greece.

645
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.380
They would very different economies.
And because of that,

646
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:57.010
the questions are still being asked about the future of the year

647
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.170
and a that's throwing the whole,
it's whole credibility into question.

648
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:07.171
And he carries on the UK of course decided after several tests,

649
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.920
uh,
not to join the year.

650
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:12.520
It looks at everything even looked at how much molesballs custody in each

651
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:17.440
European country,
um,
to try and compare how convergent they were with each other.

652
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:21.280
But it's decided not to and at the time and thought that was a huge mistake and

653
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:25.720
that what we find instead was that Germany would be the,
in the outside,

654
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:26.500
uh,

655
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.150
in fact it became the world's largest financial center is not going to continue.

656
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.800
Well,
um,

657
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.220
of course the dollar lies beneath a lot of the financial crisis.

658
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.860
But the UK being the financial center of what we saw was the,
um,

659
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.780
crisis starting in America.
Homeowners,
it couldn't repay loans.

660
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.170
Banks would repackage those loans into investment products.

661
00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:53.320
They didn't really understand those collapsed financial system.

662
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:57.100
Over here feels a wall balls.
You get cues outside of banks like northern rock.

663
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.200
And then we get constant of easing.

664
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.260
We get all that money pumped in effectively meant to create loans to be dolled

665
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:07.210
up and institutions.
Does that work?
Well,

666
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:10.390
the global economy is back on its feet again.
So it seems to have worked.

667
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.840
On the other hand,
when you look at the evidence,

668
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.710
only a small part of that money seems to have been filtering through into

669
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:21.730
consumption.
Most of it seems to just bumped up asset prices once again.

670
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:26.440
Debt levels are now at a point now where people are worrying again about,
uh,

671
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.050
the possibility of another financial crisis.

672
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.870
But another thing that worries people is whether or not we can remain the

673
00:40:31.871 --> 00:40:32.704
financial capital.

674
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.210
We've still got the dollars flowing in partly a consequence of location
language.

675
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.860
And as we all know,
London's the best place in the world to live,
but a,

676
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:46.570
the way the conversations are going now between the government and the European

677
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.830
Council,
that might be something that's under drafting.
And,
uh,
of course,

678
00:40:50.831 --> 00:40:54.240
so many businesses now are looking elsewhere for trade deal.

679
00:40:54.241 --> 00:40:58.660
So I talk about the toilet going back home because you've got a business person

680
00:40:58.661 --> 00:41:02.370
that,
uh,
picking up a dollar at the foreign exchange bureau,
um,

681
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.800
to go back to Houston and over in Houston pays it over to the concierge of his

682
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:12.930
hotel who happens to be the woman we see at the beginning buying her radio and a

683
00:41:13.021 --> 00:41:16.000
that throws up questions about whether America can be made great again.

684
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.430
And it also touches on this disease is very real disease,
which is,

685
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:22.990
uh,
the productivity puzzle,

686
00:41:22.991 --> 00:41:25.090
which is affecting the whole of the Western world at the moment,

687
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.330
which is that per hour,

688
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.830
we've not really seen output increase in any great speed since the financial.

689
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:38.030
Why is that?
We've had a lack of investment.
No,
it's of course,
um,

690
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.840
there's all the technology and the fact that we may not be measuring face things

691
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:46.640
properly.
Whatever is going on there.
Until we sought out that puzzle,

692
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:49.880
we're not going to be able to compete,
uh,
with the emerging globe.

693
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.710
So we're looking at all these journeys around the world.
One thing becomes clear,

694
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.850
it's the dollar that's keeping globalization in business.
Um,

695
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.080
and it's not the big dollars.

696
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.320
It's the small dollars which add up to very big some indeed.

697
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:07.250
It's all those individual decisions people are taking around the globe.
Uh,

698
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.260
what kind of goods to buy,
where to buy them,

699
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.690
all from where to invest their money.

700
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.670
And that's how those economic tides are turning.
And as those tides turn,

701
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.900
it's creating a global shift as well.
And power bases.

702
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.380
What's keeping the wheels turning?
It's not so much real money.

703
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.790
It's a matching money.

704
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.290
It's all that debt we've created and we've learned a lot of lessons since the

705
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:34.580
financial crisis that the central banks don't want to know about it.

706
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.820
Many of us don't want to know about it.
It keeps all finances going,

707
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.400
but it's that,
that's the big elephant in the room.

708
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.800
What does the future look like?
Well,

709
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:46.430
we could see their R and B if the Chinese government changed their ass cheat a

710
00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:49.790
bit,
uh,
coming up the stakes.
We could see the year,
oh,

711
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.450
perhaps looking a little bit more solid.
Digital currencies might with future,

712
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.820
although at the moment I think it's a bubble,

713
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:59.690
but at the moment it's the dollar that's still reigns supreme.
Keep

714
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:05.730
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

715
00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:12.660
<v 2>why we have about 10 minutes of questions.
We'll go with a hard half one finish.</v>

716
00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:14.760
If you have meetings,
I will kick off with the question.

717
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.870
What is your opinion on big tech?
So if you think that Amazon,
for example,

718
00:43:18.871 --> 00:43:21.180
is taking a huge amount of consumer dollars,

719
00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:24.270
what's your opinion on that and perhaps where that might lead us in the future?

720
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:29.190
And if you have a question please.
Behind,
um,
as in whether it's a force for good,

721
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.510
yes.
And perhaps comparable to nation states,
for example,
with,
with,
you know,

722
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:39.240
if you think how much Amazon has compared with smaller GDP countries.
Sure.
Um,

723
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.240
it's a bit like the dollar really,
isn't it?
Yeah.
It has traverse

724
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:45.700
<v 0>nation states.
Uh,
is it a force for good?
I think it's,
it's,</v>

725
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.470
it's basically what it does is epitomizes the way our global economy is changing

726
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.950
and it'll minimize all those forces of globalization.
It's like,
Yep,

727
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.840
we're all using consumer power to get the American dream on the cheap.
Right?

728
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.360
And we all want,
but uh,

729
00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:06.100
what are you sacrificing your sacrificing perhaps the things that,

730
00:44:06.101 --> 00:44:07.120
uh,
you know,

731
00:44:07.121 --> 00:44:10.030
we've come to hold dear things like employment practices and things like that.

732
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.790
So I think you're looking at Amazon in particular.
There's pros and cons.

733
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.880
It's a bit like making America great again,
isn't it?
You can buy cheap,

734
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.840
but there was a price

735
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:24.541
<v 2>I want to,</v>

736
00:44:24.541 --> 00:44:28.350
to ask a question about the choice of telling a story about the dollar because I

737
00:44:28.351 --> 00:44:32.870
imagine is an economist you reviews lots of models,
models are [inaudible].

738
00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.750
I have described these phenomena and I was just interested that you've gone with

739
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:38.940
this narrative approach and you know,
whether you've tried,

740
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:40.450
communicates with models and failed.

741
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.870
So communicating those kinds of models through journalism or whatever and maybe

742
00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:46.704
it doesn't work.
Okay.

743
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.020
<v 0>Uh,
yes,
it doesn't work.</v>

744
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.540
People distrust models,
uh,

745
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.200
because they don't understand that when we've had recently in the news,

746
00:44:58.201 --> 00:44:58.651
of course,

747
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:01.350
all this thing about economic forecasters have no idea what they're talking

748
00:45:01.351 --> 00:45:05.820
about.
I used to be an economic forecaster and yeah,
you know,
there are models,

749
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.820
um,
and they're very good models and there are,

750
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:12.680
I mean the treasury for example in the UK employs hundreds of people sit that

751
00:45:12.681 --> 00:45:15.930
programming and coming up with these things and testing them and constantly

752
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:19.500
changing them as the Bank of England by also know,

753
00:45:19.501 --> 00:45:22.770
having been an economist and muck cause these models that what you get out,

754
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.810
it depends on what you put in,
right?

755
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:29.100
So you can make various assumptions and that will impact on what you get out.

756
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.760
So I'm a little bit cautious sometimes about extolling the virtues of models too

757
00:45:35.011 --> 00:45:35.844
much.

758
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.880
<v 3>You kind of,
you painted a very loose picture about uh,</v>

759
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.160
how complicated the global system is.
Obviously 2008,

760
00:45:43.161 --> 00:45:46.190
2007 shows that economists don't have all the answers.

761
00:45:46.191 --> 00:45:49.880
Do you still trust the economists,
macro economists specifically?
Um,
and yeah,

762
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.320
I guess a little bit more information around those,

763
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.890
around those models and are we perhaps measuring the right thing?
I caught,

764
00:45:53.891 --> 00:45:54.590
remember some of my head,

765
00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.460
there was a conversation recently about GDP not measuring a certain aspect of

766
00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.160
the productive economy.
And incorporating new things into it.

767
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.080
I guess just your thoughts around that would be interesting.

768
00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.550
<v 0>Uh,
yeah.
Uh,
do I trust the economists?
Um,</v>

769
00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:11.650
good question.
Um,
I think it's a bit like,

770
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.860
it's been like being an astrologer or a weather forecaster,

771
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.280
isn't it up to a certain point.

772
00:46:15.281 --> 00:46:17.860
You get a lot of bad press when you get it wrong and it's easy to get it wrong.

773
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.173
Um,

774
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:23.170
and those are all those jokes about economists in a room and you get more views

775
00:46:23.171 --> 00:46:24.100
than there are economists.

776
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.720
I think in terms of analyzing the facts and I think I'm not columnists job

777
00:46:28.721 --> 00:46:32.920
should be to pull apart the fights,
see the underlying picture.
Um,

778
00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.280
what we found in recent years in particular is that politics,

779
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:40.600
personalities to have tend to obscure all those fights and the underlying
trends.

780
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:44.290
Um,
I think economists could do a better job and bringing those to light when it

781
00:46:44.291 --> 00:46:45.580
comes to predicting things.

782
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.510
I think we've got a little bit too complacent about looking at the past.

783
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.410
And a lot of economists who were working around the time of the financial crisis

784
00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.250
quite honestly have never seen,
uh,
a proper recession.

785
00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.820
You'd have to go back to the 70s and see a really strong economic shock.

786
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.110
They just want use to it.
And our models had kind of got a bit complacent too.
Um,

787
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.090
so,
and you mentioned their GDP.
Yeah.
I,
you know,

788
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.650
this is a really interesting point about whether we measured the world's

789
00:47:11.651 --> 00:47:15.400
wellbeing and forms or the amount of income we can generate and there's much

790
00:47:15.401 --> 00:47:16.980
more to the picture.
Um,

791
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:19.720
that measurement of income doesn't take account of a lot of things.

792
00:47:19.721 --> 00:47:21.550
It doesn't take account of the fact that,
you know,

793
00:47:21.551 --> 00:47:25.180
you might go home after a 12 hour day and you've still got a whole load of DIY

794
00:47:25.181 --> 00:47:30.070
to do or housework or whatever.
None of that counts.
There's a famous of Humira,

795
00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:33.370
your cleaner,
um,
you're reducing GDP

796
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.980
because before that the clean is output classed as part of GDP.

797
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.380
Mary,
the cleaner and it's just counted as domestic work,

798
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:46.630
which doesn't show up.
Also.
Now,

799
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:51.160
GDP doesn't measure things like environmental impact.
Um,
technological change,

800
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.010
which is one of the things that was written about recently is the fact that,
um,

801
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.440
when you look at GDP measures,

802
00:47:56.441 --> 00:48:00.940
they haven't taken account the way that technology's moved in recent years and

803
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:04.720
therefore many ways we're underestimating the health of the global economy.

804
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.120
So there's a lot more work to be done on that.

805
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:11.320
And I think it's something that now we've got past the seismic shocks of the

806
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:14.890
financial crisis.
Central banks are finally waking up and paying attention.

807
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.010
<v 2>Uh,
when you give out a loan,</v>

808
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:25.900
you have some kind of expectation that you get the money back.
But given that,

809
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:29.760
um,
uh,
countries have such a big,
uh,
adapting,
you know,

810
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.220
in particular the u s why does it not all collapsed because you know,
is,

811
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.500
is it feasible that you can get the money back?

812
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.660
<v 0>Um,
as a people,
we can get the,
my back,
the America's counting,</v>

813
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:43.590
America's counting the fact that everyone wants American particular is counting

814
00:48:43.591 --> 00:48:48.591
on the fact that everyone wants dollars to trade and to keep in bank reserves.

815
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.630
And that's why it can sell those bonds.

816
00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:56.160
That's why he can fund its deficits and ultimately its debts.
Um,

817
00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.050
it means that America was seen as being good for the money.
But yeah,

818
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.980
if every bond hold,
I,
if America and Japan,
China,
Japan got together and said,

819
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:05.911
what do you think?

820
00:49:05.911 --> 00:49:09.030
Should we ask for Armani bike that could undermine the economy?

821
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:14.660
It's one reason why the yen has never taken off in a big way as a major reserve

822
00:49:15.061 --> 00:49:18.870
currency because investors around the globe,

823
00:49:18.871 --> 00:49:23.871
I've been so concerned about the state of the amount of debt Japan has,

824
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.200
that they don't see it as being a stable and therefore ultimately attractive

825
00:49:28.201 --> 00:49:28.770
economy.

826
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:32.010
But because the dollar has a special status because it's required for other

827
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.020
things,
America doesn't solve that problem.

828
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.070
<v 2>Oh,
I'll go with one more and then we'll round off.
Um,</v>

829
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.780
what do you think outsiders outside of Brexit,

830
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:48.620
what's perhaps the next big thing coming down the line that we should be aware

831
00:49:48.621 --> 00:49:52.970
of?
The Pepsi Paul on top.
Is it,
is it aging population?
Is it unforeseen,

832
00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:57.950
uh,
tech AI outputs?
You know,
what,
what's,
what's,

833
00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.560
what's front of your mind that we should be,
we should be thinking about.

834
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.750
<v 0>Yeah.
I had something up there about aging population,</v>

835
00:50:02.751 --> 00:50:05.630
which I didn't talk about because as conscious of time,
but um,

836
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.910
as we're talking about here,
um,

837
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:11.540
Phillip Hammond's on his feet talking about the state of public finances here in

838
00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:14.060
the UK.
He's talking about the next couple of years.

839
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:18.380
But to me the big problem that's looming for all of us is the fact that

840
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:23.410
populations are aging and that puts a whole different kind of emphasis on the

841
00:50:24.051 --> 00:50:26.960
finances.
We have public finances and private finances and the,

842
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.980
we live the way we work and the way we fund everything.
Um,

843
00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:35.140
I don't think any government has really thought that one through.

844
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.820
And every time they tried to stick a toe in the water,
uh,

845
00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:41.090
things like dementia tax,
of course,
hugely controversial,

846
00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:45.710
but there is a valid issue hiding under all of that,

847
00:50:45.711 --> 00:50:48.800
that somehow we're going to have to think of the fact that the average person is

848
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:50.290
over 64,
uh,

849
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:53.480
cost four times as much and healthcare as someone under the age of 16.

850
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.810
And someone's going to have to pay for that bell,
but going to live longer,

851
00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.800
I going to live better and longer,
hopefully.
But how do we pay for that?

852
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.740
And I think that's something that has to be the subject of much debate.

853
00:51:03.741 --> 00:51:06.440
And hopefully Sam at Davos might get their heads around it as well.

854
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.730
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
