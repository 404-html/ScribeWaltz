00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.390
Good morning and welcome to talks at Google in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.810
Today it is my great pleasure to introduce Dr Anna Free Bowl of Massachusetts

3
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:22.910
Institute of Technology where she is assistant professor in the Department of

4
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.590
Physics.
She's here today to discuss her book searching for the oldest stars,

5
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.060
ancient relics from the early universe.
Why do we care?

6
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.570
Because if it's not lithium hydrogen or helium,

7
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.190
it came from the stars.

8
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.670
Dr Feeble herself along with colleagues is responsible for discovering many of

9
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:43.550
these stars.

10
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.350
And in her book she discovers the process by which he does it.

11
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.290
The book itself is um,

12
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.440
one of the rare books in which we get a dose of actual science in terms of both

13
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:02.591
experts and lay people can understand that as well as a great behind the scenes

14
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:08.261
look at what's involved in marathon observatory sessions to discover the stars

15
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:13.670
and map them.
So without further ado,

16
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.850
please join me in welcoming Dr Ama free bump.

17
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.420
<v 2>Thank you so much for their grades.
And I'm introduction.</v>

18
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.450
I'm very excited to be here and to talk about my book.

19
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.710
It's been a in the making for quite a while.
So it's really,

20
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.360
I'm really pleased that it's finally out and it really got very exciting.

21
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.003
Um,

22
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.910
so I wanted to quickly introduce and tell you a little bit what my goal was of

23
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:50.470
all these years.
I'm very,
of course I'm a scientist.

24
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.560
I'm very interested on conveying my research results,

25
00:01:55.561 --> 00:02:00.480
but also the scientific method to the,
to the wider audience.

26
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.450
And a,
in this case,
I,

27
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:06.360
I have to quote my mom because I regularly tell her,
oh,

28
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:10.680
I'm going to the telescope I'm going observing.
And she always has like,
yeah,

29
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:12.320
yeah.
But,
um,

30
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.990
now after even having written the book,

31
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:18.210
and of course her reading it in great detail,

32
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:20.250
she really understands what this means.

33
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.440
And the point of this is that the public really doesn't know what scientists do

34
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:28.260
all day long.
And this thing of going,

35
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:32.250
observing and using telescopes is certainly very mysterious to anyone who hasn't

36
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.210
been at the telescope.

37
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.710
And they're even lots of astronomers who haven't been at a big telescope.

38
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:40.560
So this is really a widespread issue.

39
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And so I wanted to write a book that is not your typical popular science book

40
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:51.660
that presents just the scientific results,
but it also wanted to,

41
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.710
um,
tell the story of how we get there.

42
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.100
As it turns out,
it's never really a straight line.

43
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.510
And so the many wine,
oh,
the big windy road is,

44
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:07.450
um,
is characterized by,
um,

45
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.170
good luck and bad luck and many other interesting things.

46
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.580
And so I have devoted several chapters,
two to that journey.

47
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.200
And so yeah,

48
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:21.760
my motto is the journey is the destination because I became a scientist because

49
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:26.050
I wanted to find things out and not necessarily do have the flashiest off

50
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:26.650
results.

51
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.220
Obviously that's really great when that happens and it's a part of the journey,

52
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.330
the destination.
But I'm really,

53
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.320
what I do on a daily basis is,
is not,
um,

54
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.800
not all that flashy,
but it's nevertheless really interesting.

55
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.420
And so I want to give and realistic insight into what,

56
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.420
what astronomers to on a daily basis.

57
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.110
So,
but let's get the story started.
Let's start right at the beginning,

58
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.090
some 14 billion years ago.

59
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.480
So the big bang occurred some 14 billion years ago.

60
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.610
And the universe at that time consisted of just three elements,
hydrogen,

61
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:15.620
helium and lithium.
And,
uh,

62
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.000
from that primordial gas,
uh,

63
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:23.890
the very first stars emerged and they were made from hydrogen,

64
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:26.470
helium,
and lithium and nothing else.
Now,

65
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:31.471
these stars had very short lives because they have a very high mass.

66
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.420
Uh,
I'll touch on that a little bit later again.
Uh,

67
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.470
so they were short lived and when they exploded as gigantic supernovae the

68
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.990
elements that they had been cooking,

69
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.660
I'd the additional elements that they had been cooking up in their course to

70
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.010
sustain their luminosity,

71
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:53.011
to shine even for their short lives there were expelled into the interstellar

72
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:55.120
medium,
into the universe.

73
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.930
And that changed everything because now the universe consisted not just of

74
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:02.170
hydrogen,
helium and lithium,

75
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:05.470
but also have elements like carbon and oxygen and iron.

76
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.450
And that has a whole lot of ramifications for additional star formation and

77
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:14.030
author for galaxy formation.
So clearly these stars,
uh,

78
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.490
our shirt in a new era in the universe and then start and galaxy formation

79
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:20.320
indeed had a chance to take off.

80
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.230
So we have the slightly enriched material here and from that the next

81
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:31.231
generations of stars formed and is actually those early generations here.

82
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:38.281
The second one in particular that we are trying to find because these stars here

83
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:45.850
now or some of these stars in that generation included low mass stars.

84
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:49.690
It's law,
small little stores and they have a very long lifetime.

85
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.130
So they are still around today.
And those are the guys said,

86
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:56.470
we are hunting down without big telescopes.

87
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.770
So I want to tell you more about how we do that and what we learned from finding

88
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:07.730
these stars.
But first let's talk a little bit about chemical evolution.

89
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.740
That is the,
the buildup,
the,

90
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.310
the success of buildup of heavy elements heavier than hydrogen,

91
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:17.420
helium and lithium in the universe of a billions of years.

92
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.700
Imagine that this here is the primordial gas cloud.

93
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.850
So just what was there after the Big Bang and the very first stars forms and

94
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:29.810
they're evolved and uh,

95
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:33.920
they exploded a supernovae and saw the elements that they cooked up inside their

96
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:38.210
cores for energy production.
They got ejected back into the reservoir here.

97
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.700
Then this is enriched a little bit,

98
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:44.300
you'll form the next generation of stars and then it goes round and round and

99
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:48.890
round.
And um,
there are several consequences.

100
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.870
Um,
you can immediately see that if you have this cycle here,

101
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:57.950
got run only a few times as opposed to a few hundred or a thousand times,

102
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.740
that the amount of the heavy elements in the resulting stars will increase.

103
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.400
So all their stores contain much fewer of the elements and the younger ones

104
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:12.080
contain more.

105
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.460
And the sun for a reference also formed at some point,

106
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:18.560
probably when the cycle had gone round,

107
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:23.480
maybe a thousand times in that locale in this local region where the sun formed

108
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:28.190
later.
So,
um,
and the sun contains,

109
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.590
I'll,

110
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.590
I'll have another slide on that contains a whole 1.4% of the heavy elements.

111
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.950
So that's already a lot.
But,
um,

112
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.530
I'll say a little bit more about this in a second.

113
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.890
So our prime primary goal is when we searched for the oldest stars is to look

114
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:49.220
for the stats with the least amount of heavy elements in them.

115
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.870
Because as it turns out,

116
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:55.871
it's incredibly difficult to actually obtain an actual age for the star.

117
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.380
However,
at the very end,
I'll show you one example of where we manage to do that.

118
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.200
So that tests kind of wraps it all up.
Nice.

119
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.880
Uh,
so we have to talk about Stella chemical compositions.

120
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.690
And for reference here I have at the top,
um,

121
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.340
the composition of the universe.

122
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.480
I'm after the Big Bang and already mentioned this,
but you have hydrogen,

123
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:24.740
75% helium,
25%,
and just a tiny sprinkle of lithium.

124
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:29.270
So I excluded that because actually it's not too relevant for the remainder of

125
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:31.440
my talk.
And then,
um,

126
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.480
after about 9 billion years of chemical evolution,
the sun formed,
um,

127
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.230
that was about 4.6 billion years ago.

128
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.540
And you can see how the composition changed.

129
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.690
Hydrogen God converted into helium and helium got converted into heavier

130
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:50.990
elements.
So the sun is very rich in heavier elements,

131
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.710
comparatively,
a whole one point percent.

132
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.240
And so what we are doing is we are looking for stars that have million times

133
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.310
less than this.
Okay,
so a whole different ballgame.

134
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.860
But that gives you an idea of what the,
the range as we are we are playing with.

135
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:09.470
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.790
<v 2>So there are lots of chemical elements in the periodic table here.</v>

137
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.480
A few illustrated,
I hope you're a little coffee shop over there.

138
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.140
We'll soon sale element cupcakes.
I'm sure they will taste particularly sweet.

139
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.670
There will certainly would to me.
Um,
a few are highlighted here.

140
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.770
M C N O P s o n n.
O,
sorry,
c,

141
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.400
n o p.S that are the elements of life.

142
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.960
W W US humans.
We come,
we consists mostly of carbon.

143
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.190
All life forms are carbon based and uh,

144
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.790
all of these in particular of these five elements here,

145
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:50.900
but we contain also a whole bunch of other elements.
Um,

146
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.670
and uh,
all that material of course needs to come from somewhere.

147
00:09:55.671 --> 00:10:00.671
And I already mentioned that stars produce elements for energy production.

148
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.940
But,
uh,

149
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.940
one thing that is often forgotten is that we actually also carry a little big

150
00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:12.581
bang material in us because our bodies consist 90% of water and water is made of

151
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:19.211
hydrogen and oxygen and those protons in the hydrogen there were certainly

152
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:23.600
recycled through stars,
but they were made in the big bang.

153
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.670
And so we're not just children of the stars were also children of the big bang.

154
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:32.090
And so I think that's really nice that we can feel a little connected to,

155
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.130
to ride the beginning.

156
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.900
And so I,
uh,

157
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.720
already mentioned he had just a few pretty pictures because in every astronomy

158
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:48.520
talk you also need a few pretty fractures.
This is the star forming region here.

159
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.420
Um,
but,
uh,
the elements are not just made in stars.

160
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:54.730
They're also made in Supernova explosions.

161
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.730
Here are a few examples of areas,
uh,

162
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.230
so called Super Nova remnants and uh,
so that,

163
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.160
that adjust the,
um,

164
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.220
the shells of heavy element material that are still expanding since the

165
00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:13.060
explosion.
And you can actually see in the different colors here,

166
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.730
they are depicting different elements.

167
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.720
So you can literally witness how these new elements that have produced and stars

168
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:24.430
and Supernova explosions are being dispersed in to,
uh,
the costs.
Moss

169
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.170
here is another version of the periodic table.
You can see that,
uh,

170
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.720
I'm ready for lunch because I like her somewhat,
uh,

171
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.820
uh,
unusual depictions of the periodic table of the elements.

172
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:43.630
But then I'm also not a chemist,
I'm astronomer.

173
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.640
So we take a unique spin on the periodic table because you probably know from

174
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:52.700
your chemistry classes that in chemistry here and according to the colors,

175
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.510
the rows,
the columns,
sorry,

176
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:58.960
the columns are very important in chemistry because the elements in a column

177
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.100
have similar properties.
As an astronomer,

178
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.190
I couldn't care less about the columns,
okay.

179
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.640
About the rose because the elements are the subsequently made.

180
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.970
Um,
if you want to create iron here,

181
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.010
you have to create these guys here beforehand.
So it goes one,
two,
one,
two,
one,

182
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:21.790
two,
one,
two to get where you have to go.
So we care for the rose.

183
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.850
And so maybe I have to assume vague,
one of those hundred and nine cupcakes,

184
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:33.120
color them in a slightly different way.
But,

185
00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:35.970
uh,
let's get to the,
to the hard off the matters.

186
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:40.971
So my work is often called Stella archaeology because we take these survivor

187
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:46.141
staffs that are in the Milky Way today and we study their chemical composition

188
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.830
so that we can for their age or at least their formation era due to the small

189
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:56.880
amounts of heavy elements in them.
And,
uh,

190
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
from that we can then infer what the composition of this gas cloud was this

191
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:06.670
little guy's farm from.
And that tells us,
um,

192
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.260
what exactly came out of one of those first star Supernova explosions.

193
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.330
Because as I said in the beginning,

194
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.040
these guys here are very massive and short lift so we can actually not study

195
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:20.874
them anymore.

196
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.960
The only way we can do this is through this indirect way of looking at their

197
00:13:24.961 --> 00:13:29.370
Stella genes that are incorporated into the next generation of stars.

198
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.320
So obviously that requires that we have to find these second generation stars

199
00:13:34.321 --> 00:13:36.270
here.
But,
um,
we,

200
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.960
we are finding them now and so we can infer a properties off.

201
00:13:39.961 --> 00:13:44.580
He's very first stores that really shaped the universe at this early time.

202
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.230
Okay.
So where do we find these,
these doors?

203
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.640
Let's look at the milky way for a second.
Heroes,
a top view.

204
00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.920
And we are in a,
we live in a spiral galaxy.
This is the galactic center.

205
00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:03.680
It's very brightly lit.
You can actually see it here.

206
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.390
This is what we see on the sky because we sit over here about two thirds on the

207
00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:12.110
way out.
And in the,
uh,
in the northern hemisphere.
From here,

208
00:14:12.111 --> 00:14:14.470
we actually looking out.
So we,

209
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.710
what we see on the sky is this spiral arm here.
We asked if we,

210
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.950
if we go to the Southern Hemisphere,
um,

211
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.430
we look in that direction and we see that spiral arm here,

212
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:27.650
but it's back lit by the Galactic Center.

213
00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:31.790
And that's where the Mickey with Oh much banner in the south.
Uh,

214
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.770
and this is a picture of the south,
so you can see the,
um,
the,

215
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:40.010
the back lighting off the Galactic Center here.
Um,

216
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.180
and um,
he or is,
it is a further edge on view.

217
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.980
Um,
what I want to focus on now is,

218
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:50.900
is actually not the disc itself at all.

219
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.200
This outer region here that we call the halo two was very thinly populated

220
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:01.450
spherical envelope that kind of protects the swirls around the desk.

221
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.360
And uh,
we have um,
lots of,

222
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.340
lots of things living in their little old halo stars and those are the ones we

223
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:12.490
want to find a spread.

224
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.840
It's a little bit like the junk yard of the gout Alexi actually.
Uh,

225
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.230
and uh,

226
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.790
we also have little dwarf galaxies that are orbiting the Milky Way as well.

227
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:27.610
And we study those as well.
So,
um,

228
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.390
I told you a little bit about stars now and that they are old.

229
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.230
You can probably guess that they're not very rare because a lot of stores have

230
00:15:35.231 --> 00:15:39.400
formed since then.
So I want to put this to a test with you.

231
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.470
Well,
can tell me which one's the oldest one

232
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.473
<v 1>here.</v>

233
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.000
<v 2>I give you a hint.</v>

234
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.530
It's not this guy here in the middle that that would be too easy.

235
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.470
That can only be wrong answers here.

236
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.320
Actually there will likely be wrong,
but why don't you give it a try?
Yes.

237
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.480
The reddest one.
Why do we have red one?
We have a red one here.
This one,

238
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.340
perhaps this one here.
Okay,
well it's not the red.
This one.

239
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.550
<v 1>Maybe the bluest warm.
Well Fun.</v>

240
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:30.720
<v 2>That's a,
that's a good deduction.
Yeah.
Um,
however,
if you put a star further away,</v>

241
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.740
it'll appear smaller.
So from this collective image here,
we,

242
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.820
we can't really tell.
Well,
I can tell you one thing.

243
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:43.470
I have absolutely no clue.
Uh,
which SARS off and restores yard.

244
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:49.190
All we can see in this image that all that have you have seen is that there are

245
00:16:49.651 --> 00:16:52.500
different EP parents sizes and different colors.

246
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.780
Because a picture like that is really not giving you any more information.

247
00:16:57.781 --> 00:17:01.830
Now that's a really good information,
but it's limited information.

248
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.920
What do we need to do?
Well,

249
00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:07.830
we need to use a different technique that's called spectroscopy.

250
00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:10.800
It doesn't deliver pretty pictures,
but oh boy,

251
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.220
it delivers information and you guys hopefully appreciate that.

252
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.500
So,
um,

253
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:22.100
we use the method of spectroscopy to explore the,

254
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.860
um,

255
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.630
the outer atmosphere of the star and a weekend would that be,

256
00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:30.210
can bridge very large distances.

257
00:17:30.211 --> 00:17:34.100
And it's almost like we're taking a little piece of the store.
And,
um,
uh,

258
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.980
looking at it in the lab,
kind of like the CSI guys guys.

259
00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:39.570
And they are mass spectrometers.

260
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.140
We use big telescopes for that.

261
00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:45.390
But before I tell you a little bit more about that,

262
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.770
I just wanted to make one more point named he's a picture's worth a thousand

263
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:50.604
words.

264
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.140
A bout a spectrum is worth a thousand pictures because this is a star and this

265
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:59.550
is a picture of a very important star.

266
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:01.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.730
<v 2>But when you look at the picture,
it's a fuzzy blob in the universe.
How boring.</v>

268
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.510
That's incredibly boring.
It doesn't really tell us anything.

269
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:13.870
But the spectroscopic analysis has revealed that this is the by the,

270
00:18:14.061 --> 00:18:16.430
by now,
second most iron our star.

271
00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:21.330
So this is a second generation star in the universe.
That's pretty neat,

272
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:26.010
I think.
So let's briefly recap,
uh,
what,

273
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.120
what we do in terms of,
uh,

274
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.700
a chemical abundance analysis that is based on a spectrum.
We,

275
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:33.270
um,

276
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.900
collect the starlight with a big telescope and we have a spectrograph which just

277
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.850
basically a prison,
uh,
in,
uh,
uh,
here I saw the prison,

278
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.020
um,
splits up the light into the rainbow colors and then you get a spectrum like

279
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:46.321
that.

280
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:49.500
It doesn't look quite like the rainbow because there are all these dark lines in

281
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:53.040
here.
And each dark line we first to,
um,

282
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.100
a little piece of light that is lost.

283
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.820
And what's happening in the Stella surface that we're observing,

284
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.590
there are all sorts of elements,

285
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:06.591
atoms swirling around and each element absorbs at certain wavelength.

286
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.210
And,
um,
while absorption means the light is absorbed,
it's gone.

287
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:16.320
And so that's where we see these lines here on actually the across cross cut

288
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:20.160
through here is shown up here and you can see indeed all these lines here.

289
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.840
These are all absorption lines.
And if we take a little peek,
a little look,

290
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.040
a closer look here,

291
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.340
we have hydrogen lines here and here's even a tiny calcium line so we can

292
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:35.970
measure the strength of these lines and then infer their abundance because

293
00:19:35.971 --> 00:19:38.220
that's really what we want in order to determine,
okay,

294
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:42.630
how much of these heavy elements is there and is that a star that could have

295
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:46.380
formed as part of the second generation because it's abundance are so low.

296
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.720
And so I already hinted that bad.

297
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.050
These stars are very rare.

298
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.510
There are forums 13 billion years ago and since then the universe has been quite

299
00:19:58.511 --> 00:20:00.160
busy making SARS.

300
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.290
And so we need big sky surveys to go from hundreds,
sorry,

301
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:08.410
from millions,
actually hundreds of millions,
almost stars,

302
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.770
200 actual hundreds and then dozens.

303
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:16.570
And we do that by getting different kinds of spectrum and the quality goes up

304
00:20:16.571 --> 00:20:20.140
and up.
We really need very high resolution spectrum here,

305
00:20:20.141 --> 00:20:23.450
which just means we really stretched the light out,
uh,

306
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.960
to an extreme to get to really,

307
00:20:25.961 --> 00:20:28.990
really fine spectral details here.

308
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.250
So we can measure this tiny little iron line here.
And here's another one.

309
00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:37.210
This is the calcium line here,
uh,
to do our work.

310
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.261
So it's a,

311
00:20:38.261 --> 00:20:42.820
it's quite painstaking and it takes years sometimes to go from here to here,

312
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.360
but,
um,
it's,
it's really awesome when we get there.

313
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.943
<v 1>Okay.</v>

314
00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.220
<v 2>And so let me tell you a little bit about the observing,
uh,</v>

315
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.240
because it's absolutely fascinating to to go there and to take your data and

316
00:20:56.241 --> 00:21:01.220
have these discovery moments.
And so that was really a big,
um,

317
00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.430
uh,
something that I really wanted to share with everyone.

318
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.700
And so here are just a few pictures of big telescopes so that I have used,

319
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.670
uh,
I will tell you a little bit more about the Magellan telescopes here.

320
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.870
Are these,
how the Keck telescopes on her way.
Maybe you have been to Hawaii.

321
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.630
You can even go up the summit,
almost up to the summit and,
um,

322
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.920
take a telescope tour if you're ever there.
Uh,
the,

323
00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:30.830
the Japanese telescopes also up on,
on one Ikea and then also in Chile,

324
00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.510
uh,
some of the European telescopes.
So lots out there.

325
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:40.700
And,
uh,
here are the Magellan telescopes.
I take students there.

326
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.013
<v 1>Uh,
oh,</v>

327
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.940
<v 2>uh,
this was an Undergrad at MIT.</v>

328
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.890
So I like to train students also from early on and I have one,

329
00:21:51.891 --> 00:21:56.720
some extra funds to take specifically undergrads to the telescope to give them

330
00:21:56.721 --> 00:22:01.430
the research experience very early on.
It's very inspiring to them.

331
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.600
And um,

332
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.660
so far they've all gone into science or stuck with a science and it's been

333
00:22:07.731 --> 00:22:09.020
always very exciting.

334
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.280
So I really love going there even when it's cloudy like this,

335
00:22:13.281 --> 00:22:18.110
but at least to make some pretty pictures and uh,
that's how it looks at night.

336
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.750
This isn't even the,
the center part of the Milky Way.
Just,
um,

337
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.450
just,
um,
the spiral arm party or the nonvascular part,

338
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.080
the galactic center sort of down here.
Um,

339
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.950
I was observing some dwarf galaxy stores with that telescope while I had to

340
00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:37.990
stand very still for 30 seconds.
So,
um,
that,

341
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.080
that was exciting.

342
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:44.350
But we show you some movies really give you the visual counterpart to what I

343
00:22:46.051 --> 00:22:47.040
described in the book.

344
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.960
So these are the two telescopes and this is set up mine,

345
00:22:51.961 --> 00:22:56.220
the one I always use.
And you can see the make you way now moving up,
right?

346
00:22:56.221 --> 00:23:00.350
And you can clearly see the back backlit,
um,
spiral arm here.

347
00:23:00.351 --> 00:23:04.100
This is the galactic center and it's just absolutely majestic.

348
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.060
And actually if the moon is down and you have the Milky Way above you,

349
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:13.880
you can see your own shadow in the light of the stars,

350
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.540
right?
Just think about that for a sec.

351
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.180
That's just truly magical

352
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.690
by the moon does come up once in awhile.
And Rex,
you're,

353
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:32.060
uh,
you're a time labs.
But
as I said,

354
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:37.160
this is about realistic experiences and not,
um,
fudge things.

355
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.160
Like it's always dark and the Milky Way is always up.

356
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.770
So I just wanted to just show how,
how it really is the good,
bad,
and the ugly.

357
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:47.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

358
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.260
<v 2>And I have another one because this one was the,
um,</v>

359
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:51.660
<v 1>okay.</v>

360
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.600
<v 2>The outside,
but what happens inside</v>

361
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.240
lots of keyboards,
Dalton buttons

362
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.930
and lots of spectrum.

363
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.170
And you'll see here the round spectrum and not yet fully processed,

364
00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:23.740
but you see the absorption lines in them.

365
00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:28.170
So I inspect the strength of both absorption life immediately after every

366
00:24:28.171 --> 00:24:33.140
observation and on Yay or nay.
So either I go onto the next target or like,

367
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.060
oh,
maybe I need take more care here.

368
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.070
And uh,
yeah,
that happens all night long.
That's what astronomers are doing,

369
00:24:42.071 --> 00:24:44.910
owner law.
Um,

370
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:49.930
but as I said was good luck and there's bad luck.

371
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.220
I have been at the telescope many times and it was completely cloudy and I came

372
00:24:54.221 --> 00:24:55.210
home empty handed.

373
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.090
I have to wait for a year until I get time again that I actually have to

374
00:25:01.091 --> 00:25:02.920
competitively win first.

375
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.300
So sometimes the universe is just against you,
all the weather gods,

376
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.300
but again it makes for a pretty pictures.

377
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.620
You can see here,
this is,
I'm Scorpion on Torres.

378
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:19.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

379
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.520
<v 2>So even through the clouds you can actually see quite a lot of stars and 10 thus</v>

380
00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:26.880
depends how thick the clouds or whether you keep observing through the clouds or

381
00:25:26.881 --> 00:25:29.700
you have to stop because there's just nothing coming through anymore

382
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:31.983
<v 1>like in this case.</v>

383
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.880
<v 2>But at least it works out pretty artsy.</v>

384
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.540
What you see here is a,

385
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:50.250
well the trucks on the highway light pollution is a big issue.

386
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.180
Even at the telescopes.
Every year I go there,
it gets a little bit worse.

387
00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:58.140
The CDs get a little bit bigger or they a little more trucks on the road.
It's,

388
00:25:58.141 --> 00:26:00.390
it's no good.
It's really affecting us.

389
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:05.420
And this is in the Atacama desert in 2,500 meters up in the mountains.
My Bud,

390
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.680
we can see very far because the era so good

391
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.710
and then it gets light again in the morning.
So,
um,

392
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.490
if you like these kinds of clips or would like to show them to someone else who

393
00:26:17.491 --> 00:26:21.100
might be interested in seeing what astronomers are doing,
epic telescopes,
um,

394
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.950
you can put my name into Youtube,
I guess.
You know how that works.
Um,

395
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.160
you can also tweet me or just check out my website.

396
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.930
So I have a whole bunch of things they are,

397
00:26:30.931 --> 00:26:35.520
because my outreach program was called science.
It's a human thing,
right?
We,

398
00:26:35.521 --> 00:26:36.690
it's people who are doing this.

399
00:26:36.691 --> 00:26:41.691
So we should show people doing it pretty simple yet apparently so difficult

400
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.140
back to the science.
So,
or here is this picture again,
this fuzzy blob.

401
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.120
This is,
uh,
one of the most important Cyrus we have found.
It's,
uh,

402
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.830
as far as we know is a second generation star because it's iron abundance and

403
00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:03.831
other elements are so deficient that only one first star Supernova is required

404
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:07.980
or needed,
um,

405
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.730
to produce all these elements that we see in the star.

406
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:16.590
Now I should say here for clarification,
this star is,

407
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:21.480
um,
actually really unevolved.
It has not even started yet.

408
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.490
I'm converting anything else but hydrogen to helium in its core.

409
00:27:26.491 --> 00:27:29.760
So this star has not really made any heavy elements itself.

410
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.890
Whatever we find in the Stella surface today came from the birth gas cloud from

411
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:35.970
which the star form,

412
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:41.010
which means that must have come from that previous generation star that enriched

413
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.900
that gas.
Okay.
So this is really the pinnacle,
uh,
of,
of,

414
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.140
of our work and um,

415
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.840
how much iron is in there?
Well,

416
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.290
stars obviously little bit bigger than the earth,

417
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:58.680
about 300,000 times.
Um,

418
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.930
but if you want to make the comparison,

419
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:05.760
you take the earth iron core and it's about 1% of the earth I core that has

420
00:28:05.761 --> 00:28:08.880
spread throughout my little star there.

421
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.090
So that supernova produced about that match,

422
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.200
which actually should you,
uh,
which,

423
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:21.201
which makes you think like could the earth have formed early on in the universe?

424
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.571
Well,

425
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:26.571
the answer is clearly no because you needed at least 100 supernovae to produce

426
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:32.730
as much iron in the universe to even make up the earth iron core.

427
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:33.420
Correct.

428
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.420
So it took probably several billion years before there was enough material out

429
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:43.230
there to,
to have planets form,
um,
that,

430
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:46.400
that sort of transition of when the first planets emerged as,

431
00:28:46.401 --> 00:28:49.680
as currently researched.
And a certainly very,

432
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:53.840
very exciting topic.
And,
um,
yeah,

433
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.530
I look forward to knowing the answer,

434
00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.370
but a no planets in the early universe.
And so what,

435
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.790
what do we learn from this?
Now?
I already mentioned many tidbits,

436
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.200
so let's put this together.
So we,
we usually use iron,

437
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:13.800
but also elements like carbon and oxygen to try to,
um,

438
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.860
to figure out what,
what went on in the Supernova.

439
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:20.640
And we work with people who calculate how many elements,
uh,

440
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.210
produced by the star itself as it is,
uh,

441
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.270
as a does before it explodes.
Um,

442
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:32.640
and then in the supernova explosion and we compare those models and then we

443
00:29:32.641 --> 00:29:33.990
figure out,
oh,
you know,

444
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.100
it was this and this much that came out of this for a star.

445
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.400
And this really is the,
the one and owned the diagnostic

446
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.640
tool that we have to study the properties of the first stores.

447
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.740
So what are we interested in?
Well,

448
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:52.150
first of all be interested in their masters because theory has actually told us

449
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.400
that he's first stars were very massive.

450
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.720
It's actually very difficult for stars to form from just hydrogen,

451
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:02.680
helium and lithium.
It can't really cool down.
So I can't really clump well.

452
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.790
And so it's difficult to make small stout.

453
00:30:04.791 --> 00:30:09.330
So we would like to confirm that the Theorosa rate,
um,
and that they have,
um,

454
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.200
high master's maybe I saw theory says maybe up to a hundred solar masses a

455
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.460
hundred times the mass of the sun.
And indeed our works from this comparison.

456
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.260
We have found that,
uh,

457
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.090
the first stars might have been something like 50 or 60 saw land masses.
No,

458
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:28.450
it's not exactly a hundred,
but that was just a ballpark number to start with.

459
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.560
So it's definitely more than 10 or 15,

460
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:37.100
which is the typical math for two days,
larger stores,
you know,

461
00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:41.860
so kind of different back then.
But we can also learn about,

462
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.600
uh,
the explosion mechanism and the explosion of energy and a,

463
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:51.160
that is very important for understanding really with how much power these stars

464
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.100
started to,
to change the universe when they exploded.

465
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:58.150
There are all sorts of homey keep ramifications that come from there depending

466
00:30:58.151 --> 00:31:01.570
on how violently these stars exploded.

467
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.570
So we have a whole bunch of ongoing sky's service that help us,
uh,

468
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.350
to find more of these stores,
especially some that have a very,
uh,

469
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:15.430
that involve in new technique that is a lot more efficient now.
So,

470
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.110
um,
hopefully we'll find a lot more of these guys soon.

471
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.900
I think,
uh,

472
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.080
in the last few minutes I'd like to introduce this second star to you,
um,
here,

473
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:32.920
uh,
another fuzzy blob in the universe.
Now this one is actually fairly bright.

474
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:36.520
So if you have a small telescope at home or you know,
someone who has,

475
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.400
you can actually take a picture of yourself.
Um,

476
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.380
this was done by taken by an amateur astronomer and d send me those picture

477
00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.290
there.
So that's Kinda Nice.
But again,

478
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:51.940
you need that spectroscopic knowledge to say that this is one of the oldest

479
00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:54.400
stars.
So we know because we have measured each.

480
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.370
And so what's the big deal here?

481
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.390
We have taken a spectrum and the spectrum was very unusual because it contained

482
00:32:01.391 --> 00:32:06.391
absorption lines from very heavy rare earths earth elements and uh,

483
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.560
and that included elements,
uh,
like ethereum and uranium.

484
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.710
And you hopefully know that these are radioactive elements.

485
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:19.270
So as soon as you deal with radioactive material,
uh,
you have yourself a clock.

486
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.440
So we're making use of that.
And um,

487
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.470
it basically works like the radio carbon method,

488
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:31.180
just we're dealing with slightly older fonts.
So,

489
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.100
uh,
if you think that this was the Supernova,
um,
these heavy elements,

490
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:38.020
including thorium uranium,
they got produced here,

491
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:41.900
they got expelled into the universe,
and then our little guy formed.

492
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.580
And all of this material got baked into the star.
And then,
um,

493
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.950
actually pretty much since the supernova explosion,
the radio active material,

494
00:32:50.951 --> 00:32:52.130
I started to decay.

495
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.720
And today we measure what's laughed and we compare that with calculations for

496
00:32:56.721 --> 00:32:59.450
how much was produced.
And Bang,

497
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.350
we have an age had all sounds really easy.
And the,

498
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.550
the concept is very straightforward.
Um,

499
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.470
before I show you why this is so hard,

500
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:13.060
let me just illustrate to you what it means to work on,

501
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.990
on some of those special stores.

502
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.810
So here are a few elements that we regularly measure in,

503
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.280
in all of our old stars.
Um,

504
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.900
we then have these purple ones here,
this other rare earth elements,

505
00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:31.760
especially the ones here at the bottom,
uh,
that we can,
we can measure.

506
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.180
And there are,

507
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.850
these elements are produced only in Supernova explosions doing very,

508
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.000
they're a special conditions.

509
00:33:37.001 --> 00:33:42.001
So the gold and the silver from your jewelry all comes from these very special

510
00:33:42.141 --> 00:33:44.900
supernova explosions.
And this,
uh,

511
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.920
they are still a lot of open questions about this process that makes these

512
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:54.290
elements.
And so it's very exciting for us to find some of these sores.

513
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:57.550
And so we can chime into this question where and them,

514
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.790
it's like silver and gold actually come from and how exactly there are produced

515
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:02.624
in the universe.

516
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:07.870
So here is why this measurement takes an incredible amount of data and it's a

517
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.070
very difficult analysis because we want to measure the uranium abundances and

518
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.330
abundance.
And so here you have absorption lines,
magnesium,

519
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.340
iron neodymium,

520
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.840
Samarium I in here and do you see it's a blow up a system.

521
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.910
So if you look at this blue line,

522
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.480
this is a synthetic spectrum that we have created to model the star there

523
00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:33.740
contains no uranium.

524
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:37.850
And the question is does dad one correspond to the observed data,

525
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:40.850
which is the dots included?
The answer is no.

526
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:43.520
Instead we have data that's a little bit lower,

527
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:46.340
which means there is a little uranium absorption.

528
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:50.870
And so we have then created model said kind of rubbed,
produced this here.

529
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.190
Um,
if the uranium was not decaying,

530
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:58.970
it would have been absorbed up to here.
So that would be easy to measure.

531
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:02.090
But it's good that it's the king because it gives us this clock.

532
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:07.010
So by making this measurement here requires x extremely,
um,

533
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.270
exquisite data,

534
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.460
but it worked because the stories are bright and we got an age,

535
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.700
well there's this nod,
precision cosmology.
But nevertheless,

536
00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:19.760
it's an important contribution to,
um,

537
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.430
to the early universe or two studies of the early universe.

538
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:27.490
And it confirms that the whole story I have told you about the chemical

539
00:35:27.981 --> 00:35:31.280
composition and that telling us that we,
uh,

540
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:36.281
that we can look back in time to this early era by measuring chemical abundances

541
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.280
is actually so here are different element ratios.

542
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.490
They all involve either [inaudible] or uranium or both.

543
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.610
And these are ages and in Berlin,
yes.

544
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.600
Now the universe is a 13.8 billion years.

545
00:35:50.601 --> 00:35:54.780
So this is just a mathematical number that pops out.
Obviously it's unphysical,

546
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.370
but math doesn't really care about physics,
so we have to take it.
Uh,

547
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:03.540
but if you average all off this,
it comes out to about 13 billion years.

548
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:05.100
And that is a number of,
we like,

549
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.180
it's very consistent with the age of the universe.
Now,

550
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:12.750
there are some uncertainties of course,

551
00:36:12.751 --> 00:36:16.200
but it is not 10 and it's not 5 billion years.

552
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.470
It's not like the sun and you know,

553
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.530
even 10 is still a while away from 14 here.

554
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:27.630
So the concept of stellar archaeology is correct if it works.

555
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.740
And,
uh,
these old stars here at first of all,

556
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:35.220
there really are old and we can use them to explore the early universe.

557
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.640
And of course before the era of these satellites that probe the cosmic Mac

558
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.040
Michael Microwave background radiation.

559
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:49.260
And that led to the very precise determination of the age of the universe to

560
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:53.390
13.8 billion years.
Methods like these where,
uh,

561
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:58.200
the standard to date the universe and to provide a lower limit to the age of the

562
00:36:58.201 --> 00:37:02.500
universe.
So when I went to high school,
um,
uh,

563
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.790
that was still the standard and this would have made a great addition then.

564
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.740
Okay.
So that brings me to the end of it.

565
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.340
I hope I could give you just a tiny little bit,
uh,

566
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.020
often insight that these old staff's really,
I like little diamonds in the sky.

567
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:23.850
Um,
feel very rare.
Um,
they are difficult to come by,

568
00:37:23.851 --> 00:37:28.320
but we have our methods.
I didn't have time to talk much about this,

569
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:32.880
but many contain actually unusually large amounts of carbon compared to their

570
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:34.680
other elements.
And that actually,
um,

571
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:39.950
indicates to us that carbon is not just an important element for us today since

572
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:42.060
we're all carbon based.

573
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.560
But it was probably also the most important element that that helped in the

574
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:49.620
early universe after the formation of the first stars.

575
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.840
So carbon really is the most important element if you ask me at all costs,

576
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:58.560
make times and um,
well the source are quite old.

577
00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:02.190
So I would say they lost almost for until forever.
And,
uh,

578
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:07.200
we can address them very many different and exciting science questions with
them.

579
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.710
So there's almost an old staff or any kind of question you might have.

580
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.130
And of course when you find them,
they make you happy.
So I would just say,

581
00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:18.930
and this my slides a little cut off there,
uh,
with our new,

582
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:21.690
an ongoing service and the big telescopes that we're using,

583
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:25.590
we are continuing this treasure hunt.
Thank you so much.

584
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.860
<v 3>So,
um,
how many of these second generation stars are,
I know now,</v>

585
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.150
<v 2>uh,
so we,
I think we know about six,</v>

586
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.840
five or six.
It depends a little bit on who you ask.

587
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.320
And it also depends a little bit on,
uh,

588
00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.310
on the type office first SAR Supernova that you're modeling and how much it

589
00:38:56.311 --> 00:38:59.610
outputs,
right?
So they are obviously a little variation,
but,
um,

590
00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:04.611
we've come really a long while because in 2000 they were zero.

591
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:10.180
Right?
So,
okay,
that's 15 years ago.
But,
uh,
with our increasing the,
uh,

592
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:14.550
improving search techniques,
it's now kind of on the rise.

593
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.870
<v 3>And,</v>

594
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:20.340
and you mentioned that we've learned things about the first generation of stars.

595
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:24.480
Is there any prospect that someday we will have a telescope that will let us

596
00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:26.580
actually see some of these first generation stars?

597
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.531
<v 2>Well,</v>

598
00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:32.531
for that we would need to have a strong infrared telescope like the James Webb

599
00:39:32.751 --> 00:39:36.510
space telescope that's currently being built by NASA.
Um,

600
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.720
people have made this calculation whether you could look far enough back in time

601
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.920
that you would essentially look back to that era,
right?

602
00:39:45.921 --> 00:39:50.921
Because the light that comes from this early era just travels for 13 something

603
00:39:51.651 --> 00:39:54.740
billion years to us.
So if you can look that far back,

604
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:59.420
that will be really awesome.
Now that would be really,
really,
really far away,

605
00:39:59.421 --> 00:40:02.870
which means you've run need really,
really bright sources.
And My,

606
00:40:02.871 --> 00:40:06.830
the first stars veer very bright that individually they're not bright enough to

607
00:40:06.831 --> 00:40:11.270
shine over 13.8 billion light years.

608
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.880
Uh,
however,

609
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:18.910
maybe if there was a cluster of first doors together that could just be bright

610
00:40:21.201 --> 00:40:24.360
enough.
We don't know.
But it's very speculative when again,

611
00:40:24.361 --> 00:40:28.900
as wasn't theorists so calculated that God bless them.
But we'll have to see how,

612
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:33.901
how that matches up with the capabilities of a telescope like the Jwst.

613
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.643
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

614
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.750
<v 3>The stores that you described seem to have low mass.
Um,</v>

615
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:45.630
is this typical of what you would predict or do you think it's selection bias

616
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.673
from your search?

617
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.080
<v 2>It's absolute.</v>

618
00:40:48.081 --> 00:40:53.081
He is selection bias because Stella mass correlates inversely with lifetime.

619
00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:58.670
So the big guys,
they die very soon and the little guys live very long.

620
00:40:58.671 --> 00:41:03.080
So we can only find old status that off very low mass.

621
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.120
And to give you a reference,
the sun and we use the solar mass,

622
00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.980
the mass of the sun as a reference,
um,
has a lifetime of 10 billion years.

623
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.870
That's actually easy to remember.

624
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:20.160
And so the guy who said we are interested in now,
um,

625
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.350
have about 0.6,

626
00:41:21.351 --> 00:41:25.940
2.8 solar masses because they have total lifetimes of 15 to 20 billion years.

627
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.610
So if they are formed 14 billion years ago,

628
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.203
<v 1>hm.</v>

629
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.740
<v 2>They're still have a while to go but not that long.</v>

630
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.180
And so they aren't just in the ride evolutionary stage right now for us to find

631
00:41:38.181 --> 00:41:42.960
them and to not have messed up their surfaces from the interior on all sides and

632
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:48.040
doing all sorts of other wonky things.
Um,
so yeah,
it's kind of by design.

633
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.050
<v 3>Hi.</v>

634
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.380
So you mentioned that the first generation stars are a very massive like hundred

635
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:05.381
solar mass and the one you presented is much lighter or 0.6 or eight.

636
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.830
Um,

637
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.950
and consequently there's a huge difference in their lifetime because the first

638
00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:14.840
generation of stars died very fast and this one is 30 and v are years old.

639
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.700
Um,
but they are not very different in terms of the amount of heavier elements in

640
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:20.930
them because as you said,

641
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:25.430
there's only a teeny tiny amount in this one and there are zero in the first

642
00:42:25.431 --> 00:42:29.090
generation one.
So it doesn't really seem a striking difference to me.

643
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:34.420
Why is it that that very teeny tiny amount of heavier elements can make such a

644
00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:37.520
big difference in the mess of forming stars?

645
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.780
<v 2>Thank you for asking that because I usually don't have time to talk.
Um,
yeah,</v>

646
00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:47.670
so a zero or a little,
it makes a big difference because um,
uh,
heavy elements,

647
00:42:47.671 --> 00:42:50.910
especially carbon and oxygen,
the act as coolants.

648
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:55.550
So imagine you have this soup and um,
it,

649
00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.450
the soup just can't cool.
You add just a sprinkle of salt.
Well,

650
00:43:00.451 --> 00:43:02.970
in this case you change the whole flavor off your soup,
right?

651
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.900
It goes from bland too tasty.
And the same kind of thing happens

652
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.890
when you add a little carbon,
right?
It's suddenly Ken cool.

653
00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:15.810
And it can clump and it can fragment.
And once you have fragmentation,

654
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:16.980
um,

655
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.720
the cloud breaks up into smaller clumps and then gravity will again do its
thing.

656
00:43:21.721 --> 00:43:25.180
But on smaller length scales,
um,

657
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.310
it's a little bit more complicated than that,
but that's the basic idea.

658
00:43:29.311 --> 00:43:33.340
So as soon as you have some elements,
because you know carbon is a more extended,

659
00:43:33.341 --> 00:43:34.470
a complicated atom,

660
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:39.450
so it has a lot of transitions for the electrons and there does kind of wiggling

661
00:43:39.451 --> 00:43:43.560
away and carbon oxygen are particularly good and having so called fine structure

662
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.610
lion transition so it can legal,
you know,

663
00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.350
whereas a hydrogen atom really it can do nothing.

664
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:54.240
I mean it has one electron going wrong.
Okay.

665
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.250
I mean the cooling mostly comes from age two.

666
00:43:56.251 --> 00:44:00.750
So you have two electrons because if two protons are HD,
so it's again,

667
00:44:00.751 --> 00:44:03.930
it's a little bit better than that but,
but you see the difference,
right?

668
00:44:03.931 --> 00:44:07.860
So as soon as you have even a few atoms in there,
they radiate away,

669
00:44:07.861 --> 00:44:10.680
which means I send out photons that that can,

670
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.580
that can leave the gas cloud and Poof,
you're energy gone.

671
00:44:14.581 --> 00:44:17.040
So this is some critical medalists city.

672
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:22.130
So critical amount of elements that you need.
It's very,
very low.
But really,
um,

673
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.050
um,
asha is in this,
this,
this transition.

674
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:34.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

675
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.670
<v 3>Please correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

676
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.910
but I imagine that what you see in the spectrum is,

677
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
is basically determined by the composition of the surface of the star two.

678
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:49.020
What do we know to what extent that matches the distribution of elements and the

679
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:49.854
whole star?

680
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:53.310
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a great question.
Um,
and that's always a concern.</v>

681
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:56.880
So that's why we have to make sure that we catch the stars in the ride

682
00:44:56.881 --> 00:45:01.460
evolutionary phase.
Um,
to back up a little bit.
Uh,

683
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.510
people have done for a long time actually that was the beginning of astro

684
00:45:05.511 --> 00:45:10.380
physics with a computer.
They have calculated the evolutionary paths of stars.

685
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:13.300
So stars evolve,
they get born.
Um,

686
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:16.870
they started to burn hydrogen to helium later on their burn,
um,

687
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:18.540
helium to heavier elements.

688
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:23.280
And so they as a whole sequence that also correlates to how the scar looks from

689
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:25.080
the outside.
It changes color,

690
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:28.500
it changes size as a function of what's going on inside.

691
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.810
And so we know very well at what time the,
um,

692
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.620
the star gets mixed and,
and,

693
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:40.380
and whether the outer layers actually realize what's happening inside.

694
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:42.630
So our stars,
um,

695
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.320
it's the case that the outer layers don't realize at all what's going on in the

696
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:50.050
center because they're just burning hydrogen to helium in the center and the

697
00:45:50.051 --> 00:45:52.170
outer layers really don't care at all what's happening there.

698
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.550
They had just sit there under store for billions of years because of their very

699
00:45:56.551 --> 00:46:00.360
slow evolution.
If we were to,
okay,
if we had let's say a 0.9,

700
00:46:00.361 --> 00:46:04.500
so I'm a startup would evolve faster and if we would see it today,

701
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:08.700
it would still be alive,
but it would have,
um,
it,
it,

702
00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.720
it would have already started to burn helium into carbon.

703
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.220
And in the process of that,

704
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:19.340
the star gets mixed and I'm carbon from the interior gets indeed transporter to

705
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:22.380
the outer layers so that we call that self in Richmond.

706
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:26.490
And that's also very interesting to study about Marcella archeology.
Uh,

707
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.870
that's a big no,
no,
because then we can't transfer any more.

708
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:34.620
What would we see today too?
We know what the composition was before.

709
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.453
<v 1>MMM.</v>

710
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:45.070
<v 3>My sister in law was a telescope driver at Kitt peak and awesome.
Would she,
um,</v>

711
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.210
often the scientists weren't actually necessarily there.

712
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:53.211
And I expect a lot of times as a scientist you don't actually have to ever get

713
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:56.970
near the telescope for these observations to occur.
How,

714
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:02.300
how frequently do you go and do you go for practical reasons or just because

715
00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:03.624
it's,

716
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.950
<v 2>well actually all of the above so it off.</v>

717
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.280
So it's two most telescopes these days have professional operators and the

718
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:15.720
astronomer doesn't even need to go there anymore.

719
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.010
Certainly all of the big ones except for the Magellan telescopes that I'm using.

720
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.930
They have the old school policy that if you want to take data you got a better

721
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:27.190
do it yourself.
And um,

722
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:32.450
for our discovery work that is actually very beneficial because I need to

723
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:36.220
inspect the data out right there and right then because you know,

724
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:39.820
the stars are not observable all night long because they are standing steadily

725
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:40.810
above my telescope.

726
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:44.680
They are moving and if I want to keep catching the star because it turned out to

727
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:47.680
be really interesting.
So we take a quick exposure first,

728
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:52.030
then we inspected because we all,
we only deal with Candida.
That's fine.

729
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.350
And so we then have to make the decision,
Yay or nay.

730
00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.660
So that has to happen fast.

731
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:02.700
If someone wants to take the data and then we would get it,
you know,

732
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.540
the next day and then we'll look at it.
It might not be observable anymore.

733
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:11.770
The weather,
my turn bad,
you know,
that kind of moment just kind of goes.

734
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:13.180
And so for us it's,

735
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.230
it's very good to be at the telescope and focus on how to present on that and

736
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:18.940
get our data.
Um,

737
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.630
now I traveled to Chile about two or three times a year.

738
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:28.040
It takes a long time to get there.
Something like 70 hours.
Um,

739
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:32.410
and I always feel like I need a vacation coming back because you work all night

740
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:35.600
long,
you have to swap,
switch 12 hours,
right.

741
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.350
Working from days and nights in between.

742
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:42.220
You have a night over flights down there.
Um,

743
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:46.660
so that's no fun.
But being there as a lot of fun and then having the data,

744
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:48.940
it's a lot of fun and,

745
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:52.810
but I do really think that it's important for at least every student to go to a

746
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:54.670
telescope wants to see the process.

747
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.820
But with all these big new sky surveys,

748
00:48:57.821 --> 00:49:00.400
people just don't know the data from the Internet.
Now.

749
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:05.460
And I have come across students who a don't seeing the data is real because it

750
00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:07.960
was downloaded from the Internet.
It was like feet.
Yeah,
sure.

751
00:49:07.961 --> 00:49:12.640
We can make fake data we have that has certain purposes.

752
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.750
Um,
but this the,
the basis,

753
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.170
I mean this as a scientist you,

754
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.450
your work is based on data collection.

755
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:28.900
<v 2>And that has been erased from astronomy,
downloading data from the Internet.</v>

757
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:32.470
It's not data collection,
at least not to me.

758
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.040
So that's another reason why I really enjoy going there because it brings me

759
00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:40.390
back to the root of my profession.

760
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:43.930
And one of the reasons why I wanted to become an astronomer on the first phase

761
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:47.530
and being on the mountain top and seeing the sun down and having the mountains,

762
00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:51.190
they had tinge in purple.
And having the night's sky above me.

763
00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:52.960
I mean that's just priceless on top of that.

764
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.510
<v 4>All right,
so I noticed you use heavier elements.
You won't say metals.</v>

765
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:13.210
Yes.
Because you're talking to the public and yeah.
Astronomers have hydrogen,

766
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:16.180
helium and then metals,
everything else.
Right.
I took that slide out.

767
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.580
I haven't caught a few slides.

768
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.860
You want me to elaborate or do you go into it in the book?
Yes.
Okay.

769
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:29.630
<v 2>Because I do believe that with sufficient explanation and motivation,</v>

770
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:33.650
um,
the public can understand a lot of details.

771
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:38.720
You just got to walk them through.
So what we're talking about is that,
um,

772
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.710
astronomy sound not chemist,
so we can do pretty much whatever we want.

773
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.430
And the universe is a complex and complicated place.

774
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:51.110
So a long time ago someone came up with a grandiose idea of,

775
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.010
um,
uh,
lumping all the chemical elements into one thing.

776
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.720
And so they called hydrogen because the universe is full of hydrogen x.

777
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.510
Then he'd him as the second most common element.

778
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.760
They call it a why and then all the rest,
that was kind of negligible.
That's z.

779
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:11.390
So if your dinner conversation ever go stale,
you know,

780
00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:15.740
just tell them what's the universe made of Xyz Hall.
Um,

781
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:20.990
so,
um,
we look for the stars with the least amount of heavy elements in them,

782
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:25.700
which means we look for Sas at our port in metals,
all of the elements.

783
00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:30.690
So we call them metal pastas.
So that's the jargon.
But I do use the,
um,

784
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:34.380
unless I give a long talk.
So in my hour long talks I do,

785
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.720
and putting the shorter ones,
I usually cut it out.
Thank you so much.

786
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:40.950
<v 5>Yeah.</v>
