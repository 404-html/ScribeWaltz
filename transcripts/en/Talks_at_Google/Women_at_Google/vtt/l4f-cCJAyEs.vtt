WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.010
Thanks very much for coming.

2
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:15.450
And I'm so excited that so many of you have the book itself in your hands.

3
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.400
We're ready.
That's a very thrilling for an author to say.
Um,

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.260
this is west credit,
long barrow in wheelchair.

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.850
It's a chamber too from the Neolithic,
the late Stone Age,

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.360
uh,
which makes it about five and a half thousand years old.

7
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.360
And I first visited this site when I was about 18 years old on a university

8
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:41.361
field trip and we walked up to the site and our chiefs has invited us to explore

9
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.864
it for ourselves.

10
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.470
So I went in and there's a 13 meter long passage into the earthen mound and it's

11
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.710
created from huge saws and boulders.
And as you walk in,

12
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.730
there were two chambers on each side and a fifth chamber at the very end are,

13
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:04.290
these were chambers that we used for burying men,

14
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.810
women and children from the Neolithic community,

15
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.810
but not in whole pieces of,
not as whole bodies,

16
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.050
but as disarticulated remains.

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.650
So there's been a lot of activity been done with the dead bodies before they

18
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:23.910
even reach the tombs.

19
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.120
They've been laid out or x car native and the bones had been picked clean by

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.960
birds,
by animals.

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.090
They've flashes rotted away and once the bones are scoured clean,

22
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.580
they've been collected up and placed into the tombs.

23
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.740
And it's thought that in the Neolithic,

24
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.970
the practice symbolizes that you stop being an individual.

25
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.030
If you stopped being Marianne,
you become part of the ancestors.

26
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.320
So walking into the tomb,

27
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:56.070
I had this knowledge in my mind that this is a tomb of the ancestors.

28
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.960
And admittedly you go in and you have a very visceral,

29
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.950
or I certainly did have had a very visceral response to the place.

30
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.300
You can almost feel the weight of the,
the earth and the stone above you.

31
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.790
It feels colder,
it's darker.

32
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:15.510
You go in and right at the very back I was looking and

33
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.180
admittedly my,

34
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.350
my first thought was this is a really cool,

35
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.090
spooky old too,

36
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.250
and then realize that I should probably have some slightly more enlightened

37
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:31.590
intellectual archeological thoughts about the site.

38
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.870
And as I was walking back out,
my tutor said to me,
Oh,

39
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:40.230
have you noticed,
notice these marks on the stone?

40
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.770
Just by the entrance and there were two parallel grooves in the rock and he

41
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:52.410
said,
these are created by late Neolithic people,

42
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.730
polishing ceremonial acts heads and the grooves that have been created by the

43
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.450
thousands of repetitions of,

44
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.860
of polishing a heaviest stone against the Sawson.

45
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.861
It's called a Polly Swann and it was used for that purpose before the stone was

46
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.070
brought to west candidate and incorporated into the team.

47
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.140
And this blew my mind to think that I,
I,

48
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.520
I kind of felt that I'd been at the beginning of history for this place,

49
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.580
that the start of the story and then realize that actually no,

50
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.340
there's so many more clues in,
in the very stone,

51
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.860
in the very fabric of the team around me.

52
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.390
I hadn't even noticed those marks on the stone.

53
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.800
And if I hadn't noticed the marks,

54
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.530
I wouldn't have known what they meant and what they represented.

55
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.600
And then back outside the team,
you're faced by this,

56
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.630
an enormous edifice of standing stones laid out at the front.

57
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.670
Some of them were original constructed when the team was first constructed,

58
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:58.570
about 36003000400 BC.

59
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.030
But some of them were brought much,

60
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:06.031
much later around 2000 BC when we're now in the bronze age as a ritual closing

61
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.820
up of the monument,

62
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.300
people came back to this side when it was already 1,015 hundred years old.

63
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.020
They wouldn't have known how old it was.
It would have just been there for ever.

64
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.070
And they ritually closed it up.
They filled it with soil,

65
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:26.020
but they didn't fill it with soil just from the,

66
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.500
from the ditch next to the next to the team.

67
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.240
It appears that they brought soil from different places and so the thought is

68
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:39.241
that this was a closing up for the whole community in a much broader area,

69
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.060
that people were bringing a bucket of soil to,
to add,

70
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.460
to seal up the ancestors and they put these huge stones as a symbolic and as a

71
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.010
very practical bar to entry.

72
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.410
The reason you can go in now is because it's since been excavated and so you can

73
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.790
wander in and kind of hunker down in one of the little chambers which had these

74
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:02.470
disarticulated remains.

75
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.110
But the other thing about West candidate is that when you step outside,

76
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:13.111
you realize just how important it is to understand a monument like this in the

77
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:17.500
context of the wider landscape.

78
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.150
How does it fit with the natural topography?

79
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.220
What views can you get from when you're approaching it from when you're standing

80
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.230
next to it,
when you walk around it?

81
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.810
How does it relate to the prehistoric Ridgeway and ancient trackway that runs

82
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:38.470
along the high ground on the other side of the valley or the bottom of the

83
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:43.240
valley?
There's a swallow head spring,
which is the source of the Kennett River.

84
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.830
Just opposite actually you can see on this,
um,

85
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.140
on this photograph there's Silbury Hill,

86
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.260
which is this huge monument that we'll talk about in a minute.

87
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:58.261
A huge circular mound on the next rise in the land,

88
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.380
there's a site called Overton down with,
um,

89
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.180
huge timber,
monumental circle structures.
No one's quite sure,

90
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.290
but they think it was possibly a burial site to start off with and then had

91
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:16.370
other ceremonial functions.
And you only understand west Canada.

92
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.560
When you look at it in its context,

93
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.860
when you look at it within it's place in the landscape.

94
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.700
And I realized,

95
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.350
and I think that was when the seed for this book book was planted,

96
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.410
I realized that if you know just a few of the things to look for,

97
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.740
if you have just some of the clues to spot in the landscape around you,

98
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.260
it starts to reveal a much bigger,
much more interesting story.

99
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.950
And for me that's incredibly exciting and hopefully lots of other people agree

100
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.570
because when you're standing there,
I think a lot of people,

101
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.640
west kind of long barrow is quite famous,

102
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.570
but a lot of people will see the brown sign,
they'll walk up,
they'll,

103
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:06.110
there's like a little information board with those slightly dodgy illustrations

104
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.370
and they don't really get much beyond that.
You kind of go,
oh,

105
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:13.130
it's all right and you stand on the top like I do and you take a picture and

106
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.964
then off you go.

107
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.370
But actually if you have just sort of some extra little hints about what to look

108
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:24.050
for,
boom,
suddenly you've added 6,000 years of history to the landscape.

109
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:26.000
You're looking at.
And not only that,

110
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.870
you can start to pick out how other people treated with landscape,

111
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.720
how farmers have respected this monument.

112
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.030
It hasn't been plowed out all that time,

113
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.020
partly probably because of the massive stones and they're a bit of a Schlep to

114
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.540
get out of the way.
But nonetheless,

115
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:45.260
you kind of start to tell the story not only of the origins of a site and a

116
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:48.260
monument,
but how it's been treated through history.

117
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.500
The book covers loads of stuff.

118
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:56.501
So I'm going to romp through a few little features and leave the rest for you to

119
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:01.980
do your own landscape spotting in your own good time.
Okay.
Quick Quiz.
Uh,

120
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.280
but it's not a test.
There's no follow up questions.

121
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.490
Who knows what this,

122
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:10.930
this cheer Mueller or there's a plural hair tumuli

123
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.760
Latin scholars,
monks g or archeologists and no,
no,

124
00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:20.840
no.
Yeah.
Earth mound,
earth mound.

125
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.390
It's from the Latin to Matt to swell.

126
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.310
So it's a mound in the flesh.
They look like this.

127
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:33.311
This is bond come down in Dorset and these are round barrows there from the

128
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:34.370
bronze age.

129
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.370
This is a time when they weren't doing the communal burying of the ancestors

130
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.860
though bearing individuals and normally you have one either buried or cremated

131
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:48.290
individual at the center of an earthen mound and then they've raised the mound

132
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.220
above them.

133
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.210
Sometimes you get additional cremations and burials kind of shoved into the

134
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:57.960
sides a bit like a team or a family grave where first of all it's one person's

135
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.960
grave and then you put,
you know,

136
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.130
grandma and Grandpa and when they've popped their clocks.

137
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.780
The thing about the barrows is that you get them in some extraordinary

138
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.810
formations.

139
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.100
This is wind sports stoke in Wilshire,

140
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.010
which is an extraordinary collection of Barrow's.

141
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:18.210
It's called the Barrow Cemetery.

142
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
There's over 30 actually and you can see that there are slightly different

143
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.070
shapes,
slightly different profiles,

144
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.510
and in Britain we have a good menu of Barrows.

145
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.760
You've got a a Bell Barrow,

146
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.050
which is amount with a flatbed on either side,
a berm,

147
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.250
so it kind of has the profile of a bell.
You have a bowl barrow,

148
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.680
which as you'd imagine,
looks like an upturned bowl,

149
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.980
but you also get weird ones like this one,

150
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.150
which is a source of Arrow where you've got an upturned rim,

151
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.250
like a cup of salsa salsa,
but it's slightly depressed or flat in the middle.

152
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.520
Now,
no one's really quite sure they was thought that,

153
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.070
well maybe if you get those slightly depressed or flattish barrows,

154
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:03.390
but it turns out that it was a barrow.

155
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:08.391
It's because the earth has been eroded away or plow down or dug out.

156
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.790
But actually this,
the earthwork,
the circular,
um,

157
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.330
edging has been retained,

158
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.080
so perhaps it was always intended to be flat in the middle.

159
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.970
Who knows what else might have been inside that circle of,
uh,

160
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.470
if you see a borough that has some kind of weird divot in the top,

161
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.480
it's probably not originally,

162
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:38.220
it's probably a sign that it's been excavated probably in antiquity.

163
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.710
There was a real trend.

164
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.740
There was a real hobby for digging into barrows in the 18th and 19th,

165
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:51.000
and probably early 20th centuries before kind of modern archeology really took

166
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:54.780
off and people were looking for treasure effectively.

167
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.440
They dug in and they knew from,
from workman and farmers,
you know,

168
00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:01.620
every now and then something weird had pop up or something shiny and golden.

169
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.720
So they dig in because they kind of thought,
well,

170
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:07.230
there must be burial mounds every now and then they would find gold or something

171
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:08.730
precious.
But most of the time,

172
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:13.380
actually what you'll get is a kind of a hastily written line in someone's

173
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.360
journal saying,
Oh,
we got to the middle of the,

174
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.030
and we didn't really find anything.
There's some burnt bone.

175
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.490
And so we threw that away and we carried on looking for the gold.

176
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.020
Oh Hudson hounds.
Because that is for a modern archeologists,
the treasure,

177
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.280
that was the burial.
That's the thing that we can now learn so much from.

178
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.450
So the ones that have strange divots in the top,

179
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.400
they've been excavated and some of the results of those expectations,

180
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:39.840
some of the fines,
some of the artifacts,

181
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:43.920
some of the bones will be available to view in local museums or online.

182
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.630
Those that haven't have either been excavated in modern times.

183
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.090
And so the backfilling has been done better.

184
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:56.091
So you can't actually see this sunken hole in the middle or far more likely

185
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.000
because there's a round barrow in every parish in the country.

186
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.540
There's thousands of them and they're just the ones we know about.

187
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:06.550
The must be loads that have been lost.

188
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.900
<v 2>Okay?</v>

189
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.000
<v 0>Loads of them haven't ever been excavated.</v>

190
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.010
We don't actually know what's under there.

191
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.740
We know what kind of type of monument is,

192
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.980
but we don't know what's under that or who's under there.

193
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.470
So the next time your I'm driving along or going for a walk,

194
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.920
look out for areas of otherwise cultivated land that have been protected.

195
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.270
So you might see a a plowed field,

196
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:36.190
but then there's a kind of a square of grass with a bit of a mound shape in the

197
00:12:36.191 --> 00:12:37.010
middle.

198
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.110
That's because the round Bairos or scheduled monument and so it can't be plowed.

199
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.130
And so if you see a weird patch of grass in the middle of a field,

200
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.120
you show your landscape spotting air should be picking up,
oh,
what is it?

201
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.110
What could it be?
What can I see?
What sort of profile?
If it's a foot path,

202
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.520
have a walk around.
See if you can see any ditches around it.

203
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.220
Normally there was a ditch that and circled the mound.

204
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.620
Now you might not actually be able to see an actual ditch anymore,

205
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.260
but you might be able to tell in terms of the difference of vegetation because

206
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.320
even though these were created four to three to 4,000 years ago,

207
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.170
there's still differences in the soil structure.

208
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.280
And so different plants will prefer to grow in the ditch soil.

209
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.140
You might get greener grass,

210
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.180
you might get taller grass and you might sometimes feel it a little bit softer

211
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:32.360
and Wester underfoot
the raw.
However,

212
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.340
as is always the way with landscape spotting loads of red herrings for your

213
00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:40.700
mound hunting.
These anyone know what these are?

214
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.180
[inaudible] not archeological.
They are moraines that a glace your feature.
Uh,

215
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.520
and these are at the top of miles Dale had in the late district,

216
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.480
the effectively created by class year chuntering down a valley and dumping

217
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.240
gravel out of the bottom and then over a thousands or thousands or tens of

218
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.310
thousands of years.
Um,
they've,
they've crossed over,
they've smoothed over.

219
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.380
So if you see this,
you go,
oh,
looks like a Barrow Cemetery.
It's exciting.
It's no,

220
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.330
probably not.
If you're at the bottom of glacial valley,
probably not.

221
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.550
You also get kind of longish ones,

222
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:24.930
lateral moraines where the gravel has been dumped out either side or drum lens

223
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:28.260
as well.
So they look a bit like long barrows.
But again,

224
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.500
if you're in a glacial landscape then be wary.

225
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:38.250
This is Silbury Hill,
which is opposite west at long Barrow and wheelchair.

226
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.480
If you want a day trip to go and visit some amazing brushy archeology out of

227
00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:47.370
London,
I would say go to wheelchair.
You could even bypass Stonehenge.

228
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.960
Stop and have a quick look to,
but actually goes to west Kenneth Long,

229
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.093
go to Avery,

230
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.640
go to Silvery Hill and you've got a really fantastic world class.

231
00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:01.670
It's so,
but as part of a world heritage site,
and rightly so,

232
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:07.390
Silbury Hill is the largest manmade mound in Europe.

233
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.720
It's estimated to have taken about 4 million man hours of labor and it comprises

234
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:19.250
about half a million tons of chalk and soil.

235
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.610
We don't really know why it was constructed.

236
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.030
It was built in about 2,400 BC.

237
00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:32.170
So just at the cusp of the turning point from the,

238
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:37.150
from the stone age,
the late stagnation,
and they're lytic to the bronze age.

239
00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:42.151
So the introduction of mixed metal working different cultural practices in terms

240
00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:44.860
of the burial,
you've moved away from communal,

241
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:48.990
you've moved towards individual burial suggests that actually does it.

242
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:53.991
A different power structure in society that it's not about the ancestors,

243
00:15:54.071 --> 00:15:58.060
it's not about communality.
It's not about shared ownership necessarily.

244
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:03.010
It might be more about hierarchy and wealth of individuals and strength and

245
00:16:03.011 --> 00:16:07.210
power of individuals.
And when you look at a monument like this,

246
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:10.390
it's possibly also about mythmaking,
about individuals.

247
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.600
The king from which we are all descended.

248
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.800
The one who was here way before us,
who was my tia,
he was greater.
Who was,

249
00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:22.390
I don't know,
Demi.
God,
we don't know.
We have to fill in the blanks now.

250
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:24.850
The archeologists,
they don't know.
No.

251
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:28.660
Only we can only we can gas or what it is.
That's not true.

252
00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:32.020
We can all gas because if you,
you know,

253
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.590
feed yourself with the pieces of information,
filling in the blanks,

254
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.430
making that leap of imagination is something that we're all entitled today.

255
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.400
The weird thing about Silver Hill is that they thought it was,
um,
the,

256
00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:49.401
the kind of the folklore story is that it was king cell with a golden chariot in

257
00:16:50.441 --> 00:16:52.150
the middle.
Um,

258
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.010
auntie's horses and king cell in his golden chariot did not appear when they dug

259
00:16:57.011 --> 00:16:58.750
into the mountain,
they tried to dig in from the top.

260
00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:01.930
They tried to dig in from the side and then in the 1960s,

261
00:17:01.931 --> 00:17:06.790
they tried to dig in from the other side and it was only in 2007 the English

262
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:09.610
heritage when,
okay,
we think that the,
you know,

263
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:13.330
it's kind of a bit EDM cheese and though we need to sort this out and fill in

264
00:17:13.331 --> 00:17:14.780
the holes.
Um,

265
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.950
so they excavated and what they discovered was that it's a,

266
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:19.930
they confirmed his date,

267
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.890
but what they also discovered is that it started off as quite a small mound.

268
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.170
It seems to start us off.
There's like a regular round barrow.
And then went poof,

269
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.980
ran by Ron Steroids.
No one really knows why.
Uh,

270
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.760
and it's,
it's yours to explore and wonder.

271
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:38.420
<v 3>Okay,</v>

272
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.140
<v 0>there are loads of other mounds in Britain.
Britain is full of lumps and bumps.</v>

273
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.640
This is a mot,
uh,
in Oxford.
It's um,
uh,
Norman mot.

274
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:51.641
So they were raised by the Normans after the 10 66 conquest as a kind of short,

275
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:54.720
sharp,
we're now in charge.

276
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.600
This was actually built in the middle of the Saxon town,

277
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.730
so people would have been cleared out of their homes and probably enslaved to

278
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:07.290
provide the labor,
the pure grunt work.
And you'd have a Bailey,

279
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.910
an enclosure around the outsides and then a mot this earthen mound,

280
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.730
nice sharp sides,
flat top,

281
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.440
and you put a wooden structure on top to fit,
very defensible,

282
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.390
not very comfortable.
Um,
and they think probably flat packed.

283
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.110
They think that Norman Norman's were great.
They were very well,

284
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:33.030
they were great at fighting and invading me can debate the morality.

285
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:38.160
Um,
but they were really great at,
at kind of doing a kind of big push.

286
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.270
And so what they would do was establish a perimeter,

287
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.100
very much like modern military.
Now establish a perimeter,
defend the perimeter,

288
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.820
and then you can build within,
and this is not just about might,

289
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.380
it's also about defensibility.

290
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:57.890
And the reason they used flatpack sort of prefab pieces is that they could move

291
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.280
their bits of castle to the next hotspot.

292
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.400
So much like modern military,

293
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.480
you get your kit to their front line,
you establish a perimeter,

294
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.960
you establish your defenses,
and then you can do your,
were patrolling,

295
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:16.200
policing and um,
smiting from there.

296
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.220
And then,
um,
how many of you have driven up and down the a 40.

297
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.400
Does this look familiar as you're driving out towards the turnoff for Heathrow?

298
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Three four huge hills come into VA that you driving out of London there on the

299
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:40.470
left,
they're called North Arla fields and they are monumental mounds,

300
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.180
but they weren't constructed in pre history.

301
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.200
They were constructed not that long ago from the remains of the Wembley Stadium

302
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.330
and the foundations of the Westfield shopping center.

303
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.170
As far as we know,
there's no one buried under there.

304
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.770
Okay.
Um,

305
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.310
how many of you go walking ever wandering up hills?
Yeah.
Oh,
Yay.

306
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.593
Um,

307
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:15.470
you walk to the top of a hill and you see a can amount of stones.

308
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.120
Some of them are navigational cans,

309
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:20.070
so when you're stopping her standing at the top of stuff,

310
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:23.340
they'll pike and you know,
you don't know quite which way to go.

311
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.460
And you see a bit of a can through the cloud and the fog in the snow.

312
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:29.610
In the mist.
Yeah.
You're on the way.

313
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.350
Some of them are walkers cans where they might not actually be that much use

314
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.700
navigationally speaking.

315
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:40.080
But everyone who's tracks up there sort of sees amount and you can't help.

316
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:44.070
It's human instinct to pick up a stone and stick one on top.
I've been there too.

317
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.240
But underneath some them are the remains of,

318
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:51.880
again,

319
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.880
pre historic burial monuments because in the lowland areas where you've got

320
00:20:57.521 --> 00:20:58.001
soil,

321
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:02.620
people would construct an earthen mound in the upland areas where young goal,

322
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:06.400
how much soil people would construct the same mound,
the same monument style,

323
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:07.234
but they'd use stone.

324
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.620
So you get a can of burial can now the thing that you're looking for the next

325
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:14.020
time you try and look to the top of a hill and you kind of go,
Ooh,

326
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.170
is this a archeological can or just a canny can on an ordinance survey map.

327
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.440
If you see that Gothic type face that Chimi Alice was written in,

328
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.880
then indicates it's an archaeological feature that someone has gone along,

329
00:21:27.881 --> 00:21:29.890
surveyed it and said,
yes,
this is a thing.

330
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.230
It's not just a mound because a farmer wants to put a silo on top or someone was

331
00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:38.980
digging sand and that's the quarrying remains.
If it says it in Gothic type face,

332
00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:43.690
it's archaeological.
If it says to Mueller's,
then you know it's a burial mound.

333
00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:47.140
If it says Ken in Gothic type face,

334
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.370
then you know it's a burial.
Can an archeological ancient can.

335
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.950
It's exciting because sometimes you get really cool little insights.

336
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.350
Sometimes you've got a modern can hiding under a

337
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.830
title in totally,
um,
uh,
hiding what,

338
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.150
what prehistory might be underneath,
but sometimes not.
This is,
um,

339
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.870
ne Fan.
Oh,
I can't ever say Brackney og.

340
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:22.630
Forgive my pronunciation in the Brecon beacons and actually can see the remains

341
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.380
of what would have probably been a standing shelter of stones.

342
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.670
And in the middle a stone kissed a stone box in which,

343
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.070
um,
cremated remains would have been placed.

344
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.610
So next time you're at a can or a kind of a weird collection of stone somewhere,

345
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:44.680
look on the ordnance survey map.
If it says that it can is marked,

346
00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:46.630
then you're looking for archaeological evidence.

347
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.220
Look to see if you can see any evidence of curb stones that mark out the

348
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:55.510
original circle that that encompassed the monument.

349
00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.580
Look for anything that's depressed and any stones that are laid down vertically

350
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.190
into the earth because they might be the remains of a Kest.

351
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.200
And if you see big stones like this,

352
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:10.201
you may be dealing with the remains of what was some kind of chambered monument

353
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.500
that was then covered by earth.
So those documents,

354
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:18.160
I don't know if you've seen dolmans where you've kind of got like an improbable

355
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.530
capstone balancing on verticals.

356
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.350
They would probably have been mostly covered by earth.

357
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.770
And what remains is the stones.
But some,
I like this,

358
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:30.340
the earth has gone or the earth probably wasn't ever there because it's upland.

359
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:34.660
So it would have had a stone capping and larger stones to create some kind of

360
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:38.770
central box.
But this is what we're,
this is what we're left with.

361
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.370
Okay,
let's talk trees.
Um,

362
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.190
London is really good for ancient trees actually.

363
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.600
You've got high Gatewood in the north,
you've got Epping forest,

364
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:48.680
absolutely fantastic.

365
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:52.850
And the woodland trust actually have an ancient tree database with more than

366
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.960
110,000 ancient trees,
which is pretty cool.

367
00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.920
If you see any fat old trees that they don't know about,

368
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.390
then tell him cause they want to know about them.
Um,

369
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:11.240
in ancient woodlands,
however,
what you're looking for is signs of modification.

370
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.730
So in Highgate word and Epping forest,

371
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.080
you're looking for three key ways that the trees have been modified.

372
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.760
The first on the top is a coppice.
Uh,

373
00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:26.761
so you cut a broad leaf tree down low at the base and it encourages it to shoot

374
00:24:27.081 --> 00:24:30.680
new growth.
So from one root base,
you get lots of trunks.

375
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:35.780
Now what your looking for our trees with sort of a glove,

376
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.620
a fingers of,
of um,
trunks that have all grown up.

377
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:44.621
Because what we're looking for is a medieval forestry practice that has

378
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.990
effectively been stopped in time.

379
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.950
Ancient woodlands in Britain are officially designated if they've been

380
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:59.021
permanently wooded from 1,680 in England and Wales and 1750 in Scotland.

381
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.760
That's not because Scottish trees grow incredibly differently.

382
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:07.490
It's just because of the records that are available.
So they went,

383
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.580
oh well we can't get further back then.
1750 so we'll,

384
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.270
we'll just make our peace with it being ancient if it's,

385
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.010
if it's been there since 1750 but when you're looking at copies trees,

386
00:25:19.011 --> 00:25:22.490
now there are actually modern woodlands,
which are still using these techniques.

387
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.440
They're very good for woodland management,

388
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.110
but when you're looking for ancient woodlands,
you'll,

389
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.340
you'll see kind of big trunks or coming out of one root base.

390
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.950
That's the sign of a capias that has been left to grow out.
It's been neglected.

391
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.810
These ones here.

392
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.280
This is a Paul od ancient woodlands in Medieval Times,

393
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:48.050
through the Elizabethan times and on up until the modern times,
rarely were very,

394
00:25:48.051 --> 00:25:51.830
very hard working parts of a land management system.

395
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:53.870
They weren't for walking the dog and you know,

396
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:58.871
building dams they were for producing valuable timber and firewood and fencing

397
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:04.910
and food for your animals,
uh,
for digging,
um,

398
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.140
uh,
resources that you'd need at home.
Uh,

399
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:13.330
so a lot of woodlands were also used for grazing animals on the understory.

400
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:19.040
So if you had your copies to trees and then you had,
um,

401
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.860
there perhaps coming in or cows,
um,

402
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.890
they would eat all the new sheets and you weren't actually end up with any

403
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:27.850
timber.
So what people would do was Pollard Pollard.

404
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.450
So you let the tree grow up two to three meters high,
sometimes four meters,

405
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:36.410
which is quite high.
And then you lop it off and encourage that new growth.

406
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:41.580
So you get a polo like this,
this is a weird hybrid called a cop hard,

407
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.470
uh,
which is you copy this,
you let it grow up and then you,
Paul odd.

408
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.430
So they call it a cop hard.
What you're looking for,
as I said,

409
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.470
are the fingers of trees.

410
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.860
And you'll probably also see thing fingery trees near to large standard straight

411
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:04.220
grand trees.
And they called them maidens and Highgate woods.

412
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.850
A fantastic example.

413
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:10.851
You've got oak standards and you've got horn beam corpuses and they're really

414
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:12.960
fun to spot.

415
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.550
I went out with my nephew who's five and we wandered around the woodland and we

416
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.190
wandered around looking for three years and for us,

417
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.930
which a cop says and Warner's,
which are oak standards.

418
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.340
And we were talking about what the timber would have been used for in a time

419
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:33.780
before steel in a time before plastic.
So we worked out and he ran around.

420
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:34.650
He absolutely loved it.

421
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:38.340
He ran around the forest looking for three years and for us that were used for

422
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:43.050
fences and houses.
And he used Warner's,
what are they for ships?

423
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.300
Kings ships,
ships.
One is houses and fences,
three of them for us.

424
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:49.134
And,
and it was,

425
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.190
he's five and he was doing landscape spotting and then we ran around more and we

426
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:55.680
found them an earthen bank.
Uh,
would bank,

427
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.430
which would have marked out a distinguished,
uh,

428
00:27:58.431 --> 00:28:02.520
an area of woodland that would have been managed slightly differently to the bit

429
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:04.550
next door.
Um,

430
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.610
when you're hunting out ancient woodlands,
um,

431
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.990
look also at place names as well.
Um,
Holly trees,

432
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.130
what often used for feeding cattle in hard winters,

433
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.290
so names with Hollins indicates a standard Holly trees that would have been

434
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:26.850
useful if you're actually looking for ancient trees.
However,

435
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:32.090
don't look in ancient woodlands because ancient woodlands where so heavily

436
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:37.671
managed that no one ever let a tree grow to a great age because at a certain

437
00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:41.820
point,
an ancient tree becomes hollow,
it starts to decay,

438
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:43.380
bits of it starts to fall off,

439
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.470
the canopy starts to retrench and it becomes a fantastic resource for wildlife,

440
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.360
but not that great for timber.
If you're looking for an ancient tree,

441
00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.050
look in states,
the kind of larger states,

442
00:29:00.051 --> 00:29:01.980
state,
Holmes,
dear parks,

443
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.060
places that perhaps once would've been wooded pasture,

444
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:12.180
um,
like bits of apping like Ashra gestate in Hartfordshire,

445
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.810
this magnificent beasts does on authors dike.

446
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:20.280
So it would have been used as a boundary marker.
Okay.
Uh,

447
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:25.340
what is the best way to age and ancient tree without chopping it down

448
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:33.000
and it guesses,
yes.
Girth.

449
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.620
What's the most fun way to measure the girth of a tree?
Hugger it

450
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.460
with oak trees that are free growing free standing so they haven't been copied

451
00:29:43.461 --> 00:29:45.180
or anything like that.
Um,

452
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.660
bearing in mind that your arm span is about the same as your height.

453
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.910
So based on being one half meters tall,
two hugs of an oak tree,

454
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.020
130 years old.
It's not ancient.
Yeah.
Three hugs,

455
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.280
250 years old.

456
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.940
That means that the oak tree is now officially ancient.

457
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:11.810
There are oak trees in Britain that they think are over a thousand years old,

458
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:16.020
which is extraordinary and they are monsters,
absolute monsters.
And it's,

459
00:30:16.021 --> 00:30:19.500
it sort of feels like a privilege to be in their presence and think about what

460
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.060
history they've lived through.

461
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:26.610
But oak trees on the grand scheme of ancient trees are kind of the babies.

462
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.260
They don't really last that long.

463
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:34.050
All things considered you trees are the granddaddies of the mall.

464
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:39.530
You trees are the longest living organisms and Europe and incredibly,

465
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.790
this still blows my mind.
Um,
the oldest oak tree,

466
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.870
you trees in Britain and uh,
we've got the oldest,
uh,

467
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.480
you trees in the whole of Europe.

468
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:57.170
The oldest you trees are between four and 5,000 is old and the three oldest

469
00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:03.210
which are named in the book all in church yards.

470
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.040
Now they obviously massively predates Christianity.

471
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.660
They predate the churchyard,

472
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.950
but there's a very strong connection in Britain with you trees being in church

473
00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:16.500
halls and graveyards.
No one's quite sure why.

474
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:19.340
There were lots of different theories,
but the,

475
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.540
the most water tight theory is that you trees were considered sacred in some way

476
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.340
by pagan native British religions.

477
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.110
And so when the early Christians turned up in the fourth and fifth centuries,

478
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.490
they appropriated pagan sites because they were pretty clever and went,
okay,

479
00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:41.010
well we'll keep the sacred site,
we'll just change the gods.

480
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.100
And you trees came with the,

481
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.580
came with the landscape and you trees are actually fantastic in terms of the

482
00:31:49.831 --> 00:31:53.070
symbolism.
It fits really well with Christianity because when you cut them,

483
00:31:53.071 --> 00:31:56.910
the SAP that comes out is red.
It looks like they're bleeding red,

484
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.670
they're evergreen.
So you can link it into notions of everlasting life.

485
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.290
They've got red berries,

486
00:32:04.291 --> 00:32:07.890
which medieval people would link to the drops of blood that Christ when he was

487
00:32:07.891 --> 00:32:12.780
crucified and they never die.

488
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.150
And so it's a kind of,
it's a,

489
00:32:15.151 --> 00:32:20.151
it's a really powerful way of expressing everlasting life and the church being

490
00:32:20.701 --> 00:32:21.960
the way to achieve that

491
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.440
briefly because I've got like two minutes left.

492
00:32:27.441 --> 00:32:30.260
I've been chatting on about mountains,
too much stumbling stones.

493
00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:32.780
Everyone loves a good all stumping stone.
You get them in circles,

494
00:32:32.781 --> 00:32:35.510
you get them in rows.
Dot.
Most really good for stone rose.

495
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.840
And you also get single standing stones,
monoliths.

496
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.760
This monster is called the roadster and monolith.
It's in Yorkshire.

497
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.130
It's 7.6 meters high.

498
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.150
And surveys have shown that there's as much stone under the ground as there is

499
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:53.300
above,
which is pretty,
pretty cool.
Uh,

500
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:57.860
it's about 36 tons and it was probably dragged about 40 miles.

501
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.230
They're not really sure.
Um,

502
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.830
the reason that it's called [inaudible] and the whole village is called roadster

503
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.480
is because of this stone.
The original name was rude,
stone,

504
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:13.550
rude being,
uh,
an old English word for cross.
And the reason it's got this,
um,

505
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:19.060
led capping on the top is because at some point someone drilled a hole into the

506
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:24.490
top of the monolith and stuck her across in the top and it was used as a site

507
00:33:24.491 --> 00:33:29.210
suffered gathering,
uh,
open worship,
so rude cross stone.

508
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.630
It's the name of the village,
the stone as named to the village.

509
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.040
The other weird thing is that it's about four meters away from the edge of the

510
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:41.420
parish church.
And so they respected the standing stone,

511
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:43.020
which is prehistoric and,

512
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.550
and it must have really edged around it and not knock it over while they were

513
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:50.120
constructing the church.
But it just indicates just how important,

514
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:54.050
how powerful sort of pre historic monuments are really.
Even now,

515
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.880
I like hugging,
hugging a standing stone is a thing of great joy for me.

516
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.830
Um,
the one on the right,

517
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.180
the Toblerones shape or the shark's tooth is on the outer Hebrides,
uh,

518
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:08.360
near Lewis.
It's near Callanish,
which is also really,

519
00:34:08.361 --> 00:34:12.380
if you want a fun archeological trip,
I'd say go to the outer Hebrides or uh,

520
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.740
the Orkney islands,
the outer Hebrides.
You can fly in from Glasgow.

521
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:16.940
It's British Airways flight,

522
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:21.500
but you fly in and he landed on the beach at low tide on the island of bearer.

523
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.480
It's really fun when you're looking at standing stones.

524
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.270
Again,
you're trying to work out what's the significance,

525
00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:31.640
why is it here and what does it all mean

526
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:37.580
and to work out whether it's prehistoric,
prehistoric standing stone.

527
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:42.290
First of all,
look for evidence of vertical weathering.

528
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:47.660
If it's been standing upright for three,
four,
maybe 5,000 years,

529
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:52.130
you'll see vertical erosion from where the rain has hit and run down.

530
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.830
If it's been raised more recently,

531
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.920
who might seem much smoother look for edges that appear to have kind of a

532
00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:06.311
machine cut or bedding that suggests that it's more modern and then also look

533
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:12.860
out at the landscape is in conjunction.

534
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.590
Is it in some kind of connection with other monuments,

535
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:20.591
with other ancient or prehistoric features in the landscape or as,

536
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.590
as I sort of memory memorably.
Notice once a in a,

537
00:35:24.591 --> 00:35:26.390
in a patch of whales can't go,

538
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.720
oh standing stone in that field and kind of trundled over to have a look at it

539
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:33.080
and then realize that there was actually a standing stone in the next field and

540
00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:35.810
a standing stone in the next field and they all happen to be in the middle of

541
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:36.650
the fields.

542
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.350
And I realized that they were capital cattle rubbing stones for the cows to

543
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.280
scratch their bottoms on so that they wouldn't knock over gate posts.

544
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:46.950
And I thought,
oh well it is a standing stone but it's not,

545
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.570
not the standing stone.
And I was thinking it was going to be,
oh come on.

546
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.960
So I haven't,
I haven't touched on half of the stuff that's in the book.

547
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:02.610
You can entertain yourselves in your own leisure for pub names.

548
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.600
The reason we started off with medieval ale stakes and then ended up with

549
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:09.800
hanging pup signs that you'll sometimes see curling ivy or,

550
00:36:09.801 --> 00:36:14.801
or kind of pretty metallic grapes laid over why you have red lines and black

551
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:20.280
boys and golden dare and Golden Hines,
uh,

552
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:25.310
y you can stare at a cottage and work out when it was constructed and how it's

553
00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:26.340
been modified.

554
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:31.430
You can go to a pub in Suffolk and look for the Malian holes in the windows from

555
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:35.310
the original timbers when it was created as a medieval hall house.

556
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.970
You can wander through field systems like this and puzzle out how it was farmed

557
00:36:41.521 --> 00:36:45.690
and what significance it has.
And the next time he walked past a dry stone wall,

558
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.520
have look at how it was constructed.
If you see a hole at the base,

559
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:55.200
then it might be used for sheep,
for the shepherds to push the cheap three.

560
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.000
And that's called a lung keyhole.

561
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.510
So there's really cool bits of Trivia in the book.
Um,

562
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.060
but hopefully my,

563
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.180
my aim is to share that passion,

564
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:11.181
to get outside and to explore and to discover for yourself and to stand in the

565
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:16.311
landscape and wonder what is it that I'm looking at and what does it tell me

566
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.450
about the story of the countryside around me.
Thank you very much.

567
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.800
<v 2>[inaudible] we do have time for questions.</v>

568
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:38.510
<v 4>Hello.</v>

569
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.980
So looking at excavating mounds and the like all their mounds that you think we

570
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:46.400
should not excavate simply so there's something for the next generation to

571
00:37:46.401 --> 00:37:47.600
either explore.

572
00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.710
<v 0>That's a really good question.
Um,
archeology,</v>

573
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.960
archeological excavation is inherently destructive because you dig into it and

574
00:37:56.961 --> 00:37:59.300
then it's not there anymore.
And how of much he preserved.

575
00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:00.950
There's stuff you're going to lose.

576
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:06.580
And some of the antiquarians back in the 18th and 19th centuries did a terrible

577
00:38:07.971 --> 00:38:11.690
job and we're just looking for treasure.
They were effectively nighthawks,

578
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.820
but others were doing the utmost within the terms of,

579
00:38:15.821 --> 00:38:20.420
of that era to be a scientific and rigorous as possible.

580
00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:22.760
And so you get really beautiful patterning sketches.

581
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.300
But for a modern researcher,

582
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.110
that's not always that useful because you've lost all the organic remains.

583
00:38:30.111 --> 00:38:33.080
You haven't got any samples that you can date.

584
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.380
You haven't got accurate records of what was where and how it was aligned and

585
00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:42.490
associated with all the other things.
So I think it's,
it's,

586
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.880
it's inevitable that people in the future,

587
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.910
we'll look at the excavations that people are doing now and go,

588
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.830
what the heck were they doing?

589
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.030
They just have no idea how much material and how much information they were

590
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:57.440
losing.
So I think it's,

591
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.000
it's definitely advisable to not dig it all up just because we can,

592
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.110
well actually we can't because it's expensive and we haven't got any money.
Um,

593
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.800
but nonetheless,
money not withstanding,
it's,

594
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:12.100
it's valuable to leave stuff as aes.

595
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:17.610
And the growth in archaeology now is in non destructive techniques.

596
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:23.160
So gout,
ground penetrating radar imaging techniques from,
um,

597
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.470
from aerial images.
Um,

598
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:30.220
we can record artifacts much more carefully now with photogrammetry where you're

599
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:32.440
creating a kind of three d point clouds.

600
00:39:32.441 --> 00:39:35.110
So you get absolute accuracy of information.

601
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.340
Dating techniques are coming on a pace as well.
But again,

602
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:41.110
if you want to radiocarbon date something,

603
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:44.680
you have to drill a hole into it and take out a sample.
So again,

604
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:49.420
you kind of have to choose what questions you want to answer.
Yeah.
So yeah,

605
00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:50.980
leave some of it alone.
I think,

606
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.620
<v 5>hi,
you talked about a couple of databases,</v>

607
00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.480
but I'm wondering on the whole how well recorded in database this stuff is.

608
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.500
Um,
and I guess I'm thinking from you know,
maps and apps sorts of point of view

609
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.210
<v 0>there.
There isn't a really good app,</v>

610
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.990
there isn't a really good app where you can say,
you know,

611
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.840
I kind of a Shazaam for archeology where you go,
what is that?
And it will go,

612
00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:14.021
well,

613
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:18.760
your hair and this is that there are databases now that are being developed by

614
00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:23.560
um,
uh,
historic Scotland by historic England,
um,

615
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:27.160
where they've brought together the historic environment records sites,

616
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:28.000
monuments records.

617
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:32.830
So these legal documents that schedule a monument as well as,

618
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.350
um,
surveys and the information,
um,

619
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.330
that is attached to that they are accessible.

620
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:45.610
Most of them,
they're all free to access,
some of them are online.

621
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.620
The search functions aren't always great.
You might miss stuff.

622
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.110
But more and more they've got interactive maps.

623
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.230
So if you actually know about heritage gateway,

624
00:40:56.231 --> 00:40:58.510
if you actually know about past escape,

625
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.190
you can go and find the stuff.
I think,
um,

626
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:04.870
the,

627
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:09.870
the problem is the general public don't necessarily know about it and it might

628
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.960
be slightly overwhelming to start off with cause you have to kind of do a bit of

629
00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:14.651
wandering around.

630
00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:18.760
So to work out what it is you're looking at and to kind of read through the

631
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.540
archeology,
ease to understand what is,

632
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.900
what is it that that's telling me this is a burial mound.

633
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:30.370
It's from the Bronze Age,
which is 2,400 BC to about 800 BC.

634
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.530
This is probably what's inside it.

635
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.320
These are the excavations or surveys that have been done now go and have a look

636
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:39.950
at it and find out these features and these features.
That would be fantastic.

637
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:40.880
It doesn't exist yet.

638
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.480
<v 6>Any more questions?
Yeah,</v>

639
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.930
I would guess that some of these features like the medieval tree management

640
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:54.300
would be common to sort of most of question Europe.
Um,

641
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.110
other things that are specific to Britain,
barrow shapes or anything like that?

642
00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.380
Yeah,

643
00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.820
<v 0>yeah.
Boroughs,
we tend to share chambered,
barrows,
chamber teams and,</v>

644
00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:07.870
and long borrowers we tend to share with the Atlantic seaboard.

645
00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.570
So the western coast,
so you get them in,

646
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.280
in western Spain and bit support school,
you get them across up three,

647
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:20.260
um,
the western coast of France and Germany as well.

648
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.480
Um,
the,
some of the medieval,
um,

649
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.400
land management systems are quite specific to Britain.

650
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.660
So we had great field systems that were very,

651
00:42:34.661 --> 00:42:36.390
very elaborate and wealth,
um,

652
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.810
sort of managed in central and southern counties.

653
00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.670
And actually when you see,

654
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.200
if any of you've ever seen those fields of like they look corrugated,

655
00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:51.670
they've kind of got those ridge and furrow running along and it's normally

656
00:42:51.671 --> 00:42:55.480
undergrad class and they're the evidence they had the remains of medieval

657
00:42:55.481 --> 00:42:57.610
plowing that has been then turned over to grass.

658
00:42:57.611 --> 00:43:00.550
And so those kinds of corrugations have been preserved.

659
00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.840
Now the reason that there's such big wide ridge and furrow compared to like a

660
00:43:04.841 --> 00:43:09.841
modern plow foro is because these fields were farmed community,

661
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.700
but different families have different strips.

662
00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:15.160
So you'd have the strep and I'd have this strip.

663
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:19.150
And then in the next great field you'd have a couple of strips and I'd have a

664
00:43:19.151 --> 00:43:22.390
few strips.
And so the land will be shared out between the whole community.

665
00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:26.470
So it'll have some good stuff,
some bad stuff.
Um,
we'd worked together,

666
00:43:26.471 --> 00:43:29.320
but we'd effectively plumber farm our own little bit,

667
00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:34.530
but they weren't fields with hedges and fences like we imagine now they were

668
00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:39.230
introduced in the,
some team 50s to 17,

669
00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:44.231
18 is primarily as an act of parliament when they were in closing common land.

670
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.810
So that's a,

671
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:51.460
that's a kind of a mass change that we've got the remanence of these medieval

672
00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:54.680
plowing systems.
But you've also got the parliamentary enclosure fields,

673
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.890
those lovely straight rectangular fields.
What we kind of imagine as the,

674
00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:01.390
you know,
green and pleasant lands that we've all come become accustomed.

675
00:44:01.391 --> 00:44:06.391
T is actually a function of a historical change that was massively traumatic for

676
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.840
a huge swathe of the population because they were booted out of land that they'd

677
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.510
lived on for ever.
Um,

678
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:20.140
and there was a huge depopulation of the countryside because these new private

679
00:44:20.141 --> 00:44:23.380
landowners who would then fence off bits of land,
um,

680
00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:27.640
would chuck the peasants off.
They put w we'll put sheep on top,
you know,

681
00:44:27.641 --> 00:44:32.640
sheep required to shepherds,
whereas farming community,
hundreds more people.

682
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.640
So,
um,
yeah,
so that was a really good one.
Um,

683
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.530
in terms of like special British things,
crook frames are really good as well.

684
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:40.831
You know,

685
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:44.040
when you look at the end of an old cottage and you see the kind of the curved

686
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:48.870
beams that's been split from an Oak,
the same oak,
so you kind of get,
um,
normally,

687
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.270
um,
you get a kind of a,
a mirror image that,

688
00:44:53.271 --> 00:44:56.760
that quintessentially British as well and wield and whole houses,

689
00:44:56.761 --> 00:45:01.530
if you want a trip to can't go and have a look for Wheeldon hall houses,
um,

690
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.220
which are really distinct and incredibly old.

691
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.250
They used to be like the stately homes of their day and now they look like kind

692
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:11.420
of slightly tumbling down cottages,
um,
with uh,

693
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.430
jettied first floor and you would have had a central area with a kind of an open

694
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:19.740
fire.
And the gallery for the servants and then,
uh,

695
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.030
kind of the top table up to the left.
The Deus.
Yeah.

696
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.960
So there's some,
there's some,
yeah,
really specific British things.

697
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.320
If you go up to Scotland actually get infield outfield farming systems,

698
00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:34.140
that picture of Wasdale,
that's the lake districts,

699
00:45:34.141 --> 00:45:38.880
but it's a similar system because obviously the,
the,
the fell side,
so,
uh,

700
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:42.720
quite,
quite hard to farm the quiet.
Um,

701
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:47.670
there's not that much return on them.
You can't cultivate them.
But the,

702
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:53.030
the valley floor is fertile ish if you clear the stones away and you work really

703
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:57.390
hard to nourish the soil over generation after generation.

704
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.010
And so the community hair,
before they broke it up into these tiny fields,

705
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.133
um,

706
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.440
would have an infield set of him fields which were heavily farmed and heavily

707
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:10.170
manured and then outfields that will be left fallow.

708
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:13.890
So they'd be used on rotation and then the fell signs would be common grazing.

709
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.220
And in the late district,
do you think of it as a very natural environment?

710
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:21.900
It's still grazed by Communists who get an allowance of sheep that they can put

711
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:25.980
on the fall side.
And that's why we've got the landscape we have today.

712
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.170
That's why you've got those green and pleasant valley's,

713
00:46:28.171 --> 00:46:32.910
I'm those what nominally appeared to be kind of barren fell sides.

714
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:36.660
But the herd sheep that live up there a perfectly attuned because they've been

715
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:40.170
there since the vikings.
Probably the vikings probably brought Hardwick's

716
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.810
<v 7>I've a question.
Well,
so when you go and explore the British landscape,</v>

717
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:51.050
do you just think I want to learn something about this area and then you just go

718
00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:56.061
there and have a look or do you study maps and look at what exactly do you want

719
00:46:56.341 --> 00:46:57.210
to find and see?

720
00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.530
<v 0>It's um,
it's a bit of both really.</v>

721
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:05.390
Sometimes you can do some fantastic landscape spotting in the pleasure and

722
00:47:05.391 --> 00:47:08.150
comfort of your arm chair with a laptop.

723
00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.330
You don't even need the paper maps anymore cause it everything's digitized.

724
00:47:11.331 --> 00:47:15.290
And you can look on the heritage records and you can cross reference and some of

725
00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:17.480
the old map,
um,

726
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.450
map systems have been digitized as well.

727
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.430
So you can cross compare modern ordnance,
survey maps,
Google maps,

728
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.160
Google earth is fantastic because you can kind of get a real sense of what,
what,

729
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.660
how things fit together in a way that you can't when you're on the ground

730
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.970
looking at human level.

731
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:42.390
Actually sometimes that aerial perspective just lets things fall into Fordham's

732
00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:46.300
place.
And obviously with,
with smartphones and IPADS,
you can tablets,

733
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:50.320
you can do that in the field as well,

734
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.400
which is really fantastic.
Um,
there are,

735
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.430
there are certain places that I kind of thing I want to go and see that and I'm

736
00:47:57.431 --> 00:48:02.260
going to go and explore.
Um,
and places that I like to go back to again.

737
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.460
So kill Martin Glenn up in Scotland is,

738
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.400
is a fantastic valley that's absolutely stuffed,
full of amazing.
Um,

739
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.140
prehistory history,
British rocker.
Oh,
that's another good one.
British walkup.

740
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.110
Really Weird,
quite subtle,
very,
very unique to Breslin.

741
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.560
Um,
but,

742
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:24.490
but then there's other places where you kind of just wander along and you see

743
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:28.250
stuff and because you've got half an idea of what your,

744
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.270
what you could be looking for,
what questions you could be asking.

745
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.980
When you stumble across something,

746
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:37.981
you can sort of do that wondering and wondering and start to try and puzzle out.

747
00:48:38.021 --> 00:48:42.650
You might not come up with a black and white binary answer,
but for me,
the,

748
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:46.180
the,
the joy is in the adventure of discovery,

749
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:50.290
not necessarily coming up with a kind of definitive answer and you can always go

750
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:54.670
back home and a check.
See what else other people have found out about the site.

751
00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.820
<v 8>Any more questions?
Yep.</v>

752
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:01.800
Thanks.

753
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.000
Have most of the ancient sites in Briston pretty much been discovered and,

754
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.210
but pretty much using that book I will find things that are relevant.
Okay.

755
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.540
<v 0>No,
there's still more to be discovered.</v>

756
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.220
They found him a s a whole stone circle upon Dartmore not long ago.

757
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.330
And there's a,

758
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.200
it looks like there's a kind of a whole crescent of stone circles and it was

759
00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:22.330
under the pizza.
There's loads of stuff under Pete.

760
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.700
There's loads of stuff under thick vegetation.

761
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:30.030
There's a chap up in Scotland who discovered over the course of I think 15

762
00:49:30.311 --> 00:49:34.090
years,
he's found more than 2000 panels of British Waqar.

763
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.610
So these are carbon ring marks,

764
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.820
the engravings into either earth fast boulders or outcrops of stone and you get

765
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:46.720
like a little divot,
a cup,
and then you get a concentric circle.
The ring,

766
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.820
sometimes you get multiple rings,

767
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:53.140
sometimes you get a groove that joins the rings or a gutter that comes out from

768
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:55.790
the middle.
We don't really know why they were used.

769
00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.730
They're constructed in the late nail ethic on the Bronze Age.
Maybe it was,

770
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.480
um,
they don't appear to be maps of any description,

771
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.900
but because they're um,
but they're not colored.

772
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.270
They may have been colored at at one point or another.

773
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:15.510
They may have been used to pour liquid onto oil or blood or milk to catch in

774
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:20.680
some way as a kind of reading of the future or perhaps as part of a ceremony.

775
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:24.760
Other people have said that actually it's the grindings of the stone that were

776
00:50:24.761 --> 00:50:28.240
possibly the special thing.
And what we're seeing now is sort of the,

777
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.930
the cast off that just,
you know,
the empty shell of,

778
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:35.300
of what was left behind and they've taken the good stuff away,

779
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.460
but we consider it rock arts.
It seems significant and special in its own right,

780
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:45.790
but because it's normally quite low and it's quite subtle and sometimes you can

781
00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:49.700
only see it if you get one of those like brilliant when today's,
you know,

782
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:54.050
really bright sunshine but the sun is low and so you get a real kind of cutting

783
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.810
across you,
you things stand out much more clearly.

784
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.330
So there's definitely more to be discovered and every now and then,
um,

785
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.810
things will be rewritten,
uh,
uh,

786
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:08.210
because of fines and discoveries that amateurs have made

787
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:15.780
<v 9>time for.
One more question.
Yep.
Any other organization,
uh,</v>

788
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:19.910
organize the archeological tours,
like say for amateurs,
not for professionals.

789
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.070
Works.

790
00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:25.760
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
there's a really good,
um,
organization called,</v>

791
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:29.800
um,
Oh God,
what are they called?
Dig Ventures.
Yeah.

792
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.530
Dig Ventures who,
um,

793
00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:37.100
crowdfund archeology dates and they've got a virtual,
uh,

794
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:41.780
dig so that you can,
if you can't get to the site and be part of it,

795
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.400
then you can kind of follow along.

796
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:48.730
And they're really hot on sort of incorporating photogrammetry imaging

797
00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:52.340
techniques so that it's as,
and then they open source,

798
00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:56.900
publish all their findings.
So they're really good.
I'd definitely recommend them.

799
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.290
Um,
and I'm also going to be doing some archeological walks as well,

800
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:04.580
doing one in Ilkley.
If anyone fancies a trip to Yorkshire,
I'm on my website,

801
00:52:04.581 --> 00:52:07.730
Mariano hearts.com.
Yeah.
Yeah.

802
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:12.590
It'll clean if you want to come and see some rock art march.
Ilkley it's nice.

803
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.030
It'll really fun.
Anyone been?
Yeah,
it's good,
isn't it?
Yeah.

804
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.800
<v 9>All right.
Thank you very much,
Mariana.
Hot Tub.</v>

805
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.630
<v 2>Thank you.</v>
