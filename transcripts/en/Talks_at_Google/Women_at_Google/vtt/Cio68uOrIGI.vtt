1
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.220
Very good afternoon everybody.
Um,

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.670
I want to talk a little bit about the last six years off my life and how it

3
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:19.620
happened that I came to India.
So first of all,

4
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:24.300
I want to show you a small video that shows the environment in which I spent the

5
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.610
last six years of my life.

6
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.213
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.273
okay.

8
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.283
Yeah.

9
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.313
Okay.

10
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.453
Yeah.

11
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.720
Okay.

12
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.750
<v 1>So now the question arises,
why,</v>

13
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.840
why did I live,
uh,
my job,
my family?
Uh,

14
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.010
a good life in the capital of Germany,
Berlin,
uh,

15
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.850
to live in a tiny little remote village in Raja,

16
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.020
Stan,
uh,
to coach and teach the children of the village.

17
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.130
I was always very adventurous.

18
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.450
I love to travel and I come from a very sports related family.

19
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.250
My grandfather,
my grandmother,
my uncle,
my Auntie,
my mother,
my father,

20
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.860
my whole family was engaged in the local sports club.

21
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.260
We all grew up in a volunteering in the Sports Club,

22
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:02.920
in coaching and playing different kinds of sports.

23
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.510
And so it was in my blood and I am what I am today because of sports.

24
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.780
Um,
I started my own travel agency,
uh,

25
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.920
so that I could travel all the time.
And,
uh,

26
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.410
one of my favorite destinations was India.

27
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.460
I was always traveling around looking for new places where I could bring my

28
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:25.630
clients off the beaten track to show them the real country.

29
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.910
My business partner came from Jaipur and his mother came from a little village,

30
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.090
which was halfway between Agra and Jaipur.

31
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.860
So we thought it would be a good idea to bring our clients for a lunch break to

32
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:43.540
a little Indian village,
show them the real village life,
traditional life,

33
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.440
colorful life,

34
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.710
and a host them for a lunch break are maybe the kids of the village could show

35
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:54.460
their village and the local family could have some extra income.

36
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.890
So the family lived in this,
uh,
ruined Ford.
They were the,

37
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.060
uh,
former rulers,
the rush foods of the village.
And,
uh,

38
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.490
I started dreaming of maybe I could teach them some hockey.

39
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.300
The village kids,
they have nothing to do.
And uh,

40
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.290
maybe we could have some space in front of the Ford where we could start

41
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.910
coaching.
So I shared my dream with the local family and they will say,
yeah,

42
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.100
you can have the space in front of our Ford.

43
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.660
We don't use that and you can try.
So in 2010,

44
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.800
I was hosting a veteran's hockey team from Vienna,
from Austria,

45
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.790
and we brought some hockey sticks and we had a training session with the kids.

46
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.830
And um,
so the kids were so excited and then I started dreaming that your,

47
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:45.580
this would be a great story if I,
if I could make a difference in that village.

48
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.780
So obviously my business was still in Germany and uh,

49
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.190
I could only coach them once in a while when I was in India.
Otherwise,
uh,

50
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.090
nothing much happened in the village.

51
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.320
So I tried to hire volunteers from Germany who could bridge the gap,
uh,

52
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:04.180
when I was not here,
but that somehow didn't work out.
Then I thought,
okay,

53
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.780
maybe I could run my travel business online and I could sit in that village.

54
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:12.100
Maybe I would have less clients than before,

55
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:17.101
but I would need not so much money to survive here and I could coach and teach

56
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:21.520
the kids.
So I gave everything up in Germany.
I sold everything.

57
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.550
I closed my office and a reconstructed two rooms in that old fort.

58
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.083
And uh,

59
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.120
I called a roller and attractor and we leveled the ground here in front of,

60
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.120
uh,
the fort and be called the kids for practice.

61
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.390
I went to the local schools and I wanted it to especially encourage the girls to

62
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.210
play hockey with me.
And uh,

63
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.810
I brought sticks and I coached them for a training session and I invited them to

64
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:53.050
come in the afternoon after school,
uh,
to our hockey ground.

65
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.710
And I also try to offer them English classes because I didn't speak Hindi,

66
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.450
they didn't speak any English.
So the mode of communication was very basic.

67
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.220
There was a old temple and uh,
the family provided me one room,

68
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.500
which we use just an open air classroom.

69
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:13.670
And I started giving English classes where some of the kids would show up in the

70
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.890
afternoons.
But I realized that,
you know,

71
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:20.690
that traditional Indian schooling system with kids happily repeat what you tell

72
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:23.450
them what their brains are not working anyhow,

73
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.130
that doesn't work much and they don't learn anything.
So we started,
uh,

74
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.890
speaking on the hockey grounds.

75
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:34.370
So actually all the kids learn speaking English while playing.

76
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.080
This was our village hockey ground.

77
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.680
We made a boundary wall around and it was very dusty,

78
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.540
especially during the hot summers.
It was almost unbearable,

79
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:51.020
but the kids would show up every day and they didn't mind.
And,
uh,

80
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.530
so we had a kind of time sharing agreement with the local cows,

81
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.010
which would rest on that place while we were not playing.

82
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.110
And so the kids always tried to sneak in late because the first one who came had

83
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.910
to remove the remainings of the cows.
And,
um,
so yeah,

84
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.830
um,
we had so many kids that I could not,
uh,
make,

85
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.040
uh,
like get hold of them and they were very wild.

86
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.020
So I started learning the colors in Hindi and I bought tee shirts in different

87
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:25.280
colors so that I could say the Biela group is there,

88
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.230
the Lal is there,
and it's a fetus over there.

89
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.440
And I got some older students of the village who helped me in coaching in the

90
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:33.854
beginning.

91
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.060
So I try to make them understand and also for me,

92
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.450
uh,
don't dream your life.
Live your dream.

93
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.860
So then after one year practicing,
uh,

94
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.600
I showed them the movie check to India.
They got very fascinated.

95
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.640
That was a funny story because,
um,

96
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.120
I bought her old screen and a beamer and invited the kids to watch with me the

97
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:04.330
movie and you know,
bought,

98
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.240
we brought the cables out of the Ford and there was some power cuts obviously

99
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:09.810
also.
And uh,

100
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.860
we had to show the movie when the sun was almost going down so that we can see

101
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:19.871
the movie and we put some chairs up and kids were sitting on the ground and I

102
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:24.170
was fascinated watching the movie and I was so excited about my idea.

103
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.670
And after half an hour,

104
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:28.790
I looked around and only the farmers were sitting here around me because the

105
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:32.060
kids already went home because when,
when it's getting dark,

106
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:36.500
they all have to go home.
So yeah,
so they only saw half of the movie.

107
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.260
Nevertheless,
they got very much inspired and they said,
Andrea,

108
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.460
you also want to play.
So my friend,
he was the hockey coach and the DPS,

109
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:47.150
a school in Jaipur,
and they invited us for our first match.

110
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.550
So we went by train to Jaipur,

111
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:52.700
which was already the first big excitement.

112
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And I feel so privileged I could share all these first moments with the kids.

113
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:00.060
You know,
they saw the big city,

114
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:04.260
they asked me and the rear hole do go Obera like how,

115
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.350
how they can go up these huge buildings and how there's all this traffic works.

116
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:13.440
And uh,
the first time in their life they were wearing sports shoes,

117
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.820
shin pads,
socks.
So,
uh,
John Do,
my local partner and I,

118
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.550
we was sitting next to each other.
One was putting up the socks,

119
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.720
one was putting inside the Shin pads and then be sent them on the ground.

120
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.510
And the,

121
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:30.360
the whole stadium was full with a privileged children invite school uniforms.

122
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.130
The green grass was,
wow.
They've never seen such a grass in their life.

123
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.740
And we realize that,
uh,
you know,

124
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:41.970
we were quite malnutritioned compared to the city children,

125
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.750
which were according to the coach,
the same age group,

126
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:49.530
which I don't agree.
But yes,

127
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:53.670
this was the next lesson that we had had to learn.
Life is not fair,

128
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.400
especially when it comes to sports and competition.

129
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.790
I had to learn my lesson the hard way in India.
If it's under 14,

130
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.190
it's maybe under 70.

131
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.050
So then I thought,
uh,
my project needs more awareness.

132
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.780
I need to raise funds so high,
I'm going to do this.

133
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.060
So I have to roam around the country.

134
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.480
So I bought a wig shop and I drove from j port two tonight,

135
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.050
2000,
400 kilometers in 30 days.

136
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:34.980
And I can tell you it was the best way to know the country.

137
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.360
Every hundred kilometers,
different de different food.
Um,

138
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.100
the people were so friendly and welcoming.
I had to,

139
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.790
I had to drink chai with each and everybody.
Everybody wanted to know like,

140
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.120
what the hell is that white woman doing in [inaudible]?

141
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.390
And we had a two meter hockey stick a on the roof.
Um,

142
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.130
so we'd be promoted.
I mean,
we didn't raise any funds to be honest,

143
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.180
but it was a great experience.
And we were in some newspaper highlighted and uh,

144
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.300
you know,
there was some awareness of the project,

145
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:10.590
at least it was a great experience to drive all along the country.

146
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.950
Yeah.
So it,

147
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.100
I try to encourage the kids that you have to sit in the driver's seat of your

148
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.470
car,
of your life.
Uh,
it villages,

149
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.880
they are only driven by the village society,
by their parents.
They do what they,

150
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:31.320
what the parents want.
And uh,
uh,
later on they do a job,

151
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.580
which they don't want,

152
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:36.330
but the parents wanted or the neighbors want other whoever wants but not them.

153
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.920
So sports teaches you to be self confident to understand what you want in your

154
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.730
life.

155
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.380
So then obviously the girls also wanted to play and my focus was anyway,

156
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:50.490
on the Gus,
uh,
the problem was just that they're scored any forms.

157
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.770
The skirts were quite long,
so it was very difficult to run.

158
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160
And a regular hockey skirt would be very brave for a village girl to wear that

159
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:04.690
was too short.
So then my fashion design diploma came into,

160
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.620
uh,
accounts.
So I got,
uh,
uh,

161
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.680
tailoring machine and I tailored hockey skirts,

162
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:14.360
which were a little longer then a,

163
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.970
the regular hockey skirts and the girls loved them.

164
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.470
And I always had my silver suitcase where I put all the socks.

165
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:28.471
She embeds just a shirts and skirts and we would travel with the train.

166
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.420
This time we went to Hariana and the girls had their first match.
But,

167
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.254
uh,

168
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.390
that was again a very enthusiastic from my end because it was,

169
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.110
I think it was April made was like 40,
45 degrees.

170
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:48.700
It was burning hot and we had to wait for them at Dt,

171
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.740
which is more important the longer you have to wait.

172
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.020
So the first children already fainted because of the heat.

173
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.310
And,
uh,
we finally had then our match.
And um,
this is,
uh,

174
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.540
my daughter Cavita so I took care of her.

175
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:12.541
She didn't have a mother and I brought her the best Puma shoes from Germany and

176
00:13:12.921 --> 00:13:16.420
she said under the two tight,
she wanted to play bare feet.

177
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.820
She was the wired Jangle Kitschy,
wanted,
uh,

178
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.660
to play bare feet as per her convenience and not with my good sport.

179
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.820
She was that I brought for her.
Then,
uh,

180
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.410
we played our first all India,
Katie Sing Babu under 14 tournament,

181
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:33.191
which is by the way,

182
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:38.191
the only under 14 tournament where really under 14 team sampling in Lucknow and

183
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:43.610
they had a really,
really good sports canteen.
So in Roger,

184
00:13:43.611 --> 00:13:44.320
Stan,

185
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.320
most of the families are vegetarians and it's even you're a bad person if you

186
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:51.820
are a non vegetarian.
So I'm from Germany,

187
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.880
I am a non vegetarian so that was always some blame to put on me or a bad

188
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:01.690
influence that I have on the children because I'm eating non which,

189
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.150
so this is [inaudible],
he was our goalkeeper,

190
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.230
he was the smallest of all and he saw all the other teams eating eggs for

191
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:12.910
breakfast and butter and everything.

192
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.910
And he was asking me and the year if I eat eggs I get strong.

193
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.580
You can try.
So he was,
he went to the buffet,
he got one egg.

194
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:29.460
The whole team was watching him.
He survived the egg and all,

195
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:32.440
all the others.
One by one also took one egg.

196
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:36.040
By the end of the tournament everybody had four eggs for breakfast.

197
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.300
And since that time it was always our secret.

198
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.120
If we went out for tournaments together,

199
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.210
the first question was and three of eat omelet.

200
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.470
So they knew that this is something good but they are not allowed to eat this at

201
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:51.801
home.

202
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:56.630
And somebody was even asking me if his mother can smell that he eat eggs

203
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.110
there was literally scared.

204
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.640
So we always extended most of the time we were out in the first round on

205
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:11.810
tournaments because we were the youngest.
But to get more experience,

206
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:16.010
I always ask the organizer if we can stay some two,
three days longer.

207
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:16.843
First of all,

208
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.940
you travel all the way for one match and then the food is so good and they don't

209
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:28.070
get that kind of food at home.
Plus if they watch matches,

210
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.310
they also can learn a lot.
So we always extended are staying.

211
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.770
We had lovely food everyday.

212
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.530
This was the narrow cap in daily where they together with all the state teams,

213
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.790
we're doing the march pass and you can see here our hand painted flag and the

214
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:51.460
kids were thrilled.
They flood light book,

215
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.140
astroturf.
ASTROTURF in Delhi.
Wonderful.

216
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.500
Yeah.
So if you have a dream,
sky's the limit.
Then,

217
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.970
uh,
the next,
uh,

218
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.880
crazy thing I did was I imported a secondhand astroturf from Germany.

219
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:16.100
And,
uh,
it was quite,
uh,
an action because it was the first,

220
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:20.540
second hand astroturf that came to India and nobody at the customs knew how to

221
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:21.374
handle that,

222
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.940
how to evaluate a secondhand as sort of from Germany and how much tax I have to

223
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:29.270
pay.
So after I overcame this,

224
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.480
the huge drag with the astroturf turf came from good shot at port to register.

225
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.630
And we had a huge party and I thought like,
wow,
my dream is coming true.

226
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:41.510
We haven't astroturf.
I made it happen in Roger's done.

227
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.330
There are only two asset person.

228
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.480
I have number three and I can make this happen for these children.

229
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.280
And we had a huge party and it was nice and great.
And the next morning,

230
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.560
eight o'clock,
Saturday,
one of my girls called me and she said,
Andrea,
please,

231
00:16:57.561 --> 00:17:00.920
you'll come to the ground polices there.
There is a problem.

232
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.890
Okay.
So we went to the ground,
the ground where it was already going on.

233
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:11.630
It was a government project and the sports ministry sanction money,

234
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.340
everything was Nice,
huge stones blocked the entrance,

235
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.910
the Sour Punch was sitting there on a plastic chair and around 300 villages with

236
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.400
a singing freedom fighter songs and glitchy go home.

237
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.140
Today she's ruling the hockey ground tomorrow she's ruling India.

238
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.570
We don't want history to repeat itself.

239
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.470
I thought like this,
are they talking about me?
What does that mean?

240
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.200
Truly the hockey ground.

241
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.490
I signed that this astroturf will be government property and I donate to the

242
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:53.700
community.
All I want is that these kids can play on an astroturf.

243
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.660
So I had to load my astroturf again,

244
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.250
rescued to another place and store it somewhere.

245
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.880
So the dream of the [inaudible] was on hold.

246
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.640
Then I thought,
okay,
if my kids cannot play in Rancho Santa Ana Astroturf,

247
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.840
I bring them to Germany.

248
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:19.490
So I took five boys for two month in the summer holidays to Germany where they

249
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:23.430
stayed in German families for two months,

250
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.890
had lovely German food and uh,
played in a German club.

251
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.630
And surprisingly,

252
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:35.631
they could compete with the kids or their age group and they got so much

253
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:40.761
exposure and so much learning for their future life that nobody can ever do for

254
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:44.280
them in their life again.

255
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.510
So they came back and everybody was thinking that maybe,

256
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.820
maybe they don't want to go back,

257
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.470
but they were so bonded with their families and their,

258
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.650
so we're so proud to tell all their stories and bring all the chocolates home

259
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:03.651
and in all benefit from their experience and tell everybody and uh,

260
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.080
motivate or the other kids so that there was a big battle for the next year that

261
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:13.230
who would be the privileged ones who could come with me to Germany.

262
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.730
So since that time,
every year we select some children,

263
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.320
the best ones who are present in practice,
good in studies,

264
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.610
good in hockey and good attitude,
good discipline.

265
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.590
And we take them to Germany and we find a lot of sponsors in Germany who support

266
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:32.640
this hockey clubs,

267
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.820
who hosts them and who find this a very great idea to integrate them in their

268
00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:42.540
teams.
So Deepak,
my so called son,

269
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.920
he was the lucky one.

270
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.920
He even went with me to Switzerland and he was so amazed that these cows give 40

271
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:53.190
liters of milk while he's buffalo at home,

272
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:57.570
gives maximum one liter,
which is enough for a cup of Chai for his grandfather.

273
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.880
Then,
um,
I thought,
okay,
sports is good,

274
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:08.030
but I should involve myself more in education because that is what counts at the

275
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:13.170
end.
And I'm out of that old temple.

276
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.610
We made a school.

277
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.840
So I had German volunteers with me and with our own hands,

278
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.760
we knocked down walls and ceilings and the whole village was standing outside

279
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.470
watching us how these white people can do this labor work,

280
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.190
which is actually the lowest level of work that you can do.

281
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:36.600
And we were working hand in hand with the local laborers who earned like 250

282
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:39.540
rupees a day.
And we had a lot of fun.

283
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.720
We had a lot of fun to build a school with our own hands.

284
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.780
And we started the first English medium school with,
uh,

285
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.850
our little ones.

286
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.100
So I want to show you a small video from our school,

287
00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.060
how we tried to teach the village kids and a state of the art way.

288
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.223
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

289
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.363
Yeah.

290
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.493
Okay.

291
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.183
Yeah.

292
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.030
<v 1>Yeah.
So our school was a primary school,
English medium,</v>

293
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.270
Elica [inaudible] class one,
two,
three,
and four.

294
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.390
Unfortunately.
Uh,

295
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.740
we also had to shut down that school,
um,

296
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.460
April of this year because our local partner misused foundation money and,

297
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:24.574
uh,

298
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.690
we bought land to lay out that astro turf where you saw that where the kids were

299
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:33.130
playing.
We already made a concrete base to final delay or that,
uh,
astro turf.

300
00:23:33.131 --> 00:23:36.880
So the dream was a little closer.
Um,
but,
uh,

301
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:41.881
the local partner registered the land in his name and we had to file a big case

302
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.503
against him.

303
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.840
And the result was that he was threatening all the children and um,

304
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.770
was beating them up in school.
Uh,
whoever came for practice.

305
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.680
So out of 80 children who were daily therefore practice,
uh,

306
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.610
who played for the district,
who played for the state,
uh,

307
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:01.580
nobody was allowed to come anymore.
Um,

308
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.650
we didn't get any support from the parents.
And,
um,

309
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.730
we were raising the question that,
uh,
you know,

310
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.730
we can only work and continue if you stand by our side and if you understand

311
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.340
what this project is all about.

312
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.730
And only one family was standing up and they were even from the neighboring

313
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:26.780
village.
Uh,
so we decided to leave this place.

314
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.590
We got threatened for our lives and,
uh,
there was no way to continue.

315
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:36.190
So we got an offer from Cork where there is obviously more awareness about

316
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:43.070
sports.
Um,
and we thought that maybe we have a better start there.

317
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.450
Uh,
it was a big decision to,
you know,

318
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.220
get all the energy again together and all the motivation and overcome,
uh,

319
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.490
the bad experience and struggle and loss,
uh,

320
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:59.300
that we were facing and registered and start again.
But we said,
okay,

321
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:01.670
we do it for the children.
And,
uh,

322
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.730
we packed a truck with all our belongings,

323
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:11.771
mainly hockey equipment and school equipment and we have two Labradors.

324
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.540
And so my husband and I and the two Labradors,

325
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.080
we're in the truck and for 70 hours and 2,400 kilometers,

326
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.940
we were driving from jet water and Roger Stone to cook to set up a new hockey

327
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:34.650
village.
And uh,

328
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:39.670
since three months we are working with the local primary school grade one to

329
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.310
seven.
We coached them in hockey and uh,

330
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.880
we teach English and math for grade one,
two and three.

331
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.870
They're all children from the Labor for the,

332
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.030
from the coffee plantation laborers.

333
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.860
And we hope that we can make a difference there.
Again,

334
00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.180
I still believe that we made a difference in Retro Stan.

335
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.000
We left our footsteps behind and um,

336
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.230
we took three of the children with us,
uh,

337
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.960
each 15,
16 or 17,

338
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.260
she Vonnie got selected as the first and only girl from Ron has done for the

339
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:22.781
national academy and she is playing at the moment a senior nationals at the age

340
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:27.200
of 15 for other Stan.
And I hope she has a bright future.

341
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.030
And um,
uh,
Rohit is from Gore.

342
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.490
He lived with me the last three years in a row to Stan and I took him now to

343
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.090
cook.
He has a learning disability.
He's a,

344
00:26:41.091 --> 00:26:45.570
I'm suffering from legacy so he can't properly read and write.

345
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.950
But he's a brilliant Sportsperson,
a brilliant,
excellent cook.

346
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.700
And he's repairing each and everything.

347
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:58.701
He's making bamboo rafts and he's the king of the jungle and cook and Deepak,

348
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.810
he's 17,
he's also very good hockey player.

349
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:07.980
And he became our plumber and electrician because we live so far away in the

350
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:11.640
jungle that even if you call her an electrician or a plumber by takes 10 days

351
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:12.930
until somebody comes.

352
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:18.410
So he's keeping our activities alive by making Jugaad here and there.

353
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.350
And uh,
yeah.

354
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:27.351
So we brought these three kids from [inaudible] so this is what we could take

355
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:33.360
with us.
And still kids are calling us and asking us like,

356
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:36.610
when do you come back or do you open a new school?

357
00:27:36.611 --> 00:27:39.690
We want to come to your school.
So at least for the children,

358
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.470
I think we made a difference and uh,

359
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.230
we want to continue the same thing in cook.

360
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:47.730
So that is Shivani.

361
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:53.630
She came as the first girl to Germany two years back and she played an excellent

362
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.600
seasoned for one of the best clubs in Germany.

363
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.550
And so now we are thinking if we are going to bring her to Germany but we don't

364
00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:07.320
want to miss out any trial for her because you never know when any selector is

365
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.350
spotting her and inviting her.

366
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.620
Because last year the trial for the national academy,

367
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.860
she didn't manage to get a space because of all the struggles that we had in

368
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:20.790
retro style.
She didn't practice for some time,

369
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.300
but now in cooled we trained her well and she's fit and we hope that she has a

370
00:28:27.451 --> 00:28:31.960
bright future and will one day play for India.
So she was very easy going.

371
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:35.910
The coming from a village the first day,
uh,
in Germany,
she was very,

372
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:38.400
the hot pants of her,
uh,
German sister.

373
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:43.050
She was completely adapting to the German lifestyle,

374
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:44.850
which is very surprising,

375
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:49.320
but I think that gives her a really bright future because she's very open
minded.

376
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.600
Her English is pretty good.

377
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.000
She's doing now and our s means open schooling.

378
00:28:55.001 --> 00:28:59.970
We teacher at home and she's doing that in English.
All subjects she's doing,

379
00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:03.780
she's doing bio and chemistry and English,
and this is British.

380
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:08.810
He was three times in Germany and he got a job with the Thyssen Krupp elevators

381
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:15.660
in Jaipur,
even if he only has a Hindi medium,

382
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:17.480
12th grade pass.

383
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.270
But he was so motivated and Thyssenkrupp said,
okay,

384
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:25.830
he's so brilliant.
We take him.
Unfortunately,

385
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:30.780
his parents thought more of a government job and didn't allow him to take the

386
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:34.470
job.
Um,
well,
let's see.

387
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:38.370
Maybe he will fight his way through,
but he is a very,

388
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:42.280
very bright and brilliant,
uh,
child and he will make his way,
I'm sure.

389
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.451
Yeah.

390
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:47.560
So they will be a day in your life when you look back and what you did in your

391
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:51.940
life and didn't make sense.
Did it make any impact?
Did you make a difference?

392
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:57.210
And that was actually my motivation to start this project and to go ahead and

393
00:29:57.821 --> 00:29:58.541
ahead and ahead,

394
00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:03.541
because I think I cannot forgive myself if I stop because I think I can do more

395
00:30:04.311 --> 00:30:05.920
debate and encourage so many more children.

396
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.203
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

397
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.330
[inaudible].
