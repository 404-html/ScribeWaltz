00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.120
Good afternoon.
Welcome to talks at Google today.

2
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:15.140
It's my great pleasure to introduce local author,
local to Boston.

3
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.420
Heidi peddler.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for coming.

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.860
Hi.
Pleasure.
No,
our pleasure.
No,
mine.
Look,

5
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.810
we'll just go.
Actually this is Heidi.
Second time here.

6
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:33.870
She was here last week for David to cuff me.
Those are,
yes.

7
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.353
Um,

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.890
who they worked for nine years as an editor at Houghton Mifflin.

9
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.443
Um,

10
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.540
since then she's worked for another nine years as co editor of the best American

11
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.360
short stories of the year.

12
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.110
So you've probably read more short fiction,

13
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.130
at least American short fiction than anybody else probably anywhere can claim.

14
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.060
I hope

15
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.050
<v 1>so.
If anyone else has sort of reads and more,
I think they need help.</v>

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.650
I need help.
So they definitely mean

17
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.180
<v 0>she's a little sort of a fun time to wrote two novels,</v>

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.420
the birthdays and her most recent novel,

19
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.390
which you have copies of the day,
like marriage,

20
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:21.240
which are road and advance.

21
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.680
And I'm in another month or two,
I may recover from reading.

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
That's pretty strong stuff should be available only with the prescription or the

23
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:37.080
people
over.
I Dunno what 18,

24
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:41.910
16,
14.
It's um,
it's seriously,
it's powerful stuff.

25
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.770
So with no further ado,
Heidi,

26
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.220
<v 1>thank you again for having me.
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Um,</v>

27
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.100
I thought I would read,
well I'll,

28
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.150
I'll sum up the book for you and I thought I would read a few pages just to give

29
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:00.080
you a sense of it and then maybe we can talk about it or anything else you might

30
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:02.120
want to talk about today.
Um,

31
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.840
so this novel is about a married couple.
They've been married for a long time.
Um,

32
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.060
they have a 15 year old and an eight year old,

33
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.020
15 year old daughter named Janine and an eight year old son named Ethan.
Um,

34
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.690
their marriage has grown,
strained.

35
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.720
They are not super thrilled with each other anymore and the book starts out with

36
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:27.050
them getting into an argument,
a heated,
you know,

37
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.780
your typical married couple being pushed to the extreme argument.
Um,

38
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.940
so where I'm going to start is,
uh,
the,

39
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.080
the characters names are level level is the husband and Hannah is the wife.

40
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.180
Um,
they have just finished their argument.

41
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.460
Hannah has run off into the son's room.

42
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:50.980
Whose name is Ethan and I'm going to read,
um,
levels.
We're were,

43
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.000
we're level now.
Uh,
the aftermath of the fight,
the,

44
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.080
the moments after in his mind,

45
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.520
he faced pillow bunched into a ball and it's ivory case at the far corner of the

46
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.660
mattress,
the poison that they had kept stored away inside themselves.

47
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.610
This toxic stew that had expanded for years had finally boiled over and out.

48
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.290
Janine pushed the door,
open an inch and leaned her face forward.

49
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.820
She peered around the room,

50
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.620
her hair sat in a brutalized tangle at the top of her head.
You all done?

51
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.190
She asked.
Yes.
He said unable to face her right now.

52
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.170
Let's get you back to sleep.
You managed.
If he was able to seem calm and steady,

53
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:36.010
she might believe that he was,
I wasn't sleeping.
She said,

54
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.660
keeping herself behind the door as he approached.
Of course not,
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.710
That was no good.

56
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.430
He had learned that the more he tried to explain away their battles to her,

57
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.420
the worst they sounded.
Where's mom?
She asked.

58
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.510
Hannah slept in Ethan's room whenever he had trouble sleeping,

59
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:57.460
which was most nights probably in your brothers room.
Janine stuffed,

60
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.690
careful stepped carefully around the door and in front of him.
Is She okay?

61
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.410
She asked his daughter could be surprisingly maternal toward Hannah.

62
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.130
Your mother's fine.
He said automatically I'm fine too.
Yeah,

63
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.260
to not that she had asked.
He followed her to her bedroom.

64
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.550
He talked to her in,

65
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.570
although she flinched at his touch and then he sat beside her on her mattress.

66
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.760
At last she closed her eyes.
He stayed a moment looking down at his daughter,

67
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.160
the wisps of light hair across her temple.

68
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.280
Her lips barely parted as she lay there on her side.

69
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.000
She may not have been sleeping.
She may have been pretending,

70
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.500
but he did not say anything.
He was grateful that she allowed this right now,

71
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.990
that she was letting him just stay here and look at her.

72
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.500
The early days.

73
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.820
Those first few months of friendship when all that he knew of Hanaman row fit

74
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:49.930
inside a daydream.

75
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.400
She had grown up on Martha's vineyard and now lived alone and one of her parents

76
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.780
to off island homes if four bedroom brownstone on Clarendon,

77
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.010
we're a tree size grandfather clock stood guard just inside the front door.

78
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.620
She kept a rosewood box of verdicts,

79
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:08.680
honey caramel truffles on our coffee table at all times.

80
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.540
She collected antique glass perfume bottles that were rounded and spiny.

81
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.620
Swirled with primordial indigo and deep opaque emerald.

82
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.110
She was passionate about the red sox but hated the PA,

83
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.470
hated the Patriots and football in general.

84
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.910
She gave the impression of a swan regal but fragile,

85
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.360
lovely and thoughtful and capable of sudden wildness.

86
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.790
She was the most feminine,
self assured compelling female that he had ever met.

87
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.780
She called him one night with a ticket to a game against the Blue Jays.

88
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.770
The next afternoon my friend just backed out.
I'd have called you sooner.

89
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.780
She began,
he immediately accepted and because she had a car and he did not,

90
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.420
they agreed that she would come pick them up before the game.

91
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.830
The next afternoon she arrived at his apartment in Brighton wearing a ski.

92
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.110
Her next swaddled in lumpy Harry scarf.

93
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.130
Her nostrils were pink and inflamed and she sounded congested.

94
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.780
Had he missed it over the phone,

95
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.750
he let her inside and offered to make her some tea.

96
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.300
We don't have to leave the second,
do we?
He asked.
No,
she shrugged.
Not just yet.

97
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.600
He hung up her jacket while she unraveled her scarf.

98
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.750
He filled a mug with water and put it in the microwave.

99
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.120
They sat across from each other at the wobbly card table in his kitchen down the

100
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:29.390
hall.
His roommate,
Paul labored with his trombone scales,

101
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.250
unable to reach the higher notes.

102
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.860
Hannah's hair pulled down onto her shoulders and ran over her small breasts down

103
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:39.110
over her stomach,
stopping at her waist.

104
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.700
She had these light filled eyes and a black eyelash clung to the side ridge of

105
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:47.360
her nose.
She made considerable attempts to sniff back.

106
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.280
All that was inside her sinuses.

107
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.500
He went to find a box of tissues and when he returned he asked you,
sure,

108
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:59.060
you're up for a baseball game outside.
I'll be fine.
The season's almost over.

109
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.950
We have to go.
Thanks.
She said as she reached for the box,
she asked,

110
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:08.870
have you ever been in love her crazy questions always nonsequitors still

111
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:12.260
blindsided him?
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.

112
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.310
He said Paul groaned and started again at the beginning of the scale.

113
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.020
The microwave beeped and level found a box of Lipton that Paul's mother had left

114
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.330
on her last visit level,

115
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:27.140
set the mug down before Hannah and she brought it to her.
Mel for a dainty sip,

116
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.460
the table tottered beneath her arms and she wrapped her fingers around the Mug

117
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.200
to protect the teeth or her lap.

118
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.250
He found an empty box of frosted flakes with the recycling,

119
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.270
folded it into awkward fourths and jammed it under the shortest table leg.

120
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.840
Once he took his seat again,
she looked off beyond him.

121
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.640
So what exactly does it feel like?
He said at last,
Oh,
you'd know,

122
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.610
she said that's what they always say.
You just know.

123
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.850
He said the trombone grew louder,
a whiny,

124
00:07:55.851 --> 00:08:00.080
embarrassing little brother in the next room.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.

125
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.370
The first night I met him,
we slept together.

126
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.020
She said this jerk named Doug bone had been her fiance just a few months ago.

127
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.890
She talked about him a lot and the next night too,
she said,

128
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.060
I probably shouldn't admit that.
How to respond.
Anyway,

129
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:20.030
level had a chemical oceanography paper due the next day.

130
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.810
He should have been finalizing his isotope indicators,
proofreading.

131
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.260
He had a hundred things he should have been doing other than sitting here with

132
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:31.820
this girl.
She said,
you've never done that.
Slept with someone right away.

133
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.400
She made one last heartbreaking attempt to breathe through her nose.
He had,

134
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:41.300
but he didn't think it was love,
nothing like that.
What's the right answer?

135
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:45.260
He said,
there's no right or wrong.
She said,
well,

136
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:49.370
I guess there was this one girl and we almost did.
We got really close.
He said,

137
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.200
but I didn't want to hurt her later on,
so I held off.
I mean,

138
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.420
we both did a the right answer.
Anyway.

139
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:01.980
She said he watched her guide the tea bag around the water by its paper tag.

140
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.540
He was a Gawky long limbed phd candidate from Semi Rural Maine.

141
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.370
He was allergic to shellfish and in his rare time,
rare free time,

142
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.460
he did little other than monopolize his roommate's Nintendo.

143
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.530
She was light years out of his league.
Now the wrong answer,
she said,

144
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.240
yes.
We went ahead and slept together,
but I didn't really love her.
He said,

145
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.970
tell me more.
She said she,

146
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.310
he began a section of his chest whether he felt protective of it.

147
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.830
No,
no.
She said he shook his head.
Good for you.

148
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:40.680
She said and nodded.
Really?
It's not in my business.

149
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.580
She finished her tea and drew a deep breath this time through her mouth.

150
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.080
She sat up straighter and looked at him a new as if only now realizing he was in

151
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:53.400
the room with her level and not someone else.
You are a good person,
aren't you?

152
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:58.020
She said,
I try.
He said she studied his face side to side,

153
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.850
up and down.
I could use a good person.
I need someone good in my life right now.

154
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:04.860
She said good.
He said,

155
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:09.300
sadly he had landed on that brotherly side of the spectrum.
Oh,

156
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.680
she said,
oh,
what?
His face was hot.
It was too late.

157
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.360
Nothing she said carefully,
but she half smiled,
embarrassed,
maybe,

158
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.910
hopefully intrigued.
Are we ready to go

159
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.880
now?
Level checked one more time to see whether both cars are in the driveway.

160
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.350
When he saw that they were,

161
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.920
he had it downstairs for his laptop and answered some work emails.

162
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.040
There would be no point trying to fall asleep after this night.

163
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.700
He skimmed the newspaper,
considered finding his Banjo,

164
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:42.390
which he had not played in a few years.
He flipped through some magazines.

165
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.410
He eventually made his way back upstairs and into bed.
Later he heard the Meccan,

166
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.900
her kid on this bike outside and the smack of newspapers landing on driveways as

167
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.630
well as the sound of the milk trucks screeching down winter street.

168
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.490
That compact joyless bovine woman,
Hannah's term.
It had made him how,

169
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.710
who left bottles of organic milk on people's porches once a week in the morning.

170
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.520
Hannah remains steely for the brief time that he saw her before he had to leave

171
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:13.320
for work,
but she allowed him to give her a quick kiss goodbye and he helped.

172
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:15.420
This might be a precursor to a truce.

173
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.870
He turned his thoughts to all that lay ahead of him at his office.

174
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.280
The numbers from Pago pago would screw up as estimates of potential intensity of

175
00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:24.510
tropical cyclones.

176
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.140
Hurricane Katrina had garnered him and his theory some attention,

177
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.460
but still there were plenty of naysayers in the government level arrived at mass

178
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:35.460
environmental and the day began.
Thank you.

179
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.270
<v 0>Well,
thank you for that.
Sure.
Luvo pros.
Oh,
thank you.</v>

180
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.720
So I'm curious,

181
00:11:46.721 --> 00:11:51.721
I'd like to get into the differences between short fiction and extended

182
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.701
novelist,

183
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:59.701
but you've spent most of your career at this point are a significant part of it.

184
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.610
Basically judging short fiction.
Yes.

185
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.930
When you were an editor at Houghton Mifflin to do work a lot with short fiction

186
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:11.590
or did you sort of just sort of stumble into short fiction?

187
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.720
<v 1>Well,
I think,
you know,
before I worked at Houghton Mifflin,</v>

188
00:12:15.721 --> 00:12:17.760
I got my Mfa at Emerson College.

189
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.870
And most writing students start out by studying short fiction.

190
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.580
And because it's a very work shoppable form,
it's a very digestible for them.
Um,

191
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.610
so I guess I started with short stories and that might've been my true love.

192
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.470
Um,
when I became an editor,

193
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.570
I did work on short story collections and novels.
I did a little nonfiction,
but,

194
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.630
um,
because I worked with a lot of new writers,

195
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:47.220
that tends to be the foreign people start out with.
So I did some of them.
Um,

196
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.130
and it's the,
you know,

197
00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:54.990
a story collection is not the preferred form.
It wasn't then.

198
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:58.770
It's not.
Now publishers kind of say,
that's great.
Do you have a novel after that?

199
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.900
Um,
so that is,
uh,
you know,
tends to be the way to get some writers in the door.

200
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:08.040
Um,
I was an assistant but worked on a book called the interpreter of maladies.

201
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.210
Oh,
sure.
And,
um,

202
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.740
it was so gratifying to see that this was a story collection.

203
00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:15.690
We published it as paperback original.

204
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.250
It was a very modest acquisition and it doesn't matter what form it is.
Writing.

205
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.660
Great writing I think is great writing and I still feel that way.
Um,
I,
you know,

206
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:29.100
my day job is short fiction.
My writing is longer fiction,
but um,

207
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.720
in my mind it's,
they're almost interchangeable.
I think,
you know,

208
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.651
it's,

209
00:13:34.651 --> 00:13:38.130
it's more about the writing to me and the pros and the quality of it then the,

210
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.690
the form that it comes in.

211
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.770
<v 0>Yeah.
I've always imagined,</v>

212
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.960
I've never gone through writing programs,
so I could be completely misinformed,

213
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:55.961
but I've always imagined that the short story as a form always require,

214
00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:01.961
has always required a different skillset or always has its own set of rules as

215
00:14:03.141 --> 00:14:06.840
opposed to longer fiction.
Is there any truth to that?
Yes.

216
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.030
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
it's such a different feeling too,
right?
I think I,</v>

217
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.160
I always say writing a novel is like at the beginning of writing a novel,

218
00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:18.900
you walk into a big empty house and you think,
I had to fill all these rooms.

219
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:22.200
And when you're writing a story,
you're in a room and you,
you know,

220
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:25.650
usually you can see at least one or two walls,
a closet,
you know,

221
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.210
kind of what the [inaudible] you can sense what the parameters are.
Um,

222
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.140
I think in novels,

223
00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:35.700
so many new writers stumble when they are over ambitious and you think,

224
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.460
I've got to fill this whole damn house.
I,
you know,

225
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.970
let's throw in it.
Let's throw in some history.

226
00:14:41.971 --> 00:14:43.470
Let's throw in a lot of characters.

227
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:47.730
I think you see a lot of novelists really stuffing it full because of that fear.

228
00:14:47.731 --> 00:14:51.890
When you walk in that fear of emptiness,
of white space on the page,
um,

229
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.310
I'm forgetting what your question was.
Just fine.

230
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.360
<v 0>Differences in both potentially both the form of a strong story and the skills</v>

231
00:15:06.641 --> 00:15:09.100
required to produce both forms.

232
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.650
<v 1>You know,
there are different than,</v>

233
00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:14.400
I do think writers tend to either fall on one side of the,
the,

234
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.780
the wall or the other.
You're either a short story writer or a novel writer.

235
00:15:18.781 --> 00:15:22.800
In short stories,
obviously every word matters more.
Um,

236
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:28.060
there's not the room for tangents and aggressions that there is an in novels.
Um,

237
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.710
you know,
the flip side of that is in novels,
there's that,

238
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.720
there's a lot of space to fill it.
You know,
I think,
um,

239
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.810
it was really interesting writing this book because it's short and it's,

240
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.270
I think kind of tight.
There's there,
you know,
I,
I cut away a lot of the,

241
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.030
the digressions that were in there earlier.
Um,

242
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.700
maybe this is kind of a hybrid or what's called a novella,
but,
um,

243
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.900
it's being published as a novel.
Um,
so yeah,
if there's a different,
there's,

244
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.310
I'm not sure if I'd say it's different skill set or a different mindset.

245
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.120
I think it's a very different mindset and some people are more comfortable in

246
00:16:03.121 --> 00:16:04.840
one.
And then in the other,
um,

247
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.400
I've seen a lot of story writers make the transition awkwardly.

248
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:09.930
I've seen a lot of novelists,

249
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.590
you just try and squeeze themselves into short stories and I,

250
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.160
you can tell a lot of times,

251
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.570
granted that's my job and all I do is read stored stories and I'm very critical

252
00:16:18.571 --> 00:16:22.770
of this stuff.
But I do think you can tell where people's comfort level is.

253
00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:29.050
<v 0>Okay.
[inaudible] speaking.
No,
I won't identify the person,</v>

254
00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:33.250
but I know there's at least one person in this room who's an aspiring fiction

255
00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:35.110
writer.
Good.
Um,

256
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.070
you mentioned that at Houghton Mifflin at least,

257
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:43.930
I assume most publishers that if I understood correctly,

258
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:48.460
it's easier to get published as a novelist and as a short story writer.

259
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.320
What advice would you give the aspiring writer of fiction?

260
00:16:53.321 --> 00:16:58.321
Because I can also imagine going the route of publishing short stories and

261
00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:04.291
journals in a McSweeney's in different places and then possibly having done

262
00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:08.630
that,
you know,
outlining a novel,
you know,

263
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.510
workshopping that and going to a publisher and saying,
Hey,

264
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:13.840
I have these short story credits.
You know,

265
00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:17.620
here are three chapters and an outline.
What do you think are going to an agent?

266
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.290
So I mean,
is that a legit,

267
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.670
<v 1>that's the standard route is to write short stories,</v>

268
00:17:23.671 --> 00:17:28.650
to try to get them published and then,
or win some awards or do some residencies.

269
00:17:28.651 --> 00:17:31.440
There are all these great writing centers,
Grub Street in Boston,

270
00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:34.990
there's bread loaf,
there's a lot of different residencies.

271
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.600
And programs you can apply to.

272
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:41.730
So to sort of go that route to writing short stories,
gather some credits,
um,

273
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.930
try to find an agent,
you know,
put together a collection.

274
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.850
Usually it'll be asked to write a novel.
Um,
you know,
I'm,
I'm a big fan of,

275
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.410
I don't think breaking rules as much as following what it is that you really

276
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:59.070
want to,
right.
So if you want to write stories,
by all means go that route.

277
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.090
It's not easy to get stories published.
I'm not sure why exactly that is.

278
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:05.490
There's a ton of literary magazines out there,

279
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.210
but it's really hard to get stories published.
I,
you know,

280
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.940
I've talked to umpteen writers when I used to write stories,

281
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:15.720
I had a hard time finding people to publish them.
Um,
it's a,

282
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.470
it's a funny world and I'm not sure if it's because a lot of the magazines are

283
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.660
published by universities.

284
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:25.890
So you get Grad students reading the piles of,
uh,
stories that come in and they,

285
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:30.150
you know,
might not have a sense of if a story is trying to take a risk,
you know,

286
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.270
you see less risky stuff out there.
And some of the journals.

287
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.970
But to go back to the question,

288
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.820
I think it's important to figure out what you really want to write.

289
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.260
If you want to write,
you know,
a science fiction novel and that is your end goal,

290
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.270
screw it.
Get to that.
You know,

291
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.200
if you want to write a prose poem and that's what you know,

292
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:50.970
you have to find where that energy is,

293
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:53.700
where that thing that keeps you interested is there.

294
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.140
It's hard these days who wants to write?
There's so much to distract us.

295
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.520
You would Google should know this.
Um,
it's,
you know,

296
00:19:02.521 --> 00:19:05.250
the whole world is full of attention thieves.

297
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.390
So you have to find what is just gripping to you and,

298
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.380
and allow yourself to write that.
I think no matter what it is,
um,

299
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.570
there's always going to be prescribed routes to go about this and that.

300
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.390
And then you hear these stories of people,
you know,

301
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:22.230
the most successful people didn't go that route.
J K Rowling,
you know,

302
00:19:22.231 --> 00:19:25.230
people who sort of wrote on the sly.
I think,
again,

303
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.980
the key is to figure out what works for you and to respect your own inner voice

304
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.010
in a way.
It's a hard thing to do these days,
but I think it's important.

305
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.383
<v 2>Okay.</v>

306
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.280
<v 0>No.
In terms of the best American short fixed move a year,</v>

307
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:48.310
you typically work with well known writers most recently to a surprise winner,

308
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.030
Jennifer Egan to produce those.

309
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.403
<v 2>MMM.</v>

310
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.230
<v 0>Do they pull their weight or they're just big names to put up the covers?</v>

311
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.920
You don't have to answer that honestly.
How does the process work?

312
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.520
<v 1>They definitely pull their weight.
I mean I have a different way.</v>

313
00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:07.080
So what I do is I get,

314
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.350
I read everything that's published in a calendar year by an American journal

315
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:18.490
that is distributed,
which encompasses a huge amount.
Um,

316
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.840
I read between three and 4,000 a year.

317
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.900
So I'm really picky and critical and awful.

318
00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:31.500
I'm kind of your worst nightmare reader because I have kids and I write and I

319
00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:34.260
don't,
I have no patients.
So either,
you know,

320
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:39.240
I'm with you on page one or two or forget it.
Um,
so I read all these stories.

321
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:41.940
They all get sent to me.
They've,
they've,
they just come in,

322
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:46.080
I'm on everybody's list circulation list.
I read them all.

323
00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:47.830
I pull 100 and of them.

324
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.420
And then I said those as to my guest editor who pulls 20,
they pick 20.

325
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.520
And everyone's different.
We work together sometimes more,
sometimes less.
Um,

326
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.260
they're the big name.
I let them decide how the process should go.
But,
um,

327
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.910
it's,
it's the world's greatest job.
It really is.
It's,
it's,
uh,
you know,

328
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:10.990
I get to be in a one on one book club with just an incredible,

329
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.860
an incredibly successful and talented writer every year and have it be someone

330
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:19.000
different.
Um,
it's,
it's,
it's fascinating.
It's completely,

331
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:22.020
completely fascinating.
Their processes are all different.
Um,

332
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.740
I never know what to expect.
When I started this job.
I thought,
oh,
I'm going to,

333
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:30.990
you know,
Lsd bold,
who wrote the lovely bones.
I pulled all these stories and,

334
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.530
you know,
violent stories about kids and girls and none of them,
she just,

335
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:38.860
you know,
she was really into historical fiction and I thought,
oh,
this is,

336
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:42.550
I have no idea.
You know?
So then I began to just sort of say we need to,

337
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:45.160
I just need to rely on my gut,
pick things that I like,

338
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.520
not try to please the other person,
which is such a good life lesson.

339
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.720
Some sometimes and,
and yeah,

340
00:21:52.721 --> 00:21:56.590
it's really unpredictable each year,
but there's a lot of reading and,

341
00:21:56.591 --> 00:21:57.850
and they do a lot of reading too.

342
00:21:57.851 --> 00:22:02.440
They have to read 120 of these stories and pick 20 and some years it's easier

343
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:06.040
than others.
There's a lot,
there can be a lot of back and forth between us.
Sure.

344
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.830
But ultimately the 20 for a perk or other ones that will go in the book.
Yes,

345
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.450
yes.
And they're,
and they're the,
they write a foreword.
I ride,
I ride a forward,

346
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.120
they write an introduction and they're the ones who,

347
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.170
it's kind of Nice for me because if people complain about the stories,
I say,

348
00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:25.680
well lamb,
Jenny Egan,
I had nothing to do with it.

349
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.390
Nice.
Not to have the full load rest on me.
Sure.

350
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.990
Always good to have a backup.
Yes.

351
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.640
Well,
anything else you want us to know about everything else you do?

352
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:49.060
Oh my God,
I blow.
Okay.
Everybody sit back.
Um,

353
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.210
I don't think so.
Do you guys have any questions?
Maybe that it's always,

354
00:22:53.211 --> 00:22:58.160
I always like knowing what you want to hear so I'm not yammering into the ether

355
00:22:58.161 --> 00:22:59.480
so much.
So go ahead.
Yeah,

356
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.470
<v 3>some reviews and the block and</v>

357
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.610
very hard under either in a sense,

358
00:23:11.611 --> 00:23:16.611
and I read it before and also a little bit of a lot of readers can relate to

359
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.270
both them to argue
or something or arguments

360
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.390
usually doesn't go that path as well.

361
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.820
But this is like leaving out like nothing off the feminist reading about some

362
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.390
characters and see what happens is,

363
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.790
this might be already already the lesson for us.

364
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:49.340
Even
they source reading.

365
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.480
I was wondering what made you choose such an intense emotional subject?

366
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.560
Um,
how did your weight,

367
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:05.570
your risk of having something that readers to recover from

368
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.260
and also how did you cope,

369
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.730
emotional burden of having to,

370
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.400
to be in the position of having to ride it out and go back over and over and

371
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.360
reliving what we are doing and what did it mean for

372
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.100
the ride.
Right.

373
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.370
<v 1>Um,
so a few answers.
Um,</v>

374
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.230
so I wrote my first book,

375
00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:42.940
it was published in 2006 and it is a novel about a family full of pregnant

376
00:24:42.941 --> 00:24:47.530
people.
Um,
and it's kind of a family drama.
It's set on an island in Maine.

377
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.540
And after I published it,
some well known writer came up to me and he said,

378
00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:55.950
you know what?
I love what,
you know,
what I love about a book?
And I said,
what?

379
00:24:55.951 --> 00:24:59.830
He said,
well,
I usually like when something happens.
And I said,

380
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:04.570
wow,
thanks.
I just kind of turn purple and crept away.

381
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.770
But it stuck with me and I thought it,
you know,
it was,
I love my first book,

382
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.440
but it doesn't have a huge plot.

383
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.810
It was more of a psychological exploration of a family.

384
00:25:13.811 --> 00:25:17.550
And I thought I wouldn't mind writing,
uh,
like a big bang book,
just where,

385
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:22.210
you know,
it had something really,
it's always been important to me,

386
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.080
and this sounds really basic,
but to keep your reader turning pages,

387
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.950
it's a really fundamental thing.
I think a lot of readers lose sight of that.

388
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.140
Once again,
these days.
There are so many distractions out there.
Uh,
you know,

389
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.070
a lot of people aren't reading as much as as they used to and it's important to

390
00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:40.600
keep your reader engaged.

391
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:45.520
So I had that in the back of my mind after my first book.
Um,

392
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:50.730
I got pregnant with twins and my husband and I lived out in a small town and I

393
00:25:50.861 --> 00:25:55.420
took this new job and I was just kind of homebound with twins,
um,

394
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.520
and it,
which was really hard on me.

395
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.670
We were isolated and we were kind of out what felt like out in the middle of

396
00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:05.200
nowhere.
Um,
it was a strange place to be at.

397
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.720
All I knew is I wanted to write something that had a big story.

398
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:13.030
And around this time there was,
um,
the Lacy Peterson story was in the news a lot.

399
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.480
And I started noticing there's all these stories of these very beautiful women

400
00:26:16.481 --> 00:26:20.140
who go missing and it's something grizzly happens to them and why,

401
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.730
why are they getting so much coverage?

402
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:23.350
Why are these stories getting so much coverage?

403
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:28.440
So I kind of dipped a toe in this story.
And then soon,
maybe a month later,
um,

404
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.420
a woman who lived in my town of was shot.

405
00:26:31.421 --> 00:26:36.421
She and her baby or her young baby were shot in her bed by her British husband

406
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.650
and the press just flooded into our town.
And I was like a crazy person.

407
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:42.910
I was completely obsessed with this.

408
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.120
They lived less than a mile and a half from us.
Um,
our town center,

409
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:51.120
a nice little bucolic town,
green filled up with reporters.

410
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.310
And I watched this whole thing and I,

411
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.910
it just kind of got under my skin and I thought,
what is with this?
Why,

412
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.990
why has this become a dark fairy tale for us?
Why do we,
why does,

413
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.920
why do people lap this up?
The media,
the readers,
why do I care?
You know,

414
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:08.460
I've sort of a smart person.
I'm literary,
I don't,
you know,

415
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.510
usually read in tabloid news so much,
but I could not get enough of this case.

416
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.360
So I,
that was my indoor to this story.

417
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:20.250
I had these things swirling around in my head,
um,
and I started writing it.

418
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.930
And the darker story was really part of a backstory.

419
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.830
As I was writing the first few drafts,
it was,
uh,
there was a nicer,

420
00:27:28.831 --> 00:27:32.220
happier story around it,
which eventually fell away.
Um,

421
00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.240
with the help of my editor who saw that the book really was about the darker,

422
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.840
more uncomfortable story and it was okay to let that sit alone on the page.
Um,

423
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.520
I didn't set out for it to be this emotional and this intense,

424
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:48.750
I think it needed to be,
it's a weird thing as a writer,
um,

425
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.360
and it probably sounds a little bit crazy,

426
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.190
but a book needs to be a certain thing.

427
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:58.190
Your characters speak to you in a way that can override what your needs are.

428
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.580
And so this thing kind of took over my life for so long.

429
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:06.210
It was very painful to write,

430
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.410
but it was also when I had finished it in the way that it needed to be finished,

431
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:14.940
it was incredibly rewarding.
And I felt nervous because I thought,
Oh God,

432
00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:17.730
I'm going to send this dark thing out into the world.

433
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.890
But I also thought of many other dark books that did okay.

434
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:27.170
I think people can handle intensity and I think it's important,
um,

435
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.140
to trust your reader.
I think I'm not enough,
you know,

436
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.060
people in various businesses do.

437
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:35.370
And I think people at the end of the day want to be moved.

438
00:28:35.371 --> 00:28:36.990
They want Catharsis and they're reading.

439
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.780
So maybe this was all just justification,

440
00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:42.960
but I clung to it and now we have this book.

441
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.910
So if that answers that.
Any other questions?

442
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.130
Anything anyone wants to talk about?

443
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.290
<v 0>Actually,
I have one morning just touched on them and taking off your question.</v>

444
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.293
Um,

445
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.760
certainly there are at least a few superficial similarities to another dark

446
00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:08.620
book.
You know where I'm going with this,
which has got no idea where,

447
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.460
well,

448
00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.940
you might've heard there was a book that was on the Times bestseller list for

449
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.740
about 19 or 20 years,

450
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.980
seemingly called gone girl that we might've made a little movie about it.

451
00:29:20.621 --> 00:29:21.940
And there,
there are few,

452
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.350
at least superficial resemblances between your book and that one.

453
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.550
Is that something that

454
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.160
came up during the editing process or the publishing process with you?

455
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.820
<v 1>That's a great question.
So,
um,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
Yeah.</v>

456
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.430
So this book took me along,
time to write and gone.
Girl was published,

457
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.890
I'm not sure what year,
but a few years into my writing it and I thought,
Oh,

458
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.410
you know,
I don't,
I read it.

459
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.840
And right away I thought this is such a different book.

460
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:59.140
I think gone girl is an edgy,

461
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.720
wonderful mystery thriller,
um,

462
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.610
fonder kind of ride of a book.

463
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.960
Mine has been called a mystery or thriller and I don't really think it is.

464
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.930
I think it's suspenseful.
And I think,
I feel,

465
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:16.780
I always feel a little pretentious using the words literary,

466
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:21.280
but I think it's literary and suspenseful and psychological,

467
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.180
but it's not,
um,
it's,

468
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.210
it's not gone girl in any way.
I mean the first five pages,

469
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.130
maybe there's a similar premise,

470
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.640
but it goes in such a wildly different direction.
That said,

471
00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:36.790
it's been hard having that out there.
It feels like the person in the room,

472
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.480
you know,
the,

473
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.020
the 800 pound gorilla that's hanging out with me during this whole time.

474
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.370
I'd love gone girl.
I thought it was wonderful.
I loved the movie.
Um,

475
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.830
this isn't that book.
And I think people keep the,
there's a lot,

476
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.810
there's a lot of desire out there to say this is the next gone girl or this is

477
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.190
the next whatever big book out there.
And you know,

478
00:30:57.191 --> 00:31:02.170
as a writer you can't pay attention to that,
you know,
unless it is the same book.

479
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:04.780
Once I had read it I felt better.
But yeah,
there have,

480
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:07.790
there's been a lot of comparisons made in the press and,

481
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.890
and I worry that that together when there's a lovely quote from Stephen King on

482
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:12.490
the front,

483
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:16.540
I worry that the gone girl comparison together with this great Stephen King

484
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:21.220
quote is going to mislead people.
So,
um,
but at the end of the day,

485
00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:24.730
I guess that's not my job.
My job is to write a book and worry about the writing.

486
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:28.210
And then at this point it's,
it's yours,
it's,
it's for the readers.

487
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:32.740
And I go away and shield myself a little bit,
hopefully.

488
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.470
Um,
so that's what I'll say about that.

489
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.140
<v 0>Okay,
fair enough.</v>

490
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:41.503
<v 4>Renewed.</v>

491
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.370
<v 1>You know,
I do and I am always nervous to talk about it too soon,</v>

492
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.500
but I do and it's much lighter.

493
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.130
I kind of feel like I need a vacation after this one.
Um,

494
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.760
and I worry it might be so like that.
There'll be no,
you know,

495
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.520
if there's a reader that likes us,
they won't like that.
But again,

496
00:31:57.521 --> 00:32:01.060
you can't care about,
you have to just write what you want to ride.
So,
um,

497
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.520
I just,
my,

498
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:07.060
my main idea is that it's about happiness and the search for happiness,

499
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.870
which will probably mean it'll turn into something horrible and unhappy knowing

500
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:15.070
me.
But I'm going to try,
I need a lighter experience.

501
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.143
<v 0>Anything else?</v>

502
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.040
<v 1>Any other questions?
Go ahead.</v>

503
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:26.740
<v 4>We will.
Description of your job.
You seem to read six,
seven,</v>

504
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.000
eight hours a day.
Yeah.

505
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.250
Which brings me to a question when you should do,

506
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:37.090
when I finish a book,
the short story more in the novel,

507
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.880
I did take a few,
it doesn't matter what it is about,

508
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:43.820
you just need to up pay my respect to the book,

509
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.390
but just waiting for a few days before I switch to another book.

510
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.170
I was wondering how you managed to do this context switching so fast,

511
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:52.190
five times a day.

512
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:52.811
<v 1>I know.</v>

513
00:32:52.811 --> 00:32:57.160
So I have to do many switches or pallet cleansers like call them and this is

514
00:32:57.161 --> 00:33:01.990
what's made me an absolute Twitter and Facebook junkie because it's the perfect

515
00:33:01.991 --> 00:33:05.080
amount of time.
You know,
I'll read a story if I read the holster.

516
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.490
So if I read a whole story,

517
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.960
my computers there putz around on Twitter and Facebook for a bed,

518
00:33:10.961 --> 00:33:14.980
get the mind out because I can't afford to take a longer chunk of time.

519
00:33:14.981 --> 00:33:19.630
There's just too much to read.
Um,
at the end of my reading year,
I've always,

520
00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:23.140
it always is this avalanche and no matter how much I try and stay on top of it

521
00:33:23.141 --> 00:33:23.621
through the year,

522
00:33:23.621 --> 00:33:27.640
there's just this neuro and pile that is sitting there at the end of the year.

523
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.720
And there's,
there's a few less,
you know,
pallet cleansers in there and you just,

524
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.660
you learn to do it after awhile,

525
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.950
but you also learn to sort of accept the fact that now you're human,

526
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.260
that you're not perfect.
And you know,

527
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:45.100
I always feel kind of like,

528
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.300
you just feel strange about how am,

529
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.230
who am I to decide what the best American short story is.

530
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.510
At some point all of us just say,
well,

531
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.680
I'm going to do the best I can and I'm going to accept my shortcomings.
And um,

532
00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.040
there are days where I'm in a bad mood and unfortunately if I'm reading your

533
00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:03.490
story that's,
you know,
that's the way the world works.
Like any job,

534
00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.240
there are days where my kids are driving me crazy or our second I have to read

535
00:34:07.241 --> 00:34:11.440
with
the TV blaring and the,
you know,

536
00:34:11.441 --> 00:34:15.960
the water pipes broken or something.
And I've sort of the,
you know,

537
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:19.660
I'm going into my 10th volume so I've learned to forgive myself and a lot of

538
00:34:19.661 --> 00:34:24.340
ways and at least try to accept my imperfections on the job.

539
00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.980
Um,
but that said,
Twitter and Facebook are,

540
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.710
or my friends for Palette cleansing.

541
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.220
Anyone else have any other questions?
Go ahead.

542
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.790
<v 4>Between the two</v>

543
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:44.310
cds were reading it or doing all three

544
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:51.030
but the main one here where like where ideas from one environment to the other.

545
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:56.710
<v 1>Absolutely.
I think the best thing to do was to write first in the day.</v>

546
00:34:56.711 --> 00:35:00.010
I dropped my kids off at school and then go right.
Because if I read first,

547
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.510
other voices get into my head.
Um,

548
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.840
I try to have a time separation,
whether it's lunch,
you know,

549
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.740
go run an errand or something,

550
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.950
but it's really easy to grow to even subconsciously grab onto a voice or a

551
00:35:14.801 --> 00:35:19.801
phrase or a character and have it warm it's way through without even realizing

552
00:35:19.811 --> 00:35:21.820
it.
Um,
and you know,

553
00:35:21.821 --> 00:35:25.600
the other thing that I think is hard is that my day job makes me a really

554
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:29.650
critical reader.
So it's hard not to be hard on myself as a writer.
Um,

555
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.850
it's much easier for me to revise then to produce new work.

556
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:38.280
It's hard to get it when you're in that generative space.
You have to,

557
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.190
it's almost like being in a dream state.
You can't,

558
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.400
you have to turn off every critical voice in your head or you're not going to

559
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:48.280
produce anything.
So that's gotten harder for me over the years.
Um,

560
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.950
and I revise this for long enough that,
um,
it's been a while.

561
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.630
So writing this new book feels a little bit like I've been put in a sandbox and

562
00:35:57.631 --> 00:36:01.590
with no toys and I kind of have to figure it out.
It's,
it's tough,

563
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:03.960
but hopefully I'll be able to get back in the mode of it.

564
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.120
Any other questions,
concerns,
fears?

565
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.510
<v 0>I have one more and one more.
Go ahead.
Cool.
Um,
okay.</v>

566
00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.100
I was just wondering,

567
00:36:15.101 --> 00:36:19.390
I would guess two would be past this stage if it ever happened,

568
00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:21.610
but at any point in this career,

569
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:27.390
have you ever had editors or agents or writers themselves say the equivalent of,

570
00:36:29.591 --> 00:36:34.000
hey,
please don't read this story of mine when you know your kids are driving you

571
00:36:34.001 --> 00:36:37.510
crazy or something.
I know you've read 10 stories of mine the last five years,

572
00:36:37.511 --> 00:36:38.650
but this is the one,

573
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.960
<v 1>Oh yes,
no,
people,
I have authors send me stuff and I again,</v>

574
00:36:41.961 --> 00:36:44.570
I'll read anything that was published,
so,
sure.
Um,

575
00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.270
but they don't get to say when I read it,
I think it's like any award,
you know,
I,

576
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.210
it's the unfortunate luck of the draw.

577
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.750
I have definitely had people send me notes saying this is the best story by this

578
00:36:53.751 --> 00:36:57.980
author.
And none of them are,
you know,
you can't,

579
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.640
you can't really take any of it in.
You have to.
Sure.
Um,

580
00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:05.150
and I think I've gotten to the point where,
you know,
if I,
I used to,

581
00:37:05.151 --> 00:37:08.600
my kids used to play soccer at this indoor soccer place.

582
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:11.540
It was the loudest smelliest,
nastiest space.

583
00:37:11.541 --> 00:37:15.050
And I'd sit there reading my stories and all the other moms were chatting away

584
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.330
and I think I got really good at

585
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:18.780
<v 2>yeah.</v>

586
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.320
<v 1>At telling right away,
this is a good story or this isn't,
you can,
you can,</v>

587
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.830
it becomes this automatic thing where you just,
it's,
you know,

588
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:31.130
there's a switch flicked or not and it becomes easier and easier the more you do

589
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:34.260
it.
Um,
yeah.

590
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.630
But people do,
people rally a little bit,
um,
and,

591
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.500
and they're allowed to rally all they want,

592
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:42.840
but it's not gonna make any difference to me.
Sure.

593
00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:45.963
Did you have a question,

594
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.340
<v 4>miss somebody who's writing the story?</v>

595
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.870
It sounds like you hadn't been friends for what it is that makes a good story

596
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.470
from like my perspective was added.
We are like,

597
00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.460
there's always this conflict between his story that's really strong Brown.

598
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.890
And then the ones that just didn't vote.

599
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.590
One piece of imagery that no matter how little I'm enjoying get,

600
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:12.400
they're either reading two years later,
I'm still like revisiting.
Are there,

601
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.400
you find that correlation?

602
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:19.401
Is there an inverse correlation kind of the ones that stick with you the most?

603
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.520
<v 1>They do.
I think I'm,
you know,
I,</v>

604
00:38:24.521 --> 00:38:27.220
I've started to think of in this very unromantic turn,

605
00:38:27.221 --> 00:38:29.710
my head is a computer that's getting really stuffed.

606
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.280
So I don't remember as much as I used to.
Um,
when you're reading,

607
00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.270
I also should say I'm,
um,

608
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.250
hoping Mifflin is publishing a book called 100 years of the best American short

609
00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:41.050
stories.
And that's coming out in October.

610
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:45.730
So along with reading three to 4,000 of the regular stores a year for the past

611
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.860
three or four years,
I've read every volume of the book to put together this.

612
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.600
So this computer chip,
whatever is fried.
I mean there's just not a lot of,

613
00:38:55.630 --> 00:39:00.430
you know,
specific imagery that I'm sitting around thinking up.
But um,

614
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.200
<v 2>okay.</v>

615
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.050
<v 1>For my favorite stories.
It's true.
There are moments that stick with you.</v>

616
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:09.790
There are lines that stick with you.
Um,
what do I think makes a strong story?

617
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.180
Um,
confident writing,
natural writing.
Um,

618
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.950
I wish there were more humor out there.
I like risk taking.
I'm,

619
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:22.420
I'm a big fan of melding of genres of Psi Phi,

620
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:27.080
of Dystopia or of humor mystery,
um,

621
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.060
as well as literary fiction.
Um,

622
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.060
I like anything that feels inventive or new or important or relevant.

623
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:34.630
Um,

624
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:39.400
I wish more people wrote stories about technology and science and um,

625
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.580
the economy,
the,
there,
there are certain,
you know,
it's funny in short fiction,
um,

626
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.690
news or content of the day,
it takes a while to penetrate short fiction.

627
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.360
So now I'm reading a lot of stories about the Iraq war,

628
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.470
so I always feel like I'm reading the shadow of what's happening in the real

629
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:59.200
world because it takes writers awhile to,

630
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:04.090
to digest and to properly digest what's going on in the world and make sense of

631
00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:07.750
it and turned it into art,
obviously.
Um,
but yeah,
that's,

632
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.110
that's basically what I look for.
I think,
um,

633
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.570
that said good writing is good writing.
I think I'm,

634
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:17.410
I'm always surprised when I like a story that is about nothing that's just a

635
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:21.010
great voice or has great imagery or characters,
um,
that,

636
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.930
that is incredibly gratifying too.

637
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

638
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.010
<v 1>Thank you so much for coming.
This was really fun.
Thank you.</v>
