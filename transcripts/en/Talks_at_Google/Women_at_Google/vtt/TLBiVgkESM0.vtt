1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm Aaron Shaffer.
I work on our global brand solutions team.

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.410
I'm a part of the broader youtube crew.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.390
So let me tell you a little bit about Ariana.

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.240
I'm sure many of you already know a lot of this.
Um,

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.300
but Arianna is the cofounder precedent at an an editor and chief of Huffington

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.263
Post's media group.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.360
She launched the Huffington post in 2005 and in 2012 the slight won a Pulitzer,

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.320
the first for a digital media company.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.540
Incredibly impression for their national reporting.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.960
Arianna also in all her free time has been a very busy author.

11
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.370
She's the author of 15 books and her 15th and most recent that we're going to

12
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.010
talk a little bit about today is the sleep revolution,

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.970
which is about the science,
history and mystery of sleep.
Um,

14
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:46.410
and I know we'll dig into that a bit.

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.760
You also probably know that Ariana has been named to times magazine's list of

16
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:54.720
the hundred most influential people and the Forbes most powerful women list.

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.890
She's on numerous boards,
including the center for public integrity and Uber.

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.360
And she's also originally from Greece having moved to England when she was 16,

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.490
um,
where she graduated from Cambridge with a Master's,
an MBA in economics.

20
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.120
And again,
I've only had the pleasure of meeting her just this morning,

21
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:15.870
but I already feel that we're close friends after 15 minutes.
She's a very,

22
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.860
very special person.
So with that area on a please come on up.

23
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.280
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

24
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.450
<v 0>so thank you so much for joining us here.</v>

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.180
<v 2>Yeah,
and I'm so happy that everybody seems to be getting a copy of the sleep</v>

26
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:38.970
revolution.

27
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.410
<v 0>Yes,
we're sorry.
Not Everybody on GVC can do that,
but um,</v>

28
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.080
but was two should get a copy of the book.
Um,

29
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.590
so what I'll do is I'll ask you a few questions and then I'll open it up to our

30
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.680
audience here and then the many people who've asked questions from around the

31
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:53.670
globe on our dory.

32
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.780
But let me get started here and I'd love to start with this book and the sleep

33
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:58.614
revolution.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.790
So can you tell us a bit about your motivation for writing a book about sleep?

35
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.650
<v 2>So,
um,</v>

36
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.710
my motivation was that I actually collapsed from sleep deprivation and I'm on my

37
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:15.420
way down,
broke my cheekbone,
a corner of my desk.

38
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.630
And as I came to in a pool of blood,

39
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.540
and I had to ask myself the question,

40
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.380
if you come to in a pool of blood and nobody has showed you,

41
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.090
is that really what success looks?

42
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.270
And so that led to a book I wrote two years ago called thrive and,

43
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.390
and in thrive sleep is a tiny part.

44
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.610
And as I went around the world speaking about redefining success and including

45
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:49.611
our wellbeing and sense of wonder and giving into the definition,

46
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
what people really wanted to talk about was sleep because it was Sherry.

47
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.330
It's like it's the universal common denominator.
You know,

48
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.990
you may not want to meditate or wonder or give,

49
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.490
but you have to sleep.

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.240
So I decided to sort of dig deep and make the book very much based on all the

51
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:18.370
latest science about sleep because it's kind of amazing.

52
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:23.110
Sleep is a very new science.
In fact,
the first,

53
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:28.111
a scientific slip center was founded here at Stanford in 1970 and now there are

54
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:33.730
over 2,500 in the US alone.
And the conclusion,
as you'll see,

55
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:38.530
the 1200 scientific footnotes in the book,
you don't have to actually read them,

56
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.880
but if you have a partner or a friend who's skeptical about sleep,

57
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.910
you can make them read them because it's kind of unequivocal and conclusive.

58
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.710
The science Dezeen sleep is not negotiable.
Um,

59
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.110
it's not something you can choose to do or not do unless you have a genetic

60
00:03:59.111 --> 00:03:59.944
mutation.

61
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.360
And about 1% of the population has a genetic mutation and they can do great on

62
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:06.970
four or five hours sleep.

63
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.720
I don't have the genetic mutation and you cannot train yourself to have a

64
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:14.080
genetic mutation,

65
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.170
but there is actually a choice before your children are born.
You have to chill.

66
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:23.740
But if you,
and we'll have a third one and you want them to be a short sleeper.

67
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.050
I don't know why you would,
but if you do,

68
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.420
you can do gene editing before the baby's born.

69
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.780
Once the baby's born,
the days gas,
that's tit,

70
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.870
seven to nine hours where you are in that spectrum is individual but seven to

71
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:44.020
nine.
So what is the revolution itself?

72
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.080
So therefore solution is really changing the culture because we are all living

73
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.160
under the collective delusion.

74
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.870
And you experienced it more than anywhere here in the valley that,

75
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.733
um,

76
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.000
in order to succeed you have to burn out.

77
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.730
It's like that's the delusion of our culture.
I mean,

78
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:08.290
you go into companies and you see people being congratulated for working 24,

79
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:12.940
seven people were being,
being busy like a badge of honor.

80
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.450
Um,
people say,
you know,
she's amazing.

81
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:21.451
She's always on should it there and stacks and emails right away and we need to

82
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.040
change that.
We need to

83
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.310
change how we hear something like that.
So now if I hear someone say,

84
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:34.420
you know,
she's amazing.
She's always on,
I think,
ah,

85
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.430
that's a problem.
You know,
and it's a problem on many levels.

86
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.890
It's a problem because at some point that someone on person is going to burn out

87
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.620
mathematically and hot.
The farm,
the burnout decks will vary.

88
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.420
It can be a collapse like mine,
it can be a health issue.
Um,

89
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.020
it can be any number of things.
You know,

90
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:00.040
even a lot of the that happened that we think are accidents are really because

91
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:04.730
our immune system is down or we're not paying attention,
et cetera.

92
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.940
And the other thing is that you've,
this,

93
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.330
this whole building is like a celebration of creativity.

94
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.080
Youtube is sort of a celebration of creators.

95
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.820
So the first thing that gets degraded if you are sleep deprived is your

96
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.040
creativity.
You know,

97
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:30.041
you can still big transaction now you can still go to meetings and pay attention

98
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.390
with half your brain and make notes and um,

99
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.230
show up.

100
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.230
But really the part of you that really comes up with innovative game changing

101
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:45.050
ideas,
which is what you are all about,

102
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.110
is not functioning as well.

103
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.560
So we need to kind of rethink a whole idea of what it means to be optimally

104
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:58.430
performing.
And you know what?

105
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:03.431
I love that athletes who are all about performance and winning are now

106
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.370
prioritizing sleep and renewal and recharging.

107
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.410
I write a lot about Andrew Goodall in the book because he actually tracked his

108
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:15.800
stats after he started getting eight hours of sleep.

109
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.270
And it's just amazing to see the immediate impact on performance.

110
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:25.220
So sleep as a performance enhancer.
Now sleep is a lot more than that,

111
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.810
but I don't really care why he started getting enough sleep.
You know,

112
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:32.030
whatever your entry point is,
take it.

113
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.550
And one of the lines in the book is Com stump for the performance enhancing

114
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:41.810
benefits stay for the life enhancing benefits.

115
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.260
And for me the biggest life enhancing benefit is actually bringing joy into what

116
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:51.950
you're doing.
Because I feel we're also blessed to have jobs.

117
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:54.530
We love to be living here.

118
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.880
And so often enough for myself,
when I'm sleep deprived,

119
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.980
I may still get things done,
but the joy is gone.
I'm kind of drug,

120
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.030
I dragged myself through the day.
I just go through the motions.

121
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.080
But I'm not really a need.
Yes,

122
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:16.340
you're sleepwalking through through life,
but not really experiencing it.

123
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.990
<v 0>Um,
I want to talk a little bit about media.</v>

124
00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:21.690
So I want to go back to a time when you certainly were not sleep walking through

125
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:25.530
anything.
When you,
um,
when you started the Huffington Post,
um,

126
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.120
you started in 2005,

127
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.470
what do you think led it to become so successful when there were already a lot

128
00:08:31.471 --> 00:08:33.360
of other online news platforms out there?

129
00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:36.600
What was it about the Huffington Post that attracted so many readers?

130
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.800
<v 2>So I think what it was is really what is at the heart of Youtube,</v>

131
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:43.920
which is that we are a platform from the beginning.
Yes,

132
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:48.921
we are also a journalistic enterprise that a few years later won a Pulitzer and

133
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.550
we now have 850 journalists,
editors in 16 countries.

134
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.060
But the fact we were in a platform where people could come and create and tell

135
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:05.331
their stories and share them was really what differentiated us from the

136
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:10.470
beginning.
And that we did that not as a free for all,

137
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.430
but I'm making sure that the best things caught the most attention and that

138
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:22.341
there was no hierarchy except is this really worth them amplifying?

139
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:26.550
Is this worth sharing?

140
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.140
And whether it was President Obama or a homeless student who had something

141
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:33.300
interesting to say,
which actually happened.

142
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.790
And that homeless student wrote a beautiful blog post,

143
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.400
which happened to be seen by the Harvard admissions office and he's now in his

144
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:42.600
third year at Harvard.

145
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.170
So immediately use also the magic of what was happening in this digital

146
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.320
revolution that people were discovered.
And we look at all the,

147
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.220
all the stars that youtube has created.
Where would they be?

148
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.000
Were it not for this platform?
Um,
yeah,

149
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:02.750
the might get an agent in Hollywood,
Eh,

150
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.080
but now you don't need an agent in Hollywood.
A,
you don't need a publisher.

151
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.280
You can actually be your own publisher and you can be your own creator and you

152
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:12.960
can be discovered.
Yes.

153
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:16.320
I think there are a lot of similarities between the Huffington post as a

154
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:19.950
platform and youtube and it is all about just giving people a chance to have

155
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:23.010
their voice.
Um,
I was looking backwards to the,

156
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.150
to 2005 a lot has changed in the media industry.

157
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.870
What have you noticed over the last,
not just those 10 years,

158
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:33.960
but your history in the media industry and what do you think has happened is

159
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.510
going to happen next in the next five to 10 years of media?

160
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.400
So I think what's happening now as you know,
is that there's so much,

161
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.640
there's so many platforms,

162
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:49.641
there's so much noise that I think what is happening and where it's going to

163
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:54.831
become increasingly important in the next few years is are you adding value to

164
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:59.440
people's lives?
And a,

165
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:02.280
so I'd half paused or if deck and that too hard.

166
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.840
And we've divided everything we're doing into three editorial pillars.

167
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.710
The first is obviously news and politics,
but with our own perspective,

168
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.540
like we're not covering this election the way others are covering this election

169
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.190
from day one.

170
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.090
We refuse to treat Donald Trump as a normal candidate.

171
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.980
We feel this is very important for journalists not to buy into the idea that our

172
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:35.970
job is to be in the middle and presented two sides to the story.

173
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.520
Because you know what?
Not Everything has two sides.
You know,

174
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.550
evolution is a fact.
The earth is not flat.

175
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.210
Barack Obama was born in the United States.

176
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.290
You know,
global warming is real.

177
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.640
So and yet far too many journalists are having these conversations where you

178
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:01.000
have a scientist who believes in global warming.

179
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.350
Debating is scientist who doesn't as though this is a legitimate debate.

180
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.270
So from day one,

181
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.170
when Donald Trump decided he's running for president,

182
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.350
we started covering him in the entertainment center

183
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.370
<v 1>on the ground.</v>

184
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.880
<v 2>Seth Meyers said that the White House correspondents dinner in 2011 when Donald</v>

185
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.090
Trump first said he was running for president,
he said,

186
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.230
I just heard that Donald Trump is running for president as a Republican.

187
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.630
I thought he was running for president as a joke.

188
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:43.430
So the day that he actually pronounced this policy of banning 1.6 billion

189
00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:49.530
Muslims from this country,

190
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.970
we stopped covering him in the entertainment section and we'll cover him as a

191
00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:56.460
clear and present danger to this country.

192
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.820
And at the end of every story that mentions him,

193
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.740
there is an editor's note to them that says,

194
00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:09.741
we want to remind our readers that Donald Trump wants to ban anti-religion from

195
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:15.030
this country,
is regularly inciting violence,
is a serial sexist,

196
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:16.170
misogynist,

197
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.700
and xenophobe who does not believe that the president of the United States was

198
00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:23.250
born here.
And this is our job.

199
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.810
Our job is to keep reminding voters who he is.

200
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.500
Voters will do whatever they're going to do in November,

201
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.330
but it cannot be because the media have not done their job.
So as you can see,

202
00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:40.050
the way we approach our politics and news pillar is very different.

203
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.650
The second pillar is covering solutions.

204
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.060
We think there's way too much coverage of problems and crisis and obviously we

205
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.270
cover those.
But there's an amazing amount of good happening in the world,

206
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.490
is an amazing amount of innovation and creativity and compassion.

207
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.920
And we need to cover those things too.

208
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:03.921
So we have a big editorial department called what's working and at the heart of

209
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:08.040
that is also encouraging people to take action.

210
00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:10.590
And Susan and I have been talking about that,

211
00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:15.060
how there's so much amazing stuff on youtube and how can we encourage people

212
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.480
immediately to take action because sometimes you,

213
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.430
you watch a video and you feel compelled to do something and then life

214
00:14:23.431 --> 00:14:27.180
intervenes.
So if you don't do it right away,
it's going to be harder to do it.

215
00:14:27.181 --> 00:14:29.550
So we're working with,
um,

216
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:34.350
crowdrise and we're working with Jordan and Houston's action baton and the glove

217
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:39.070
and poverty project button to make all these stories more action,
a Bot.

218
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.360
And the third thing is all our initiatives around wellness and reducing burnout

219
00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:48.060
and all the things that we've been discussing in the first part of our

220
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:51.770
conversation.
Do you think the way that,
um,

221
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.610
that huff post and others will deliver that content,

222
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.790
interact with viewers and readers of that content,
will that change?

223
00:14:58.791 --> 00:14:59.624
Would you see,

224
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.410
what do you see happening in the next five to 10 years in terms of how the media

225
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:06.770
works and how consumers are the media interact with it?
Well,

226
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:09.650
I think what's been happening is going to accelerate.

227
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:12.230
And of course you're right at the middle of this changes.

228
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.040
More and more of this content is going to be conceived on mobile.

229
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.840
More and more of it is going to be video and Mara Mara,

230
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:25.841
Mara rate is going to come to readers and viewers through the back door.

231
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.050
Instead of them going to a site,

232
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.490
it's going to be because their friends are sharing it,
um,

233
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.730
are some other social action that makes them aware of that content.

234
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.820
And we see that at,
they haven't done by setting the Huffington post properly,

235
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.120
the last major media side that still has destination traffic,

236
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.370
but we see declining every year.

237
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.320
So we've actually far postmark on or off platform traffic,

238
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.101
uh,

239
00:15:58.101 --> 00:16:03.101
on the grounds that ubiquity is the new exclusivities what we're saying,

240
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.080
it's not really about exclusive content.
And we knew we love partnerships,

241
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.700
we love crossposting balls,

242
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.890
letting others crossbar style content and cross paths in the content of others.

243
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:16.490
So this is,

244
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:21.490
I think it's all these trends that are already present are going to accelerate

245
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.370
being where the people are and making it eats exactly.
Get to get 10.

246
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.570
And then also,
um,

247
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.700
shaping the content in ways appropriate probably for whatever platform you're

248
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.090
going to see their content because a lot of sense.
Um,

249
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.320
getting back to the news pillar just for a moment,
um,
I've would wonder,

250
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:43.220
what would you tell a young person today who is interested in getting into

251
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:47.760
journalism?
I would say golf.
I read and,
um,

252
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.510
Don Devon way to go to journalism school.

253
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.640
I just start where you are because journalism has so dramatically changed that

254
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:01.460
it's really about the stories you tell.

255
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.490
And then using the amazing technology available to step to tell these stories.

256
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:11.450
With Marlene packed,
we just bought a Vr company called riot.
Um,

257
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.140
and the reason we chose them is because they,

258
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.390
they care about,
um,
their stories having impact.

259
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.170
And now just using the technology to make a dog beauty fall and uh,

260
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.850
and um,
and appealing to people.

261
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.780
And so in the,
in the same sense,
if you had to go into journalism,

262
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.710
do have an impact,

263
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:38.711
whether they begged is in politics or entertainment or any field,

264
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.880
Eh,
this is the golden age of journalism.
It's a new style matters.
And in fact,

265
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:48.350
you have more tools as a journalist example to,
than ever before.
Okay.
Thank you.

266
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.190
Um,
I want to turn

267
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.070
<v 0>to some questions about leadership.
Um,</v>

268
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.430
so you have been phenomenally successful in such a variety of different areas,

269
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.290
but I'm sure along with everybody else,

270
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:05.700
you've had a lot of lessons along the way from setbacks,
et cetera.

271
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.510
Can you tell us about some of the lessons that you've learned both from the

272
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:12.270
success and from times where you've,
where you've struggled a bit?

273
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.430
<v 2>Absolutely.
I,</v>

274
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.070
I was very lucky that I had a mother when I was growing up in Athens,

275
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.930
Greece in a one bedroom apartment,
um,

276
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.340
with the no money who always made me believe that I could take risks in a,

277
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.390
it didn't matter if I fade,

278
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.190
because I think what stops us very often from taking risks and going for our

279
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:38.940
dreams,
he said,
we don't want to fail,
especially women.
For some reason.

280
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:43.890
We women want to be perfect and,
and uh,
we're an odd,
nobody is.

281
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:47.950
And so recognizing that failure my mother used to say,

282
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.440
isn't that the opposite of success,

283
00:18:49.441 --> 00:18:53.670
whether a stepping stone to success and then instead of changes there we,

284
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.240
we are broad everything.

285
00:18:55.241 --> 00:19:00.241
And for me I would say that the thing I've struggled the most all my life is,

286
00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.430
um,

287
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:07.430
the voice inside my head that are called the obnoxious roommate living in my

288
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:12.090
head
that we all see our house.

289
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.540
Yes.
And,
and uh,

290
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.570
but you can really work on that voice and you can really make sure that that

291
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:23.571
voice only gets guest appearances and actually just to link it back to sleeve

292
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.880
when I'm sleep deprived,

293
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:30.750
which now I have to say only happens about 5% of the time,

294
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.950
um,
I,
that voice becomes intensified.

295
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.540
So that's another thing,
you know,
when we're arrested then recharge.

296
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.430
That voice doesn't have as much to way over us because we don't identify with

297
00:19:44.431 --> 00:19:45.264
it.

298
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.330
And so that the voice of self doubt of questioning what we're doing is the most

299
00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:56.040
draining thing in our lives.
So just if you notice it,

300
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.490
it's not really,
why do we do that's exhausting.

301
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.840
It's really what our mind does before and after,
before it's wearing,

302
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.770
like give you a deck.
Our conversation today,
you,

303
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:10.920
my mind beforehand can go into a worry anxiety.

304
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.560
Are they going to like what I'm seeing?

305
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.850
Am I going to remember everything I want to share?
You know,

306
00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:20.700
all these things that are mind you mind does.
And then when we finish and win,

307
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.520
I love being here.
This is fun.
This is not work.
Uh,
I,

308
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.390
I talk about something.
I love your Fabry Lewis.

309
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:30.300
I'm meeting somebody new and uh,

310
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.720
and I look forward to your questions.
You know,
it's like great.

311
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.340
But if then I leave and my mind,
the obnoxious roommate starts with

312
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.300
maybe I'm catching what Susan has.
Um,
you know,

313
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:48.610
you forgot to say that.
Oh,
and the way you're talking about story,

314
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:51.220
I don't think it'd really worked.
And why did you wear that white jacket?

315
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.920
<v 0>You know,
because it looks great.
It looks great,
but no,
no,
no.
What I'm saying?</v>

316
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.000
Anybody that's on all the,
all new thing

317
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.990
<v 2>switch.
I'm meaningless.
And is anybody recognizing the voice?
Yeah.</v>

318
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.470
So let's just the whole kind of

319
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.800
make this decision that we don't take this very seriously.
It's not the truth.

320
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.270
It's not who we are.
We can just like treat it like a child.
You know,

321
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:22.300
when your child says something and it throws a temper Tantrum,

322
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.990
you don't have to actually act on it.

323
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.680
<v 0>Right.
I shouldn't.
In fact,</v>

324
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:35.010
especially the two and a half years
I ran,
I'm wanting to ask,

325
00:21:35.011 --> 00:21:37.790
cause you also brought up your mother and um,

326
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.900
and her having teaching use it.
You could,
you could,

327
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.430
failure would be okay and that you as a woman,
um,
would still be able to succeed.

328
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:52.350
You've been a female leader in a very traditionally male dominated industry.

329
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.130
And this,
I know we have,
uh,
we have,
uh,
all sorts of folks here today,

330
00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:58.380
but there are a lot of people from our women at group,

331
00:21:58.381 --> 00:22:01.170
at Google here and a lot of people listening on the GVC.

332
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.440
So wondering if you have any advice for the women here and beyond Google who are

333
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.440
often in similar situation where they're in a male dominated industry.
How to,

334
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.110
how to think about showing up there?
Well,

335
00:22:13.111 --> 00:22:16.770
I feel that we'll have a great opportunity as we were talking actually

336
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.610
beforehand for women,
not just to their,

337
00:22:20.611 --> 00:22:25.611
our place at the top of the world in every profession had to actually including

338
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:27.444
the White House.

339
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.750
<v 2>But to actually change the way the world works.</v>

340
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.260
Because right now the way workplaces have been designed and the work of,

341
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.430
um,
the work world has been designed,

342
00:22:44.431 --> 00:22:47.430
has been designed by men and it's not functioning well.

343
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.750
It's not really good for anybody,
including polar bears.
And,

344
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.370
and I think women have a greater opportunity to lead the way here.

345
00:22:56.371 --> 00:23:01.371
So I feel it's not just about having the careers we want and knowing that we can

346
00:23:02.731 --> 00:23:05.970
have any job and any position we want,

347
00:23:05.971 --> 00:23:10.971
but also doing it differently because there's a lot of pain and suffering in the

348
00:23:11.011 --> 00:23:13.320
world that we cannot immediately change.

349
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.810
But this is some pain and suffering that we can immediately change simply by

350
00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:21.990
that cultural revolution that we are talking about,

351
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:27.390
of moving away from this delusion that we need to bear now to succeed.

352
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.310
And,
um,

353
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.430
men are going to be incredibly grateful because look at just last year alone,

354
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:40.080
the number of men who collapsed on their treadmills and either died or ended up

355
00:23:40.081 --> 00:23:41.190
with heart attacks.

356
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.920
And because what's happening is that we've all kind of accepted whether we do it

357
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:49.340
or not,
that exercise and nutrition are important.

358
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.500
But the third pillar is sleep.

359
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.340
And you have all these sleep deprived Taipei executives getting up at the crack

360
00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:02.741
of dawn to get the workout in when in fact I urge you to just sleep in,

361
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.620
you know,
when you're sleep deprived,

362
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.480
that's more important dealing with that deficit and then you'll have a lot more

363
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:15.860
energy even if you do a shorter workout or even if you skip it.

364
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:21.250
You just need to look at the science of how essential that is and all this

365
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.150
conversations happening in the workplace.
Um,

366
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.820
changing the way workplace or design of course that Google,
you know,

367
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:33.740
you're ahead of the curve,
but some of the other places are not.
Um,

368
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.770
I'm going to be key and I'd love women in whatever field they are to also take

369
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:44.740
that into account and do and to do it openly.
I mean,
I,

370
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:50.020
Susan an hour and Davos together and then we just happened to be sitting next to

371
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:56.660
each other at the dinner and she was telling me how she was pumping because she

372
00:24:56.661 --> 00:25:01.661
had just had a fifth child and she said she goes back to their hotel and she'd

373
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.990
pumps and then she leaves it out in the snow because she didn't have a fridge.

374
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.810
Very creative to know,
well enough sleep to best read of idea.

375
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.100
And then I said,
well you have to dig a picture on Instagram.
Me,

376
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.220
they're sad because it would be so great for this.
And she did.

377
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:20.210
I don't know if you are salaried,

378
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:25.211
but it is so great to have this powerful kind of woman executive who is also a

379
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:29.840
mother and was bumping.
It should in these two grandmas have bumping.
She just

380
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:35.090
suggesting.
So Graham,
do you know the milk in the snow?
And,

381
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.880
and I think that the moral openly we men and navigate these,

382
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.700
there are different responsibilities and their mar,

383
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:45.860
they actually um,

384
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.400
make it a by ruthless prioritization rather than,
uh,

385
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.100
the juggling act that drives us all crazy.
Um,

386
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.030
the more we'd be able to change the culture faster.
Wonderful.

387
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.920
So we should be ourselves to bring ourselves to work a full full selves.

388
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.150
So my last question for you before I turn it over to the audience here into the

389
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:13.010
folks that have been asking questions on our dory,
um,
is really just this,

390
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:16.550
you have accomplished so much what is next for you.

391
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.260
So I didn't think there was going to be next after they haven't done past,

392
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:26.290
but in fact a thrive and the sleep revolution have led to so many amazing

393
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:32.270
conversations for me in so many companies and with so many people that have

394
00:26:32.271 --> 00:26:36.320
decided to launch a new company,
thrive global,

395
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:41.240
which is going to be about going into corporations and helping them change the

396
00:26:41.241 --> 00:26:46.241
culture around these principles and actually ending this a delusion that there

397
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:52.341
is a trade off between productivity and wellbeing and seeing that they do.

398
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.870
And in fact incredibly interconnected and making all our offerings,

399
00:26:57.871 --> 00:26:59.370
trainings,
courses,

400
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.400
very science based and then measuring the impact of everything we are doing.

401
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.240
Um,
with this two key metrics,
um,

402
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:14.160
health care costs and productivity because I think the key to accelerating this

403
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.450
revolution is impacting the bottom line.
Absolutely.

404
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.480
And helping people recognize that in fact the wellbeing of employees is really

405
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:28.110
tied to the health of the bottom line and a pioneer.

406
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:32.940
Um,
in this area is Mark Bertolini,

407
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:37.941
the CEO of Aetna who is actually going to be joining the board of my comp new

408
00:27:38.521 --> 00:27:42.300
company.
And I don't know if you saw the latest thing he's done.

409
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:47.590
He m he introduced this program at Aetna and even employees are given fitbit to

410
00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:55.221
track their sleep and if they get seven hours or more for 20 nights and they are

411
00:27:57.151 --> 00:27:59.850
given $300.
Wow.

412
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.340
So it's not just the financial incentive.

413
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:07.670
Can you imagine how revolutionary that is that the CEO of a fortune 500 company

414
00:28:08.581 --> 00:28:13.470
is telling you that getting enough sleep is good for business?
Fantastic.

415
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.940
It's good for the shareholders.

416
00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:19.941
And then he always brings in Duke University or some scientific center to

417
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:25.890
measure the impact on productivity and health care costs.
So for me,

418
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:30.891
that will will revolutionize how workplaces function and that will make it much

419
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:36.621
easier to change lives and reduce all that unnecessary pain and suffering.

420
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.610
<v 0>Well we can't wait to see it and we will make sure that you get to talk to</v>

421
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:44.110
Sundar Lazlo and I lean about this idea of

422
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:46.690
thank you.

423
00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:51.420
I know that I would love to invite folks from the audience here in San Bruno to

424
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.470
come up to the mix with any questions for Ariana.

425
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.350
We'll first take one live here and then we'll go to our dory.

426
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.940
<v 2>Any brave souls?
Want to ask Ariana a question and let us know.</v>

427
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.580
I'm sorry there's a mic right and you probably can't see it.

428
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:10.140
It's right in the sort of middle of the room over here and let us know your name

429
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:13.050
and if you're doing,
if you want,
you can tell us how many hours sleep.
Yep.

430
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:18.240
<v 0>Last night,
last night,
if you want to say how much you got last night,
is it on?</v>

431
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.150
I just didn't get enough last night.
I'm,
I'm Aaron.

432
00:29:20.151 --> 00:29:24.800
So I lead our product team for consumer music area and I'm actually working on

433
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:28.970
trying to get more sleep.
But it's really hard.
Um,
my question for you,

434
00:29:28.971 --> 00:29:32.150
you touched on earlier,
um,
you know,

435
00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:37.151
how the post is covering the election and taking more of a perspective of

436
00:29:37.761 --> 00:29:41.090
sometimes there isn't two sides to a story.
And what I've,

437
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.400
and I'm and it's been talked about is how people can very easily now find

438
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.740
content that reinforces their own views.

439
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.890
And so there's sort of this echo chamber where instead of,
um,

440
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.290
going to a sort of central new stores,
people just,
you know,

441
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.770
share things and it seems to be driving more of a divide in opinion,

442
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.440
public opinion.
And so I'm curious what you think,

443
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.010
what are some of the things that we can do to,
um,

444
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.280
to impact that in a positive way?

445
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.130
Because it seems to be driving people to more extreme point of view,

446
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.070
extreme points of view.
And I'm curious your thoughts on that.

447
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.240
<v 2>Thank you.
Well,
first of all,
before I answer that,
can I give you just one very,</v>

448
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:22.330
very simple tape about guessing mostly sounds great

449
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.780
and since you have the book,

450
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:29.970
you'll see the second part of the book is all about best practices and simple

451
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.120
tips and techniques.

452
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:35.410
But please don't go straight to that because they're key thing is to convince

453
00:30:35.411 --> 00:30:39.850
yourself by Lou reading all the latest scientific findings of how important it

454
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:43.180
is.
Because once you change your mind about it's important,

455
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:45.220
it will be easier to change your habits.

456
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.550
But the Marston Barder nonnegotiable thing is creating a little transition to

457
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:54.370
sleep.
That's what we've lost in modern times.

458
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:58.720
So you still have young children so you know that you don't just drop your child

459
00:30:58.721 --> 00:31:00.010
in bed some nights.

460
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:04.450
You may wish to wish you give it a bath,

461
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.730
you put it in as PJ's using it the lullaby.

462
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.810
So we needed or the equivalent with ourselves,
age,

463
00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.940
each person's ritual with different,

464
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.680
but it's kind of creating your own good night moon,
you know,
good night,

465
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:21.940
loved up goodnight,
goodnight smartphone,

466
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.950
us,
got them out of your bedroom.
That's the first kid thing,

467
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.000
you know,
because we're all addicted to our devices,

468
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:34.840
let's admitted so they have to slip separately from you.

469
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.060
And that's the first kind of nonnegotiable tip.
And then there are many,
many,

470
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:44.680
many others.
But creating that little ritual,
even if you start with a five,

471
00:31:44.681 --> 00:31:49.681
10 minute demarcation line between your day life without are inevitable

472
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.760
challenges and obstacles and incompletions and the time for us to sleep and

473
00:31:56.951 --> 00:32:01.570
recharge minus 30 minutes now,
and I describe it in the book,

474
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.840
it's going to make an incredible difference.

475
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.160
So bad politics.
Um,

476
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.840
I feel that that's definitely an issue.

477
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.900
But I think the bigger issue is that we are losing respect for facts.

478
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.900
You see,
I think that it's perfectly okay to have divergent opinions,

479
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.290
but we cannot have a different set of facts that we based this opinion on song.

480
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:36.730
So when Hillary Clinton in her speech yesterday,
he said,
I believe in science,

481
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.820
that should not be a point of between two candidates.

482
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.320
And I think that's really where we need to be kind of much more adamant and much

483
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.930
more absolute,
you know,
why does,

484
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:58.990
why does the fact behind this opinion and I think that we help close the divide

485
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.700
we're experiencing right now.

486
00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.650
<v 0>Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.</v>

487
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.420
I'm going to take a question from our,

488
00:33:07.421 --> 00:33:10.990
because we've got so many people around the globe interested in seeing this and

489
00:33:10.991 --> 00:33:13.870
asking you questions.
So here's one that we have,

490
00:33:13.871 --> 00:33:18.871
which is what role Ariana do you see live streaming playing in all media in the

491
00:33:19.391 --> 00:33:24.270
future.
Okay.
And in general,
what's,
what has driven your decision,
um,

492
00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:29.170
to either leverage an industry platform versus build one yourself?

493
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.060
And the example here that the question asker gave was,
um,
you spent,

494
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.190
um,
I,
of course last question.

495
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:39.510
You spent resources to build a player for Huffpo live,
um,

496
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.440
instead of utilizing a free solution.

497
00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:44.050
So how do you decide to build yourself versus use somebody else's?

498
00:33:44.051 --> 00:33:45.730
And how important do you think live is?

499
00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.900
<v 2>So we think life is more and more important and we're very,
in fact,</v>

500
00:33:49.901 --> 00:33:54.901
we consider it to Susan doing part of this conversation on your new offering,

501
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.740
eh,
your live offering.
We're doing a lot with Facebook live.

502
00:33:59.741 --> 00:34:04.320
We're doing a lot on snapchat and we also have our own huffpost live.

503
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.580
So again,
we're very agnostic.

504
00:34:06.581 --> 00:34:11.581
We want to be on every platform and we want to be on every platform,

505
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:16.510
um,
in ways that are appropriate to that platform.

506
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.160
And so for example,
for one day we took cover,

507
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.410
um,

508
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:27.410
a pop up discover channel on snapchat called it recharge and it was all around

509
00:34:27.551 --> 00:34:31.930
sleep and recharging and um,
it was amazing.

510
00:34:31.931 --> 00:34:35.970
It was like funny.
It was all about,
um,

511
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:42.060
kind of message that would appeal to millennials and would not be kind of Etl

512
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.060
Broccolini and make it sexy and fun and give them all the stats about how I'm

513
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:51.550
getting enough sleep.
Um,
deals with Eric,
dial dysfunction,
for example.

514
00:34:51.551 --> 00:34:52.384
Did you know that?

515
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.230
And so may made it appropriate to the platform and it had incredible engagement.

516
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.620
So that's why we,

517
00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:06.010
we need to be agnostic to the platform instead of expecting us all expecting

518
00:35:06.011 --> 00:35:08.110
everybody to go to half of us live.

519
00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.590
But you think live is increasingly important you guys are investing in.

520
00:35:11.591 --> 00:35:12.311
Absolutely.

521
00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:16.450
And I think live stream is very important and even live events and incredibly

522
00:35:16.451 --> 00:35:16.841
important.

523
00:35:16.841 --> 00:35:21.400
You not remember there was a time when we thought nobody would go to anything

524
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.850
life.
And you know,

525
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:27.040
all of you could be watching this on live stream but you chose to come here.

526
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:31.900
So I think live stream is going to be more and more important and live events

527
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:36.930
will we always be important because especially the more technology dominates our

528
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.640
before the more we actually still want that.

529
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.570
That direct connection.
Yes.
Thank you.

530
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.670
We will take questions from the ground.

531
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.610
<v 3>Hi Arianna.
My name is Scott.</v>

532
00:35:49.611 --> 00:35:52.940
I'm on the partnerships team here at Youtube and last night I slept for six

533
00:35:52.941 --> 00:35:55.650
hours.
Um,

534
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:59.480
so piggybacking off of the last live question,
um,

535
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.460
in this presidential election where you have a lot of the rhetoric on one side

536
00:36:04.461 --> 00:36:08.630
being based around fear and anger and not around facts,

537
00:36:08.631 --> 00:36:12.020
which is something that you were saying Hillary Clinton was trying to reinforce

538
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:14.660
the fact that she believes in science,

539
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.950
it's hard to believe that that's the argument that we're making in 2016.

540
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:23.780
So what sort of role and responsibility to be play in media companies like

541
00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:25.040
Huffington Post,
youtube,

542
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.480
other platforms around the world in combating fear and anger and things that are

543
00:36:31.491 --> 00:36:36.260
emotion based and so strongly emotionally based as opposed to things that aren't

544
00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:37.130
rooted.
In fact,

545
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:42.820
<v 2>what I love the fact that Susan called on everybody to,
um,</v>

546
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.620
do use the platform to express their views.
Uh,
you know,

547
00:36:47.621 --> 00:36:52.621
after all this explosion of violence and to actually recognize that you are

548
00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:58.180
offering a very,
very powerful Tori and more and more people,

549
00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.060
um,
need to use it.

550
00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.480
And so this is not a time to sort of sit things out.

551
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.970
And then for me,

552
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:12.070
this election will be decided in the end by who?
By who turns out to vote.

553
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:17.950
And,
uh,
so anything that the platform can do to reinforce that,

554
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.030
you don't have to tell them how to vote obviously,

555
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.580
but to a,

556
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:28.710
to make them recognize that this is not an election to sit out and say,

557
00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:34.000
you know,
I don't really like any either of the candidates very much,
eh,

558
00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.070
because
this is a,

559
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:42.100
this is really an existential threat to our democracy and people need to take a

560
00:37:42.641 --> 00:37:47.641
stance and they can take a stance obviously by creating content,

561
00:37:48.341 --> 00:37:53.320
by expressing themselves,
um,
by sharing things that they feel,

562
00:37:53.321 --> 00:37:56.260
express their point of view and by voting.

563
00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:01.270
And the more we can get that message out to all the different demographics that,

564
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:02.643
um,

565
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:08.310
that are on youtube and the Mall Bosley,

566
00:38:08.531 --> 00:38:11.830
we can influence the outcome.
Thank you.

567
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.200
I can speak for Google and say,

568
00:38:14.201 --> 00:38:18.070
and Youtube and say that we are very committed to using our resources to help

569
00:38:18.071 --> 00:38:18.731
get out the vote.

570
00:38:18.731 --> 00:38:22.660
So there'll be a lot of efforts here in the u s on youtube and across Google to

571
00:38:22.661 --> 00:38:26.020
make sure that people get to get out to vote and express their opinions.

572
00:38:26.021 --> 00:38:27.760
That's fantastic.
And I'm saying,
you know,

573
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:32.580
I'm on the board of Oba and we're having a board meeting yesterday and we're

574
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.220
talking about free Uber Rides to go to Poles,
whatever.

575
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.910
Maybe airbnb can,

576
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.800
if you have to fly to travel to another city to vote,

577
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.970
maybe I'll be in beacon help subsidize where you stay,

578
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:50.890
sort of basically every company needs to do what they can to encourage people to

579
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:55.891
vote because it's absurd how many millions and millions of people did not vote

580
00:38:55.991 --> 00:39:00.280
in the last election.
If we can change that,
um,

581
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.540
it'll have a huge impact on our democracy.
So I'm very happy to hear that.

582
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.710
<v 0>Absolutely.
Um,
changing gears a little bit,
back to wellness,</v>

583
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.440
and this is something you and I talked about this morning,
so I really,

584
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.890
I really want you to share your point of view here.
I'm a question.

585
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.980
The question that we have from the,
from somebody outside the offices,
um,

586
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.680
it seems easy to advocate for slowing down and getting seven to eight hours of

587
00:39:23.681 --> 00:39:25.240
sleep once you've made it.

588
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.800
But how do you counter the perception that you have to put in time and sleep

589
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:34.801
deprivation before earning the ability to have a work life and sleep balance?

590
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.470
<v 2>Well,
thank you so much for asking this question because my obnoxious roommate,</v>

591
00:39:39.471 --> 00:39:41.390
if we had not dealt with this topic,

592
00:39:41.391 --> 00:39:46.391
would have told me afterwards you should have addressed that fact because that

593
00:39:46.611 --> 00:39:51.611
is a very important fact and that's exactly what has led to the founder meet.

594
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.641
You know,

595
00:39:52.641 --> 00:39:56.180
the idea that if you're the founder of a company or if you're starting in your

596
00:39:56.181 --> 00:40:00.890
career,
you have to out outwork everybody and just,

597
00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:01.724
um,

598
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:07.420
pay your dues and all these things and it is scientifically fault.

599
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.580
That doesn't mean that a lot of people who've succeeded haven't been sleep

600
00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:15.581
deprived and exhausted along the way it is because up until now,

601
00:40:15.591 --> 00:40:16.261
everybody,

602
00:40:16.261 --> 00:40:19.940
since the first industrial revolution has been living and working under this

603
00:40:19.941 --> 00:40:20.774
delusion,

604
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:25.910
but it is not only unnecessary but counterproductive.
So,

605
00:40:25.911 --> 00:40:29.570
let me just give you an example.
We all know the stats.

606
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.560
Three quarters of startups fail,
start up,

607
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:38.630
founders are exhausted and sleep deprived.
Hey,
maybe there's a correlation here.

608
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:44.380
Maybe we can change the stat because there's not question that our cognitive

609
00:40:44.811 --> 00:40:47.480
performance is degraded when we're exhausted.

610
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.900
So that's why understanding the science is so key to changing that cultural

611
00:40:53.211 --> 00:40:54.044
perception.

612
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:58.520
There is actually a great study that came out in the Harvard business review by

613
00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.430
Mckinsey to late to include in my book,

614
00:41:01.431 --> 00:41:06.410
but it will be the paperback and my kids is study and the title you would have

615
00:41:06.411 --> 00:41:11.411
thought it was out of the army on the tidal was the proven link between

616
00:41:12.141 --> 00:41:14.060
effective leadership and sleep.

617
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:19.820
Now can you imagine that studied like even two years ago.
Um,

618
00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:23.630
and they walk you through on the science of what happens to your prefrontal

619
00:41:23.631 --> 00:41:27.560
cortex when you are sleep deprived and how it affects your decision making and

620
00:41:27.561 --> 00:41:32.540
how it affects your capacity to lead and to be empathetic and to build teams and

621
00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:37.500
to spire and all the things that are essential to leaders.
Absolutely.

622
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.130
I think we have another question here in San Bruno.

623
00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.450
<v 4>Hi,
Ariana.
Uhm,
I'm Daniel from the living room team.</v>

624
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.480
I got about seven hours of sleep last night.
All right.
Um,

625
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.000
so I was curious your thoughts if you had any,
uh,

626
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.800
recently it's come out that Peter Thiel,
who is a luminary figure in the valley,

627
00:41:53.801 --> 00:41:55.960
but not,
not without controversy,

628
00:41:55.961 --> 00:42:00.520
has been bankrolling a number of lawsuits against Gawker media.
Um,

629
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.480
the supreme court has told us that money equals speech,

630
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.430
so he's certainly entitled to do as he wishes,

631
00:42:06.431 --> 00:42:11.170
but I'm curious if you had thoughts on one billionaire trying to take down a

632
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:15.760
media company,
irrespective of whether it's a muckraker side or,
or whatnot.
So,

633
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.453
<v 2>so,
um,</v>

634
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:22.550
I actually believe that it's not the role of billionaires to,

635
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.810
to try and take down sides.
Um,

636
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:32.790
I think eight is even more dangerous when billionaires running for president

637
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.670
talk about banishing media.

638
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:40.550
And I think that's really infinitely more dangerous.
And,

639
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.120
and Donald Trump has said many times that,
um,

640
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.433
um,

641
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.740
not only are he demonstrated already by removing credentials from the Huffington

642
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.460
Post,
from the Washington Post,
for many,
eh,

643
00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.050
media operations that,
uh,

644
00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.390
I have taken very strong stances against.
Seymour simply point out the facts.

645
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:07.780
You know,
again,
it's that the Washington Post stories that made him subset,

646
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.590
you know,
we're not even,
we're not opinion driven.
They were fact driven.

647
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.520
Um,
as you know,

648
00:43:14.521 --> 00:43:19.080
Beto de Alonso speaking at the convention and it sounded that,

649
00:43:19.081 --> 00:43:20.870
I don't understand or tall,

650
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.310
maybe he did not read the platform on gay rights,
Eh,

651
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:30.060
but you know,
people just need to try and build more consistent,

652
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:33.990
um,
about,
um,
all these issues.

653
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.450
And so I ultimately,

654
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:41.660
freedom of expression includes acknowledging that a lot of things being

655
00:43:43.021 --> 00:43:47.850
expressed are not going to be to my liking.
Thank you.
Thank you.

656
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.340
We have another question coming up here in San Bruno.

657
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.220
<v 5>Hi.
Hello.
Ariella.
Um,
my name's Ariana from the people operations team.</v>

658
00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.900
I'm a huge fan of yours.

659
00:44:00.901 --> 00:44:05.220
I've been reading the huffpost since 2005 so read it everyday.
Yeah.

660
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.220
And I,
last night,
I think I got seven hours,
but usually,
um,

661
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.710
what I'm trying to go to sleep,
I'm usually reading the Huffington post,

662
00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.980
but I'll try to read it like around nine and then the break between the two.

663
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.450
Um,
okay.
Um,
so first off,
thank you so much for coming.

664
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:26.770
It's great to see you in person.
Um,
so I have a question about the media.
So,

665
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.640
um,
it was reported I think in 2000,
or excuse me,

666
00:44:30.641 --> 00:44:35.370
in March,
2016 that a Bush or not pushed,

667
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:38.370
um,
that,
uh,
sorry,
I'm a little nervous.

668
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.700
It was reported by the New York Times that,
uh,

669
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.790
Trump had almost $2 billion of free media coverage.
And then,
um,

670
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.100
a couple of other things that have been interesting as like in the 2000

671
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:51.180
presidential election,

672
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:53.990
the media declared Bush the winter before the votes in Florida where even

673
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.230
counted.
And then,
um,
also this last election cycle,

674
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.980
I was a little upset when I'm California,
hadn't voted yet,

675
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.630
and the media declared a Clinton the winner of the,
um,
uh,

676
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:07.740
democratic nomination.

677
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:11.010
So I'm just curious what your thoughts are about like the political kind of

678
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:14.700
manipulation that's happening with the media and how they're kind of changing

679
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:17.970
public opinion and things like that.
And maybe how we can counter that.

680
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.340
<v 2>Well,
the absolutely great question.
And,
uh,
I,</v>

681
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:29.330
I'm very troubled by the media role in especially in this election cycle.

682
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.680
There was actually a great style by the Sharon Center at Harvard about how

683
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:41.640
effectively and the media,
um,

684
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:47.150
dramatically help Donald Trump win the nomination because at the beginning when

685
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:51.570
they were giving him this amazing amount of coverage that as you said,

686
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.410
was the equivalent of $2 billion in free advertising.

687
00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.120
There was no justification for it.
She was not ahead in the polls.

688
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:05.020
He had not built the kind of fundraising organization,

689
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.670
um,
teams that,
um,

690
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.650
would make him a legitimate candidate.
So just,

691
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.970
just purely because of ratings.

692
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:20.490
And they even allowed him to phone in to major political shows,

693
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:24.900
including the Sunday shows,
which never happens.
And,
uh,

694
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:28.950
and so a lot of what the media have been doing has been ratings driven

695
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.000
rather than driven by,
Eh,

696
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.940
basic journalistic ethics.

697
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.840
And we've done a lot of coverage on that again and again.

698
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:45.300
And um,
it's also a recognition

699
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:52.040
that for me came very much to the forefront when I was giving a commencement

700
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:55.350
speech at um,
uh,
Fletcher,

701
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:58.950
which is in foreign service school at Tufts.

702
00:46:58.951 --> 00:47:02.610
And it also houses the Edward Murrow papers.

703
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:07.470
And I was talking to the head of the morrow center about how would he have

704
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:10.990
handled Donald Trump.
And he said he wouldn't have skewered here.

705
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.290
And if you go back and see how morrow handed McCarthy,

706
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:21.890
this is not the time to actually hold back and far too many journalists,

707
00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:26.730
even the way they are covered in this,
this conventions,
Eh,
you know,

708
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:27.720
Eh,

709
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:32.720
focusing on things that are legitimizing,

710
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:37.000
um,
the entire Shah raid of the Trump candidacy.

711
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.420
M shows that these are all ratings driven decisions and nothing has,

712
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:47.680
I don't think there is some deep manipulation behind these decisions except that

713
00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:49.570
when Donald Trump was and meet the press,

714
00:47:49.571 --> 00:47:54.010
it was the biggest rating bonanza that chuck Todd had.

715
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.340
<v 6>Thank you.</v>

716
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.620
<v 0>I'll check it out is not letting him call in anymore.</v>

717
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:04.140
And I'll be very proud of chuck,
who's one of my favorite journalists.
Um,

718
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.090
one last question Ariana,
cause we're at the end of our time,
sadly.
Um,

719
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:12.580
but I want to get back to wellness and thrive.
So one last question from,
uh,

720
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:17.530
from here was how important is napping to productivity and well being and have

721
00:48:17.531 --> 00:48:22.531
you seen examples of napping being incorporated and integrated successfully into

722
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:25.090
a company's culture?
Yes.

723
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:28.520
<v 2>So first of all,
not being is incredibly important.</v>

724
00:48:28.521 --> 00:48:30.640
I if you've gotten all the sleep you need,

725
00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:34.270
which just to remind you is seven to nine hours unless you have a genetic

726
00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:37.160
mutation,
which is only one in a hundred people.

727
00:48:37.161 --> 00:48:41.440
So you are unlikely to have that much.
I'm sure one or two of you here do.

728
00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:45.610
And you know that and if you don't know that you can test yourself.
Um,

729
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:51.010
but having said that,
um,
napping is amazing.

730
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.700
So if you didn't get enough sleep for whatever reason and that's all it's going

731
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:57.730
to happen.
You have a sick child,
do you have a big deadline,

732
00:48:57.731 --> 00:49:02.731
your flight was late and then try and get a nap as soon as possible.

733
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.900
In the day,
even a 20 minute nap is unbelievably restorative.

734
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:13.300
Winston Churchill regularly napped and won the Second World War and call them

735
00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:19.831
power naps at the half and imposter of two nap rooms and they're always full.

736
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.530
And now here you have a lot of Napa judge.

737
00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.090
We do and nap rooms in almost every office.
Yes,
Youtube,

738
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.500
you have an appro we do.
Great.

739
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.920
Does everybody know where the now pro pods and rooms,
right?

740
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:38.550
So I think that I'm predicting that within the next five years,

741
00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.980
the nap room is going to be as universal as the conference room in every

742
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:46.240
company,
not just

743
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:52.200
pioneering companies like Google and youtube.
So the,

744
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.280
the thing that we need to recognize is that even the middle of the afternoon or

745
00:49:57.431 --> 00:50:01.000
at any point you,
you feel really tired,

746
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:06.750
there's nothing that's going to increase your productivity as fast as a little

747
00:50:06.911 --> 00:50:09.270
nap.
And um,

748
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:16.020
it's going to dramatically transform how we handling this afternoon.

749
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:18.310
Low Pints were normally,

750
00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:23.311
now we go for the Fifth Cup of coffee or a donut or whatever it is to,

751
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:26.590
to get some energy.

752
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.970
So this is all part of the culture change that is happening and that I have with

753
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:32.930
your help and me,

754
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:37.460
you're amazing creators and leaders and in our culture.

755
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.940
So you have an incredible power to accelerate,

756
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:46.250
a cultural change that's already happening and that's going to bring some

757
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.570
amazing change in people's lives and,

758
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:51.710
and would love to hear from you and the Huffington Post.

759
