00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.580
Uh,
today I'm very,
very excited to host a us,

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.650
our speaker or author Sarah drew and I have a little intro for her to talk about

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.770
the Gaia Co Codex talk,

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.040
the talk about feminine wisdom and the evolution of technology.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
I actually know Sarah as a personal friend and I,

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.110
I think she's in one of the most inspiring women who embodied feminine values.

7
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.850
I think if you just watch her on stage all you'll know what I mean.

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.510
But I'm really pleased that she's here today to talk about her book.

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.070
So a little bit about that and we'll go ahead and hand it over to her.

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910
So basically the guy a codex is what we're going to talk about and this is both

11
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:49.140
an ancient found wisdom text and assumption was epic novel Gaia.

12
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:54.120
Codex reveals the hidden histories of a world long forgotten the secret wisdom

13
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:59.121
of an ancient lineage of women said in a near future of impending societal and

14
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.750
environmental collapse.

15
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.020
The novel is a tale of hope and remembrance as well as an inspired vision of

16
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:10.230
humanities origins and on the potential we hold for conscious evolution.

17
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.480
Very important topic with with growing numbers of international readers.
Gaia.

18
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.720
Codex is a flourishing phenomena that is capturing the passionate spirit of the

19
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:22.620
feminine rising and our deepening reconnection to our mother earth and very

20
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.270
timely with earth day coming up,

21
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.050
a lifelong explorer of cultural and consciousness.

22
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.430
Sarah has traveled the world from the high plateaus of Tibet to the jungles of

23
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.590
the Amazon to remote villages in Bhutan.

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.030
She studied religious studies at UC Berkeley and has lectured internationally

25
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:43.110
and at the graduate level on topics such as technology and consciousness and the

26
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:46.950
design of mind is consulting and innovation for Meto.

27
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.970
Muse brings a seasoned expertise in the areas of innovation,
media,

28
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.360
emergent technologies and environment,
evolutionary culture.

29
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.170
Men Amuse works with clients and companies to help shape regenerative vital

30
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.590
cultures that catalyze the optimum potential of the human species and honor the

31
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.800
sense the sanctity of mother earth.
Sarah lives in mill valley,

32
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:10.140
so she's local and please welcome Sarah.

33
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.150
<v 1>Thank you.
Thank you,
Rachel.</v>

34
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.420
It's wonderful to be here with all of you today and to be here at Google and may

35
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:25.350
our time here together benefit all beings,
benefit life.

36
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.910
We're going to be doing a little exploration about how we as a species can

37
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:35.911
create vibrant regenerative cultures at this critical point in our evolution.

38
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.670
And now a little bit later we're going to go deep into the guy a codex and are

39
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:46.671
going to be looking at how we as women and men can reconnect with the ancient

40
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
wisdom that is the feminine wisdom traditions.

41
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.640
But right now I want to look at how we can create conscious wise technology.

42
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.290
There's an ancient body of wisdom and I emerging cultural knowing that our

43
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.400
mother earth,
terra Gaja is a living,
breathing entity.

44
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.970
We are part of her and she is part of us.

45
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.220
She is consciousness,

46
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.430
the pure vibration of consciousness and she has matter of evolving,

47
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.270
learning,

48
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.270
experimenting and breathing and in the stream of knowing we are.

49
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.970
But one of the many forms of life Koa emergent with her

50
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.040
over time,
pythons and elephants,

51
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.380
regular trees and lotuses,

52
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.670
ancient tried to sources saber tooth tigers and ferns whose origins stripped

53
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:53.110
spread back 350 million years and their origins,

54
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.260
we human beings,
we homo sapiens.

55
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.900
I've only been here for a blip in time

56
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.810
in the history of mother Gaia 200,000 years in a 2.5 and a 4.5 billion year

57
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:10.084
history.

58
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.370
And if we dig deep into our DNAs unknowing knowing we find that Gaya is ever

59
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:25.210
evolving and that we are just part of this living consciousness,

60
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.730
this evolving spirit of life running through us.

61
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.440
And I'd like to pose that technology is also part of guys blueprint

62
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.130
now when its optimum form technology is consciousness manifest and deeply

63
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:49.440
resonant with life flourishing here on mother earth.

64
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Let me say this one more time and its optimum form cap Knology is consciousness

65
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.720
manifest,

66
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.410
consciousness manifest and deeply resonant with life flourishing on mother

67
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:04.374
earth.

68
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.100
Now there's a lot of debate right now about different scenarios of how we're

69
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.220
evolving as a specie and especially in regards to technology.

70
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.910
And kind of the simplistic polarity of that right now can be one on one hand

71
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.970
there's the uh,
AI,
singularity,
um,

72
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.980
human beings in carbon life would become obsolete.
Uh,

73
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.320
this is the scenario that you scenario that we've seen played out in many

74
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:36.000
Hollywood movies at this point.

75
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.360
One of the points factors of this is that technology is seen as something

76
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:46.450
separate from us.
And Technology is uh,

77
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.770
also,
uh,

78
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.070
and mother Gaia in this sense is seen not as living Brent beating entity,

79
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:59.511
but as a resource to be extracted to develop technology.

80
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.220
What I'd like to pose is that technology is indeed actually part of ourself and

81
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.710
that we are sacred technology.

82
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.250
And in particular our mother earth is one of the most extraordinary technologies

83
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:19.490
that we can learn from

84
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.360
4.5 billion years.

85
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.420
Library of our mother guy has a 4.5 billion years library of wisdom of living

86
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:35.270
technology is here for us to cherish and to learn from.

87
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.590
And we have a choice about how we evolve as a species.

88
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.510
We're all part of the participants in this game and this divine play.
There's a,

89
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.560
there's a wonderful word,
Sanskrit words,
Lila,

90
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.190
which means the divine play that creates worlds.

91
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.923
Um,

92
00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.070
what Lila's presupposes is that we are actually creaking our creations with

93
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:07.091
consciousness or at least the aspiration towards awakened consciousness that

94
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:10.040
understands the laws of causalities.

95
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.040
All our actions have a effect and that we work within a web of interconnected

96
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:20.501
being and that we're here to the best of our ability to benefit all beings and

97
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:24.370
to benefit all alive.
So from this view,

98
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.360
this middle way that we are living,
breathing technology,

99
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.510
sacred technology and consciousness and that we're apart and intrinsic to mother

100
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.910
Gaia who is also a technology and consciousness.

101
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:42.620
There's a couple of anchor points to look at.
One that,
uh,

102
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.190
technology is a tool for the evolution of consciousness is a teaching tool.

103
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.720
And in,
um,
it's optimum form is,

104
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.780
can be used as a bridge to activate a qualities that the human being already has

105
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:05.000
within oneself.
Um,

106
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.270
a lot of areas that have been covered in the esoteric traditions,

107
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:10.190
which we'll go into two in a minute.

108
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.840
Technology at this point in time in its evolution is there is an externalization

109
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:15.674
of that.

110
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.780
The other that mother Gaia has a 4.5 billion year old library and blueprint of a

111
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:25.130
highly functional and sustainable technology and we've only scratched the

112
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:29.530
surface as to what it's here and it's our imperative to nourish her in,

113
00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:34.040
to sustain her and to learn from her,
not to burn her,

114
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.140
not to pollute her rivers,
not to cut down her forest or blast out.

115
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:44.141
Her mountaintops is the equivalent to destroying the library of Alexander.

116
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:49.510
Maybe even worse because it's four Pi pi billion years of information and data,

117
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.740
which can inform how we are living on the,

118
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.190
and this goes into a lot of the work and teachings,

119
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:02.250
which you're probably aware of,
a Jane Venus with bio mimicry,

120
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.110
looking to the mother earth to find design for evolving technology and also

121
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:11.880
Bucky fuller was working with planet ship or the third thing,

122
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:16.560
we must make the transition from extractive technologies to technologies where

123
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:21.480
the energy sources are regenerative so that we don't continue to deplete the

124
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:23.070
resources in the planet.

125
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.020
And that we're looking at forward not just to seven generations ahead,

126
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.550
but we're looking forward to how do we keep the planet livable for Homo Sapiens

127
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.350
for the next millennia.

128
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.530
<v 2>Okay.</v>

129
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.470
<v 1>A doorway understanding technology and regenerative energy is maybe to dive into</v>

130
00:09:41.471 --> 00:09:45.250
the Meza Fez,
Ben,
a physics or esoteric practices.

131
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.063
Um,

132
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.270
<v 2>okay.</v>

133
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.050
<v 1>These have often been in a span of many human traditions,</v>

134
00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:58.051
a bridge to understanding this precious give a gift of life and our mother Gaia

135
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.710
across epic's cultures and epics of time.

136
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.800
There's been these practices that allow us to go directly in to the wisdom of

137
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:13.350
our sacred technology of the human being.
Now,

138
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:17.700
probably many of you are familiar with yoga and probably practice it.

139
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.330
Um,
the first level of Yoga,
when we go into a yoga class,

140
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:24.570
we'll just be working with the physical body,
right?
We're going to get in shape.

141
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:27.840
We're going to do are saunas go one layer deeper.

142
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.800
We start to work with the energy systems of the body,
which is in Sanskrit,

143
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:34.350
but it is,
there's a home network calls naughties.

144
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.580
The noddies are a nodal network that are there,
which is an energy system.

145
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:40.200
You learn how to activate that.

146
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.640
They're there and they're in alignment with the Chakras,

147
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.400
which in that system are understood to be poor tolls to um,

148
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.730
activating the body's full of energy and consciousness potentials.

149
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.920
Um,
very key.
And that is the balance between the male and the female.

150
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:02.730
It's called the Pingala and the Eda,
the sun and the moon.

151
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.010
They understand that,
uh,

152
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.510
a whole human being is a balance between the male and the female.

153
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.810
Um,
mindfulness meditation is,
I know many of you here are practicing,

154
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.920
um,

155
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.920
helps clear the mines so that we understand where thoughts come in and what were

156
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:27.240
receptive to what types of creation we are actually bringing forth.

157
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.480
When the mind is still in the mind is clear,

158
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.780
we can start to bring forth with choice a conscious creations.

159
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

160
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.070
<v 1>Causality is,
um,</v>

161
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:48.130
there's a couple of things that you can go also into Western alchemy which is

162
00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:51.160
working in the western alchemic tradition is again,

163
00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:55.060
is working at how to use the technology of the human being.
Um,

164
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:59.350
the coding of the symbolic form of that was the transmutation and material which

165
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:02.590
became part of the history of chemistry,

166
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:08.010
but it's inner practices were esoteric practices about how we transmute the

167
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:12.940
human beings so that we have a direct connection with consciousness itself.

168
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.690
And there's an equation.
It was like an energetic equation,
whether it was Tantra,

169
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.380
whether it was yoga,
whether it's Alchemy,

170
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.740
that the human being is a microcosm and we are a mirror replica of the

171
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.850
macrocosmic,
which is consciousness.

172
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.870
And if we understand how to align these energies and go into that,

173
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.660
we have the full energy of a potential.

174
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.220
We aren't just bodies and material,
but we are also a consciousness.

175
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.420
We're also light.
We're also vibration.
Um,

176
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.490
and the,
this from my understanding,

177
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:56.491
this fusion of pure consciousness with our material bodies and our understanding

178
00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:02.581
of working with a network of how we can benefit all beings and all life is

179
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:06.850
really critical.
Again,

180
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:10.930
across these traditions,
inner connectivity,
all of life is connected.

181
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.690
You'll find this through most many of these traditions,

182
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.990
there's causality or effects have action.

183
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.200
This could be car come across in Karma and western Buddhism or,

184
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.133
uh,

185
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.650
the golden rule in Christianity and love that pure vibration of the heart where

186
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:35.860
we really hold care and compassion for other beings.

187
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.250
And that replicates itself out in our actions.

188
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.943
And finally,

189
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.460
the wood is so essential for this point in time is the reclaiming of our

190
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:52.420
relationship with the feminine part of ourselves and our reconnection into

191
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:56.530
mother Gaia.
So gaia codex,

192
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.810
codex is novel Britain is the ancient found wisdom text.

193
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.310
It's about an ancient lineage of women called the priestesses of hysteria.

194
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.500
If an holding rejuvenation cause for the planet for Millennium,

195
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.240
the story takes place a flash moment and right after now when there's

196
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:18.070
environmental crisis,

197
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.460
a culture right at the brink of either transformation or collapse.

198
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.060
It's also remembrance and to the deep roots of our collective past by a coded,

199
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.570
since the reclaiming and the recasting of the lost history of the sacred

200
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:35.404
feminine,

201
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.700
which in many cultures is a lost part of our shared human story.

202
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.370
So I'm going to read now from the prologue to the book.

203
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.560
I'll give you a taste of how we go into the world.

204
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:53.730
<v 2>Okay?</v>

205
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.800
<v 1>Yeah.
To the easy part,</v>

206
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.180
three of the flow of ages and the rise and fall of cultures.

207
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.290
A secret codex has been inscribed for the tales and stories,

208
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.850
the rites and rituals of priestesses who are emanations of the channel,

209
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.660
goddess caretakers and guardians of our mother earth,

210
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.670
Terra Gaya in India,

211
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:21.671
in China and ancient consumer in ancient Greece and Egypt in the Serengeti and

212
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:25.220
in the Amazon and in the Celtic wilds.

213
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.450
Their flows a timeless tradition amongst those who have walked the earth.

214
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.920
We've year and remember the circle of life past from grandmother to mother,

215
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.270
daughter,
sister,
aunt Tonnies,

216
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.680
health safe in the heart of sisters who have incarnated through the ages.

217
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.880
This text is not written on pieces of paper or pup Jairus.

218
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.950
Instead it is inscribed and Holograms of light and the leaves of trees.

219
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.220
The hunt of bees and the codes have spiraled DNA hidden for many.

220
00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.240
The Codex is known to those with the eyes to see the ears to hear and the heart

221
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:05.300
to feel that which lies just beyond the veil.

222
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.520
It is said that the guy at Codex contains Joel,

223
00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:13.310
sees a planetary destiny for all beings and life on planet earth.

224
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:14.780
These women,

225
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.970
these priestesses of Astera have sheltered and protected the codex and when

226
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:20.661
necessary,

227
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:25.040
kept it hidden and ready for those moments of extraordinary crisis and

228
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:29.420
transformation when it will be needed once more for the nourishment and

229
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.880
regeneration of humankind.

230
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.410
Now,
the book has been out since August and it's been really amazing,

231
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.480
um,
to receive and it's being read all over the world,

232
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.770
have readers in Malta,

233
00:16:47.771 --> 00:16:52.690
in South Africa and Finland and down in South America and over in Japan and all

234
00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:53.860
over North America.

235
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.390
And it's been really amazing to get these long letters from women saying,

236
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.000
I know this.

237
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:06.390
There's something that I remember and what they will describe as their own

238
00:17:07.181 --> 00:17:10.910
childhood memories,
their own breakthrough memories.
And we,

239
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:15.430
many of us have had this when we've gone into a place that's either ecstasy or

240
00:17:15.431 --> 00:17:19.300
crisis where the veils become a little thinner.

241
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.460
And we remember these essence truths about our own soul,

242
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.800
about our people.
Um,

243
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.320
and each of the women that are writing are adding in their own story.

244
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.790
And how I understand the codex is working is more as an open source code.

245
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.770
It's a narrative that is also,
there is an activator for

246
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.280
PR essence with life.

247
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:56.370
<v 2>I want to read another passage here.
And these are from uh,</v>

248
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.050
at the beginning of each of the chapters.
There's these codes or Gaia,

249
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:02.160
codex nodes.

250
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.800
There are priestesses of Astera whose bodies and minds have been dedicated as

251
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:12.540
temples of memory into these women's bones flesh in Oregon,

252
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:18.110
Oregon's into their very selves report historical events and knowledge for

253
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.850
safekeeping.
In these women,

254
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.880
these memory keepers are storage jewels of revelation bins for healing and

255
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:27.480
creation.

256
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.880
Some say the true gift of these women is their ability to seamlessly connect

257
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:34.230
with all life itself.

258
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.570
Do you read the ancient records in the tiniest grain of sand in the veins of a

259
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:44.571
leaf and a constellation of stars or in the softness of a kiss upon the lips?

260
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.800
These memory keepers are both empty and full is they carry the wisdom through

261
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:52.770
the ages.

262
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.300
Gaia Codex node four 4.54281

263
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.040
<v 1>there's an ancient Buddhist,
um,</v>

264
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.270
Sutra called the [inaudible] trail,
which is one of my favorite.

265
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.800
It's my on a Buddhist.
It was actually put into written form and fourth,

266
00:19:14.801 --> 00:19:19.690
fifth century
BCE.

267
00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.570
And
I,

268
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.660
what it is is this amazing holographic text of how this reality is structured is

269
00:19:30.441 --> 00:19:34.820
a thousand page pages in written form and it talks about,

270
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.740
um,
very central to it injuries net,
which probably many of you know about.

271
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.160
And an interest net is this infinite,

272
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.280
infinite dimension on that where at every node there is a parole that reflects

273
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:52.220
all the other pearls.
And

274
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:53.630
<v 2>okay,</v>

275
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.630
<v 1>it's talked about is a inner technology that has been discovered by people who,</v>

276
00:19:58.881 --> 00:19:59.451
in this case,

277
00:19:59.451 --> 00:20:03.930
we're following the Buddhist path and we're going on the path of being a bowtie

278
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.773
soft fat.

279
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.960
The book also talks about the stages of becoming a bodhisattva and how we

280
00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:11.490
cultivate that.
Um,

281
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.290
and there's some beautiful descriptions of the body.

282
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.360
They call it the Buddha body,
but it's,

283
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.660
it's our body when we are in awaken consciousness and it'll talk about billions

284
00:20:25.281 --> 00:20:29.030
of worlds being on one little strand of hair.

285
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.640
And you know,
each fingertip holds the eons of the ages.

286
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.600
And so it's this way of where we become multidimensional beings through

287
00:20:40.851 --> 00:20:43.130
conscious contemplated practice.

288
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:45.663
<v 2>Okay.</v>

289
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.530
<v 1>And I would say as women,
um,</v>

290
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.880
we have a very close relationship to our bodies and a care of our bodies as

291
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:05.110
containers of the,
the universe and containers of life.

292
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.770
Okay.

293
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:12.770
Working with women when I've done that kind of the entry point often is first

294
00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:16.020
that place of where we're feeling,
feeling,
um,

295
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.830
the pain and the sorrow of generations of unbalanced.

296
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.800
And you know,
both all of us as human beings and for men too,

297
00:21:25.801 --> 00:21:27.780
we're both male and female.

298
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:33.240
And balance is what we are striving for right now.

299
00:21:33.241 --> 00:21:36.990
What we're cultivating,
what we're nourishing.
Um,

300
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.460
so it's cultivating the activation of the feminine rising,

301
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:45.410
but it's also cultivating the honoring of the,

302
00:21:45.411 --> 00:21:48.840
the masculine part of ourself in relationship to the female.

303
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:57.410
When did the sacred technologies that women have is the,
the circle.

304
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.410
And,
um,

305
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.280
the sacred circle is a way of activating energies and activating direct

306
00:22:07.041 --> 00:22:12.041
connection into wisdom streams as it's understood in the sacred feminine is the

307
00:22:13.251 --> 00:22:16.100
activation of the matrix.

308
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.030
But the original meaning of the Matrix,
which means womb.

309
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.250
Um,
I also kind of makes me laugh that,

310
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.503
um,

311
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.630
his status is a week for the wandering rooms.

312
00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:36.890
So hysteria happens when the womb is his wandering.

313
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.760
So it's important to anchor these circles and to anchor it together with other

314
00:22:45.861 --> 00:22:48.760
women.
It becomes,
um,

315
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:54.730
a place where we can start to directly connect with the codes of the planet

316
00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.020
directly,
connect with the wisdom that wants to come through,

317
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:05.240
directly connect with the creations that want to come through right now and give

318
00:23:05.241 --> 00:23:07.350
life and form.
Yeah.

319
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.830
This technology of the sacred circle with women gathering is a means to activate

320
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:19.890
new life
and to connect to life.

321
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.240
I think there's,

322
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.240
there's really many women right now that are giving voice to this rising sacred

323
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:35.800
feminine within us and many men that I've met,

324
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:39.200
two that are supportive of it.
Um,

325
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.470
it's a call to,
um,

326
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.383
be,

327
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.650
to continue life and healthy life here out in our planet.

328
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.520
When I really started to feel the tears of Gaia,

329
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.730
when you start to see,
get the stated rain forest,

330
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.260
when you see mountain tops in Virginia that had been blasted off.

331
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.390
Yeah,
this is our body,
this,

332
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.460
this is our source to life.

333
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.910
And we may be cosmic universal beings.

334
00:24:21.911 --> 00:24:25.300
We may be being as a pure mind and intelligence,

335
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.000
but we are citizens.

336
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.260
We are part of the mother earth.
And

337
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.860
if we say this story her and the way that we're going right now,

338
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.350
it will not be here for our children.

339
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.850
And we have a responsibility as women and as men

340
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.110
to cultivate life.
Okay?

341
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.310
Part of it is feeling.

342
00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:07.311
It is feeling the pain of what we as a culture have done.

343
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:13.930
And it's not easy.
We do a lot of things to intoxicate herself,
all of his half.

344
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.290
I have to,
um,
not feel,

345
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.750
but we need to feel.

346
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.830
And from that we can create a new way of,

347
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.300
of doing things.
Um,

348
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.330
that was unexpected.

349
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.930
Where to go from there.
Um,

350
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:50.230
when you talk a bit about just the gathering of women,
um,

351
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.470
again from the book,
okay.

352
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.880
It's called the temples of Astera.

353
00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.730
These women are called the priestesses of Astera.

354
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.180
Most of the forgotten that the temples of Astera exist.

355
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.860
This is by design.

356
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.480
Our temples have been carefully protected for in many cultures and political

357
00:26:13.481 --> 00:26:18.400
climates.
The revelation of our temples existence has meant a certain death.

358
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.060
Conquer is built their temples on our sacred grounds,

359
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:27.330
but even stone edify has fed edifices at some point fall the wheel is always

360
00:26:28.991 --> 00:26:29.824
turning.

361
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.870
Our temples are found in forest groves and the reflection of the clear glacial

362
00:26:34.871 --> 00:26:36.750
lake or on the mountain top,

363
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.380
you may find she's such a temple inside a simple hut or at the back of an

364
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.970
unassuming merchant's shop.

365
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.610
It is known that our physical bodies are one of our most profound and sacred

366
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.444
temples.

367
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.920
The temples of a stair I've been designed to look common to the common eye.

368
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:58.440
But for those with the eyes to see the temples of a stair are radiant with like

369
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.880
they are the repositories of what has been and what may be.

370
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.800
Once again on our mother earth,

371
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:10.500
the temples of Astera take inspiration from the natural harmonics of nature

372
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:13.680
herself,
from the Subatomic to the cosmic.

373
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.440
The walls of our temples are resonating,

374
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.350
fluctuating between light and matter.

375
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.730
Hence their fluidity and ability to transform in the eye of the beholder.

376
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.360
Our temples are portals where you can enter deeper dimensions both in the past

377
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.080
and in the future.
Palimpsest where multiple dimensions coexist,

378
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.360
stand in the center of one and you're anchored inside the wheel of life.

379
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.260
All the elements,
earth,
water and fire,

380
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:46.460
wind are all there in equal proportion.

381
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.333
So I think

382
00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.340
simplicity in clothes is that,
um,

383
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.960
we're here as defenders of Gaia where the voice of Mother Gaia,

384
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.440
whether we are male or female or vessels into which the future becomes manifest

385
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:11.250
in every one of us.

386
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.523
<v 2>Okay.</v>

387
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.130
<v 1>It's time for us to wake up from the days</v>

388
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:22.780
the Maya have repetitive action to go deeper into our central consciousness

389
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:30.170
and to understand when a meme or a seed is implanted inside of us and to

390
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.500
understand and give caution to what we're propagating for the future.

391
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.020
For those of you here who are essential to shaping reality through technology.

392
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.100
Consider the impact of what we're creating on generations to come.

393
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:49.680
Let's create why is conscious technologies which nourished life and consider the

394
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:54.000
wellbeing of all being and for the woman in the audience,

395
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.550
it's important for us in particular to return to our ancient ways they tried

396
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.550
into technologies of our lineage.

397
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.580
But to do it for at this moment now at this critical choice point,

398
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.260
it's time for us to gather in circles large and small,

399
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:15.470
and to open the portals for what has been long hidden and forgotten for we're

400
00:29:15.471 --> 00:29:20.471
defenders and mother Gaia and we are defenders of life and we're here to create

401
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:27.591
a vibrant life of farming future for our children and our children's children

402
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.690
for generations to come.
Thank you.

403
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.080
<v 0>So I,
uh,</v>

404
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:41.890
I know that from the book you have some really great imagery,
just wonderful,

405
00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:42.550
beautiful

406
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:46.720
<v 3>images.
So can you talk a little bit about that and the inspiration for those?</v>

407
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:49.030
Where do those come from?
And they're just beautiful.

408
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.750
<v 1>Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
it's such a great question.
Uh,</v>

409
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.360
when I'm,
uh,
creating,
and it's interesting,
I'm,

410
00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:03.160
I'm working with a lot of clients right now who are writing and,

411
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.970
uh,
women and men who are bringing in,
um,

412
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.970
a lot of these new flows of information.

413
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:15.460
And I found that I actually received the information first as a visual.

414
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.010
So,
um,

415
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.870
what I mean by that is that there will be,
um,

416
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.480
and this is like going into the creative process.

417
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.890
When I went to write the book,
um,
there is,

418
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.870
this scene would come in and it'd be like watching a movie.

419
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.220
And for me it was so visceral.
And so since Storyful,
um,

420
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:43.060
and I was just the transcriber writing it,
you know,
okay,
wow,
okay,

421
00:30:43.061 --> 00:30:46.690
this is happening,
this is happening to the character.
Um,

422
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.700
and even though a lot of my background had trained my mind and the intellectual

423
00:30:51.701 --> 00:30:56.701
process and it studied religions and I've been a curator on different projects

424
00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:01.420
working with a kind of global wisdom when it came to that process,

425
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:03.700
it was just going into these living worlds.

426
00:31:03.701 --> 00:31:07.570
And it's a way a traveling both in the writing process,

427
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:10.150
in the past and the future.
Um,

428
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.010
so those are images or anchors and I,

429
00:31:13.011 --> 00:31:17.050
I see it as like a symbolic language actually.
Um,

430
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:22.260
and it was really essential I thought in the publication of the book to have the

431
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:24.270
images as part of the story,
kind of the,

432
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.410
like the ancient illuminated manuscripts.

433
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.690
<v 3>And one of the calls to action that you had for,
um,</v>

434
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.860
women here and just,
um,
men that they channel their inner feminine,

435
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.410
um,
was to gather and circles.

436
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.060
And I wonder if you could share more like what you mean by that.

437
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:45.400
Is that more of like a symbolic thing or,

438
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:50.000
I'm thinking of my brain like nude gatherings or something like,
yeah.
Um,

439
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.530
where we gather on the fire and like share stories.
I don't know.
I'm curious,
um,

440
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.840
if you have any suggestions.

441
00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.710
<v 1>Um,
it's a great question and I think,
you know,</v>

442
00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:05.711
gathering in circle is something that's so natural once we go into it.

443
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.520
Um,
especially for women,
you know,
and,

444
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.970
uh,
I,

445
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:17.480
I'm seeing it as a ground roots call to action,

446
00:32:17.481 --> 00:32:19.730
but I'm also seeing it as medicine.

447
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.600
We're doing it to come together because there's a lot of healing and

448
00:32:23.601 --> 00:32:26.870
transportation that happens first.
You know,

449
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:31.930
and that's really essential and a lot of the energies that we're working with

450
00:32:32.331 --> 00:32:35.990
right now,
none of us can do it alone.
We need to do it together.

451
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.290
And it really is this place where our personal,

452
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.830
our personal joy is our personal pains interact with the larger ethos of what's

453
00:32:46.251 --> 00:32:49.880
happening on the planet.
Um,
with a guy,
a codex,

454
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:51.980
there's been women that had been gathering around the book,

455
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:56.981
around the planet and it's really wonderful and we're going to be coming in the

456
00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.180
end of May,
probably mid May.

457
00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:02.540
We're going to be having just free online gathering so that those are,

458
00:33:02.541 --> 00:33:05.960
that are gathering and just,
and just some basic blueprints.

459
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:10.961
I'm really big on people being able to access the room knowing,

460
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.050
cause I think once what I've found,
when the circle set up right,

461
00:33:15.051 --> 00:33:20.051
you can start to access these wisdoms and you have these amazing things of stuff

462
00:33:20.421 --> 00:33:25.160
that maybe we haven't been taught that starts to flow through us.
So,

463
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.750
um,
but anyway,

464
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:30.320
it will be having that and I'll give my information at the end hearing.

465
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.760
It'd be wonderful to see you here,
all of you there and men too.

466
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.470
And get your [inaudible].

467
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.730
<v 0>Yeah,
I'm getting,
it's like a community.
So it's,</v>

468
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.730
it's almost like embracing that feminine,
uh,

469
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.960
value and trade of community and associating with others,

470
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:53.260
men or women about this issue and how we can help the planet.

471
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:54.873
And

472
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.480
<v 1>that could,
thank you.
So it's almost kind of going into the root word of that,</v>

473
00:33:58.481 --> 00:34:03.370
right?
The communion,
the commune,
the community,
the um,

474
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:09.060
yeah,
there's just that,
that,
that empathy is the heart.
Right.

475
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.370
<v 3>Um,
while you were talking,</v>

476
00:34:11.371 --> 00:34:13.810
especially it kind of when you became overcome with emotion.

477
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.550
Thank you for sharing that.
Um,
I was curious,

478
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.760
I'm just curious generally to hear your thought process and why it sounds like

479
00:34:20.761 --> 00:34:23.480
it's a fiction book more or less,
um,

480
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.700
kind of how you decided which should be fiction or nonfiction because these are

481
00:34:26.701 --> 00:34:29.370
also very serious factual issues.

482
00:34:29.371 --> 00:34:32.250
And also I'm getting shivers as you're saying it.

483
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.740
<v 1>Thanks for tuning in.
It was actually when I started to,</v>

484
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.880
to write the book and I got the,

485
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.120
that I needed to write the book.

486
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.530
I actually took three years and,
uh,

487
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:50.590
was very fortunate to receive a bequest from Sean Healy who is an early,

488
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.630
uh,
silicon valley and,
or you can go over and silicon genesis,

489
00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.950
genesis over at Stanford did a lot,
does it work with bio chip.
Um,

490
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.420
she's passed.

491
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:05.400
And I say she because she became a transgender at the end of her life and it

492
00:35:05.401 --> 00:35:07.770
could have been fiction or it could have been nonfiction.

493
00:35:07.771 --> 00:35:11.550
And I felt that fiction at this point in time allows us to be,

494
00:35:11.551 --> 00:35:16.551
have more brain elasticity to just stretch your imaginations a bit more on what

495
00:35:17.611 --> 00:35:20.570
could be without having to go into it.

496
00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:23.760
And I do it too going into our critical mind of like,
well no,

497
00:35:23.761 --> 00:35:27.990
this isn't how it is right now or you know,
going into logic so much.

498
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.070
So it was a very specific choice with that.
Um,

499
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.550
yeah,
just to give us more of X.

500
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.590
And I wanted to give a real visceral since oil where sometimes with facts,

501
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.530
um,
I mean facts done well are going to be visceral into the soil,

502
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:48.390
but I wanted to have more of this real something that taste and eat and smell

503
00:35:48.391 --> 00:35:50.880
and yeah,
it's a great question.

504
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:57.770
<v 0>I'm just about to finish this like year and a half immersion called inner yoga,</v>

505
00:35:58.861 --> 00:35:59.461
this whole thing.

506
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:03.630
And I just started a new job here and I'm kind of crossing these two worlds,

507
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:04.630
so I'm glad you're here today.

508
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.100
And I was just wondering more about your personal background of like your

509
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:15.780
spiritual influences or rituals that lead this and if there's any,

510
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.070
um,
I don't know,

511
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:22.071
just certain practices that you do regularly or rituals or people you follow.

512
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.910
Anything else you'd recommend?
Thank

513
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:30.290
<v 1>you.
Um,
I'll make it brief.</v>

514
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.030
My journey's been a long one.
You know,
um,
you know,

515
00:36:35.031 --> 00:36:36.440
when I was 19,
20,

516
00:36:36.441 --> 00:36:41.240
I started out and completely different field and then got,

517
00:36:41.241 --> 00:36:45.020
which I know some Googlers did that I needed to take three years off and travel

518
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:45.854
around the world.

519
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:52.210
And I ended up going to Tibet and India and down in the Amazon and then came

520
00:36:53.151 --> 00:36:57.290
back and went to UC Berkeley and studied religious studies.
Um,

521
00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.780
I was journalism to begin with.

522
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:04.040
It's going to become television anchor or something.
And then,

523
00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:05.270
and then from religious studies,

524
00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:10.040
I went into technology and how it had a high tech startup in the 90s,
um,

525
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.760
that was working with earlier forms of virtual reality.
Um,

526
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.410
so my practice became the crack open.
It wasn't pretty,

527
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.150
it was messy,
you know,

528
00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:25.151
it was like me going and just the top of the head being ripped open.

529
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.980
And all of a sudden everything that I thought was true wasn't true and I needed

530
00:37:33.981 --> 00:37:34.814
to,

531
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:40.450
my solution to that was to travel to bed to 1984 and sit with Buddhist monks.

532
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.470
And a lot of my practice right now is in the,
um,

533
00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.920
the tantric Buddhist Yoga tradition.
Um,

534
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.520
my main teachers are in Butan.
Um,

535
00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.160
and I meditate every day.
I work with the goddesses.

536
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:04.160
Sally Kempton,
I don't know if you know of her work.

537
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:08.450
She's been one of my mentors for many years.

538
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.690
Um,
so the embodiment,
I think for women,

539
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.160
the Hindu and Buddhist tantric tradition for embodying the goddess,

540
00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:20.000
I find really useful because there are these whole templates and they're almost

541
00:38:20.001 --> 00:38:25.001
like kind of finished aesthetic multimedia templates of how we can have all the

542
00:38:26.361 --> 00:38:28.280
information embodied in there.

543
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:32.450
And it's a really interesting technology actually I think because you have like

544
00:38:32.451 --> 00:38:34.100
a,
as you know,
a Mandela,

545
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.830
but I'm Dala also has a link to connection into a mantra,

546
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:39.820
which is a sound,

547
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.990
which also has a link connection into the image of the goddess that's easier for

548
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:48.400
you to just kind of,
oh,
I will be.
Her will will resonate together.
Right?

549
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:49.990
And,
and so it's,

550
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:54.991
it's a fairly fuss I found sophisticated system of embodiment and,

551
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.200
um,
and they cultivate,
you know,

552
00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:04.210
the steep karmic compassion.
So,

553
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.570
um,
I really look forward to hearing more about your journey because I,

554
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.710
it just feels like it's something really big and whatever your eye,

555
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.650
I mean not to put you on the spot in the room and we can talk it,

556
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.890
but it feels I can,

557
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.920
I can feel that after these couple of years there's something quite

558
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:28.870
extraordinary you're bringing through.
So thank you.

559
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.190
<v 3>And one more question.</v>

560
00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.210
So when you were getting the visuals and trying to write this,
was it

561
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:36.650
<v 1>okay?</v>

562
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:40.160
<v 3>Was it a all at once,
like through like it would took three years to write,</v>

563
00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:44.800
but did you just get an entire storyline and know what you're exactly getting to

564
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.410
right?
Or was it piece by piece and unfolded over years of what happened?

565
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:52.490
<v 1>Right.
Um,
the way that I received the information,</v>

566
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.520
and it's interesting that in this illuminated creation writing program that

567
00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.500
we're doing right now,
um,
a lot of this,

568
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.370
almost all the students that signed up for the program are receiving the

569
00:40:04.371 --> 00:40:07.700
information in similar ways,
which is like a blueprint.
At first,

570
00:40:07.701 --> 00:40:11.300
I received it as kind of like a mandelic blueprint.

571
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.050
And I actually took a piece of paper,
drew down certain images,

572
00:40:15.051 --> 00:40:19.640
put down certain key words of what the key,
um,
means,

573
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.590
if you will,
in the books he and from,
you know,
were there.
Um,

574
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.960
and then I didn't pressure myself to say,
okay,

575
00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:34.670
let's start at the beginning.
I just let whatever scene would come up.

576
00:40:34.671 --> 00:40:38.690
And there's these key anchor scenes.
One of them,
um,

577
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.840
give the guy a codex was there's this extraordinary gathering of women at the

578
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.450
Chateau Lumiere.

579
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:48.680
And all of a sudden I found myself in the midst of this room with women from all

580
00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:51.890
different cultures and places,
um,

581
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.160
who were gathering at this particular time on the planet to bring about

582
00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:03.230
rejuvenation.
And it was so since oral,
I mean,
it was,

583
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:09.200
I was curious and in my job as a writer at that point was just to,

584
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.430
I was described really,
you know,
um,

585
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.760
so a lot of the key themes would come like that and pretty much in their

586
00:41:16.761 --> 00:41:20.660
complete form.
And then narrative arc constructure you know,

587
00:41:20.661 --> 00:41:24.200
it basically took a heroine's journey.
It was the narrative structure.

588
00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.910
And then of course the editing's a whole other,
I want to say editing's a bitch,

589
00:41:28.911 --> 00:41:33.170
but
it's a whole other process.

590
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:38.030
While I was very lucky to have some wonderful people to work with.
Anyway,

591
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:41.510
wonderful to be here and thanks for your great questions.
Um,

592
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.520
if you're interested in diving in deeper,

593
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:48.521
you can go to www Daya codex.com for those of you here today,

594
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:51.230
the book is over available over here.

595
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.890
It's also available on Amazon as well as the website.
Um,

596
00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.260
I am offering a nine week one on one mentoring program and illuminated creation,

597
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:02.490
the art of visionary writing,
um,

598
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:05.960
where we dive in deep and both look at structural start stuff.

599
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:10.990
And it's really geared towards if you feel that you're bringing in

600
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:16.070
