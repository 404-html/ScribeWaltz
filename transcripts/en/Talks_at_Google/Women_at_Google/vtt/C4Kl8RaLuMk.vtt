00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.490
Carolyn venaseal team.

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.640
Our guest today has been in video games since roughly the start of the current

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.993
century.

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.620
She got hooked on designing them and then on observing what kinds of games other

5
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:23.370
people are making and connecting those and also what kinds of games people

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.070
haven't been making an or just thinking of now.
So Carolyn,
Venice,
Hilton.

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.820
<v 2>Hi everybody.
As Coase introduced me,
I'm Carolyn,</v>

9
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:40.654
Dan Haseltine,

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.400
and I'm here today because everybody can dance.

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.830
I know there's this punchline that normally goes after that.
Everybody can dance,

12
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:54.430
but not every patient buddy should dance.
I don't believe that.

13
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.730
I believe that everybody can dance and that everybody who wants to dance should

14
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.940
dance.
I think they should dance.
I think they should sing.

15
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.440
I think they should write poetry.

16
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.890
I think they should do whatever our expression moves them.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.880
I think that our expression is a natural human right that transcends every brown

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.510
boundary we have.

19
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.270
The problem is this hasn't been true for our youngest art form and by our

20
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:25.150
youngest art form.
Of course,
I'm talking about video games.

21
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.260
Historically there has been a very high boundary,

22
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.410
a very high border to be in part of video games because historically in order to

23
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.800
make video games you need to be a programmer.

24
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.540
You need to know somebody who can program and who's willing to work with you or

25
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:47.290
you need to have the money to hire a programmer.
For this reason,

26
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.430
the people who've been making video games are extremely different than the

27
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:55.780
people who've been singing or writing poetry or dancing.

28
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.950
I have a quick question,
uh,
before I fully get into this,

29
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:03.070
which is I'd like to know how many people here are programmers.

30
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.030
Great.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Just didn't want to make any assumptions.

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.280
No,
there's a terminology thing I should hit before I keep going.

32
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.670
There is a difference of opinion about the difference between coding and

33
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:20.904
programming,

34
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.980
so I just want to admit I'm going to use those synonymously for the most part

35
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.830
when I talk about someone who is a non programmer,

36
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.070
what I mean is someone who is not fluent in any scripting language or I mean

37
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.730
someone who is not fluent in any programming language or I mean someone who

38
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:42.360
identified themselves to me as not being a programmer because a lot of this is

39
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:46.830
about self identification
set.

40
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.970
I want to take a step back and tell you a little bit about my history with video

41
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:52.804
games,

42
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.810
which starts in 1980 when I was born into a house with a computer which was true

43
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.470
of fewer than 1% of American households have that time

44
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.560
when I was five years old.
My Dad,
because he has awesome,

45
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.370
introduced me to colossal cave adventure.

46
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.560
I thought that this was the best thing I had ever seen.

47
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.840
I could tell computer things and the computer would do things.
It was fantastic.

48
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.040
He printed out the source code in Fortran on our old dot matrix printer.

49
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.630
It was about this big from the perspective of someone about this tall and I

50
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:34.330
would carry it to daycare.
I wanted to understand it.

51
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.690
I wanted to know what was going on.
Fourth Grade,

52
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.610
my fourth grade elementary had a school computer lab.

53
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.650
I met logo,
their logo with the turtle.
The turtle is awesome.

54
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.790
You told that what you wanted to do and it would just do it on the spot and you

55
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.730
could make procedures and you could link all these commands together.

56
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.290
In fifth grade I had decided I wanted to make video games.
I had this idea,

57
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.190
it was like a Mashup of wit of Infocomm's wish,

58
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:07.090
Springer and colossal cave adventure and Jurassic Park.
It had dinosaurs.

59
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.080
It was going to be great and I would map it all out on graph paper and I would

60
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:15.130
write all the text descriptions down by eighth grade.
I knew a little basic,

61
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:19.030
I knew a little pascal.
Uh,
at one point I borrowed a book from the library.

62
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.330
It had a explanation of Conway's game of life and basic.

63
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.070
So I typed it into the computer and it was a really bad implementation of

64
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.550
Conway's game of life.
So every time the sales hit the edge of the board,

65
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.384
they would break.

66
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.390
My parents saw what I was doing and one of them showed me one way to make it

67
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.310
better than the other.
Showed me the other way to make it better.
Okay.
Oh,

68
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.760
you know the millions of ways you could've made that program better.

69
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.170
It was a pretty bad implementation,

70
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.640
but the point I'm trying to make here is that I wanted video games.

71
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.220
I wanted this,
I wanted to be part of this.

72
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.670
I had wanted it my entire life and I had every advantage.

73
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.700
There was a computer in my house when I was born.

74
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.620
I have never lived in a house without a computer.

75
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.300
Both of my parents were programmers.
There was a,

76
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.170
there was a computer lab at my school.

77
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.220
I had basic programming concepts from about five years old.

78
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.060
So I went to college and I majored in creative writing and I never took a single

79
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:24.061
computer science course because one of my friends had told me that the comp side

80
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:26.670
professor who taught comp side,

81
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:30.220
one o one deliberately washed people out who didn't want to major.

82
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.240
I didn't want to.
Major programming is great,

83
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:39.241
but it was a means to an end and there weren't any game programming classes.

84
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.530
I didn't know how to take my little bit of basic,
my little bit of Pascal,

85
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.570
even if it had been expanded,

86
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.230
I didn't know how to take that and make something with graphics.

87
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.450
I didn't know how to make something that you could put on a disk in a box on a

88
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:59.930
shelf and then could go to the store and buy it and put it in their council.

89
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.410
That was,
those were the people who made real games.

90
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.490
It wasn't a meaningful aspiration for me.

91
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.260
And so I faded out of games.

92
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.030
I'm standing here in front of you today and I did say I was a prep professional

93
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:20.780
game developers.
So you can tell that some point.
I got back on the horse,

94
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.010
but I didn't do it by learning to program.
I came in the back door.

95
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.500
There was a company called Sigma Tronics Games and around,
let's see,

96
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.460
they started somewhere in 94 95 I think,

97
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.080
and I apologize if I just got that wrong,

98
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.830
but the pertinent part is that what they were making was a pay for play mud and

99
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:44.831
it was available on America Online and I wound up doing volunteer customer

100
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:50.240
support for them in exchange for my pay for played being play instead of pay.

101
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.750
So I got through the door there.

102
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.800
Eventually they hired me on when they hired me,
it was to run in game events.

103
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.830
It was to write documentation and it was to do more customer support.

104
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.710
At that point I was in the games industry and I had no idea how to make my own

105
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.160
game.
I knew how to support someone else's,

106
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.950
but games were for people who knew how to program,

107
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.420
they were for people who could put that disk in that box on that shelf.

108
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.750
I didn't know how to do any of that,
which meant they weren't for me

109
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.040
so obviously
at some point I got over this.

110
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.550
I got over this because of a system called informed seven informed seven made it

111
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.380
possible for me to release.
My first game.

112
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.040
One I open is a psychic horror game.

113
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.390
It was a collaboration between me and my friend Katelyn Sandal and it came out

114
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.420
in 2010 the reason I was able to create and release a game is because of a

115
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:59.861
system called informed seven informed seven looks like that it does not look

116
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.410
like a programming language.

117
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.010
To me with my limited background and experience,

118
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.480
when I saw something like this,
when I saw something that looked like English,

119
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.820
I was a creative writing major.
English was comfortable.

120
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:17.510
I knew how to work with it.
I had the confidence.
I said yes,

121
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.540
I can make something that looks like that informed seven was created by Graham

122
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.180
Nelson.

123
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.320
Graham Nelson was looking specifically at non programmers and trying to make a

124
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:29.210
system that was more comfortable for them.

125
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.100
It has an integrated development environment is actually a Trans Pilar.

126
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.060
It does not go from informed seven to working game.

127
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.530
It goes from an informed seven two and form six to work in game.
Uh,

128
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.590
what you're looking at right here is a relatively common in interactive fiction

129
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.980
snapshot of a game called cloak of darkness.
It's a very bad game,

130
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.420
but the point of cloak of darkness is to show how various systems handle the

131
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:01.890
creation of various game elements.
This is what cloak of darkness.
Well,

132
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.910
this chunk of cloak of darkness looks like uninformed six.

133
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.260
If you know how to program,
this is not scary looking.

134
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.760
If you don't computer code is intimidating.

135
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.750
Computer Code is intimidating because the computer doesn't think like a person.

136
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.000
The point of learning to program is learning to think like the computer
operates.

137
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.400
That's the whole point of computer science.

138
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.960
If you don't know how to think like the computer operates,

139
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.960
then you need some kind of bridge.

140
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.500
You need something that makes it easier for the way you think,

141
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:45.501
to correspond with the way that the computer operates and that's what informed

142
00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:50.430
seven was for me.
When I originally launched my game,

143
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:51.810
I was working at harmonics.
By then.

144
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.760
I'm not going to go into the details of how I got there,

145
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:56.700
but assume it was kind of like how I got into games in the first place.

146
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.600
When I launched my game,
uh,
I was really excited about it.

147
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:02.490
I told a bunch of people at harmonics,
Hey,

148
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:05.700
I made a game and one of the engineers and has to see my source code.

149
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.350
I would be happy to show you my source code I sent over my source code.
Uh,

150
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:13.620
informed seven actually tells you your word counts dead,
your line count.

151
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.530
So I knew that it was upward of a hundred thousand words.

152
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:18.930
I had no idea what that meant in lines of code.
I still don't,

153
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.770
but I sent it over and he sent it back and said,

154
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:27.150
you accidentally sent me or design notes.
I wanted to see the source code,
but,

155
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.830
but that was my source code.
I didn't have anything else to show him.

156
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.330
He had looked at it and seen it as something that a non programmer could do.

157
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.240
Something that a non programmer could understand.
Inform seven,

158
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.300
don't get me wrong,
can actually do some extraordinarily complicated things,

159
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.340
but informed seven was released in 2006,

160
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.883
uh,

161
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.680
in the year 2006 use of informed six and dropped like a rock and by the time you

162
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:03.561
get to 2012 informed six alone was hardly being used anymore at all because the

163
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.880
people who were making interactive fiction where people who were coming from a

164
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:11.400
programming background but also from a writing background,

165
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.140
they had the same experience I did.

166
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.950
Also informed seven has an integrated development environment which makes

167
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:18.000
everything so much better.

168
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.360
Here's the problem with informed seven informed seven is a scripting language.

169
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.860
It has very specific syntax.

170
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:30.750
The Syntax is actually as specific as the syntax for informed six,

171
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.670
which means that even though it looked intuitive and it was easy to read,
Oh man,

172
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:39.180
you can get the most amazing compiler errors out of it and because it's trying

173
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:42.630
very much to help you and figure out what you meant to do.
Yeah,

174
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:46.020
it's not as simple as I think there might be a semicolon missing.

175
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.310
It's kind of amazing.
Actually.
I love informed seven.

176
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.530
I don't claim that it's for everybody.

177
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.050
I'm going to digress for a second because I do come,
uh,

178
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.010
as a hobbyist very much from an interactive fiction background,

179
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.080
I'm seven is used to make purser games.
Parser games tend to look

180
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.750
<v 1>okay</v>

181
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.500
<v 2>like that.</v>

182
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.980
When someone who doesn't know how to play parser games plays a parser game,

183
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.660
they try commands that don't work because they don't understand the limits

184
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.360
because they haven't been taught to play parser games.

185
00:12:18.361 --> 00:12:19.830
There's an actual skill involved here.

186
00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:24.810
You need to know that you need to make these known verb verb noun combinations

187
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.370
and you need to understand that it's just not understanding English.

188
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.550
There are a lot of people who play and love Parser Games.

189
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.930
There are a lot of people who get frustrated by the fact that the prompt is

190
00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:39.540
giving them this illusion of infinite choice.

191
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.470
But in reality they have very limited choices available to them.

192
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.440
<v 1>Okay,</v>

193
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.350
<v 2>but there are systems that are easier than this.</v>

194
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.710
This is the other major branch of interactive fiction.

195
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.640
It's called choice-based interactive fiction and it actually comes from the

196
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:01.510
tradition of game books and from choose your own adventures.

197
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.660
Instead of giving you an illusion of infinite choice,

198
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.580
it shows you exactly what you can do in that room and the actuality is all you

199
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:10.900
can do in that room is walk around.

200
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.600
That makes it so much less frustrating to people who don't have the skill to

201
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:19.300
interact with that program who don't have the experience.

202
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.060
So bringing it back to game engines,

203
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.960
what's needed is a game engine that is just as accessible as this.

204
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.760
Something that takes that experience of I don't know what to type and turns it

205
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:34.594
into.

206
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.840
I know what I can type or not even type this is construct too and construct to

207
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.370
is a visual scripting engine for making graphical games is something that

208
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.310
presents everything in menus.
It presents everything with drag and drop.

209
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.790
What you're seeing right here is actually a script in the making.
Uh,

210
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.920
if you click the little heart image,

211
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:02.310
which is the AA friends sprite with the left mouse button,

212
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.790
it will rotate 90 degrees and it's currently offering me the chance to add

213
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:10.450
another action to this script.
This is not a complicated script,

214
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.660
but once you start adding them together and chaining them,

215
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:17.080
just like a small program can become something dramatically larger,

216
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.560
a small script can join with others to become a game.

217
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:31.530
Just because it works with visual scripting does not mean that a program is

218
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:36.530
necessarily going to be simple.
All it's doing is making the syntax accessible.

219
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.910
Here you can see that there are a lot of things you can do from the system

220
00:14:40.911 --> 00:14:43.280
object,
many of which are extremely important,

221
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.970
many of which require mastering the engine.
Apart from the scripting side,

222
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.910
there are actually a number engines in this style.

223
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:58.210
They are engines that are based around the idea that it will be easier for

224
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.490
people to code if they don't have to fight with syntax.

225
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.620
This is an image from the game.
Air Escape,
the fit,
the fall of gravity.

226
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.380
Air Escape was greenlight through steam.

227
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.510
It received multiple awards including an award on its physics engines.

228
00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:14.344
Specifically.

229
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.840
It was created entirely in construct to it is a fiendishly difficult puzzle.

230
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:25.031
Platformer and the developers selected this system specifically because he

231
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:31.040
didn't have experience making games with programming yet.

232
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.610
He needed something that was accessible to where he was at the time he was

233
00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:37.550
starting
there or another.

234
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.320
There are a number of other game engines in this same vein.
Click team,

235
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.910
click team fusion,
uh,

236
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.880
gamemaker studio game salad and Stencil.

237
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.750
The last one,
it's dental,
uh,
and there are others but those are some major ones.

238
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.260
I'm not going to go through in detail all of them because what I actually want

239
00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:00.410
to do is move to show you a completely different kind of game engine.

240
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.500
This is twine.
Twine is designed specifically for making,

241
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.580
is designed specifically for making choice based interactive fiction games.

242
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.080
What you're seeing here is the design interface and since twine games are played

243
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:19.690
as this series of webpages,

244
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.080
essentially you can see with a map the webpage forming.

245
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.740
This is actually the exact same cloak of darkness section that you saw before.

246
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.450
Although I didn't implement the rest of it.

247
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.660
Here's the thing about twine I didn't try to teach you in form seven I didn't

248
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.310
try to teach you construct too.

249
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.290
Those take half an hour at least to teach somebody if what you want is for them

250
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:46.340
to go from zero to game and that's regardless of whether they have a programming

251
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:50.450
background or not.
Let's face it,
a language is a language,
their syntax to learn.

252
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.880
There's system,
there's the system to learn.

253
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.590
I can teach you twine in 30 seconds.
I have done this repeatedly.

254
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.180
You can make a basic twine game with the information you get in 30 seconds,

255
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.540
which is start at the start type whatever you want into that passage.

256
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.600
Whenever you want to make a link to a new passage,
put in double brackets,

257
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.840
it will open up a new,
it will open up a new passage for you.

258
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.250
Keep going until you're done.
Hit Build,
build story.

259
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.890
You now have a playable webpage.
You can put it anywhere you want.

260
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:22.940
People can play your game.

261
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.070
It is that simple and that is why people are flocking to twine right now because

262
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:32.000
there is no game engine.
More accessible.
Twine is free.

263
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.830
It is also open source and it supports a lot more than simple hyperlink.

264
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.600
It has full support for variables,
for conditional logic,

265
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.930
for extensions with images and CSS and video and sound and it also extends with

266
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:51.580
Java script,
but for that basic game,

267
00:17:51.581 --> 00:17:54.900
that first experience of I made a thing.
There it is.

268
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.670
It's amazing for someone who never thought they could make a game before.

269
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.480
Here's a different engine choice of games.

270
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.300
Try some games is also an interactive fiction engine,

271
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.860
but it's an interactive fiction engine that is aimed at a very specific audience

272
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.430
and it's aimed at a very specific audience because it's used to create a very

273
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:16.980
specific kind of game choice.

274
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:20.850
Script is used specifically to make novel length interactive fiction.

275
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.750
Choice of games is a commercial company that is making its money on selling

276
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:31.230
novel length,
interactive fiction.
They are not aiming at programmers,

277
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.850
they're aiming at writers,

278
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.380
specifically writers who never intended to make this kind of system.

279
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.100
It's as simple as it can be because they need it to be accessible to this

280
00:18:41.101 --> 00:18:42.360
specific audience.

281
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.450
There isn't actually an ID for choice of games for choice of games choice
script.

282
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.960
The system you use actually has extraordinarily simple syntax and you just write

283
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:58.590
it in manuscript form.
When you're done,

284
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.300
what you get looks like this.

285
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.590
This is actually optimized for people playing on their iPads or other

286
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:09.360
touchscreen devices,
but you can play on a computer as well.
Uh,
and again,

287
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.440
it's very intuitive to play.
Select your option.
Click next,
move on.

288
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:16.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

289
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.220
<v 2>These are three examples of engines that are also aimed at creating very</v>

290
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:24.360
specific kinds of games.
Run Paya specifically for visual novels.

291
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.120
RPG maker is specifically for RPGs.

292
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.650
Adventure Games studio is specifically for Click and pointed ventures.
Again,

293
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:33.720
I'm not going to walk you through the full details of all of these.

294
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.060
<v 2>All of these engines</v>

296
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.000
are aimed or had as a primary audience.

297
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.260
People who don't know how to program in mind.
This one

298
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.690
was aimed at programmers.
Unity is a big deal.

299
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.790
They currently have 45% of the market share for game engines used in commercial

300
00:19:57.791 --> 00:20:00.910
games.
47% of developers are using it.

301
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.940
4.5 million developers are registered and they have 600 million gamers at a

302
00:20:07.061 --> 00:20:10.120
minimum playing projects created with unity.

303
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:11.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

304
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.660
<v 2>Unity uses c sharp and Java script as it's languages.</v>

305
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.650
This is not something that's accessible to people who don't know how to program

306
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.770
except that a company saw the void.

307
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.780
The people who make playmaker put a visual scripting system on top of unity.

308
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.980
It is in use at actually some rather large studios.

309
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:38.290
Most famously blizzard used the visual scripting system playmaker when it was

310
00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:39.730
making Hearthstone.

311
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.760
Hearthstone is a digital collectible card game and it's something like the

312
00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:49.390
income is estimated at about 20 million month.
It's a very successful card game.

313
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.250
The reason why they used a playmaker was so that when they're 15 person team

314
00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:55.240
that was working on it,

315
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.230
the art team was capable of building things in the engine without needing to

316
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:04.050
pull programmer off what they were doing at the time.
Specifically.

317
00:21:04.051 --> 00:21:09.051
Playmaker is a visual state editor and it's also a runtime library,

318
00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:13.950
but the net effect is only visual scripting system that was built directly into

319
00:21:13.951 --> 00:21:18.870
unity in addition to large studios using it for specialized projects.

320
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.740
It is possible to make a full game with playmaker

321
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.170
Hoff Stein is the founder of little worlds interactive.

322
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.360
Her launch product was the counting kingdom,

323
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.010
which is a tower defense game that is aimed at teaching kids arithmetic.

324
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.690
She made it completely in unity with the support of playmaker.

325
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.690
No,
I've been talking about non programmers.
I've been talking about programmers.

326
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.910
When it comes to game development,

327
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.300
do programmers have an advantage over non programmers?

328
00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.380
It depends on what you mean by advantage.

329
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.220
A lot of people ask if non programmers can use these tools to compete with

330
00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:05.610
programmers,
but that depends so much on what you mean by compete.

331
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.920
When I talk about game developers,

332
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.520
I'm not just talking about people who want to make games commercially.

333
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.990
I'm going to show you one of my favorite quotes about game development.

334
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.340
It's from Zoe Quinn.

335
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

336
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.770
<v 2>How do I not game jams go make a thing.
It doesn't have to be good or finished.</v>

337
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.240
Okay,
cool.
You one,

338
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.140
this is an attitude I can get behind 100% game jams are not intended to be

339
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:33.970
polished commercial games.

340
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.860
This is kind of like a 48 hour hackathon you want to get from zero to game and

341
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.460
at the end you have the joy of having done it and possibly you polished and

342
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:43.750
refine it and continue,

343
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.490
but the concept of compete isn't meaningful.

344
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:50.290
If you look at game development as a whole,

345
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:53.380
it's only meaningful if you look at game development in a commercial market.

346
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.660
I made this game once,

347
00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.820
it was specifically for one of my friends and it was called coffee with about

348
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:05.821
five e's on the end and it was this tiny text adventure about how awesome it is

349
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:08.770
when you wake up in the morning and someone else brings you a cup of coffee.

350
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.210
It couldn't compete with Super Mario Brothers for the,

351
00:23:13.211 --> 00:23:18.130
we get Super Mario Brothers for the we,
you couldn't compete with coffee.

352
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.060
They're of in two completely separate worlds during two completely separate

353
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:26.320
universes.
Yes.
Video Games are a commercial market,

354
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.760
so are novels.
Not everyone wants to be the next J K Rowling.

355
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.710
Some people just want to make little games that they can show to their friends

356
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.950
or just make them for fun or just keep them for themselves.

357
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.990
These concepts exist in writing.
People write for fun people,

358
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:46.070
right for their friends.
People write for themselves.

359
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.330
Postcard game is the term given to a game that is just for one other person.

360
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.290
Diary game is the term given to a game that you made just for you.

361
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.880
These things you might show them to someone else later,

362
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.600
but that's not necessarily why you made it.
This is an art form.

363
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.590
People practice this art form for themselves.

364
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

365
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.510
<v 2>As I was preparing for this talk,</v>

366
00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.260
I spoke to a number of game doves,

367
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.150
actually about 35 who are not programmers.
I asked them,

368
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.010
why do you want to make games?
What's in this for you?

369
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.230
Is it really worth it to you?

370
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.850
I got an amazing variety of answers back and I just want to read you a few

371
00:24:35.251 --> 00:24:38.640
excerpts that exemplify themes that people talked about.

372
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.890
One of them was joy.
Darryl Kelvin told me for me,

373
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.750
games are windows on other worlds,
discovering new things,
ideas,

374
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.790
ecosystems.
It's about creating tiny play spaces to create and share wonders.

375
00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.830
People talked about the unique nature of the medium.
Valentino,

376
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:02.190
Christos Dymo told me there are two reasons I make games.

377
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.560
One is that I love the idea of creating something that people can interact with

378
00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.130
and get an emotional response back to.

379
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.300
I love the idea that people can have such a strong emotional response that it's

380
00:25:15.301 --> 00:25:17.340
in my power to make them feel it,

381
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.640
that people resonate with a story in a game more than any other medium people

382
00:25:22.861 --> 00:25:24.390
talked about self expression.

383
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.980
That's something you can't access in the world of commercial game development in

384
00:25:28.981 --> 00:25:31.680
the same way that you can if you're sitting down at your computer and making a

385
00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:34.770
game for you.
[inaudible] Asia,
Maroon cough.

386
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.220
I showcase an aspect of what is important to me.

387
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.190
Using themes and elements taken from my life.

388
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.070
I want to walk with whoever ends up playing.

389
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:48.300
I also want people to finish the game and have a part of me to walk away with.

390
00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:55.200
People talked about contributing to the greater body of art lecture.
Denise,

391
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.310
I want to make video games because I like to pretend there's more to this medium

392
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.390
than escapism and power fantasies.
I don't like competition.

393
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.300
I don't like capitalism.
I don't like violence.

394
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.740
I can't stand the values mainstream games usually convey,

395
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.940
I like to pretend I can change that with my very limited skills,

396
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.790
at least for the handful of people that can reach,

397
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.960
and here's one very common theme from Talon Lee.

398
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.980
I make games because people make games.

399
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.140
Little kids make games in the playground.

400
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.720
We make games when we walk on tile floors.

401
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.200
I basically always constantly been making games and computer games were just

402
00:26:36.721 --> 00:26:38.130
another thing I'm willing to do.

403
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:44.040
I spoke with 35 game dubs of all those people.

404
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.730
One person mentioned money as a primary motivator.

405
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.470
I spoke with multiple professional game devs who are making their incomes off

406
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:55.800
the games that they were making.
They didn't get into this for the money.

407
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.270
Singers don't get into music for the money.

408
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.120
Artists don't start painting for the money.

409
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.770
Actors don't start out in theater for the money.
Of course,
it's nice to get paid.

410
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.900
Everybody likes to get paid getting paid as great,

411
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.440
but what brought them in originally was the art form.

412
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.480
They found something in it that spoke to them,

413
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:20.010
something that resonated with them.
It's the same way and get game development.

414
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.190
There are 7.3 billion people,

415
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.670
approximately a very large approximation on this planet right now.

416
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.790
All those people,
how many people like to sing?

417
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.230
I can bet you it's a lot more than the people who are making their living off
it.

418
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.660
I would guess that it's millions,
hundreds of millions,
perhaps.

419
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:43.800
Literally billions.

420
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.290
All we see usually is that little tip of the iceberg,

421
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.650
but there's this huge iceberg of people beneath it who want to sing just to sing

422
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.500
in game development.
Historically,
there was this barrier.

423
00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:02.940
You had to know how to program.

424
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:06.750
You had to know a programmer or you had to pay someone to program for you.

425
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.460
That meant there wasn't much below that tip of the iceberg.

426
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:16.680
You saw the professionals.
That was pretty much what you saw.
To be clear.

427
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:17.550
To be fair,

428
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.410
there were game creation systems in the eighties things like pinball constructor

429
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:26.790
set,
things like adventure creation system,
things like Gary's kitchen,
game maker.

430
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.410
There were more in the nineties RPG maker originally showed up then a divinity

431
00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:33.350
for realms,
the FFR,

432
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.340
but those systems existed.

433
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.410
You had to know where to find them.

434
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.620
You had to know that they existed even to go looking for them.

435
00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:44.890
<v 1>Okay,</v>

436
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.820
<v 2>and all this time it was easiest if you knew how to program.</v>

437
00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.920
So historically,

438
00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.630
most examples of this art form that we have are the examples that were created

439
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:06.130
by programmers.
Most of them were created in studios,

440
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.160
which means by corporations or by Solo developers working on their own in a

441
00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:14.470
context where their games might not be seen afterward,

442
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.330
even if they wanted them to be.

443
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

444
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.230
<v 2>This is the youngest art form we have.</v>

445
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.050
We don't know who invented singing.
We don't know who invented acting.

446
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.910
We don't know who invented painting.

447
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.810
We know who filed the patent for the very first interactive electronic game.

448
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.950
That would be Thomas t Goldsmith Jr and es El Rey man.

449
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.190
They filed a patent for something called the Cathode Ray tube amusement device

450
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:50.250
in 1947 that was 68 years ago and given that it was analog,

451
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:53.620
we might not even count that in when we're talking about digital games.

452
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:57.310
A Pong is commonly cited as the first video game that we had.

453
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.130
E pollen is,
you know,

454
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.640
from the seventies this is young.

455
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:08.670
This is a very young art form and to frighten now it is undergoing this

456
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:10.660
incredible revolution.

457
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.740
We're instead of this tiny group of people being able to make video games,

458
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.660
there is a lamp swell.

459
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.820
Here's what we know about the people who are at the tip of the iceberg,

460
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.650
the igd.
Yay.
That's the,
that's the international game.

461
00:30:28.651 --> 00:30:33.180
Developers Association runs a survey every year and one of the things they do is

462
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:35.220
collect demographics about the people who answer.

463
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.340
Most of these people are in studios,

464
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.360
either large studios or small ones or our freelancers associated with the

465
00:30:42.361 --> 00:30:43.194
industry.

466
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:48.030
Here's what the IGA said in 2015 about its members.

467
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.430
The people who responded were white.
They were male.
They were cisgender,

468
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.130
they were heterosexual,
they were young.

469
00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.510
They were usually married or in a longterm relationship,

470
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.740
but they did not have children.

471
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:07.250
Most of these people were in the United States and 93% have some amount of

472
00:31:08.191 --> 00:31:09.090
higher education.

473
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.500
93% of people in the world do not have higher education.

474
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.290
93% of America does not have higher education.

475
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:25.010
93% of the people who own computers in their homes or gaming systems or

476
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.040
smartphones.

477
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:27.930
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

478
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:32.930
<v 2>it's not 93% this is a very specific group of people.</v>

479
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.143
Right now.

480
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.190
The profile of video games is changing because the profile of the people making

481
00:31:49.191 --> 00:31:50.480
video games is changing.

482
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.220
We are not just seeing games now that are made by this profile of people,

483
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.520
which means that we're not seeing games that are necessarily aimed at this

484
00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:07.521
profile of people because that is also what was happening here because this was

485
00:32:09.001 --> 00:32:10.440
the profile of people making games.

486
00:32:10.441 --> 00:32:12.900
They were making games for people who look like themselves.

487
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:18.230
They were making games for white men in America and they were making games where

488
00:32:20.431 --> 00:32:25.431
the protagonist tended to be a white heterosexual man with American attitudes

489
00:32:25.981 --> 00:32:27.660
though not necessarily in America,

490
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:33.650
so this is a very big change for people who are not in this profile to be

491
00:32:34.741 --> 00:32:38.700
realizing we can make games too.
We can take this into our own hands.

492
00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:42.140
We are capable of being part of this art form.

493
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.210
Even if we don't know how to program.

494
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.623
<v 1>Even if</v>

495
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.200
<v 2>for those of you in this audience who don't know how to program,</v>

496
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.980
even if you don't know how to program Game Dev is open to you,

497
00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.323
<v 1>it's changing.</v>

498
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.930
<v 2>The barriers are coming down and this is a moment in history that people are</v>

499
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:10.451
going to look back to and see that an art form became available to the public

500
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.990
instead of to a small specific group.

501
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.380
No,
this is an argument I've heard before.

502
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.400
If people want to make video games,
they should learn to program.

503
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.060
It doesn't make sense for people who don't know how to program to be making

504
00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:29.894
video games.

505
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.910
There is no merit in these systems that are making it possible for people who

506
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:37.400
don't know how to program to make video games because the people who know how to

507
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:40.970
program will make better video games.
This is not true.

508
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.730
I have worked in AAA development.

509
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.780
It does not make you a better game designer to be a better programmer.

510
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.290
These are two separate skill sets.

511
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

512
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:53.650
<v 2>The one does not follow the other.</v>

513
00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.573
<v 1>It's</v>

514
00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:00.290
<v 2>like having to learn human anatomy before you're allowed to sing,</v>

515
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.380
but what about the limitations of the tools?
Well,

516
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.720
two limitations from relate to design.

517
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.140
If you're trying to design something that runs outside the limitations of your

518
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:15.950
tools,
then yeah,
you're going to,
it's like having a hammer.

519
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.220
If you have a hammer and that's what you've got,

520
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.210
you can be incredibly versatile with that.
Hammer can be a screwdriver,

521
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:26.510
it can be a lever,
it can be a Panini press.
It can be a s'mores stick.

522
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.150
There are so many things you can do with that one hammer.

523
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.590
If you're used to a full toolbox,
having one hammer,
it's terrible,

524
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.180
but if that's not what you're used to,
if someone gives you one tool,

525
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:41.130
you can do amazing things with it.
Yeah.

526
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.560
If you're used to having the full power of c sharp or the full power of seat for

527
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:47.120
that matter,
let's go eat and lower level.

528
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.940
Then visual scripting is incredibly limiting,

529
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.830
but that doesn't mean that you can't make amazing things with it.

530
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.060
Remember twine,
I talked about twine as the game engine.

531
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:02.240
That is the fastest to pick up the one you can learn in 30 seconds.

532
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.100
This is a non extended version of twine.

533
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.400
This is what you can do with variables.

534
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.920
If you can set variables and you can check variables,

535
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:16.610
you can make so many amazing things happen with game development.

536
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.930
Comparing twine to unity,
yes,

537
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.750
there are huge differences between these two programs.

538
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.140
Twine cannot do three d animation.

539
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:32.150
It doesn't have a built in physics engine at all and it doesn't,

540
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.780
for example,
make a good tool to make something like world of Warcraft in.

541
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:39.900
There are no twine,
massively multiplayer roleplaying games,

542
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.810
but twine runs in your browser,

543
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.090
which unit is not unity can run in your browser.
It requires a plugin.

544
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.880
You have to download the plugin,
you have to get the plug in to work.

545
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.380
The plugin does not work on Linux or appropriate to this audience.
Chrome,

546
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.280
you cannot play unity games in chrome in your browser.

547
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.780
So twined might have its limitations,
but unity does too.

548
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:10.680
And this is because every tool has its limitations.

549
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:17.330
Going back to 1841 1841 was when it became possible to purchase premade oil

550
00:36:19.351 --> 00:36:23.730
paint before 1841 if you were an artist and you wanted to make a painting,

551
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.980
you were probably grinding your own pigment.

552
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:30.240
You were probably mixing it with oil and you were probably stretching your own

553
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:33.870
canvas.
Cause let me tell you,
premade canvases did not exist back then either.

554
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:39.710
So if you have an idea for a painting and it's about six feet by two feet and

555
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.560
you happen to have a six foot by two foot canvas,
you're fine.

556
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.640
Your image for the project fits within your parameters.

557
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.250
But if the idea for a painting you have is six feet by two feet and the canvas

558
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:57.960
you have is four by three.

559
00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:02.910
If you know how to stretch canvas and you have the supplies,
you're still good.

560
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.220
You can just stretch the new canvas that you want.

561
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.760
If you don't know how to stretch canvas,

562
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.660
then you can either alter your design so that it fits within the materials you

563
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:16.800
have or you can paint on the wall.
The second version is not recommended.

564
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.620
So that's what programming is like in this context.

565
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:26.010
In the context of this art form,
if you know how to program,

566
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:30.450
you know how to grind your own paint pigment,
you know how to mix your own paint,

567
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.280
you know how to stretch your own canvas.

568
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.460
You can go beyond the builtin limitations of your tool and that's fine and that

569
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:40.740
might make amazing things,

570
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:45.240
but it doesn't mean that a game made within the limitations of the tool is

571
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:49.800
innately inferior because games that are designed with their tools in mind,

572
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:54.000
whether you know how to program or knots are going to work better than games

573
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:56.460
that are not designed with the limitations of the tool in mind.

574
00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.210
But everyone should learn to program programming is awesome.

575
00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.690
And I say that with the greatest enthusiasm because while the things you should

576
00:38:05.691 --> 00:38:10.070
know is that by now I do in fact know how to program.
I think it's wonderful.

577
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.630
Uh,
I've been doing c sharp for about a year of doing c for about three years.

578
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.240
Programming is so cool you guys,

579
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.810
as many of you in this room doubtlessly agree,

580
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.823
<v 1>but</v>

581
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.770
<v 2>not everyone should learn to program.</v>

582
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.950
The people who want to program should learn to program.

583
00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:34.300
There are no huge definitive you must do.

584
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.080
There are things that will make your life a little easier in the society if you

585
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:42.250
know how to read that will make your life easier.
Knowing how to program,

586
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:48.510
it's actually not a basic societal skill and gamed of is an art form.

587
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.810
Art is a basic part of human society.

588
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.600
Gamed of is a valid and in and of itself.

589
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.300
It doesn't have to be a gateway to anything else.

590
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.920
If Somebody Tries Game Dad and they get excited and they want to learn a program

591
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:12.230
like yours truly,
that's fantastic.
You know more power to them,

592
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.580
but if they just want to make a game,
that is okay.

593
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.510
So going back to the 35 game devs who I spoke with,

594
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.250
the 35 game devs who are nuts,
in fact programmers,
I asked them this question,

595
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:30.330
if it were impossible to make games without learning to program first,

596
00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:35.580
would you still have chosen to make games?
Some of them said yes.

597
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.670
More of them said no.

598
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.450
Many of them had already tried to learn to program.

599
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.610
They had not succeeded and it wasn't a lack of effort.

600
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:55.180
They were up against huge barriers that they had no personal control over

601
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.930
barriers,
like time,
money,
energy,

602
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.850
the former education that they were coming into this with access to tools and

603
00:40:04.851 --> 00:40:09.440
teachers and people who would give them feedback on their work competence,

604
00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:14.870
social pressure.
I want to tell you a story about social pressure.

605
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:20.960
This comes from Megan Hughes Gamemaker who uses twine and gamemaker maker.

606
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:28.250
Megan Hughes.
I went to an all girls high school here in Durban,
South Africa.

607
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.660
We had a male teacher for computer science.
Well,
he taught us well.

608
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:35.930
He would make comments about the fact that women should not be programmers.

609
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.860
He chuckled to himself if anyone's spoke of that sort of career for women,

610
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:43.880
and he was generally patronizing,
even when we might correct him about code,

611
00:40:43.881 --> 00:40:47.390
he'd put on the board as in he humored us throughout our education.

612
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.090
For most of the three years I had him teach me,

613
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:54.140
I thought he only had a son of whom he spoke incredibly fondly.

614
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.460
Somewhere near the end of the third year,
he accidentally mentioned his daughter,

615
00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.920
uh,
well accomplished specialists daughter.

616
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.440
This attitude combined with the fact that the male friends I knew who were into

617
00:41:06.441 --> 00:41:10.940
computers seem to sell far ahead of me having dads that encourage them and

618
00:41:10.941 --> 00:41:13.730
taking apart machines and coding from an early age.

619
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.810
Whereas I was blamed for anything even slightly off on her home,

620
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.160
on our home computer,

621
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.730
and we certainly didn't have the funds for me to run risks of breaking anything

622
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:24.500
with phones,
with code attempts.

623
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:29.210
I figured I'd already lost the race before starting.
In the end,

624
00:41:29.211 --> 00:41:31.670
I pursued my other love psychology.

625
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.040
This is not just about America.

626
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.610
This is about everybody worldwide who might want access to this art form.

627
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.610
This is about me,
but it's also about Meghan Hughes.

628
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.660
It's about everybody I heard from who wasn't in the United States and everybody

629
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:54.470
who was but who never thought that they could ever learn to program

630
00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.100
some of these people,

631
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:00.580
the ones who thought they would never ever learn to program our learning to

632
00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:04.150
program because of Game Dev.
This is especially common in twine.

633
00:42:04.151 --> 00:42:08.410
That's super simple language and the reason it's especially common in twine is

634
00:42:08.411 --> 00:42:12.130
because twine extends with javascript.
People working in twine.

635
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.610
See what other people have done in Java script and some of them are getting

636
00:42:15.611 --> 00:42:19.720
curious and some of them are getting involved.
This is Kiva Bay.

637
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:24.670
I'm 32 and I feel for the first time in my life like I could learn programming,

638
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.020
maybe not well,

639
00:42:26.021 --> 00:42:29.560
but I could figure it out with some help and I think it's because I've made a

640
00:42:29.561 --> 00:42:32.890
twine game now that I feel confident enough to even try.

641
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.660
Programming always felt like a secret society hidden behind a locked door.

642
00:42:37.661 --> 00:42:41.020
I could never find twine.
Showed me a window to sneak through.

643
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:42.600
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

644
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.280
<v 2>keep a base.
First game is about her personal experience of homelessness.</v>

645
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.740
It's called 12 hours and it just went,

646
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.380
it just went through a green light on steam.

647
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:58.020
This is not a game that would exist if she had to learn to program,

648
00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.613
<v 1>but</v>

649
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:06.210
<v 2>well some people are inspired to learn to program by their game Dev experience.</v>

650
00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:08.100
It's not true for everybody.

651
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.730
This is Mike Rosen who works in quest and adventure game studio.

652
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.280
I have mild dyscalculia,
which is basically like dyslexia,
but with numbers,

653
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.420
it's nearly impossible for me to recognize or make sense of patterns and

654
00:43:21.421 --> 00:43:25.110
sequences in numbers and I'm also pretty bad with computer logic.

655
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.940
Years ago a friend tried to teach me some basic programming and I just could not

656
00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.440
get a handle on it at all.

657
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:36.630
I just assume making a game would be something beyond my abilities until I found

658
00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:37.470
these programs.

659
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

660
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.080
<v 2>I spoke with 35 known programming game devs.</v>

661
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.360
They work on over a dozen different engines and between them they have created

662
00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.580
literally hundreds of games.

663
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:56.440
Some of these games are hours and hours long.

664
00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.620
Others are 15 minutes,
10 minutes,

665
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.240
five minutes to some of them have created just one game.

666
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.340
Others have created dozens.

667
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:07.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

668
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.960
<v 2>The vast majority of these games would not exist if they had had to learn to</v>

669
00:44:13.211 --> 00:44:14.380
program first.

670
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.900
We are better off because their game success,

671
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.970
we are better off for these new voices,
these new experiences,

672
00:44:24.971 --> 00:44:27.610
these new ideas about what is a video game.

673
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:33.540
We're better off even for the gains that were just created for one person or for

674
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:39.360
no one else to see.
Has anyone ever drawn you a picture?

675
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.140
Has anyone ever written you a poem?
It doesn't have to be big.

676
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.160
Just something small like Oh,
dirty limerick core.

677
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.310
You know when new version of roses are red,
violets are blue.

678
00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.220
What would the world be like if no one could?

679
00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.830
What would the world be like if your choices were right?

680
00:44:56.831 --> 00:44:58.990
The entire Elliot or nothing.

681
00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.230
That is where video games have been.

682
00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.950
That is what is changing right now.

683
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:08.800
Right here at this moment in history.

684
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.350
Every single person in this room,

685
00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:15.550
programmers and non programmers could go home tonight,

686
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:20.440
download a free game engine and start making a game if that was what you wanted

687
00:45:20.441 --> 00:45:25.150
to do.
This is how the world is changing.
This is incredible.

688
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.630
This is huge and more people every day thanks to the Internet,

689
00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.950
thanks to free tools,

690
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.000
thanks to other people telling them you can make a game to more people everyday.

691
00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:38.500
Go home,
download that free software,
try it out,

692
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.700
discover that they can be part of this.
The world is changing.

693
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.620
It's changing right now.

694
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:49.870
This is the future where everyone can make games and it's really important.

695
00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.573
Thank you.

696
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:03.940
I would like to take a moment to thank the Devs who were willing to speak with

697
00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:05.200
me and share their insights.

698
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.000
There were more stories here than I possibly could have shared with you and I

699
00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:11.110
wish I could have shared more.

700
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.740
I was deeply honored by their willingness to tell me their stories.

701
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
I would also like to thank the people who take the time to make software to help

702
00:46:21.191 --> 00:46:25.210
non programmers into this,
into this art form.
Uh,

703
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:27.490
particularly the people who are releasing it for free.

704
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.780
As many of the people coming into game development do not necessarily have the

705
00:46:31.781 --> 00:46:36.220
money to be able to afford an expensive game says inexpensive game engine.

706
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.890
So any questions,

707
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:42.323
<v 1>right?</v>

708
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.510
<v 3>Yeah,
I'm 20 years older than you,</v>

709
00:46:47.511 --> 00:46:52.511
but I remember witnessing a fairly similar phenomena with hypercard

710
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:58.700
people developing interactive stories,
you know,
in the mid eighties

711
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.053
<v 2>absolutely.</v>

712
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:04.830
And I think part of what's going on right now that makes the change here is the

713
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:05.664
Internet.

714
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.760
I think it is how easy it is for people to pass their games for one person to

715
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:15.831
another because hypercard not as easy as just downloading on someone else's file

716
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.110
or playing online.
But yes.

717
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.740
Hypercard as an example that absolutely fits into this model.

718
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.890
<v 3>So you don't have to be use twine.</v>

719
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.980
Presumably you were a

720
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.570
<v 1>programmer created twice so correct design stand point.</v>

721
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.580
If you want to make tools for game designers,
what advice would you,

722
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.550
<v 2>the question was from a Meta perspective,
uh,</v>

723
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.220
what would be my advice to people who want to make games?

724
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.780
We want to make game engines for non programmers.
Uh,

725
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:53.120
this is actually a really interesting question for me because one of the things

726
00:47:53.121 --> 00:47:57.910
that I've been working on quietly behind the scenes has been exactly that.
Uh,

727
00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.470
there are reasons why I wanted to learn c sharp.

728
00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:06.580
The thing that I would say is most important to keep in mind is that you want to

729
00:48:07.461 --> 00:48:10.160
minimize the number of walls that people can run into.

730
00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.240
That if it's possible to keep people from using bed syntax for whatever the

731
00:48:17.871 --> 00:48:22.460
system is,
keeps them from doing that,
make it impossible to make bad decisions,

732
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.170
make it possible to make interesting decisions.
And I recognize that,
you know,

733
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.450
it's very hard to get rid of runtime errors.

734
00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.800
Like you can't help the people who go and divide by zero deliberately.
Yes,

735
00:48:33.801 --> 00:48:35.870
you divided by zero and now everything's going to stop.

736
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.650
But if it's not possible for them to hit,

737
00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.540
go and then have compiler error after compiler error after compiler error if it

738
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:47.840
will run.
But give them a heads up about what went wrong.

739
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:50.000
That would be my advice.

740
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.570
Make it as streamlined as possible to make something.

741
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:59.180
I also want to give credit to Chris [inaudible] who was the creator of twine,

742
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.350
uh,

743
00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:04.850
who was looking specifically at this kind of question when he created it.

744
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:08.743
Anybody else?

745
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:17.230
<v 4>So I have a question.
It's a little bit of a tangent from your talk.
Um,</v>

746
00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.340
goes a little bit beyond game design.
Um,

747
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:23.690
the thing I find really neat about what you've been saying has been the,
um,

748
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:27.080
I guess I'll say the bridge between programmers and non programmers in the field

749
00:49:27.081 --> 00:49:29.230
of game design that's been created by these,
um,

750
00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:32.450
different systems where you can actually do some game design.

751
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:37.630
And I think of these different systems as providing different ways to express

752
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:41.270
programming logic that are somewhat more intuitive to people who haven't gone

753
00:49:41.271 --> 00:49:43.490
through the,
okay,
let's learn in December from scratch and all right,

754
00:49:43.491 --> 00:49:47.330
the seven computer things and that can stop.
Um,
and I,

755
00:49:47.331 --> 00:49:50.480
I'm sort of wondering how do we expand that beyond game design?
Because you said,

756
00:49:50.481 --> 00:49:53.360
should everyone learn to program?
No.
And I certainly sympathize with the,

757
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:54.770
with the feelings behind that.

758
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.990
There are people who can't learn to program and people for whom it's really not

759
00:49:56.991 --> 00:50:00.140
worth it and they will not enjoy it and they will be miserable.
Um,

760
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:04.760
but our society is more and more one that's like,
just,
you know,

761
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.270
the computers are accumulating under our feet and we're being risen up by them.

762
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.240
And for the people who don't understand anything about programming to understand

763
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.470
how computers work,

764
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:17.770
I think the feeling is just being more and more helpless in the face of all

765
00:50:17.961 --> 00:50:21.830
sorts of stuff around them.
So I'd love to see that,
um,

766
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.800
bridge that you're building in game design,
outside of game design.

767
00:50:24.801 --> 00:50:27.590
Do you know of any efforts in that area?
Ways make,

768
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.820
I'll say programming in general.
The wow,
is that a,
you know,

769
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.280
broad statement more accessible to people who aren't programs?

770
00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.653
<v 2>Code Academy,</v>

771
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.760
Code Academy Code Academy comes instantly to mind from a game design perspective

772
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:43.820
because,
hey,
I come back to this,
it's,
it's my lunch.

773
00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.610
<v 4>No,
that's your thing.
That's this talk.</v>

774
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:51.070
<v 2>There is a system that was created at MIT called sketch and what's really</v>

775
00:50:51.541 --> 00:50:54.180
interesting about sketch it same day eight to 16 year olds,

776
00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:59.690
but it works in the browser and not only does it not let you fail your syntax,

777
00:51:00.571 --> 00:51:03.900
but all of the visual drag and drop scripting,

778
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.750
all the pieces of it are kind of shaped like puzzle pieces.

779
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:11.100
So you can see how they all fit together.
So it makes it very easy to understand,

780
00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.200
okay,
if I have an,
if else,

781
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:17.670
there's this little gap here and that little gap means that I have to have what

782
00:51:17.671 --> 00:51:21.960
my conditional is in there.
But you also ask the broader question,

783
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:27.440
not just about programming but about growing more comfortable with computers at

784
00:51:27.481 --> 00:51:28.314
large.

785
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.940
And I want to point out that another way to look at this is that it's a Ui

786
00:51:32.941 --> 00:51:35.810
challenge and that is a Ui challenge.

787
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:40.110
That number one is being tackled at Google.
Number two,
apple excels at,

788
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:45.590
and there were so many people continuing to tackle this challenge of how do we

789
00:51:46.291 --> 00:51:48.780
make computers that look like they think like people,

790
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:53.930
how do we make things intuitive and it's an ongoing struggle.

791
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:58.620
It's an important struggle and how to teach programming is undergoing that exact

792
00:51:58.621 --> 00:51:59.454
same struggle.

793
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.580
<v 4>Yeah,
I'm,
I'm worried.
I mean I'm,</v>

794
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.970
I'm behind efforts to make computers think more like people,

795
00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:10.190
but I think that the computers the way computers think has a way of the own and

796
00:52:10.191 --> 00:52:14.340
it's always going to be around and helping people in general understand a little

797
00:52:14.341 --> 00:52:18.060
bit more of that would be valuable too.
But that's a program perspective so,

798
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:20.443
<v 2>well,</v>

799
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:25.690
so I had an experience a couple of weeks back where I was working on a rogue

800
00:52:27.211 --> 00:52:31.100
like game.
So these are the top down dungeon games,
procedural generation,

801
00:52:31.101 --> 00:52:34.290
whole nine yards.
And I was working on line of sight.

802
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.220
So here's my,
here's my player character.
How far can they see,
what can they see?

803
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:43.850
How are things getting exposed?
How does this interface with the light mechanics?

804
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.720
And it was the first time I'd used my Algebra in about 20 years and before then

805
00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:55.130
I was in school doing something in school.

806
00:52:56.450 --> 00:53:00.260
But it was important for me to learn Algebra in the same way.

807
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.160
I think that there's merit to learning programming in the context of actually,

808
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:11.810
you know,
programming.
There's a lot to be said for knowing some programming.

809
00:53:11.811 --> 00:53:16.220
There's a lot to be said for knowing some Algebra and possibly it'll show up 20

810
00:53:16.221 --> 00:53:17.390
years later and you'll sit there going,

811
00:53:17.391 --> 00:53:19.250
I'm so glad I paid attention in that class.

812
00:53:19.251 --> 00:53:22.300
Why didn't I listen to my trig teacher or what?

813
00:53:22.301 --> 00:53:23.780
And I listen to my programming teacher,

814
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:29.340
but my protest is against the idea that a barrier should be in place.

815
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:34.740
The barrier when it's not in the context of being a barrier is another matter

816
00:53:34.741 --> 00:53:39.200
entirely.
Anybody else?

817
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.940
Right.
Hi.

818
00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.170
<v 5>So I had a general question about building tools.
So in some sense,</v>

819
00:53:45.171 --> 00:53:46.670
building a game with her strict language,

820
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.770
it's like building a very specialized tool so you can build for Mckinnell things

821
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:53.180
you've built in with our hammer and the hammer is very good at hammering but

822
00:53:53.181 --> 00:53:56.060
terrible at other things.
And there are other tools,
our Swiss army knives,

823
00:53:56.061 --> 00:53:58.490
which are kind of expert to use.
Um,

824
00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.040
so I've seen this in game engines that you try to build to.

825
00:54:01.041 --> 00:54:02.960
This is a tool and knows how to speak certain things,

826
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:06.410
but it's extremely frustrating when you try to go beyond that to paradigm.

827
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:10.220
And I don't know if you've talked a bit about that trade off between generalized

828
00:54:10.221 --> 00:54:11.480
tools and specialized tools.

829
00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:16.610
<v 2>It's startling.
So that's something that we see with choice script,</v>

830
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:20.000
RPG maker,
adventure game,
studio,
Britain Pie.

831
00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:25.360
They are aimed very specifically a doing one specific kind of game and once you

832
00:54:26.811 --> 00:54:27.950
branch off that,

833
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.690
it's that question of making sure that the system you're using to make what

834
00:54:32.691 --> 00:54:35.810
you're making actually fits with what you're trying to make.

835
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:41.650
And I got rescued by a programmer once about a year ago because I had this great

836
00:54:42.441 --> 00:54:47.441
idea for any synchronous multiplayer game written an informed seven and I knew

837
00:54:49.341 --> 00:54:53.600
that informed seven can support data that holds over from play to play.

838
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.220
And I thought to myself,

839
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:59.510
I can make a game that's multiplayer where multiple people can play it and

840
00:54:59.511 --> 00:55:01.520
affect each other by just putting it on a server.

841
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:06.230
I didn't understand that what was going to happen was that it was going to cash

842
00:55:06.231 --> 00:55:09.440
in the browser and people would not be able to interact with each other.

843
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:11.780
I didn't understand the limits of my tool.

844
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.370
I wound up and this was for a game jam,

845
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:17.960
so I wound up running actually to my fiance,
Daniel Church,

846
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:23.450
who is extraordinarily good at programming and said,
save me.

847
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.840
I have created an idea that is beyond my toolset and she set up server

848
00:55:29.421 --> 00:55:34.280
communication and Java script and made it so that it could actually happen the

849
00:55:34.281 --> 00:55:37.850
way I had originally pictured it.
Yes,
there are dangers.

850
00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:40.460
If you decide that you're going to use your hammer as a Panini press,

851
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.940
it is a good idea to look around and see if you have a Panini press available

852
00:55:43.941 --> 00:55:44.774
first.

853
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:52.750
Anybody else?
Well,

854
00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.220
in that case,
I want to thank you so much for your time.

855
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:59.990
I really appreciate that you came here to hear me speak today and I actually

856
00:55:59.991 --> 00:56:04.370
have a blog@civilnoon.com where I think about game does and the state of Game

857
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:08.120
Dev and the people making games.
So if that's of interest to you,
please stop by.

858
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.440
Thank you so much.
Sure.
