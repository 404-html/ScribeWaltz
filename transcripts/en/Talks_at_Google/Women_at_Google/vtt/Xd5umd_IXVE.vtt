00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
Good afternoon and welcome to toxic Google in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

2
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.250
Today it's my privilege to introduce two extraordinary individuals,

3
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.700
professor Lani Guinier and Dr Deborah Beal.

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.160
Among many other things,

5
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:27.870
both are fierce advocates of equal educational opportunity for all.

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.790
Debra Beal was MacArthur fellow in 2007 she has an education strategist who

7
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:41.721
addresses the challenges of college access for underrepresented populations by

8
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:47.571
identifying and fostering latent talent and opening opportunities for them to

9
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.110
pursue higher education through her posse foundation,

10
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.800
which is a funded in part by Google.

11
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.320
She offers an alternative model for identifying promising young people from less

12
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.330
advantage urban environments.

13
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.020
Promising students are invited to join a Posse,

14
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.730
a small group that participates in an eight month pre-collegiate training

15
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:16.731
program that builds individual and team skills and serves as an essential social

16
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:21.030
support system once students arrive at college.

17
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.520
She served as the founder and president of the foundation posse foundation since

18
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:31.521
1989 she is also a founding partner of the consulting company Firefly Education

19
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.363
Llc.

20
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.480
Lani Guinier is the first woman of color appointed to a tenured professorship at

21
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.490
Harvard law school.
Previously.

22
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:48.060
She had been a tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania,

23
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.920
a lawyer with the Naacp Legal Defense Fund,

24
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.880
special assistant to the assistant attorney general for civil rights during the

25
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.630
Carter Administration and was nominated by President Clinton to be the first

26
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:08.010
black woman to have the civil rights division of the Department of Justice.

27
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.250
Uh,
professor Guinier on behalf of the people of the United States.
Uh,

28
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.560
I apologize for how that went.
Sincerely,

29
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.560
uh,
she is the author of several books,

30
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.320
most recently the tyranny of the meritocracy,

31
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.500
democratizing higher education in America,

32
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.270
and she has received 10 honorary degrees,

33
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.770
although I suspect that she feels equally honored to have received awards for

34
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.220
teaching excellence from both Penn and Harvard law.

35
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:42.000
School's please join me in welcoming in conversation.

36
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.190
Lani Guinier and Deborah veal.

37
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.440
<v 1>We're just winging this.
You guys.
Not really,</v>

38
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.850
we're acting like we are,
but to,
I'm Debbie bial.

39
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.980
I run the posse foundation and I'm Lani Guinier and I'm

40
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.380
<v 2>a law professor who</v>

41
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.110
is very fond of the posse.

42
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.300
<v 1>We're fond of each other.
We really are.</v>

43
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:14.440
Actually I admire Lani enormously and one of the,

44
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.320
this is the first time that we are,

45
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.560
we've actually come together to talk about an issue that we've been dealing with

46
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.530
separately for decades.

47
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.920
And what I am so grateful to Lani for is that she has written extensively about

48
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.010
an issue that this country doesn't talk enough about.

49
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.010
And that is the idea that the country was built on,

50
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:43.650
which is there were supposed to be a meritocracy.
And she,

51
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.980
I work a lot.
I work with 52 different colleges and universities,
all elite.

52
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.730
And those institutions are really gatekeepers for young people who want to

53
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.580
achieve the American dream.
And Lonnie has written a lot about that.
And you've,

54
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.590
you give,
you validate what we do at posse and I'll talk more about that.

55
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:08.410
That I,
I wanted to thank you because it's an honor to be here.

56
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.500
<v 2>Oh Wow.
Yeah.
So I'll just be quiet and I'll let you talk.</v>

57
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.350
No,
it's a privilege to be here.
I've had,
um,

58
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.650
a lot of opportunity to talk to and,
um,

59
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.580
work with one of the form of posse officers,
surely Co Yaddo.

60
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.890
Right.

61
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.470
<v 1>And she was a posse member,
right?
Yeah.</v>

62
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.030
<v 2>Right.</v>

63
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.500
And she's the one who really explained to me what it was like to be a posse

64
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:39.000
member.
And

65
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.530
Her story is so powerful because she's the son of the son.

66
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.080
She's the daughter of a taxi driver who was somebody who would come to the

67
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:54.300
United States from another country.

68
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.870
And her father was extremely worried that she was going to leave New York City

69
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:05.370
to go to Vanderbilt,
which is in Tennessee.

70
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.270
And so they arranged an agreement that she would call him or he would call her

71
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.690
every day.
He's a taxi driver at nine o'clock or at eight o'clock.

72
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:18.630
And she'd have to report to him as to what she was doing.

73
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.820
And it turned out initially that she thought this was,
um,
intrusive,

74
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.100
but it turned out to be very,
um,

75
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.050
powerful in a way of reassuring her cause she was in a new environment

76
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.700
completely without,
um,
you know,

77
00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:39.600
coming in with old friends or,
or with people who've been there before.

78
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.160
And so the fact that she had somebody to look forward to,

79
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.110
to talk to every night was,
um,
very affirming for her.

80
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:53.550
She ended up doing extraordinarily well.
She ended up getting a phd.

81
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.260
She's now,
um,
uh,

82
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.150
I'm not sure exactly her she decision at Rutgers,

83
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.270
but she's no high predicative vice chancellor.
Yeah.
Okay.

84
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.060
Executive Vice Chancellor.
Okay.

85
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.270
Who used to rely on her taxi cab father to move on to the next day of,

86
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.090
of her life.
So she,
she's,
she's just a really good example of,

87
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.320
um,
the posse program.
But

88
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.720
<v 1>Lonnie rights,
I don't know how you guys should all read her book.
She,</v>

89
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.863
which we have,

90
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.700
and there's kind of make the pitch at the beginning of the middle men,

91
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.420
but Lonnie has a whole chapter dedicated to this program as an example of how we

92
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:40.210
can be thinking differently about defining this term merit.

93
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.570
And I like to talk about the word merit because I don't know how many of you

94
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:47.110
went to one of,
you know,

95
00:06:47.111 --> 00:06:50.200
what we call the most selective colleges in the United States,

96
00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:54.280
but there's over 1400,
four year colleges in the United States.

97
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:58.210
If you took just the top 10% right.
The ones that everyone's heard about,

98
00:06:58.211 --> 00:06:59.980
the Ivy League schools and Vanderbilt,

99
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:02.830
Northwestern and Duke and these kinds of schools Middleburry,

100
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.610
they still rely pretty heavily on the sat as a way of deciding who's,

101
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.660
who's going to be admitted.
Right.
You're familiar,
you know,
you know this idea,

102
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.680
but in 2015 it's still white and Asian kids that are scoring the best on those

103
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:24.730
tests.
Now we can talk about all the problems and why that is the case,

104
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.140
but here's a kid like Shirley and I just want to jump on your story a little
bit.

105
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.780
Surely grew up in Brooklyn.

106
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.320
She's a Dominican kid who got 800 combined.

107
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.670
I'm letting this thinking combined on the math and reading sections of the sat.

108
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:44.650
She lets us say this combined.

109
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.120
She never in a million years would've gotten into Vanderbilt.

110
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.720
We get her into Vanderbilt.
She graduates with honors.

111
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.170
She gets her doctorate in clinical psychology from Duke.

112
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.180
She becomes the dean of the college at Middlebury and within the next five
years,

113
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:04.540
I think she's going to be a college president today.

114
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.250
Those schools that I mentioned,

115
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.170
88% of the presidents of those schools are white men.

116
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.140
If you look at who's in the U S Senate,

117
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.120
94% of our Senate is white.
Most are men.

118
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.280
The same thing with who runs fortune 500 companies,
white guys mostly,

119
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.440
and their section 16 executives white.
So what we're talking about is,

120
00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:32.380
well,
how do we keep going like that,
right,
Lonnie?

121
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:37.381
Because if we keep doing that in a country where the demographics are changing

122
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:40.750
radically,
and what within the next 30 years is white,

123
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:43.780
Hispanics will be the minority.
No longer be the majority.

124
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.250
We're not going to have a country that's representative of its people.

125
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.870
So maybe we could talk a little bit about how these institute,

126
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:56.100
why it's important for the elite schools.
Why do you think

127
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.933
<v 2>and why do I,</v>

128
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.160
why should they be focused on thinking differently about who deserves to be on

129
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:03.030
their campuses?

130
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.510
So just to put what you're saying into a slightly larger,
um,

131
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.020
context,
and I've,

132
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:17.070
I definitely want to follow up with your saying is the book that,

133
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.230
that I'm

134
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.740
describing or that actually you've done a great job of describing is,

135
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.490
is really about what we mean by merit.
And so it's,

136
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.530
it's a larger question than just,
uh,

137
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.970
who is benefiting from the concept of merit.

138
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.300
But we tend to think of merit as something that measures how well you do on a

139
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:43.110
particular test.

140
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:48.111
That a particular moment and what I am trying to do in this book and what I

141
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:52.050
think is consistent with what the posse program does,

142
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.350
is to give people another way of identifying with an exhibiting merit.

143
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.130
And that is working together in groups in posses that can look at a problem from

144
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:10.431
different perspectives and as a result work together to solve that problem.

145
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.710
And adding to your comment about the number of,
um,
of,
of,

146
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.220
of men versus women and finding more women in,

147
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.090
um,

148
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.320
in who are going to college and who and who are graduating.

149
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:29.550
Because it turns out that the women are better at collaborating with each other

150
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.481
than the men.

151
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.890
There's a study by a woman named Anita Woolley who

152
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.810
in fact I think was working with MIT at at the same time she was doing this

153
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:48.681
study and what they were trying to find out is who was leading the conversation

154
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:54.270
and what groups were most effective in solving the particular problems that were

155
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.560
presented before the groups.

156
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.380
And it turned out that the more women you had in the group,

157
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:03.381
the better the group was at solving the problem up to 85% once you had 85%

158
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:08.100
women,
it was fine to bring in the men.
They would not be a complete distraction.

159
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.600
Okay.
Now why would that be if,

160
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.410
if we have so few women who are in positions of power and yet those are the

161
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:20.550
people who are most likely to work together to collaborate,
to solve problems.

162
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And I don't know the answer to the question of why is this true of women and not

163
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:29.220
men.
It may be biological,
it may be cultural.

164
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.220
They're all kinds of explanations.

165
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.580
But it's really important that we acknowledge the value and the merit of people.

166
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.540
Disproportionately women who can work together to solve problems.

167
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.470
And the reason they can work together to solve problems is that they're willing

168
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:50.550
to listen to each other.

169
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:56.090
Whereas what many of the men do is that they immediately think of an answer.

170
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.210
I want to say the answer to everyone else.

171
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:01.240
They're not really interested in what other people are saying.

172
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.190
They're self promoting it.
Not Not all men,
but,
but many of them.

173
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.080
And so it,

174
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.580
the point I'm trying to make the point I'm emphasizing is the power of

175
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:17.530
collaboration and the importance in the 21st century of developing a,

176
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.423
um,

177
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.450
a group of college graduates who are comfortable working with other people to

178
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:29.461
solve complicated problems and who are not simply trying to dominate the

179
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:33.190
conversation and demonstrate the how smart they individually are,

180
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.670
but who are willing to listen to what other people are saying.

181
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:41.440
Build on what those other people are saying and create new and,

182
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.910
um,
helpful instruments for solving these problems.

183
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:51.060
One last example is a professor from the University of Michigan who

184
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.700
also is,
is doing work on,
um,
on groups and,

185
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.980
and his experience is with people who are all taking the same test.

186
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.280
And his argument is that when you give people a test in their 10 questions on

187
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.754
the test,

188
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.270
there are some people who are going to immediately answer seven of the 10

189
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:17.110
questions and get them right,
but they don't get all of the questions right.

190
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.420
So what does,
what do they do?

191
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.840
Our instinct is to get the people who had the seven of the 10 questions,

192
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.750
right?
Cause they had the most questions,
right?
And we put all of them together.

193
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:31.870
That's the sort of sat idea.

194
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:35.410
You get the people who all did quote the best.

195
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.320
But what if it turns out that you're overlooking two or three of the answers to

196
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:46.240
questions that these quote unquote stars got wrong.

197
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.030
And that some people got those three or two questions right?
Me,

198
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.000
but didn't get as many questions.
Right?
As,
as the initial,
um,

199
00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.550
group leaders that you really want people to work together.
Even those,

200
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.280
they only got two or three of the 10 questions,
right.

201
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:06.400
If it turns out that they're the only ones who got those,
um,
correct.

202
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.310
So the idea is that,

203
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.670
and I think it's very similar and very compatible with the concept of Posse,

204
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.530
is that you have to,
in the 21st century,

205
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.530
it's really important that you can work in groups that you can,

206
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.350
and I don't mean that work in groups in your march together and you follow

207
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:25.350
everyone.
I mean,
work in a puzzle,

208
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.830
in a position where you are not the only person with ideas.

209
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:35.070
You are open to other people's ideas and you're willing to test out their ideas

210
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:36.340
and,

211
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.200
and see ways in which those ideas can be improved or can be.

212
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.490
Um,
that's very Google,
very Google.
But Lonnie,

213
00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:49.150
can I ask why since I have you captive anyway,

214
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.640
why do you think we've been so resistant

215
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.350
<v 1>to to this at our,
when we admit people to these colleges,
why are we,</v>

216
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.530
why are we clinging to the sat so much?

217
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.670
<v 2>Well,
first of all,
there's a lot of money.
Yeah,
yeah.
Behind the sat and,
and,</v>

218
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.890
and those tests.

219
00:15:07.891 --> 00:15:12.720
So th there's a part of the population that's invested in,

220
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.620
in that,
in terms of their livelihood.
I think it's,
um,

221
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.660
the idea that you can reduce people's intelligence and you can reduce people's

222
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.700
ability to the performance.
Yeah.
On,
on a single test.
Right.

223
00:15:26.701 --> 00:15:29.990
It's not like you get a chance to,
to do this test.
Yeah.
You know,

224
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.260
every month for a year,

225
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.600
<v 1>raise your hand if you took the sat or the act.
Look,
how many of you,</v>

226
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.670
almost all of you,

227
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.610
and raise your hand if you raise your hand if you went to college

228
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.470
and raise your hand.
Raise your hand if someone said to you,
what,

229
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:51.410
what was your score?
Do you remember that?

230
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.060
It's an raise your hand if you're willing to tell us your score right now.

231
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.583
Exactly.

232
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.080
A lot less hands because we still feel like it reflects,

233
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.360
there's a judgment that we're going to make about you.
If we hear score,
that's,

234
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.610
that's terrible.
We shouldn't make that judgment about you right now.

235
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:17.750
And look how old you are.
It's what we,
can I just,

236
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:23.420
can I just hang a footnote to what you're saying and then,
yeah,
no,
I'm,
yes.
No,

237
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.363
sir.

238
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.400
<v 2>To tell you it's a personal story.
When I was admitted to</v>

239
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.050
Radcliffe College of hotel,
this is a good story

240
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.170
<v 1>in your,
in your end.
Yeah.
I love the story.</v>

241
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.910
<v 2>So,
um,
uh,
my father had,</v>

242
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.170
my father who had,
was born in Jamaica,

243
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.780
west indies.
He came to the United States,
he went to Boston,
English high school.

244
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.370
He then applied to Harvard.
He was admitted to Harvard College,

245
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.500
except that they didn't realize he was black.
He,
right,
they didn't,

246
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.440
they didn't have that kind of photography or whatever,
no photos.

247
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.310
That was,
and that was his mistake,
a quote unquote,

248
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.750
because he showed up and once they saw him,
they said,
oh my God,

249
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.300
what are we going to do with you?
So,
um,

250
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.810
they admitted him since they had already admitted him,

251
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.770
but they wouldn't allow him to live in the dormitory.
They wouldn't allow him to,

252
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.693
um,

253
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:29.130
to eat in the dining halls with the other students.

254
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:31.920
And the first person to,
um,

255
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.770
well there are a number of people,
but

256
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.360
the people he knew from Boston English high school where he had been the chair

257
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:45.900
of the,
um,
newspaper and had done very well and who were his friends?

258
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.870
Those people were very friendly when he was at Boston English high.

259
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.220
But once he was at Harvard College,
they wouldn't talk to him either.
So

260
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:59.970
I'm saying that because for me,
he felt it was important that I go to Harvard,

261
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.930
right.
Test it out,
see if they've improved in the past

262
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.200
40 years.
But it was also,

263
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.080
it was also in many ways this,
um,

264
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.590
what I felt was a painful experience.
That is my,
uh,
roommate.

265
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:23.040
I believe that's what you're talking about.

266
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.260
So my roommate comes into my

267
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.760
dorm room the first day of class and she starts telling me about herself and she

268
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.550
explained that she was very worried that she would never get married.

269
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.270
And I'm thinking this is a very odd conversation,
right?

270
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:42.330
This is the first day of college.
You know,
I'm 17 years old.

271
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.490
I have definitely not thinking about who I might marry.
But,
um,

272
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.630
she was using this as an opportunity to brag about her test scores because it

273
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:56.520
turns out she had gotten perfect eight hundreds on her sats.
So that was,
um,

274
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:58.860
her announcement to me and I was there for,
you know,

275
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.130
a pen I should be observant of her and learn from her.

276
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.720
And what I learned was to move to another dorm room.
But what did,

277
00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:09.780
what did she mean

278
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:14.120
<v 1>and what other people would be really impressed is that she's smart.</v>

279
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:19.750
We equate that test score with intelligence and when we use the word merit in

280
00:19:21.981 --> 00:19:24.590
Higher Ed and we give out merit scholarships,

281
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.110
we give them to the kids with the highest test scores.

282
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.310
Because if you look the word up in the dictionary,
it means deserve.

283
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.860
Who deserves to be at Harvard?
Who deserves to be at Cornell,

284
00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:38.360
who deserves to be at Vanderbilt,

285
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.500
the kids with the highest scores because they are the smartest.
It's that simple.

286
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.510
But because white and Asian kids are still scoring the best,

287
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:53.170
they deserve to be at the schools more than black and Asian kids than poor kids

288
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.270
who don't score as well.

289
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.610
There's an amazing stat that I know you're gonna love this stat.
Okay?

290
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.320
The top hundred and 50 schools in the United States would need 50,000 black

291
00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:11.240
students every year going into their freshman class,
their first year class,

292
00:20:11.241 --> 00:20:14.630
if they were going to reflect the percentage of blacks that exists in the

293
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:15.740
American population,

294
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.240
but only 9,000 black kids score 1200 or above on the math and verbal sections of

295
00:20:23.871 --> 00:20:28.340
the sat last year in the entire United States.

296
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.650
If we continue to rely too heavily on the sat,

297
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.540
will never get the kind of reflective diversity that we want on our campuses.

298
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:45.430
And if we continue to define merit so narrowly that it only relates to the test

299
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:49.990
score,
we're basically gonna say certain kinds.

300
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:54.340
There are certain slice of the demographic deserves to be on our campuses.

301
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.500
The others will create charity programs for at risk,
poor kids,

302
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:03.970
underrepresented,
needy,
you know,
underprivileged.

303
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.840
We've got programs for them.
And when you do that,

304
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.540
you divide the community,

305
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.370
you create a campus community that says these kids deserve to be here,

306
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.670
and then out of the kindness of our hearts,
we're bringing in the rest of you.

307
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.310
And that's very dangerous for this country.

308
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.620
Kids with high scores of course,
are deserve of course,

309
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.920
but they're not the only kids that deserve.

310
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.930
And so I feel like what we have an opportunity to do together is say,

311
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:39.931
here's the theory and the analysis behind it and here's one example of a program

312
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:44.380
that puts into practice this other way of finding talent and think about how

313
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.890
Google is a company that thinks outside the box that you're whole.

314
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.900
You're all about that,
right?

315
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:54.901
You need people who are creative thinkers who think differently and the,

316
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.700
and you want to put teams together.
Right.

317
00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:01.720
Do you guys believe in working in teams a lot or is that just what I'm imagining

318
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.880
you do?
Right.
The teens are more fun.
They're more dynamic there,
sillier,

319
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.650
but the you come up with great ideas that way where if you're working by

320
00:22:11.651 --> 00:22:16.150
yourself only it would happen in a different way.
Less often.

321
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.380
So posse says there was a kid who dropped out of college.
He said,

322
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:25.330
I never would've dropped out if I had my posse with me.
This kid was super smart,

323
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.460
great sat scores by the way,

324
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.720
got into an ivy league but dropped out because of the culture shock cause it,

325
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.200
he didn't see anybody like him.
The posse created a support system.

326
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:38.980
But then we began to look at these other indicators.

327
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:40.600
And I bet if anybody,

328
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.350
is anyone here responsible for hiring people?

329
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.960
What's her name?
Ryan.
Brian.

330
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.270
Brian W.
So you don't only care about a test score,

331
00:22:55.271 --> 00:22:58.660
now you look for other things.
You look for Grit,

332
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.410
you look for leadership ability.
You look for,
um,

333
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.000
analytical ability,
problem solving skills,
ability to work well in a team,

334
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:08.830
collaborate like I can go on and on.
Right?

335
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.150
Aren't you looking for all those things?
Yes.
So among,

336
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.840
I'm not saying the whole of when these kids are 17 years old,

337
00:23:16.841 --> 00:23:20.830
they're nominated to posse and we,
I wish I could stand up.

338
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.950
I always want to stand up,
but we can put them in a room like no,

339
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:26.410
because the camera and the,
Oh,
the whole thing.

340
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:34.050
But imagine a room like this with no furniture and a hundred kids from Boston

341
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.710
come into this room.
They'd been nominated by someone who believes in them.

342
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.240
And the person who believes in them says this kid might not have the best score,

343
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:45.890
but I know her.
She's amazing.

344
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.390
She could kick ass at a school like union.

345
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.320
They walk in and for three hours,
and,
and Brian,

346
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.330
I think you would love this if we did it at Google.

347
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.590
Those hundred kids get put through a series of activities.

348
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.080
They're building robots out of Legos.

349
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.890
They're running a discussion in small groups on genetic testing.
Quick.

350
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:08.420
You have four minutes running discussion.

351
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.870
They're creating a public service announcement that they have to present in

352
00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:15.830
front of you.
And we're watching them and looking for these,

353
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:19.880
what I don't like this term,
but people call noncognitive traits,
their cognitive,

354
00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:24.050
but I'm just anyway.
And we find the standout kids,

355
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.960
the dynamic kids,
the kids who think creatively,

356
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:28.940
the kids who are work well in teams,

357
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:32.990
the kids who are leaders who have ambition and drive and motivation and all of

358
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:36.560
that.
That's our first slice of the pie.
Not just,

359
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.190
we don't even look at the test score yet.
We'll look at that later.

360
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.790
That's one way of finding talent.

361
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:49.030
Kids who are amazing kids who deserve to have a shot at the American dream.

362
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.660
And so we're putting into practice this idea that you shouldn't define merit so

363
00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:57.734
narrowly.

364
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.950
<v 2>No,
I think that's a great example.
I'm also thinking</v>

365
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.920
of some of the TV shows where you can see,

366
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.480
um,
black kids walking across the,
um,

367
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.810
the terrain in front of the projects.
And in,

368
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.000
in one of these shows that there were two brothers who were talking about the

369
00:25:21.001 --> 00:25:25.000
amount of marijuana that they had each,
um,

370
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.070
sold that that particular day and how much money they had made.

371
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:34.490
And the younger one was computing in his head how you know,

372
00:25:35.191 --> 00:25:39.600
how,
how much she had sold and how much he had benefited from the sale.

373
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.750
And his older brother was just amazed because the,

374
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.720
the younger brother who was in the fourth grade or fifth grade,

375
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.620
it was not doing well in math and yet he's doing this in his head.

376
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.960
And so the older brother says,
well,
how come you're,

377
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.870
you're failing math?
And he said,
because,
um,

378
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.420
I don't really care what the outcome is and Meth,

379
00:26:00.421 --> 00:26:04.050
but I care in terms of selling these drugs that if I get it wrong,

380
00:26:04.051 --> 00:26:04.884
they're going to kill me.

381
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:11.060
So there's a talent there but it's not being done in the right format.

382
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.930
<v 1>[inaudible] so we have like a few more minutes to talk and then we're going to</v>

383
00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:19.190
open it up for questions.

384
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:24.730
And I thought maybe it would also be interesting to hear a little bit more about

385
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:30.110
how you think these higher ed institutions can change what you think they can
do.

386
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.681
<v 2>Well,</v>

387
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:38.681
this is an opportunity for me to cry because I've been trying to get

388
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.460
institutions where I teach two at address.

389
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.410
They don't necessarily have to cure,

390
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.910
but at least addressed the issues that we've been discussing.

391
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.610
Now I've been at law schools,

392
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:58.110
not at elementary schools or at quote unquote colleges.

393
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:03.160
But what I did find,
and this is not about,
um,

394
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.840
class as much as it is about gender,
the people at,
um,

395
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.190
both law schools that I was associated or have been associated with,
um,

396
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.410
both at U Penn,
at Harvard,
um,

397
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.340
there are more men than women in the school.
The men outperform the women,

398
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.640
although the women come into the school with very similar criteria as the men in

399
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:29.760
terms of their Lsa t scores and their undergraduate GPA.
In fact,

400
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:34.620
the women have slightly higher undergraduate GPA and have slightly higher Lsa t

401
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:38.820
scores,
but they're statistically not significant.
And yet the women,

402
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.260
when they come to law school,
these are

403
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:50.880
considered important and difficult to get into law schools.

404
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.840
The women have the Lsa t scores that that would presumably predicted they're

405
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:00.660
going to do better in law school,

406
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.190
but they don't do as well as the men in law school.

407
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:10.310
So the Lsa Lsit is predicting about 14% of the variance in first year classes.

408
00:28:11.461 --> 00:28:14.820
This was at Penn and 15% of the variance in second year,

409
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.740
which means that 85% of the time the Lsa t was wrong.
Raw,

410
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.620
w.
R.
O.
N.
G.
So what,

411
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.300
what's showing on the Lsit is not a good predictor.
It,
it,

412
00:28:29.301 --> 00:28:31.890
it,
it tells you how well somebody is at,

413
00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.620
at answering certain questions under a lot of stress.
But,

414
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.820
but that doesn't mean you're going to be a good lawyer and it doesn't mean

415
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:41.310
you're going to be a good a law student either.

416
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:46.610
So if 85% of the time you are wrong in terms of the correlation between your Lsa

417
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:51.060
t scores and your performance,
your performance,

418
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.810
we need to reconsider what we're considering quote unquote merit.
And so what's,

419
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.650
uh,
what should they do?

420
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.270
If you could press the button and Harvard and Yale and Princeton would change,

421
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.060
how would they change?
Well,

422
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.270
the answer to that is a long one because it has,

423
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.740
they'd have to change the culture.

424
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.610
It's not enough just to change the score because you could say,

425
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:19.560
oh well they can check.
They,
they could say if you pass the Lsit,
that's enough.

426
00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:23.740
You don't have to have a higher LSAP.
Since the distinction in your Lsa t score,

427
00:29:23.741 --> 00:29:27.330
he really is not very predictive.
So I mean that,

428
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:31.710
so the lsit could be a floor that is,
you have to get above that floor.

429
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.230
Even if you write above it,
that's fine.

430
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.890
We're not going to compare you to people who are,
um,
doing a lot better.

431
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:41.980
Cause that,
I mean,
I could show you scatter,
et cetera.
We,

432
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:46.480
you see people who had really high LSA t scores and really low,
um,

433
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.650
law school grades.

434
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:52.560
<v 1>I mean,
my guests,
Lonnie,
is that people listening to you?
I have this sense,</v>

435
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.910
no,

436
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:58.620
or wondering if maybe those scores would be more predictive.

437
00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:03.240
If culture was different on these campuses that I as a woman,

438
00:30:03.241 --> 00:30:05.220
I get a high score and I go to Harvard.

439
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.370
But because the culture is a certain way,

440
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.800
my performance is effected,
but I don't know.
Um,

441
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.070
<v 2>but this is true for men and women in terms of the El set.
Oh,</v>

442
00:30:16.071 --> 00:30:19.870
it is good predictor of performance.
So,
so then,

443
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:25.190
so becoming a man is not going to help you in terms of doing better at,

444
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.840
um,
at law schools.
But what I really wanted to get back to,

445
00:30:29.841 --> 00:30:31.460
which is what posse is

446
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:37.910
well known for is the power of working with other people,

447
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:42.890
collaborating and building trust among that group of people,

448
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.050
each of whom is bringing something new,
something different,
something,
um,

449
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:51.920
potentially important too to the group.
And so the challenges,

450
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:57.190
are you in a position to take advantage of what the various people in this room

451
00:30:57.981 --> 00:31:00.920
or in,
in,
in a particular group have to offer?

452
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.580
Or are you one of these people who has to dominate the conversation,

453
00:31:04.581 --> 00:31:08.690
has to show how smart you are and has to take charge in which you're leading and

454
00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:11.930
everyone is just following that could be very boring.

455
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.320
Whereas if and and also not very effective.

456
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.850
Whereas if we had a culture shift,

457
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.560
not just a rule shift,

458
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.620
meaning I cultureship that says what the way we think merit and uh,

459
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.980
Amartya Sen has a definition of merit,
merit.

460
00:31:29.981 --> 00:31:32.360
It is an incentive system that rewards actions,

461
00:31:32.361 --> 00:31:37.070
a society values and incentive system that rewards actions,
the society values.

462
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:38.480
Well,

463
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.230
what are the maybe the actions that we value or not how well you do on the test,

464
00:31:42.231 --> 00:31:46.670
but how well you're doing stopping the real problems of the world and that you

465
00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:51.290
alone are not going to be able to do that.
But if you find the right posse,

466
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.460
you find the right group of people,
each of whom has something to offer,

467
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.570
then you're in a position to start really solving difficult problems.

468
00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:02.150
And it's not that you alone are going to solve them.

469
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.890
And it may not be that even the group you're part of alone is gonna solve the

470
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:11.470
problem,
but you're introducing interventions that,
um,

471
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.680
in invite and excite other people who then build on what you've done.

472
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.030
And through that process,
I think we'll be in much,

473
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.540
much better shape.
By contrast,
what we have right now,

474
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:28.541
at least in college admission and college graduation is competition as to who

475
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:31.490
have chosen us,

476
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.530
who's doing the best that is whose school is,
um,

477
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:41.480
admitting the students with the highest El sat scores and then whose schools are

478
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:44.060
graduating the people who go and make the most money.

479
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.400
And then the idea of the contribution to society,
the,
the,
the,

480
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.540
the commitment to democracy,
the commitment to,
um,

481
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:59.290
making sure that as a democracy we want to make sure everybody as many people as

482
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:04.640
possible are educated because we never know among those people who's going to

483
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:09.500
really contribute something unique and something that's brave and something

484
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.310
that,
that,
that really works.
We don't have a good predictor of,

485
00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:19.490
of that outcome through the Lsit,
the sat,
the GRE,
none of those.

486
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.630
What those,
um,

487
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:25.370
tests tend to tell us is what kind of car your parents drive.

488
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.840
Meaning they co right?
They have enough money to buy a Mercedes.

489
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.860
So you've obviously been able to do well on this test because they've also

490
00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:38.480
bought people who are going to help you to get prepared for the test.

491
00:33:38.481 --> 00:33:42.920
And then of course,
when you're writing out your,
um,
admissions data,

492
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.920
you also get somebody else who writes it for you.
And right there,
there are,

493
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.360
they're working on your behalf presumably,

494
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.600
but they're not going to be there when you're in college and you have an exam or

495
00:33:55.731 --> 00:34:00.731
something else to do that you're really not prepared for because the way you got

496
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:07.001
there was somebody else was pushing you or function as a pedestal on which you

497
00:34:07.791 --> 00:34:09.260
could stand.
So,

498
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.940
so I'm saying all this because I think that the posse program is wonderful,

499
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:19.180
not just because it's bringing together students from working class families,

500
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:25.990
but because it's also giving us the opportunity to see how teams can be created

501
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:28.660
and,
um,

502
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:33.970
and built in ways that not only give people who are part of the team confidence,

503
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.820
but give the people who benefit from the outcome of the work of the team.

504
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:46.420
Uh,
some sense that life is better with the interventions.

505
00:34:46.421 --> 00:34:49.970
I'm going to use that as a quote in our next [inaudible] Ken,
it was good.

506
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.770
So should we,
yes.

507
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.540
Turn to you guys because you have a million questions.
I'm sure.

508
00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.190
I hope not a million,
but um,
starting at the beginning.

509
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.310
<v 3>Okay.
So it sounds like the population that you're most concerned with are the</v>

510
00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:11.050
students that are both minorities and talented.
And I guess I have,

511
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.010
my brother is now applying to colleges.
He's just deciding where he's going.
So,

512
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.570
um,
I've been kind of like hearing a lot about this lately and I have questions

513
00:35:19.571 --> 00:35:21.910
about the population who is either

514
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.950
like some talented but not diverse,
you know,

515
00:35:26.951 --> 00:35:31.900
not minority and the population that is that is maybe not so talented.

516
00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:36.100
So I guess my,
my two kinds of situations are that I,

517
00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:40.980
that I've seen that are kind of like concerning one is say a friend of mine

518
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.350
who's White Guy,
you know,

519
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:48.351
in engineering really smart and like is really struggling to get into schools.

520
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.500
He kick feels like that,
you know,

521
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:56.730
there are a lot of spots that are reserved for people of other categories and

522
00:35:56.731 --> 00:36:00.930
like he's really smart white guy and it's just like really struggling to kind of

523
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:04.980
like get noticed because he doesn't have anything,
anything special.
And in this,

524
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.930
in this particular case,
he gets his parents went to college,
community college,

525
00:36:09.931 --> 00:36:13.410
not really super academic kind of people like you really didn't have,

526
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.440
he wasn't from,
you know,
like a Mercedes driving kind of family.

527
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:21.090
Didn't really get the,
like the,
the support and the motivation and everything.

528
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.510
But he feels like,
because you know,
he's white doesn't really count for anything.

529
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.440
So that's kind of like the one situation of like talented but not minority.

530
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:33.950
And the other situation that I see are people who are really not interested in

531
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:36.070
pursuing academic careers.
Their intro,
you know,

532
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.300
I actually was a serious ballet dancer and a lot of my friends didn't go to

533
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:41.580
college because if you want to be a valid answer,

534
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.580
why would you spend $160,000 on a college education?

535
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.300
It doesn't make any sense or more,
um,
more.
Yeah.
So,

536
00:36:48.301 --> 00:36:52.920
so what about for those people who want to,
or they want to pursue culinary arts?

537
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:57.150
So they want to do whatever else that doesn't,
shouldn't require.

538
00:36:57.151 --> 00:37:00.630
It doesn't depend on getting your college education where they feel like they're

539
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:04.920
being pressured to spend a fortune.

540
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:07.650
And go into debt to get an education that maybe,

541
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:12.300
maybe they could have an excellent professional career doing the things that

542
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:15.870
they want with another path that somehow looked down upon.

543
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.380
So I guess what are your thoughts on,
on people in those two situations?

544
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.250
<v 2>Either way.
Yeah,
go ahead.
So</v>

545
00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:30.430
first I think you should go to Canada.
You don't have to stay,

546
00:37:30.431 --> 00:37:35.431
just visit and see the way in which they admit people to their schools.

547
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.010
You have a grade point average of over 80%.

548
00:37:39.011 --> 00:37:43.240
You're automatically admitted to one of their,
um,
colleges.

549
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:48.310
And I don't know that you're entitled to your first choice,

550
00:37:48.311 --> 00:37:52.720
but they try and give you at least one of your first three choices.

551
00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:58.090
And I don't,
um,
I don't believe college is free,

552
00:37:58.091 --> 00:37:59.740
but it's not very expensive.

553
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:03.550
So if that would solve a lot of the problems that,
that,

554
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.940
that you're talking about,
the other point that you're making though,

555
00:38:06.941 --> 00:38:11.680
I think is really important and that is that people are coming to college and

556
00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:13.720
they're really not there to learn.

557
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:18.960
They're there to promote themselves into another sphere where there'll be making

558
00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:25.360
a lot of money.
So,
for example,
in the Harvard Crimson of about five

559
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.060
or so years ago,

560
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:32.530
they had an article called show him the money that was the front page of the

561
00:38:32.531 --> 00:38:34.510
Harvard Crimson.
That's the newspaper,

562
00:38:34.511 --> 00:38:38.890
the students and what they were commenting on.

563
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:41.380
And they had done a survey of the graduating class.

564
00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:44.800
This was in May of that year.

565
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.200
And the survey noted that the men from Harvard wanted to go to Wall Street

566
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.670
because they want it to make a lot of money.

567
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:56.440
And the women wanted to become lawyers or,
or doctors or teachers.

568
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.520
And the people who were writing this article were making fun of the women,

569
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.020
the women who wanted to do good because they should have been trying to get the

570
00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:11.890
money.
And it suggests that,
that's why I say you need a culture shift.

571
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.350
It's not just the,

572
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.740
that you have a certain group of people and not another group of people.

573
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:22.741
It's that the culture of higher education has lost some of its connection to the

574
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:27.010
Di,

575
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:32.010
the promoting democracy and the importance of civic involvement.

576
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.320
That is the basis of um,
of,

577
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.020
of many of the colleges in,
in,
in this country.
It's,

578
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.710
it's the reason that they were created and yet they've,

579
00:39:43.711 --> 00:39:48.711
they've been shifted from an engine of democracy to an engine of plutocracy

580
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.360
<v 1>and Monica,
I think there,
can you help me answer this also there's,</v>

581
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.410
I have an idea formulation.
They,

582
00:39:55.411 --> 00:40:00.411
because behind what you're saying is a question that I've heard a lot of times

583
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.953
from

584
00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:09.460
white people whose kids are applying to college and they're worried that the

585
00:40:10.521 --> 00:40:14.480
black kid is going to take the spot that their kid should get.

586
00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.700
And I'm not saying this is your question,

587
00:40:16.701 --> 00:40:21.701
but I hear it kind of and I sh I hear that question a lot.

588
00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:28.780
There's a black kid in my daughter's school and she didn't score as well as my

589
00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:34.190
daughter did on the sat and I know she's going to get in to x school and my

590
00:40:34.191 --> 00:40:38.930
daughter deserves to be at that school and there is resentment that builds.

591
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.680
How do you,
how are you supposed to think about that?

592
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.140
How does the country think about that?

593
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:50.650
It is very difficult for us to understand that the numbers of black kids going

594
00:40:54.141 --> 00:40:59.141
to these elite institutions is very small and 10 extra or 20 extra kids that get

595
00:41:02.601 --> 00:41:04.730
inserted into that freshman class,

596
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:10.270
even if they didn't have the test score is not the effect it has on the number

597
00:41:12.141 --> 00:41:15.950
of white students applying in.
Their chances of getting in is minuscule,

598
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.400
but it feels big because we all know of a black kid who gets in with a lower

599
00:41:23.451 --> 00:41:24.050
score.

600
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:29.050
It's this problem of using the score to define deserving anyone in this room and

601
00:41:29.871 --> 00:41:34.010
listening and online and all of that.
Who thinks that admissions

602
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.130
<v 2>is,
this is an objective process is wrong.</v>

603
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:42.380
It's completely subjective.
The Dean of admission says,

604
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:46.220
we need a violinist.
Let's try and find a great violinist for our orchestra.

605
00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:52.310
We this year we need more kids who want a major in our new curriculum in

606
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.890
communications.
It's just about building a class,

607
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.520
but we're so competitive and we,

608
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.950
we compete against our friends and our kids friends and our parents rent.

609
00:42:05.951 --> 00:42:08.900
All of this stuff that we end up resenting.

610
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.660
The black kid who got in with the lower score.

611
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:16.010
It's a big problem and I don't know how to articulate it more,

612
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:19.910
but yeah,
no,
I think you've articulated it very effectively.

613
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:22.220
The question is what's the intervention?

614
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.970
What like how do we change our mindset almost doubled.

615
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.120
I think we have to go back to,
um,

616
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.570
understanding what's the purpose of higher education and it's not there simply

617
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:37.010
to give your child or my child an opportunity to make a lot of money.
Right?

618
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:42.080
It's also a very important engine of democracy and that's the part of the Co,

619
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.410
the college that we don't really talk about that we want students who are going

620
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:52.931
to graduate from college and make a contribution to our society that promotes

621
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:59.060
democracy.
That by democracy I don't mean,
I mean fairness.
I mean,

622
00:42:59.290 --> 00:42:59.720
um,

623
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.720
engagement of the citizen re in making decisions that affect their lives in our

624
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:09.860
lives.
That we're not,
that college is not just a platform for,

625
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:14.930
um,
becoming a millionaire or becoming,
um,
continuing in your,

626
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:19.940
your parents footsteps and being a person.
Yeah.
Great.

627
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:22.940
Great way of framing it.
Thank you.

628
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.730
<v 4>Are you okay with somewhat more of a comment than a question?</v>

629
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.950
<v 2>No,
absolutely not.
You need to sit down.
No,
just kidding.
Just kidding.</v>

630
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.840
<v 4>I see the essence of,
of what you were saying as as three areas.</v>

631
00:43:35.841 --> 00:43:40.841
One is scoring people based on some perceived stability being done badly and the

632
00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:46.100
alternative is,
is over credentialism you have a degree,

633
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:50.510
therefore you must be qualified to do an entire class of work unrelated to the

634
00:43:50.511 --> 00:43:55.190
degree.
Um,
there is the diversity aspect where,

635
00:43:55.850 --> 00:44:00.800
um,
you're clearly losing the game if you're not getting included in,

636
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:05.240
in the solution,
um,
and someone else's disproportionately winning the game.

637
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:10.730
But my pet peeve is the,
the posse versus singular,
um,
uh,

638
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.330
model of it.
Survival of the fittest

639
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:20.180
is universally accepted as the driver of evolution.

640
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.900
That if you have someone who keeps his tribal live by sacrificing himself or

641
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:29.330
herself,
then then I'm,

642
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.850
that person's genes aren't being carried down directly and therefore,

643
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:34.530
clearly that person was a failure.

644
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.410
But if you look at how evolution actually works,

645
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.050
the tribe's succeeds.

646
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:44.960
The tribe survives because one person was willing to sacrifice for the group's

647
00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:49.500
success.
And that strikes me as an almost direct,
um,

648
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.210
uh,
um,
very,

649
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:57.780
it's very much of the issue of you have five people were very good each at one

650
00:44:57.781 --> 00:44:59.970
science and none of them can get along.

651
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:05.160
You add a sixth person who gets people along with each other and finally the

652
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:09.420
team can succeed rather than being a bunch of individuals.
Even for leadership,

653
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:12.060
which is one of the aspects we consider in recruitment.

654
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.150
It is hierarchical sort of leadership.

655
00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:19.260
We look at it is not management of a group to make the group effective.

656
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.070
It is domination of the group in order to make the group do what it's told.

657
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.670
And I feel like that is not just some people are winning and are there,

658
00:45:29.191 --> 00:45:30.210
people are losing.

659
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:35.211
But our consensus as a society seems to be on the wrong rules of the wrong rules

660
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:39.390
of physics,
you might say about how these things work.

661
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:43.050
And I feel like that is an understanding that needs to be spread.

662
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:44.400
And I'm glad you're doing it.

663
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.473
<v 5>Oh,</v>

664
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.810
well I'm glad you just came up and made what I thought was a very powerful

665
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.900
argument.
So thank you.
So,
uh,

666
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.450
I have just enough personal experience,

667
00:45:57.451 --> 00:46:00.720
not nearly as much as either or both of yours to beat dangerous sadness,

668
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.470
meaning I had a daughter who went through the process this year and I'm a

669
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:07.440
regional enrollment director from my Amada.
Okay.

670
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:12.441
So I see a lot of really scary numbers and things experiences happen from both

671
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:15.090
the applicant perspective and the alumni perspective.

672
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:21.140
So my view is the entire process is of getting into colleges and going through

673
00:46:21.391 --> 00:46:23.430
colleges.
It's completely broken for everybody,

674
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:27.870
regardless of what your socioeconomic,
racial,

675
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:30.960
gender classes,
it's a hundred percent broken for everybody.

676
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:36.380
And somebody has to do something drastic soon to take a leadership role and

677
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:37.854
changing it.

678
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.960
But because institutions exist to continue to exist,

679
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.690
it's happening way too slowly.

680
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.960
So I going to tell you an idea I sent to my,

681
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.640
our admissions director at our campus this spring that I think after his,

682
00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.640
you know,
eyes and ears got done bleeding after he read the idea,

683
00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:00.660
he sent me a politically correct no back.
Okay.
But my,

684
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.330
my idea was because there's all the,

685
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:08.190
all these colleges are keeping score on an yeah.
Rankings,

686
00:47:08.191 --> 00:47:13.020
number of applications yields accepted it.
There's all kinds of scorecards.

687
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:18.450
I said,
my recommendation is next year we have no applications.

688
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.740
There is no application process.
The process is,

689
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.110
well not exactly.

690
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:30.170
You take your admissions officers who spend time reading too many applications

691
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.940
and delivering on the admission directors need for the communications class with

692
00:47:35.941 --> 00:47:39.700
a violinist and they just go out into the community and they find your,

693
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.470
they find it right.
1200 people for it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Why don't we do that?

694
00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:48.790
Someone's got to be first.
Yeah,
and so my question for you is,

695
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:53.200
is anybody close to being first with anything that matters in this?
I mean,

696
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:57.810
the closest thing I see to this is maybe what's happening in technology with Ed

697
00:47:57.811 --> 00:47:58.960
acts and things like that,

698
00:47:58.961 --> 00:48:01.900
but they are still premium institutions and they haven't figured out how to

699
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:02.734
commercialize it,

700
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:07.180
but it's anybody doing anything material to be first at this and start to change

701
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:08.014
it.

702
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.900
<v 1>I mean,
I have some,
yes.
Some things.</v>

703
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.370
I love what you're saying because you're saying we have to be radical,
right?

704
00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.390
It's not enough.
This little small,
you know Lonnie,

705
00:48:20.391 --> 00:48:24.800
who's a civil rights expert and witnessed the progress we made his,

706
00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:29.600
his all to witnessing as we all are,
how how we are moving backwards.

707
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.290
We striked down the voting rights act and we lose affirmative action and we

708
00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:35.180
think because we're there,
we've solved the problem.

709
00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.330
We have a black president done but so we need to be more radical because we move

710
00:48:42.261 --> 00:48:46.730
away too slowly.
As you're saying,
so what you know moocs have evolved.

711
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.880
Higher Ed is going to change the,
there's,
we call it sometimes the,

712
00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.170
the higher ed bubble.
Remember we had these,

713
00:48:54.171 --> 00:48:57.350
these other technology bubbles and stuff,
but it's going to burst.

714
00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:02.330
People will not be able to afford this kind of higher education within the next,

715
00:49:02.331 --> 00:49:05.840
I don't know how many years.
The schools can't afford it.
We can't afford it.

716
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:06.920
Something's going to change.

717
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.120
I just wanted to mention this is not supposed to be about posse.

718
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:16.150
I wanted to mention that this year we had 15,000 nominations from all over the

719
00:49:16.491 --> 00:49:21.491
United States for 700 slots and every one of those 15,000 kids came from someone

720
00:49:23.181 --> 00:49:27.260
who said,
this is a great kid.
He should be going to this great school.

721
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:31.400
Someone who believes in this kid knows this kid.
Frankly,
in my opinion,

722
00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:35.840
all 15,000 of those kids should be sent to these great schools.

723
00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:39.890
Nothing would happen that's bad.
It would only be good,

724
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:44.990
but those 15,000 kids came into a room that was radically different.

725
00:49:44.991 --> 00:49:47.120
It wasn't about scores and grades and tests.

726
00:49:47.121 --> 00:49:51.890
It was about all of these other qualities that we think could make a great

727
00:49:51.891 --> 00:49:54.980
student on a campus and a great leader in the workforce.

728
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.680
If we could do more of that,

729
00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:02.000
replicate these large group interviews,

730
00:50:02.001 --> 00:50:07.001
these large group opportunities for companies like Google to hire for schools

731
00:50:08.091 --> 00:50:12.410
like Vanderbilt to admit students for whatever it is that we're looking for.

732
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:17.440
It gives us another way of finding talent that's more radical because it's not

733
00:50:17.691 --> 00:50:20.870
just sitting in a room and looking at a piece of paper and making a decision.

734
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:26.330
I know we are,
we're running out of time because it's with three minutes.

735
00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:28.850
But I love that.

736
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:32.960
And there are things that are happening and I just think we need to keep pushing

737
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:35.840
it really loudly that,
that we should,

738
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:39.860
we should radically change the system or it'll just break like you said,

739
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:41.630
and then we will have no choice.

740
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.080
We cannot end on that note.

741
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.860
So please ask them.

742
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:53.900
<v 7>I'll be real fast cause of time.
Um,</v>

743
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.940
meritocracy rests on a bedrock of scarcity.

744
00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:01.260
We can only enlist x many people each year.

745
00:51:01.261 --> 00:51:04.770
So how do we pick,
and you make good points about changing the metric,

746
00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:08.460
but you also mentioned if I change the metric than some other people who

747
00:51:08.461 --> 00:51:10.050
might've otherwise deserve don't get to go.

748
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:14.460
The other way to approach that problem is to drastically increase the number of

749
00:51:14.461 --> 00:51:15.900
people who are able to go.

750
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:20.010
So what are your thoughts about changing that restriction of the small number of

751
00:51:20.011 --> 00:51:22.260
people who are kind of able to go to college?

752
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:26.110
<v 1>That's positive.
Yeah,
I agree with you.</v>

753
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.093
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

754
00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:36.780
<v 1>Moocs might be able to make that happen.
You know,</v>

755
00:51:36.781 --> 00:51:39.690
we may be able to create more systems that take more kids,

756
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:43.740
go to Canada and see what they do.
That again,
this is,
nope,
I'm bring,

757
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.170
because if you have 80% or above,
um,
in,
in terms of your,

758
00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.780
uh,
high school grades,
you're entitled to go to college in Canada.

759
00:51:54.781 --> 00:51:56.340
They've figured that out.

760
00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.280
<v 6>Yup.
Right?</v>

761
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.050
<v 7>My kids are not Canadian.
All right.</v>

762
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.430
I have a nine year old and a six year old and nine months I've done.

763
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.380
I'm glad they're not getting into college at this age.

764
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.470
I have to start financially planning for that now because it's going to cost me

765
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:17.470
half a million dollars to send them and I,
how do we solve that problem?
Right.

766
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.280
You know what I mean?
But that's part of what I'm seeing.

767
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:22.160
Literacy is so important that we give it away for free.

768
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:26.660
<v 1>Five Sec.
Go to Canada.
And you know what?</v>

769
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:28.260
I think what you're hearing is that we can,

770
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.800
but it's not an answerable question right now.
You're right.

771
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.720
We need everybody to feel like the opportunity to reach an American dream.

772
00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:40.540
Whatever that dream is,
exists.
And it feels unbelievably unfair,
right?

773
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.580
We're living in a country that has 33% of its population living in poverty or

774
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:48.560
what we call near poverty,

775
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:53.780
33% those kids,
we don't even talk about them.

776
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:57.500
Do you read about the poverty that exists in United States?
You don't really.

777
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.020
And so we need to talk about it.

778
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:04.670
The middle class has gotten squeezed out of education because the cost is so

779
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:08.510
enormous.
So we end up with schools that we called rich poor schools.

780
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:12.470
The rich kids can go and the really poor kids can get these scholarships.

781
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:14.030
It's not enough.

782
00:53:14.031 --> 00:53:19.031
And we need to find a way to make state systems work for everybody to make great

783
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:23.840
schools expand what they offer to more people.
And we haven't figured it out.

784
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.850
You're right.
We have to figure it out.
And maybe by the time your kids are older,

785
00:53:26.851 --> 00:53:28.720
there'll be something great but okay.

786
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.130
<v 2>But it's not just an,
and I think what you just said is great,</v>

787
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:36.940
but it's not as too negative.
No,
no,
no,
no.
But it's something that we,
yeah,

788
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:40.680
we don't have the capacity to solve that problem alone.
But it's,

789
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:43.710
it's an issue that that's why I keep talking about Canada.

790
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.750
You should go to Finland or to other countries and see that in these other

791
00:53:48.751 --> 00:53:53.751
countries they are committed to making sure every student to use them as models.

792
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.880
Yeah.
Something we could copy.
Yeah.
Right.
If we think we are

793
00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:01.110
in a position of greatness,

794
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:05.820
we need to go and actually see greatness that is democratic as opposed to

795
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:08.700
plutocratic as what,
which is what we have here.

796
00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:14.570
<v 8>So we said the test scores are not predictive of of college success,</v>

797
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.230
but you have this posse selection process.
Is that,
is that predictive?

798
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.820
<v 1>Yeah,
so I didn't say they're not predictive.</v>

799
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.610
Test scores are limited.

800
00:54:24.611 --> 00:54:29.080
They predict for some kids and the only thing the sats predict is how well

801
00:54:29.081 --> 00:54:30.700
you're going to do your first year in college,

802
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:34.750
what your GPA will be and it doesn't PR again,
it's like Loni said,

803
00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:37.660
it's incredibly flood,
but it finds some great kids.

804
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.560
Posse kids graduated rates of over 90% from 52 colleges and universities that we

805
00:54:46.541 --> 00:54:51.541
send them to thousands of posse kids have one $800 million in scholarships over

806
00:54:51.881 --> 00:54:53.260
the past 25 years.

807
00:54:53.261 --> 00:54:58.030
So we've got a program that's showing that what Lonnie's talking about totally

808
00:54:58.031 --> 00:55:02.470
works,
right?
We've got thousands of kids in an experiment,

809
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:07.800
and this other way of identifying talent is just as good as the sat.

810
00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.680
All I'm saying is we can't just only use the sat.

811
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:16.510
We need many more ways of finding great kids,
and then the cost is another issue.

812
00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.840
Yeah.
Okay.
You guys,
thank you so much,
Lani.

813
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:25.000
A pleasure to be with you.
Thank you everybody.
