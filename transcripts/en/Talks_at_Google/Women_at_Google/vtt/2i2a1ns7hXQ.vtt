1
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.380
Welcome to Hadley Freeman,
uh,

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.410
author of life moves pretty fast and various other things.
Uh,

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.360
so very warm welcome to you.
It seems we're in a room,
at least with,

4
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.770
uh,
people who haven't read the book yet.
Uh,

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.410
so I wonder if you could just start by giving us a brief precis of what it's

6
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:25.490
about and why you wrote it.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.450
<v 0>Right.
So this book,
uh,</v>

8
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:31.020
who to her about almost three years ago now is a bout eighties movies,

9
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:32.520
which I love very deeply,

10
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:35.340
and it's not just a nostalgia fest because obviously you can turn on channel

11
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.750
five any night and see loads of utterly random talking head,
just going,
oh yeah,

12
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:43.680
mannequin.
It's amazing.
Oh yeah,
that's the future.
It's amazing.
Obviously that is,

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.430
those are all true,
although my actually quibble with the medication.

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.370
But what I wanted to write about is how these movies from the eighties movies,

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.540
these movies from the 80s teach us lessons that we don't get today.

16
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:59.220
And that is because actually Hollywood was weirdly very liberal in the 80s and

17
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.040
they were able to do really interesting things with movies that we don't get

18
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.090
today.
So,
for example,

19
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:07.920
depicting abortion on screen in a positive light or having a black act or take a

20
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.400
role that was written for a white actor.
Um,
and all sorts of things like that,

21
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:15.270
depictions of masculinity,
um,
movies made about,
and just for women,

22
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:17.850
all those things were coming out of the 80s and we don't really get those

23
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:18.630
anymore.

24
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.290
<v 2>Okay.
So that's sort of why you rate it.</v>

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.180
One of the things that strikes me most when reading it is just how much fun it

26
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:29.550
seemed that you were having so much fraud.

27
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.780
Where's that genuinely real or are you just really skillful at writing as if it

28
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:34.520
were that much fun?

29
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.680
<v 0>Well,
there was a lot of angsting beforehand.</v>

30
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.830
Once I had this idea because my publishers were really not into it.

31
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:43.400
They just thought nobody buys books about movies,

32
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:46.250
which I quibble with almost all my bookshelves are filled with books about

33
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:50.600
movies and eighties movies,
bit passe.
Now.
Does anybody really care about that?

34
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.960
And I just knew they did.
I knew they did.
All my friends love eighties movies.

35
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:57.500
I love eighties movies and I very much live by the maximum you should write

36
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:58.670
about what you're interested in.

37
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.890
Not trying to guess what other people are interested in,

38
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.060
which sometimes doesn't always work for lay readers would say from the Guardian.

39
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.090
But I believe if someone is passionate about their subject,

40
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:11.450
that really comes through.
And so I asked it a lot,
but how am I going to do this?

41
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:13.790
And I thought,
how do I sell this to people?
Did it?
And then I just thought,

42
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.640
stop worrying about it.
Stop trying to convince your publishers.

43
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.160
Just write the book you want to write.
Write the book you wanted to read.

44
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:22.300
Which is always what I say to aspiring writers when they ask,
you know,

45
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.410
how do they find their voice?
So what,
what should they be writing about?

46
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:25.640
I just say,
right where you want to read.

47
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.380
And I just thought I'm going to write what I want to read.

48
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.660
And it was so much fun.
And the more I wrote in,

49
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:32.600
the more I spoke to friends about it and the more enthusiastic I saw.

50
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:33.710
All my friends were at,

51
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:36.440
my parents' friends were and other people are getting really into it and saying,

52
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.580
Oh my God,
you've got to talk about,

53
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:40.460
obviously you know the 10 best montage is and you've got to do,
you know,

54
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.070
the 10 greatest power of is everybody had all these lists,

55
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:46.200
ideas for me and obviously you're going to have to include the lost boys and the

56
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.070
this and the that.
And I thought,
Oh wow,
people really are into this.

57
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.963
And then I had,

58
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.910
then I suddenly got a burst of confidence and then it was so much fun to write.

59
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.200
<v 2>Well I think we can,
we can see,
even if it weren't for the book,</v>

60
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.930
by stranger things and ready player one,

61
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.190
there is so much almost pen touch nostalgia for the ATC.

62
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.810
<v 0>Yeah.
Which,</v>

63
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.270
and that really wasn't around as much when I was writing it because I was

64
00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:10.390
writing it in 2014 you mister,
you created that.
I created it.
I don't think,

65
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.600
I think I'm part of it,
which is,

66
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:15.750
I don't mean like I'm anywhere on the same level of stranger things,
but I'm,

67
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.840
I have this idea that there's a 30 year rule,
which is it,
that it takes 30 years.

68
00:03:18.841 --> 00:03:23.010
So people still look back on a decade with nostalgia and that's because kids who

69
00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:26.250
grew up in that decade are now adults and they're now making the content and

70
00:03:26.251 --> 00:03:27.150
they're looking back at you.
I see.

71
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:29.280
That was what was great and they're putting it out there.

72
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:31.710
So I'm very much of that generation that is putting it out there.

73
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.183
<v 2>Cool.</v>

74
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.290
So let's dive straight into specific films and specific messages that you've

75
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.800
taken out of them.
Um,

76
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.740
I'm going to start with Ghostbusters because I watched it all last night.
Um,

77
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.650
I was meant to be writing a book and I thought,
I'm eating healthy.

78
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.210
I'm going to watch you guys buses.
Hello it.
Indeed.
Awesome.
Um,

79
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.510
and it,
it's aged pretty well.
It's amazing for the most part.
Yeah.
Um,

80
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.980
so you bring out this as,
uh,

81
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.730
almost male role models of friendship.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

82
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.300
and obviously as soon as he started talking about the eighties,
Ghostbusters,

83
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.950
you think 2016 Ghostbusters,

84
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.420
how would you compare them in terms of,
uh,

85
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.200
does the reboot,
whatever you want to call it,
of Ghostbusters,

86
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:21.280
portray female friendships in the same kind of way?

87
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.900
Or was it more extreme?
I mean the,

88
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.570
the friendships in original Ghostbusters are reasonably extreme and non non

89
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.000
normal that there's,
there's a certain truth there.

90
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.940
<v 0>There is.
And also obviously with part of the time of eighties,
Ghostbusters is,</v>

91
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.910
it is,
it was so based on their real life friendship,

92
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.520
particularly I'd Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd,
uh,

93
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.260
who were friends from Saturday night live.
And in fact,

94
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:44.830
Dan Akroyd originally wrote Ghostbusters for him and his best friend John

95
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.130
Belushi,
uh,
who died in the middle of John Belushi literally writing,

96
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:49.840
he wrote a line in the script.

97
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:54.330
He got a phone call saying the John Belushi had overdosed in Beverly Hills.
Um,

98
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.580
so he was writing it for the two of them.
And you can sense that friendship.

99
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.560
And Harold Ramis was a close friend of theirs as well.

100
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:03.100
And I really feel you can have that feeling that these guys all know each other

101
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.260
to love each other and appreciate each other's weirdness.
You know,

102
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:09.190
they all called Bill Murray the murder Cain and obviously Harold Ramis then made

103
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.180
other movies and deck.

104
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.930
We've made other movies with Bill Murray and Harold Ramis obviously then make a

105
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.510
groundhog day with Bill Murray.
And they had a very complicated friendship.

106
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:18.190
They're all like always falling out with each other.

107
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.820
It was a very weird time to be a very successful male comedian in the 80s,

108
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.880
but I feel that all comes across and you sense that despite the weirdness,

109
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.420
they'll love each other truly.
Um,

110
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.290
and now I had so much goodwill towards the 2016 female Ghostbusters.

111
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.230
First of all,
I love the idea of women carrying a great franchise.

112
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.470
I really love Paul Feig that he's the one who's championing this idea.

113
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.020
He's the one who directed it and I believe her,
the screenplay for it.

114
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.180
I think Melissa McCarthy,
Kristen Wiig,

115
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.020
all good things and it just completely didn't work,
which was disappointing.

116
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:50.140
It was a bit like watching Hillary Clinton's presidency bed.

117
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:54.100
It was just like you really want it to work and it just,
it didn't work.
Um,

118
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.530
and I think so many of the things that were wrong with it exemplify what's wrong

119
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:00.350
with movies.
These kind of big movies today compared to the 80s,

120
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.680
I mean for a start,
it was all filmed on studio lots.

121
00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:05.360
So the whole city looks really anonymous and generic.

122
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.060
You don't really get a sense of where on earth these people are.

123
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.390
Whereas in the 80s,
Ghostbusters,
it's very much New York City.

124
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.170
Like they are on the New York streets.
They're going to tavern on the green.

125
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.740
This restaurant in central park,
which is where Rick Moran has,

126
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.460
has his freak out when he's turned into the goal.
Um,

127
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.520
you see the taxi's going around the corners,
the piles of garbage,

128
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:23.660
Larry King on TV.

129
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.260
And there's a specificity about that obviously in New York public library that

130
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.370
is very charming and people then sense that this is real.
This is real.

131
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.610
It definitely helps.
And if you grew up in New York as I did,

132
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.920
but I feel you're watching this,
you're like,
okay,
this is real.
I mean,

133
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.020
I watched Ferris Bueller when I was like eight,

134
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.700
so when I first saw it and I'd never been to Chicago,

135
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:42.560
I didn't go to Chicago until I was an adult,

136
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:43.880
which is weird cause I only lived in New York,

137
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.600
but I liked that they were all in the streets.
They were going to the museum,

138
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.540
they were going to restaurants.
Like I got a sense of Chicago.

139
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.190
It wasn't just some generic studio lot that could be used for a sitcom the next

140
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.980
day.
Um,
and there was no rough edges to the 2016 Ghostbusters.

141
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.800
I mean Bill Murray and the original Ghostbusters is really freaking weird.

142
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.460
I mean he was like giving electric shocks to the teenage boy when it opens.

143
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.260
It's latching on everything.

144
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.180
He's basically stalking a Sigourney weaver and the movie accepts all that and

145
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:17.120
isn't excusing it.
And in fact she's making fun of his face to it,

146
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.810
whereas I didn't,
you don't get that as much.
It felt more try hard,

147
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:24.020
but they were trying to do with the characters there.
Um,

148
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.350
and I mean,
first of all,
I really don't,

149
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:31.220
I think it's a mistake to try to reboot such a beloved movie as Ghostbusters.

150
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.740
I mean even Ghostbusters couldn't do it in the 80s when they make those posters

151
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:35.660
too and everyone got cross about it.
Uh,

152
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.920
so I don't really know why you would do that.

153
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:38.480
Why not just make your own new movie?

154
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.590
<v 2>Right.
Which I guess at the same time we have,
uh,
if,</v>

155
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.640
if we're looking for strong women needs,
et Cetera,
we have wonder woman.

156
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.350
<v 0>Hello.
It's an old movie too.</v>

157
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.120
I mean that is piggy backing on another old franchise,
which is fair.
It's true.

158
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.380
Which is fair.
Um,

159
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.400
but people will always have sentimental feelings about little movies.
I mean,

160
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:01.510
I feel like that is the wrong way to rehash eighties movies the right way is to

161
00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:02.890
do something like stranger things,

162
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.850
which kind of digest all these eighties movies and make something totally new

163
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.450
through them without then having people my age and older being like,
Ooh,

164
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.850
as good as the original cause it is original.

165
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:16.330
It's just doing all these amazing homogenous to stand by me and alien and all

166
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:17.164
this cool stuff.

167
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.400
<v 2>So that brings me to TV in general.
Uh,</v>

168
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.050
you go in detail in the book into the economics of why films aren't made in the

169
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:28.064
same way,

170
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.950
why things like dirty dancing just wouldn't get meet them at all.
Um,

171
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.460
but it feels to me like interesting things are happening on TV.

172
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.031
<v 0>Definitely.</v>

173
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:41.180
I mean that is where things are happening now and I don't necessarily think

174
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:42.290
that's a bad thing.

175
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:45.740
I do think you lose something from not having that big go to the cinema,

176
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:49.040
but I know I sound like I'm sitting in my rocking chair on a porch talking about

177
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:49.610
this,

178
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.610
but I remember the weekend Batman came out in 1989 and to the movie theater with

179
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:58.590
my dad and it was such a huge deal.

180
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.180
I mean probably you guys all weren't even alive then,

181
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:02.460
but it was such a big deal when this came out.

182
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.250
Like this movie had been building up all summer.
You go to the cinema,

183
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:08.430
there's all this Batman Logos and Signia everywhere.
I'd always say at the time,

184
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:11.130
grown up like this,
this is discussing and so commercial before a kid,

185
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.911
this is amazing.

186
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:16.560
And I felt like really collective experience sitting in the cinema watching Tim

187
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.610
Burton's Gotham city,
you know,
seeing Jack Nicholson.
Yeah,
it was amazing.

188
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.530
And you don't have quite that same feeling watching something on TV.

189
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.380
You just don't and you don't,
it's not even about who the glory of the cinema.

190
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.040
It's more that everybody's watching things at different times now and it's,

191
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.310
it's more of an individual experience rather than a collective experience.

192
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.740
<v 2>I guess.
All the,
uh,
thinking about when Handmaid's tale was on.
Yup.
That would,</v>

193
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.810
I would watch it without being able to breathe barely until the adverts and then

194
00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:47.900
suddenly checked with Twitter.
You see everything,
there's a sort of different,

195
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:48.020
yeah,

196
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.940
<v 0>it's a different elective experience.
It is.
You know,
Judd Apatow,
um,</v>

197
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.850
talks very sort of sentimentally I think in the book I use the quote where he

198
00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:58.670
talks about going to the Ghostbusters when that opened,
going to go,

199
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.610
suppose his movie and standing in the line around the block.
And yes,

200
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:05.030
this does sound like we're all talking about going to drive ins in the 1950s or

201
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:05.630
something.

202
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.780
But there is something to gain from that and there is something else to be

203
00:10:08.781 --> 00:10:11.150
gained from watching things on TV and like tweeting about it with your friends

204
00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:13.970
and seeing what Armando Iannucci is saying about something that you just watched

205
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:16.740
and other people who you like Sharon Horgan,
whoever.
Um,

206
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.480
but I think there's something sad about the kind of,

207
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:23.200
it was really kind of a slow death of big cinema really.

208
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.350
Cause that is what I grew up with.

209
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.313
<v 2>Yeah.
I,</v>

210
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.370
I think it'll be interesting to see what happens to cinema in the next 10,

211
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:33.960
20 years with more and more great stuff coming on TV basically.

212
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.900
<v 0>Yeah.
Which they're not even trying to compete with because they're too scared to</v>

213
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:37.734
compete with really

214
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.050
<v 2>occasionally cinema is we'll show TV series at the cinema and that sort of</v>

215
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.430
sounds a strange,

216
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.720
strange situation going back to the lessons that we should have been learning.

217
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.660
Um,
it feels,
yeah,

218
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:55.350
the title is the lessons we learned as if it job done.

219
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.080
We don't need to talk about those things.
We've,
we've learned now,

220
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.520
I'm pretty sure you'll agree that a lot of these lessons haven't been learned.

221
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:06.300
No,
that's right.
Is there any one in particular that you think we really need,

222
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:08.680
is that one of these films that you should say,
great,

223
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.360
this should be on the curriculum.
Everyone should just get the message.

224
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.040
<v 0>I mean,
I as a,
as a woman in feminist,
all the rest of it,
I mean,</v>

225
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:18.450
I would say dirty dancing.
Really.

226
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:23.310
I do think dirty dancing is an amazing movie and people particularly not wanting

227
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:24.600
to gender stereotype,
you're a particularly,

228
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.980
men tend to laugh at me when I say that.
Um,

229
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.450
I've yet to meet a man who's ever seen dirty dancing willingly and not been

230
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:30.870
forced yeah.

231
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.590
<v 2>By his girlfriend or wife.
Absolutely.</v>

232
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.130
<v 0>Well,
I come to Google,
everything is here,
um,
at,
but it is an incredible movie.</v>

233
00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:43.270
It's a movie about the importance of legal abortion.
Um,
which is what I,

234
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.160
Eleanor Bergstein the screenwriter wrote it to be,

235
00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:49.020
she wa she felt in the 80s that women were taking feminism and,
um,

236
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.840
access to abortion for granted.
And that Roe versus Wade was under threat.

237
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.280
And so she wanted to write a movie for teenagers that stress the importance of

238
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:59.110
it.
And so she took this movie,
set it in,

239
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.420
I believe it's the end of the fifties and sixties,
isn't it?

240
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.170
That must be the fifties,
um,
where abortion was still illegal in America.

241
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.170
And there's a character in the movie who gets pregnant and has to have an

242
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:12.430
illegal abortion and then has to be saved by Jennifer Gray or a character called

243
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.230
baby.
Jennifer grade's dad who's a doctor.

244
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.140
And this is really just like slid into the movie.
I mean,

245
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:18.450
obviously when people think of dirty dancing,

246
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.550
they think of Patrick Swayze holding up dinner for gray and the leg and you
know,

247
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:24.340
the two of them having sex and all the cool songs on the soundtrack.
I mean,

248
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:25.840
and that is what you're supposed to see.

249
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:31.240
But she buried this subplot in it and made it so essential to the movie that no

250
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:33.730
one could take it out.
And the studio of made it,

251
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:35.560
the producers at first didn't have any problem with it.

252
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:37.660
And then I'm a pimple cream.

253
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:40.270
Wanted to sponsor the movie and they saw it and they're like,
oh,

254
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:43.180
we can't have this abortion thing.
And Eleanor Bergstein was like,
oh,

255
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:44.930
what a shame.
Because the movie kind of hangs on it.

256
00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.740
You can't really work without it.
And they're like,
okay,
fine.

257
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.250
And in the end of the movie made so much money that obviously didn't matter that

258
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:55.230
it wasn't sponsored by Bimbo Green.
Um,
and the really sad thing is,
um,

259
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.480
recently some high,
we're producers went back to Eleanor and said,

260
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:02.410
we'd love to remake dirty dancing obviously,
and are they,
and she was like,
great.

261
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:06.490
And they said,
but we're going to take out the abortion thing.
And she said,

262
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.503
no way.

263
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.520
And what she did instead was she rewrote it for the stage and you guys might

264
00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:14.350
have seen this in the west end,
the dirty dancing musical,
which she did.

265
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:16.240
And she owned up the,
um,

266
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.810
the abortion subplot and emphasized about how the doctor really could have gone

267
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:23.770
to prison for helping a woman who'd had an illegal abortion and was dying on a

268
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:27.520
table from internal bleeding and really made it very central in the play.

269
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.480
I mean it's you,
you can't ignore it in the play.
And it in a way,
the movie,

270
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:33.400
you can almost overlook it in the plate.
We really can't.

271
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.370
And that movie has made almost a billion dollars around the world.
Um,

272
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.640
which just emphasizes how cowardly and wrong Hollywood movies are now.

273
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:45.310
I mean,
you try to think about a movie that depicts abortion now.
Okay.

274
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:49.150
So the obvious one would be Juno that was made came out about 10 years ago now

275
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.560
in which abortion is depicted unbelievably negatively.
Like so negatively,

276
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:55.120
even though this is a school girl,

277
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.530
I think it's like 15 in the movie who is not in a relationship that needs to do

278
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:03.580
something when she's pregnant and she goes to the abortion clinic,
it's dirty,

279
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:04.570
it's CD.

280
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:07.690
The woman at the reception desk is like kind of licking this lollipop in a

281
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:12.580
salacious way.
Um,
and in the end,
the character do know,
um,
is,
uh,

282
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.900
who's played by Ellen page,
of course,

283
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.930
is persuaded not to have an abortion because an abortion protest or tells her

284
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:19.480
outside,
you know,
your baby has fingernails.
Now,

285
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.540
there are a lot of reasons a woman could have choose not to have an abortion.

286
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.830
I mean I have two children myself,

287
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:27.040
so obviously there was a period of my life when I chose not to have an abortion.

288
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:28.840
I'm not saying everyone who's pregnant to have an abortion,

289
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.230
but you cannot have an abortion protestor.

290
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.520
Use a stupid argument like that and on screen show that as that's okay.

291
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.520
Like that's not,
that's not okay.
Um,

292
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.100
particularly since the movie was written by a self professed feminists,

293
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:46.570
Diablo Cody and stars one Ellen page.
And I find it really upsetting that.
No,

294
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:50.020
but I no point in this did they think this is not right to do this?

295
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.250
You interviewed Alan Page about

296
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.570
<v 2>that.</v>

297
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.860
<v 0>Did you also interview the,
the writer and sort of why?</v>

298
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.980
Why'd you chose to write it down?
But I did,
I,
I did interview her and I,

299
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:00.641
I said to her,

300
00:15:00.641 --> 00:15:04.120
I don't understand why you depicted abortion so negatively in this movie.

301
00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:05.980
You could have just had her say,
do you know what?

302
00:15:05.981 --> 00:15:08.440
I actually want to have this baby and give it to a couple who don't have a baby.

303
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:12.130
That's a perfectly reasonable reason not to have an abortion.
And she said to me,

304
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.370
any woman who doesn't think I'm not doing enough for feminism can kiss my butt.

305
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.350
And you're like,
that is not a response.
That is not a response.
Yeah,

306
00:15:20.351 --> 00:15:23.440
that's just not a response.
That's a stupid response.
Um,

307
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.920
and then knocked up was the other obvious one in which a woman gets pregnant on

308
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.270
one night stand,
she's 22.

309
00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:32.800
She's just got her dream job being a TV host and she rejects flat out not having

310
00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:35.500
a,
not having an abortion,
which is fine.
Maybe a lot,
you know,

311
00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:36.610
a lot of women would do that.

312
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.050
It seems unlikely in that circumstance that a woman in la who just got her dream

313
00:15:41.051 --> 00:15:42.820
job would reject having an abortion but fine.

314
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.430
And the only character who mentioned it to her is her mother.

315
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.910
And the mother is styled in the movie as basically horrendous.

316
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.760
And the mother says to her,
just get it taken care of.

317
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.040
And one day you'll have a real baby.
Now,

318
00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:57.490
obviously that's a terrible way to put it.
That's a terrible way.

319
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.510
And nobody who is pro choice as I am would say it like that,
just say,

320
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.360
because your choice,
it doesn't matter.
You know,
it's your life.

321
00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:06.280
Do you want to be looking after a baby or just say,

322
00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:08.260
do you want to have a baby right now?
You're 22.

323
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:11.110
You don't even know this guy's name.
Like,
seriously do you want have a baby?

324
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.500
And she goes,
yes I do.
Actually,
you know,
it feels important me.
Then you say,
fine.

325
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.200
Where you don't say is just,
just get rid of it.
It's disgusting.

326
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:20.190
It's not a real baby.
Anyway,
that's all the way people talk about abortion.

327
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.400
<v 2>So between junior we've got uh,</v>

328
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.960
a pro life campaigner who's giving bad reasons and then we have a pro choice

329
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.150
<v 0>person.
He came back,
he's getting above reasons.
We need a more mature,</v>

330
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.090
there's nation positive way and there's only been one movie.

331
00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:36.841
That's what he dealt with it,

332
00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:39.540
which was a small independent movie called obvious child,

333
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:43.320
which came out I think in 2016 starting very excellent Jenny slate.

334
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.210
And which is about a girl who gets pregnant.
Well not girls.

335
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.350
Twenties is a woman who gets pregnant after a one night stand,
but the thing is,

336
00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:54.351
the whole movie is about her decision whether or not to have an abortion and

337
00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:56.480
they then show her,
you know,
the camera's over,

338
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.370
she's on the garnish she size to and there's like tears rolling down her face,

339
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.560
anything,
you know?
Sure.
Some women really do feel this very strong way about it,

340
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:08.960
but for a lot of women now,
they don't.
They don't.
And for love,

341
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.270
I mean I had an abortion when I was 24 I'm very happy talking about it and it

342
00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:16.620
was just a relief and everybody in here will know somebody,

343
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:19.590
whether they know it or not,
who's had an abortion at this point.
It's not,

344
00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:22.440
it doesn't have to be depicted as the seismic thing in someone's life.

345
00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.660
It is just something that happens and you take and you deal with it.

346
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.150
Whereas in eighties movies,
yes.
Something like fame,

347
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.750
which everyone forgets had an abortion in it and which a girl in the school gets

348
00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:32.880
pregnant and she's white and he's black already.

349
00:17:32.881 --> 00:17:35.070
You cannot imagine this happening in a movie today.

350
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.520
And she just goes to the clinic.
It's done.
And then she goes back to the school.

351
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.920
Fast Times at Ridgemont high,
1980,

352
00:17:40.921 --> 00:17:44.580
I believe Amy Heckerling written by 18 old Cameron Crowe,
a 14 year old,

353
00:17:44.581 --> 00:17:46.050
played by Jennifer.
Jason Leigh gets pregnant.

354
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.150
She had to take him to the clinic by her older brother,

355
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:52.080
played by the much loved much miss judge Reinhold.
He picks her up afterwards,

356
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:53.220
they go home,
she goes back to school.

357
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:56.460
I mean that these are just making abortion part of life,

358
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.030
which is what it is now rather than making it either a big deal or a terrible

359
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:00.864
deal.

360
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.930
And do you think that it was acceptable to do that in the 80s because society

361
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:10.890
was different because people weren't paying attention to what was going on in

362
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:15.690
the films or just because Hollywood was bullet?
Um,
well two things.

363
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.180
I think people weren't paying as much attention.

364
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.170
I think also movies were able to be riskier.
Those movies that I mentioned,

365
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:25.080
fame fast and for is my dirty dancing.
We're all made fairly cheaply.

366
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:26.370
They were seen as mid range movies,

367
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.210
so they weren't required to make $1 billion back right away,

368
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.060
which is what movies now our movies are not marketed around the world.

369
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:35.010
It costs $1 billion tomorrow can move you around the world.

370
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.220
So every movie that comes out that gets a big release like that has to be

371
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:41.520
basically transformers or something that doesn't need a lot of translation that

372
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:43.230
isn't going to upset people in China,

373
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
which is a massive market now and isn't going to have set the Christian right in

374
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:50.160
America.
So things are much blander,
everything specific is taken out,

375
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:51.960
everything real is kind of taken out.

376
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:53.790
And that's why movies today feel very bleached.

377
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.780
And is that just Hollywood or is it the global film industry?

378
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.770
It's mainly Hollywood is mainly because it's mainly Hollywood movies that get to

379
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:03.090
go around the world.
I mean,
you know,

380
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:06.030
the French film industry doesn't spend $1 billion sitting with is around the

381
00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:07.710
world generally.
Um,

382
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.490
but also Hollywood underestimates things a lot of the times.

383
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:16.380
So Hollywood is now when in the 80s,
a movie made 80% of its money in America,

384
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:19.750
20% overseas,
and now that's flipped around.
Um,

385
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.920
and in some ways you could say that's good that Hollywood is aware that the rest

386
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:23.730
of the world exists,

387
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.760
but it does mean that they have these weird assumptions about what people in

388
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:31.050
China like to watch.
Um,
so they'll say,
well,
you know,
in China we can't have,

389
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.291
you know,

390
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:33.300
they're not gonna go see a movie with a female lead and they're not going to

391
00:19:33.301 --> 00:19:36.300
have a movie with a woman on the poster.
And there are loads of examples online.

392
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.310
You can look at it through a website called Google,
um,

393
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.120
of which movies that had female women,

394
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.570
a female women had had female actors are women on the posters in America and

395
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:48.970
Britain that have men on the poster in China.
You know,

396
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.990
they do this also with black and white actors.
So like 12 years a slave.

397
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:54.750
For example,
I had Brad Pitt on the poster when it went overseas.
I mean,

398
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.100
it's like there's a lot of that.

399
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.140
But actually if you look at the Chinese film industry,

400
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:01.380
a lot of their movies do have female leads.
They do take much riskier things.

401
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:04.170
It's just that America,
it's just like,
whoa,
we can't ignore the Chinese.

402
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:06.420
We have to be really careful with this.
So he's blood pump.

403
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.680
It'd be really interesting to know what happens with Black Panther because

404
00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:15.000
actually the last movie that made a lot of money overseas that had an all black

405
00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:18.300
cast was coming to America in 1989.
Uh,

406
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.860
it'd be amazing if Black Panther can kind of restart that again 30 years later.

407
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.360
I wasn't sure whether we should discuss this as two white people talking about

408
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:28.800
racism has never great look.

409
00:20:28.801 --> 00:20:33.801
But just briefly in the book you talk about Spike Lee and Eddie Murphy having

410
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.220
very different ways of empowering African Americans,

411
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.800
different ideologies about it almost.
Um,

412
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:48.170
whether you make films that are about black communities or

413
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.460
<v 2>you have black people in white communities like Eddie Murphy in several films.</v>

414
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.430
Maybe the only bucket to,
yeah.
Um,

415
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.410
and it struck me thinking and got through that argument how Hamilton has kind of

416
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:06.650
done something interesting to take a third position.
Yeah.
Right there.
Yeah.
Um,

417
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.480
do you think that's something that works to compromise on those two positions or

418
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:14.110
is it just,

419
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.340
it would either spike Lee or Eddie Murphy be happy with what's happened there?

420
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.300
Or do you think they still have an issue?

421
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.090
<v 0>I don't think Eddie Murphy's that happy about anything these days,</v>

422
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.600
which kind of breaks my heart because he really is my favorite of all the 80s

423
00:21:27.601 --> 00:21:32.280
actors.
Um,
but I think spike Lee would kind of love it.
Surely Hamilton.
I mean,

424
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.800
I hope most of you have seen Hamilton.
It is amazing as you watched it,

425
00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.960
when you first see it,
you're just like,
Whoa,
Thomas Jefferson is a black guy.

426
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:38.490
And then you're like,

427
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.280
he would literally don't even see it at like within five seconds.
It's amazing.

428
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.450
Um,

429
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.960
<v 2>I'd say it almost goes in reverse.
So,
um,
in fact,</v>

430
00:21:45.961 --> 00:21:49.320
I bought this copy of the book on my way to see Hamilton in December.

431
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.640
And then in February I went to Hamilton grange in New York.

432
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.940
And solve various pictures of Hamilton and Jefferson and all these people.
Well,

433
00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:58.460
they're white.

434
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.320
<v 0>Yeah,
they're all tight.
It was really all white.
Yeah,
that's true.</v>

435
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.780
That's true.
And he's suddenly think back on other plays and movies you've seen,

436
00:22:05.781 --> 00:22:09.110
you're like,
that's so weird.
Everyone was white in them.
Like that's the total,

437
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.990
right.
That's such a weird casting decision.
Anyway.
Anyway,
so you,

438
00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:16.280
so Eddie Murphy's whole thing was he was going to infiltrate the mainstream

439
00:22:16.281 --> 00:22:19.640
Hollywood industry in a way that no black actor had been able to before and

440
00:22:19.641 --> 00:22:22.790
Richard prior had been to self destructive to do so before,
uh,

441
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.360
and then make movies from within and kind of recreate the system from within,

442
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.150
which he successfully incredibly successfully did.
And you know,
it,

443
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.140
it's a testament to his talent that he did that because a black actor pharmacy

444
00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.710
needs to be like 10 times more talented than a white actor to get a role.

445
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.380
And he was a million times more talented than everyone and he was the most

446
00:22:39.381 --> 00:22:40.490
successful action of the decade.

447
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.580
Whereas Spike Lee was all about giving a voice to the black community and the

448
00:22:43.581 --> 00:22:43.981
black media.

449
00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:46.310
He was going through at the time was still making things like she's gotta have

450
00:22:46.311 --> 00:22:50.060
it and all those kind of movies.
And they were absolutely polar opposites.

451
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.170
And Eddie Murphy as the decade went on,
got increasingly attacked for this,

452
00:22:54.171 --> 00:22:56.570
about the black by the black community,
feeling like they,

453
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.090
that he'd abandoned them,
that he was making,
you know,

454
00:22:59.091 --> 00:23:01.100
Beverly Hills Cop and the golden child.

455
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.310
And when she's basically the only black guy in it and making movies for white

456
00:23:04.311 --> 00:23:06.410
audiences and not reflecting the black experience.

457
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.830
And he became more and more kind of embittered and kind of drew more and more

458
00:23:09.831 --> 00:23:13.490
into himself.
And then he may coming to America,

459
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.550
which is an incredible movie in that it has an entirely black cast and no white

460
00:23:18.741 --> 00:23:20.990
audiences seem to notice that in America.

461
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.240
And if anyone of you know anything about racial history in America,

462
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:27.880
that really is kind of a miracle.
Um,
and then after that he,
he started,

463
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.480
started doing more of that.
So like boomerang,

464
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.840
he did in the 90s in which he sort of gave,
you know,
launched Chris Rock,

465
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.010
but he became angrier.
I kind of sad or you know,

466
00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:40.030
anyone who has the kind of success that he did so quickly need,

467
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.330
it's going to screw up your brain.
Um,
and Spike Lee,
I mean,
he,

468
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:47.180
I think spike Lee is just incredible.
I mean,
you know,

469
00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:49.400
his movies from the eighties and nineties or some of my favorite,

470
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.390
but he found himself being painted into this tiny corner that he couldn't really

471
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:56.630
break out of.
But if you look at the early nineties,

472
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.190
there were so many amazing movies about African-american's particulate,

473
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.960
people like John Singleton and Boyz in the hood and stuff like that,
that,
uh,

474
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.610
you don't see any more today.

475
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.080
And I personally believe that it was the combination of Eddie Murphy and Spike

476
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.710
Lee together that kind of helped that era of the nineties nineties movies of

477
00:24:12.711 --> 00:24:13.640
African American cinema.

478
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.033
<v 2>Cool.
Once you</v>

479
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.630
take away from politics entirely for just briefly,

480
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.620
what are the things I love that you say is that the princess bride,

481
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.750
which was one of my favorite films ever,
uh,

482
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.650
works brilliantly because it is,

483
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.520
it is a fairy tale and it's a spoof of the fairytale,

484
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.960
much like into the woods.

485
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:41.830
That's fine for a fairy tale as a musical and an absolutely awesome musical.
Um,

486
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:47.570
various films have tried to do this and some succeed and some really don't.

487
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:52.460
So for me,
ones that succeed,
the frighteners is a great uh,

488
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:57.350
sort of horror film and Spoof Horror Film and starship troopers manages to work

489
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:58.910
in various different ways.

490
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.020
I remember I was at university when starship troopers came out and I was in the

491
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:06.710
fourth year and have various friends in the first year and titanic was out at

492
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:10.430
roughly the same flame and all of my first year friends said,
Oh,
I love titanic.

493
00:25:10.431 --> 00:25:11.960
It's so deep,
no pun intended,

494
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.320
but starship troopers is just mindless violence on all my fourth year friends

495
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:18.350
were going,
wow,
starship troopers is very,
very cutting.

496
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.210
Titanic is extremely dreary and it worked for me.

497
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:24.920
And then you've got films like scary movie,

498
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.960
which are very explicitly trying to be a spoof.

499
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.350
And again for me it doesn't work.

500
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.430
What do you think is the key to getting that?

501
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.670
<v 0>I feel that the filmmaker has to really love the genre.
I mean,</v>

502
00:25:36.671 --> 00:25:40.000
another one I would add into that that's quite like that is Mars attacks and I

503
00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:41.730
know people kind of have mixed feelings about Mars attacks.

504
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.930
I am a big Tim Burton Fan,
as you might've guessed at this point.

505
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.640
And I feel like you get that.

506
00:25:45.641 --> 00:25:49.030
He really loves that genre of that kind of Schlocky alien movie.

507
00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:50.590
Obviously like Edwood whole thing.

508
00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:53.500
Like he loves you to return from planet nine and he's kind of any is sending

509
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:55.180
that up but also doing it.
Um,

510
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.510
and with the princess bride William Goldman who wrote the original book,

511
00:25:58.511 --> 00:26:00.970
which I highly recommend if any of you haven't read it,
it's so amazing.

512
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.760
Obviously knew those books from meeting them to his daughters at night.

513
00:26:03.761 --> 00:26:05.800
I mean he said he wrote the princess bride because his daughters loved

514
00:26:05.801 --> 00:26:08.680
princesses and brides and they loved books about them and he'd just combined the

515
00:26:08.681 --> 00:26:09.310
two.

516
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:14.020
And he knows those stories and he also knows those kind of pretentious academic

517
00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:16.210
approaches to them,
which is what he makes fun of in the book.

518
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.270
A little bit like possession by ais by it as well.

519
00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:21.970
That kind of making fun of this kind of academic attitudes towards literature,

520
00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:25.030
which is what he does.
You have to love the genre.
You can't hate it.

521
00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:27.520
And I feel like the scary movies and the scary movie movies,

522
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.150
does that make sense?
Um,
they're just kind of,
there's sort of hating on it.

523
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:34.540
They're just making fun of it and you have to have love for it.
And I feel like,

524
00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:36.790
and I don't mean to keep mentioning this TV show with stranger things,

525
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:37.980
you feel the love,
right?

526
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.820
It's not just like making fun of eighties eighties hairstyles and eighties

527
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.700
music,
like normal homages to 80 stuff.
Just take the silly surface.

528
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:50.670
You have to have a deeper feeling.
And with princess bride,

529
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:53.070
you get the deeper feeling.
It's not just like,
oh,

530
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:56.090
princesses screaming in a tower and dragons,
you know,
it's like,

531
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.660
there is like deeper emotions going on.

532
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.190
<v 2>Fantastic.
Yes.
But to the politics,</v>

533
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.720
that's how I was thrilled.
Uh,
yeah.
I started reading the book thinking,
Hey,

534
00:27:05.721 --> 00:27:09.030
this is a book about movies.
I then thought,
hey,
it's another feminist book.

535
00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.090
I mean just finished a bunch of feminists or he taught me,
it's pretty fast.

536
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:19.240
It's another,
yeah,
you have the Magnolia test.
Before I go further,

537
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.720
Georgia described the magnolia tests.

538
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.850
<v 0>Gosh,
now,
you know,
you described them.
I really was actually,</v>

539
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.693
you'll to do it better than me.

540
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.750
<v 2>You owe us so long since I wrote the question,
but it's,</v>

541
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:32.280
it's about a strong women led a that depicts,

542
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.940
depicts women doing awesome things and tends to have,

543
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:38.610
and this is the bit that I want to talk about.
Um,

544
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.880
men who are really not much,

545
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:47.160
we'll say either they're explicitly despicable or they're just a bit useless.

546
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.380
Yes.
Um,

547
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:53.690
do you have any good examples for Allah isn't just men who want to be decent

548
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:55.500
human beings?
Oh,
for sure.
For sure.

549
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.450
A strong women led films that depict men not in a romantic role,

550
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.760
but being decent human.

551
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.910
<v 0>Um,
yeah,
so obviously the Magnolia tests is,
I was,</v>

552
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:07.980
I'm sure you've all guest named for Steel Magnolias,

553
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:11.370
which is my favorite women's movie of all time.
And any man who's like,
oh,

554
00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:13.800
I don't want to say we've got Lisbet old women.
You're so wrong.

555
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:16.250
It's like one of the funniest movies ever read one of these that I haven't seen

556
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.570
yet.
I mean,
no.
Again,
like dirty dancing.

557
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:22.290
No man has ever willingly electricity steel magnolias it was written by a man I

558
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:24.600
should add and is a true story about his sister.
But anyways,

559
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.770
that's a whole other issue.
Um,
my favorite movie that depicts platonic male,

560
00:28:28.771 --> 00:28:30.970
female friendship is say anything.
Um,

561
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.630
I'm amazed by how few people in this country,
I've seen it in America.

562
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:36.280
It's like such a major teen movie.
It's,
you know,

563
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.160
up there with dirty dancing or whatever or you know,
breakfast club,
um,

564
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.460
say anything is so great.
So it's how many,
many of you seen it?

565
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:46.590
Most of you probably have it.
Just a fee.
Oh my God.

566
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.230
All of you guys need to go home.
Not just guys like guys,
girls,

567
00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:51.990
everybody just go and watch it right now.
I excuse you from what?
For the deck.

568
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.460
It's about John Cusack

569
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.240
<v 2>in his dorm crew sock as well.</v>

570
00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.060
<v 0>No,
no.
Oh my God.
Oh my God,
it's junk.
He's at his most junk cues.
Okay.</v>

571
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.660
It's his ultimate role.
Like,
forget about gross point blank and grifters,

572
00:29:04.661 --> 00:29:07.600
it's like the ultimate cues that girl who's in love with the,

573
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.960
he's like the sort of weird kid in high school whereas it trench coat and stuff.

574
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.250
Um,
and he's in love with Ione Skye,
who's like the class princess who's right,

575
00:29:15.251 --> 00:29:18.670
beautiful at her father is played by John Mahoney,

576
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.740
the recently deceased father of Frazier.

577
00:29:20.741 --> 00:29:23.990
As y'all probably better know him as who is wonderful in it.
Maybe.

578
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.190
So it's about donkeys I trying to get with Ione Skye,

579
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:31.360
but in the background he's got his two best female friends called DCN Corey,

580
00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.600
one of whom is played by the immense Lili Taylor who is amazing.

581
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.650
And you're watching this movie and the opening scene is them talking and like

582
00:29:38.651 --> 00:29:42.760
the three of them obviously have an incredibly close,
they're very similar.

583
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.680
They totally get each other,
get each other's music.

584
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:46.600
They like go shopping for guitars together and everything.

585
00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.970
And what has we mean thinking if you know,

586
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.590
surely he's just going to get with one of them.

587
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:53.260
In the end he's going to forget about this princess,
but no,
no.

588
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:57.700
Like they just want him to be happy and he just loves hanging out with them

589
00:29:57.701 --> 00:30:00.130
because as the movie shows,
his male friends at school,

590
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:04.580
one of whom is played by Jeremy Piven,
um,
are just total idiots.
Um,

591
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.120
play by Jeremy Pivot,
let's just reiterate that,
uh,

592
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.300
who are just total jerks and he gets his most fun with his female friends and

593
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.710
it's a wonderful depiction of male,
female friendship.

594
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:17.140
And I went to a coed school for sixth form and I was like,
yeah,

595
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:18.280
that is what it was like.

596
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.290
Not all men and women who get on then have to sleep together.
Right.

597
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.990
That's a very nice message to get from a movie.

598
00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.080
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

599
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:29.090
And it's sort of almost the UNCW message of when Harry met Sally.
I know,
I know.

600
00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.450
Although I do feel like,
I mean they did not ready,
but it is true.

601
00:30:32.451 --> 00:30:36.230
It is the antiemetic of that.
But there is also the cross friendships there,

602
00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.600
you know,
with Bruno Kirby and Carrie,
Carrie Fisher,

603
00:30:38.601 --> 00:30:40.940
like they are all hanging out and they're not all sleeping with each other.

604
00:30:40.941 --> 00:30:45.100
It's like some mass orgy.
Anything that has Carrie Fisher just gets my version.

605
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.680
Exactly.
Exactly again.
Oh yeah.

606
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.570
Okay.
It feels like I have no idea what the time is,

607
00:30:53.571 --> 00:30:57.870
but it feels like we've been chatting away.
Sorry,
I talked so much.
Very quiet.

608
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.940
Extremely Needy for me.

609
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:07.220
Other people may have questions and I'll just interject more.
Yeah.

610
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.870
<v 0>Uh,
first I wanted to add the comment.
You said that one day TV,
Charlottesville,</v>

611
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.620
Bertrand and cinema,
uh,
they are shown in the cinema,
for example,

612
00:31:16.621 --> 00:31:18.490
game of Thrones wash on the same amount,

613
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.480
but of course like it must be a spectacle,

614
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.380
but about politics and all that stuff.

615
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.570
What is your,
how to say,
how do you,

616
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:35.870
what do you think about forcing diversity in cinema?

617
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:36.550
What,

618
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:41.550
what do you think about scandal in Academy Awards about not enough black actors

619
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.160
and all that?
What do you think about it?
Say,
what did you say?
I mean,

620
00:31:47.161 --> 00:31:49.770
I write about it quite a lot because until the guardian stopped,

621
00:31:49.771 --> 00:31:52.170
being able to send me to La for the Oscars is very sad.

622
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.080
I used to go to the Oscars every year.
It's right about it.
And of course it's,

623
00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:57.320
you know,
I think it's good for it to be drawn to attention.

624
00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:58.980
It's not like I think there should be quotas,

625
00:31:58.981 --> 00:32:03.840
but I do feel like the academy should be shamed into the fact that,
you know,

626
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.880
are so few black winners of Academy Awards.
It's is amazing.

627
00:32:08.881 --> 00:32:13.350
So few women directors have been nominated or won awards.
It's,
it's,

628
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:17.100
it's mortifying.
Um,
and this should be done to center.
And the problem is,

629
00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:20.220
is that the academy is very largely old white men.
You know,

630
00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:23.460
there are many statistics about it and they just see themselves,
you know,

631
00:32:23.461 --> 00:32:26.300
they look for themselves.
Okay.
But,
uh,

632
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:31.450
what about just the last black actors in other say work in?

633
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.330
No,
there's no,
but I mean,
it's never going to be 50,
50,

634
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.910
but there's obviously it should be more,
I mean,

635
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:41.630
there've been there plenty of incidences of African American actors just being

636
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:45.860
completely overlooked.
I mean,
Eddie Murphy,
how was Eddie Murphy not won an Oscar?

637
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.071
I mean,

638
00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:50.540
he clearly should have won an Oscar at this point and we'll just have this,

639
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:55.140
the same thing about Dick Opera until about about Djakapurra.
Yeah.
Well.

640
00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.800
Well,
he did witness Oscar though.
I mean,
he got there.
Um,
and I,
I mean,
I'm sorry.

641
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:01.634
I mean,
I,
I,

642
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.450
I genuinely believe Eddie Murphy is like one of the greatest actors around.

643
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:07.400
I mean,
he got nominated for dream girls.

644
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:11.210
I personally would have nominated him for Bowfinger,
which he is incredible.

645
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:13.970
And it,
all of you need to see that too.
Some eighties moving to nineties movie.

646
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:15.290
Him and Steve Martin,
I mean,

647
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:20.150
Eddie Murphy's performance in that is just like astonishing.
Um,
and as he said,

648
00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:23.900
I mean,
if you could Google Eddie Murphy,
you can Google Eddie Murphy.

649
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:27.260
I'm speech at the Academy Awards.
It's so hard not to do that.
Um,

650
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.990
in which he talked about this and the ade saying,
well,

651
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:33.350
you guys gave an award to a black actor last year.
I can't remember who it was.

652
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:36.560
Maybe Denzel Washington,
so you don't need to do it for another 30 years.
Right.

653
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.130
And it's like,
yeah,
that is literally how it works.
That is looking out,

654
00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.010
you know how white,
you know Greta Gerwig,
why is she not overlooked,
you know,

655
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:45.290
for best director,
you know,
it's stuff like that.

656
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:50.060
You just think this is ridiculous that it's these old white male movies that win

657
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:50.894
all the time.

658
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.863
<v 3>Okay.</v>

659
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.300
<v 2>Hi.
Um,</v>

660
00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:01.220
do you think Netflix and Amazon getting into film production is going to cut,

661
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:04.520
revive this kind of a tradition of being a bit edgier?

662
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.740
<v 0>No question.
I hope so.</v>

663
00:34:06.741 --> 00:34:09.530
I mean the film festivals are really freaked out by it as far as I can tell.

664
00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:13.190
A lot of them refuse to show Netflix and Amazon prime productions,

665
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.150
which is just ridiculous.
You can't fight against what is happening.

666
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.730
I don't know how Netflix and Amazon prime,
I have so much money.

667
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:22.250
Probably you guys in this room can enlighten me on that.

668
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.830
But they are making really amazing stuff now.

669
00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:26.960
I mean the conversation I hear with my friends,
but it used to be like,

670
00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:27.794
what are you going to go?

671
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.900
Are you going to see like in the cinema this weekend it's now,

672
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.490
have you seen that new Netflix documentary?

673
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:34.100
I mean that is how people talk to each other.
That's how,
you know,

674
00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:35.180
I've got two very young children,

675
00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:39.080
so I met home most evenings and my boyfriend and I all we do know is what stuff

676
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:42.890
on Netflix and Amazon prime and stuff that they've made original content.

677
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.650
We're currently watching the defiant ones,
which is amazing,

678
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:47.600
which is the documentary about Jimmy I,
I,
and adopted.
Right.

679
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.470
I should have been keeping a list,
you know,
this is the stuff we watch now.

680
00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:55.040
It's not,
it's not going to the multiplex on Friday night anymore.

681
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.270
Some world has changed.

682
00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:00.350
<v 2>But one interesting thing,
uh,
to come back to films,
uh,</v>

683
00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:05.580
I was thinking about films that I have found,
not necessarily edgy,
but,

684
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.300
uh,
have at least promoted more diverse,
well view,
um,

685
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.400
and engaging young people politically,

686
00:35:14.401 --> 00:35:18.350
I think tend to be around either superhero or superior.

687
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.650
Like if you think that even if you didn't elect sort of the remake of

688
00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:26.130
Ghostbusters,
you can think it's kind of super hero ish.
Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.

689
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.510
By the time we've got wonder woman and Black Panther.

690
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.320
And at the same time,
young people,
certainly in America,

691
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.390
I think over in the UK as well too.

692
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.200
To slightly lesser extent appeared to be more politically aware.

693
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.050
<v 0>Yes,
no question.
Is there a correlation,
causation?
And it may be,</v>

694
00:35:45.051 --> 00:35:45.291
I mean,

695
00:35:45.291 --> 00:35:48.410
it's certainly true that superhero movies have been good at smuggling in good

696
00:35:48.411 --> 00:35:51.230
roles for women and ethnic minorities.
They have,

697
00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:53.180
there have been good at that and you know,
and Ghostbusters,

698
00:35:53.181 --> 00:35:57.770
one of the specific things was to,
you know,
improve the representation of,

699
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.980
you know,
this is a terrible way of putting it.
The black ghostbuster.
I mean,

700
00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:03.020
one of the big faults with the original Ghostbusters,

701
00:36:03.021 --> 00:36:05.210
how Ernie Hudson is so sidelined in it,

702
00:36:05.211 --> 00:36:09.620
like for no reason either have a minute or don't.
Um,
and in,
uh,

703
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.230
oh Leslie,
um,
what is her name?
Who plays her?
And uh,
the new Ghostbusters,

704
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.460
I forgot my mind's just gone blank.
Can someone Google it for me anyway,

705
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.790
but she has a real role in it and she's in it,

706
00:36:19.791 --> 00:36:24.590
the whole movie and she's not pushed out.
Um,
and that is great.
That was great.

707
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.150
And definitely young people.
I don't know if young,

708
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.580
I don't know if it's because of superhero movies that young people are more in

709
00:36:28.581 --> 00:36:28.970
line.

710
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.300
I think young people always need to go further than the generation before and

711
00:36:32.301 --> 00:36:34.310
young people are going further in this than we did.

712
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.900
<v 2>Right.
Another thing I find interesting about para fins,
Z,</v>

713
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.930
you talked about Batman,
uh,
as sort of,

714
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:46.040
even though it was kind of dark in a way,
it had huge light moments.

715
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.770
Tim Burton or that's in Boston one.
Yep.
Um,
so yeah,

716
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.510
big gothic feeling,
but still hugely funny bits.
Yeah.

717
00:36:55.310 --> 00:37:00.130
And when you wrote the book was before I think before Deadpool.

718
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.350
Yes.
It was definitely before Thor.
Ragnarok yeah,
that's right.
Um,

719
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.900
do you feel that things are taking an upswing?

720
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.250
<v 0>I think so.
And it's weird,</v>

721
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.410
like I've seen actors like Chris Pratt or whoever get more in these kind of

722
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:13.410
roles and they are funny.
Yep.
Rather than,
you know,
tortured,
you know,

723
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:17.400
Christian Bale and tortured Tom Hardy with a mask on his face.
I mean,
I don't,

724
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.650
I honestly like do you guys are like those movies,
I didn't laugh at them,

725
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.770
whereas we recently rewatched right.
Drug addicts.
It's very funny.

726
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.740
It's very funny.
No,
it's true.
I mean,
I loved,
um,
the,
the moderate,

727
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.600
the Christian Bale Batman with the joker.
I mean,

728
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:36.450
that is a great role obviously with heath ledger as the joker,

729
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.180
but it's not fun watch.
I mean,

730
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:42.630
it's quite heavy weather really watching it and everything's so dark.
I mean,

731
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:46.230
not just like,
like mood.
I mean the lighting,
you can't fucking say anything.

732
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.120
Whereas you watch Tim Burton,
I mean,
it's so much fun.
And you know,
watching,

733
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.590
watching Jack Nicholson do his little dance down the steps towards Kim
Bassinger,

734
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.950
he's playing prince on his boombox.
So much fun.

735
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:00.810
And it looks like a cartoon.

736
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:03.480
It doesn't look like it's taking yourself so damn seriously.

737
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.480
And it doesn't have the constant car chases.

738
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.810
Like you have the Christian bail bond and the Christian Bale Batman's,

739
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.310
I don't mean to keep knocking them.
Obviously.

740
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:13.440
They're beautiful and they're kind of done in this amazing way.

741
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:15.450
Christopher Nolan is obviously an incredible filmmaker,

742
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.540
but there's just too much.
There's,
there's just too much.

743
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:21.450
I feel there's too many characters,
too many people being tortured,

744
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.110
emotionally tortured.
You know,
you have Gary Oldman,
you're Christian Bale,

745
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.320
whoever the villain is,
you have this and the that and fuck.

746
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.690
<v 2>Yeah.
By the time you get to Datto Rises,
oh my God,
it's so,</v>

747
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:33.950
it's still a lot for a very long,

748
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.010
<v 0>it's so long.
And a vendor is that just too</v>

749
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.350
<v 4>much?
They like pack in so much in these movies.</v>

750
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.750
Whereas I feel like with Tim Burton's Batman,

751
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:45.340
you have just nice clean Michael Keaton a bit unhappy in a castle.
Some villain.

752
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.710
Yeah.

753
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:52.710
Oh there's an angst amongst in a quite interesting self mocking way like you

754
00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:56.120
know,
kind of,
he knows he's this pathetic rich boy.
Like feel sorry for me.

755
00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:00.190
Rich boy hours.
Christian Bale is just kind of like miserable and you're like,

756
00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:01.660
this is great.
Night out.

757
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:07.510
Do we have any other questions?
So it can be slightly to self indulgent.

758
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.410
And I used to work in children's publishing and they went once to a marvel

759
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:18.430
showcase.
And I was really excited because I'm a big marvel fan.
And,
um,

760
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:22.420
I remember being incredibly disappointed because they had this huge cinema

761
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:22.901
screen in there,

762
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:25.960
were showing all their new films and then it came up in massive letters.

763
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.090
Everything we do is to,

764
00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:31.390
and I was just really excited for it and it said to sell more product.

765
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.580
And I remember

766
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.413
<v 0>what,</v>

767
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.290
<v 4>yeah,
what's happening to cinema today,</v>

768
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.320
that they want to basically make everything so PG 12 so they can appeal to as

769
00:39:41.691 --> 00:39:42.830
many people as possible.

770
00:39:42.831 --> 00:39:46.250
And that's why I think films like that man don't work anymore because they're,

771
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.460
they're darker and they're older and everything feels like a little bit safer.

772
00:39:49.461 --> 00:39:50.960
And we don't have many eating's anymore.

773
00:39:50.961 --> 00:39:52.260
I remember when I used to go to the cinema,

774
00:39:52.261 --> 00:39:55.460
I used to sneak into eighteens all the time and it's no like there's no

775
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:57.900
eighteens,
everything's really dry.
Um,

776
00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.590
and everything's trying to sort of sell more product and merchandise.

777
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.390
And I wondered if you shared that.

778
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.210
<v 0>I mean definitely everything's trying to sell merchandise,
but I,
you know,</v>

779
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:07.110
you have to kind of blame eighties movies for that.

780
00:40:07.111 --> 00:40:09.000
I mean it was the eighties movies that really got onto that.

781
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.540
Obviously star wars in the 70s and then Batman in the 80s and Ghostbusters.

782
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:16.140
But I don't feel like they were just made for that.

783
00:40:16.141 --> 00:40:17.940
They weren't seen as vehicles for that.

784
00:40:17.941 --> 00:40:20.490
It was the merchandise came off the greatness of the movies.

785
00:40:20.491 --> 00:40:24.180
And actually the merchant does kind of took those movies by surprise.
I feel.
Um,

786
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:29.250
whereas now the movie is almost a side show to everything around it.
You know,

787
00:40:29.251 --> 00:40:33.150
there's just not as much effort put into scripts anymore is for me the real

788
00:40:33.151 --> 00:40:35.430
problem between movies today and movies from the 80s.

789
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:40.350
And that's because so much of a movies takings comes from overseas that they

790
00:40:40.351 --> 00:40:43.200
don't want to have movies,
they have complicated scripts that need,
um,

791
00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:46.980
a lot of translation where things have cultural references that won't translate

792
00:40:46.981 --> 00:40:50.640
overseas.
Um,
which is why it's movies now.
Like,
for example,

793
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.560
the Christopher Nolan Batman are so full of car chases and shootouts and special

794
00:40:55.561 --> 00:40:58.170
effects.
Cause obviously you don't need to translate those.
I mean,

795
00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.570
whereas you have something like,
uh,
you know,

796
00:41:00.571 --> 00:41:04.140
going back to Tim Burton's Batman is there's a lot of dialogue going on in those

797
00:41:04.141 --> 00:41:08.250
movies,
whether it's like in the newspaper office or whether,
you know,
it's,
uh,

798
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.230
Bruce talking,
you know,

799
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.420
having the long conversations with his Butler and these kind of weird parties

800
00:41:12.421 --> 00:41:12.960
that he had.

801
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:17.010
There's like emotional stuff that needs translating and it's just too much of a

802
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:21.650
faff and like,
why bother,
you know,
big CGI effects,
um,

803
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.840
work well anywhere.
Although I personally find them incredibly tedious.

804
00:41:24.841 --> 00:41:28.410
One of the things I love about go especially is how charming the special effects

805
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:32.970
are there.
So shonky,
uh,
and now when you see,
when I see special effects in a,

806
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.800
I went to see the re the modern jungle book,
I'm watching the actors thinking,

807
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.810
I know you're just standing against a blue screen.

808
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.060
Like that's all that's happening here.

809
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:45.500
You feel no real connection between what's going on the actor and the special

810
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:49.160
effects.
I don't think,
um,
and I think that's something that's been lost,

811
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:50.750
but that's what translates overseas.

812
00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:59.140
<v 5>I have a question.
Do you also have lessons that we shouldn't have learned from?</v>

813
00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.820
My goodness,
of course.

814
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.460
<v 0>So obviously eighties movies for all I'm talking about Eddie Murphy,
et Cetera,</v>

815
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:07.040
et cetera.
We're completely,
totally racist,

816
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.890
which is why it's amazing that Eddie Murphy was such a success,

817
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:12.510
which is why another reason why everyone should just,
you know,

818
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.430
worship his talent.
Um,
if you look at,
I mean,
let's see,

819
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:18.890
is the worst eighties racist movies.
I mean,
where to even begin.

820
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:21.410
Obviously there are 16 candles,
which is John Hughes,

821
00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:24.680
his first film with Molly Ringwald who's upset because her parents have

822
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:28.340
forgotten her 16th birthday.
What an innocent sweet movie you might think.
Ah,

823
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:33.020
but let me tell you about their random Asian exchange student called Long Duck

824
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.380
Dong,

825
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.040
who just wants to have sex with a white girl and does things like fall out of

826
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:39.090
trees at inopportune moments.
Um,

827
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.200
there's also this unbelievably weird bit in 16 candles where the boy who,

828
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:47.810
um,
who my room was in love with,
um,

829
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:52.070
is talking about how his girlfriend has passed out at a party and he could have

830
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:55.910
quote unquote had her five times without her noticing and then tells the school

831
00:42:55.911 --> 00:42:59.910
nerd he's played by Anthony Michael Hall.
Um,

832
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.880
why don't you just got in the car and have sex with her?

833
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.750
And it doesn't say in those words because why don't you go upstairs?
And he does.

834
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.500
And then the girl wakes up next to this Dorky guy and she's like,
did,

835
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.890
did we have sex?
And he goes,
uh Huh.
And she's like,
oh,
hi.

836
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.530
Like it's the most weird thing in the world.

837
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.990
And eighties movies are full of that kind of stuff.
I mean,

838
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.590
those kind of movies don't get it.
They haven't lasted so well.

839
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:25.670
Things like Porky's risky business is something that everyone remembers very

840
00:43:25.671 --> 00:43:28.670
fondly as like this movie in which Tom Cruise dancing in his underpants.

841
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.020
But actually if you watch it,

842
00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:35.021
it's a movie about how a boy who turns becomes a pimp and that becomes a pimp.

843
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:36.830
And then gets into Princeton because of it.

844
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:40.250
Cause a Princeton guy comes to his house to meet Tom Cruise,

845
00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:44.360
who is now fully a pimp and probably sleeps with the hookers that he keeps in

846
00:43:44.361 --> 00:43:45.860
his house and then get them into Princeton.

847
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.580
It's the weirdest movie you'll ever see in your life.
I swear to God.
Um,

848
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.220
so there's all that obviously.
And also,
you know,

849
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:55.340
racism against black people is so obvious in eighties movies.
I mean,

850
00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.090
Eddie Murphy,
his first film is 48 hours,
uh,
in which he's opposite McNulty.

851
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.860
And Eddie Murphy plays this Khan who's led out of prison to help grizzled carp.

852
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:06.680
Nick naulty find criminal ring,
if I remember this correctly.

853
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.000
And I was actually supposed to,
Richard Pryor,
who is in the moon,

854
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.030
who is supposed to be in the movie,
but he was too much of a disastrous,

855
00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:16.940
they cast Eddie instead.
Now McNulty is playing the traditional grizzled cup.
Um,

856
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:19.630
you know,
a bit alcoholic has woman problems are,

857
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.690
and as part of his term in grizzled nest,
he is incredibly racist.

858
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.350
And he calls,
um,
Eddie Murphy,
things like watermelon.

859
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.620
But if you a spear chucker like unbelievably racist terms.

860
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.890
And at no point is this seen as like,
oh,
maybe we shouldn't like this guy.

861
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.590
It's seen as part of his charming on reformed,

862
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:41.790
grizzled Innes and Eddie Murphy was asked about this in a couple of interviews,

863
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:45.750
like,
what is this not a bit weird for you to be doing?
And he's like,
well,

864
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:48.900
you know,
because my character is kind of equal with him,

865
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:51.660
it's like it makes it okay and you're like,
no,
it makes it okay.

866
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:54.810
Is that Eddie Murphy is such a charismatic actor that it doesn't,

867
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.100
he doesn't feel totally subjugated by it.
He's able to,
like,

868
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.190
he's out acts and McNulty and steals all the scenes,
but when you watch it,

869
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:02.700
you're like,

870
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.450
this is disgusting and why am I supposed to be cheering on this grizzle racist

871
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:11.340
cop who being totally racist?
Um,
so there's obviously tons of that.

872
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:15.840
Um,
and also when you look at Eddie Murphy's movies,
I mean,
I don't,

873
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:19.770
I'm sorry to be going on about Murphy.
It does happen.
Um,
he was,

874
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.280
he was not allowed to do very much within them,
really.
He was,
I mean,

875
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:25.800
even when he was making them.
So you look at Beverly Hills cop for example,

876
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:29.400
which was a movie that was written for a white actor in incredibly,

877
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:32.470
it was supposed to be Mickey Rourke who was in it and then it was,

878
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.750
was to be Sylvester Stallone and then to Don Simpson.

879
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.310
And um,
uh,
Jerry Bruckheimer is enormous credit who,
who are producers.

880
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.140
They did something that never been done before,

881
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:46.260
which is they decided to cast a black actor in a white characters role.

882
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.260
And the cast Eddie,
yeah.
When you're watching this,

883
00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:52.530
it's very notable that Eddie Murphy is not allowed to have sex really at any

884
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:53.370
point in this might be there.

885
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.750
He has this white female friend in Beverly Hills who works in the art gallery.

886
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.710
I'm sure all of you have seen Beverly hills cop.

887
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.220
You know the girl who works in the art gallery with it.
She's got that,
you know,

888
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:03.810
assisting with the funny accent.
Uh,

889
00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:07.800
Bronson Pinchot and there are lots of seeds where this girl was like sprawling

890
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:10.440
on his bed in the hotel room.
They're like hanging out in hotel rooms.

891
00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:15.300
They're like old friends and clearly in the original script they were getting it

892
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:18.300
on.
But no way is this happening in the movie.

893
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:22.050
No way do you see Eddie Murphy ever kissing a white woman and these movies?
Um,

894
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.220
I see it.
You can sense the restrictions that were on black actors.
Definitely.

895
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.100
And this is Eddie Murphy who is the most powerful actor in the 80s.

896
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.650
So stuff like that.
And of course the Ernie Hudson thing.

897
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.200
And Ghostbusters is totally weird and unacceptable.

898
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:37.110
And I say that as someone who loves Ghostbusters is almost more than life
itself.

899
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:41.460
Yeah.
Various films with,
uh,
with my kids.

900
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:46.170
So we have kids who are 14,
11,
11.
This is a great film.

901
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:46.890
Ignore that.

902
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:51.360
They enjoy that bit to know that unfortunately they ignore that.

903
00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:55.560
Really unfortunate.
It's funny,
John Hughes made quite a few weird,

904
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:59.010
they racist movies in his kind of slapstick thing cause he,

905
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.060
he came from a real sort of slapstick,
uh,
sort of tradition.

906
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:07.370
So his movies like the National Lampoon vacation movies,
which he wrote,
um,

907
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.410
are so bizarrely racist.
So there's this one scene,

908
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:14.240
I think it is in the first one,
national lampoon vacation.
Chevy Chase,
um,

909
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:18.390
is driving his kids to the inner city,
which I mean,
you know,

910
00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:20.460
he lives in the suburbs starting to get to the inner city,

911
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:24.360
which obviously means a street full of black people and their car stops at a

912
00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:25.980
light.
I think at this point.

913
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.280
And loads of black people just swarm in and start stealing their hubcaps.

914
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.520
And in all of Hughes's movies,
I love Hughes.

915
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:37.090
Ferris Bueller is lifting my favorite movie of all time that the representatives

916
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:40.290
of black people is makes you just kind of want to throw up on your shoes.
Um,

917
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.400
like weird science for example.
I've done,

918
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:45.580
how many of you have seen weird science that also a terrible movie and lots of

919
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:46.120
ways.

920
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.060
I mean that's kind of the only other time you see black people in a John Hughes

921
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:50.140
movie.
I'm trying to think of any others.

922
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.460
And it's when Anthony Michael Hall goes to a jazz club and their loads of like

923
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.380
jazz black people or being kind of creepy and jazz and like that's it.

924
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:02.920
So in John Hughes is world black people or they're stealing your hubcaps or

925
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:06.460
basically smoking reefer and being a bit creepy.
Um,

926
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:10.300
so yeah,
lots of bad stuff,
but also lots of good.

927
00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.320
Katie,
you mentioned you have a couple of young children.

928
00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:20.730
Have you given much thought to what their introduction to [inaudible]?

929
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.980
It's all I think about,
it's really tied to like,
so um,
I have two year old twins.

930
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:26.581
Um,

931
00:48:26.581 --> 00:48:30.150
so they don't really have attention span for anything beyond a two minute Peppa

932
00:48:30.151 --> 00:48:33.030
pig video at the moment.
But,
so they're twin boys as well,

933
00:48:33.031 --> 00:48:35.670
which is obviously slightly different from me.
Although I,
you know,

934
00:48:35.671 --> 00:48:37.620
I very much think that boys and girls just watch the same movies.

935
00:48:37.621 --> 00:48:38.640
There shouldn't be these kind of limits,

936
00:48:38.641 --> 00:48:41.970
but I do get that certain things grab boys' attention quicker than maybe grab

937
00:48:41.971 --> 00:48:43.590
girls' attention.
So for the,

938
00:48:43.591 --> 00:48:48.000
my first movie from that year that I saw was I believe Ferris Bueller's day off,

939
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.980
whereas I already know my boyfriend stuff like the first movie 80s movie they're

940
00:48:51.981 --> 00:48:54.930
probably go see is going to be like back to the future or Indiana Jones.

941
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.650
Like those kinds of more actiony things.
Whereas I got,

942
00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.220
I got to this little bit late and obviously I loved them.

943
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:01.350
There was no difference.
There shouldn't be a,

944
00:49:01.351 --> 00:49:03.390
definitely both boys and girls watch.
Let me just stress that.

945
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:07.920
But I do think they'll probably enjoy back to the future earlier than they might

946
00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:09.630
enjoy.
Ferris Bueller and the breakfast club.

947
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:13.630
So important question about introducing kids to films,
Star Wars.

948
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:15.280
Do you start with a pursuit for,

949
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:18.430
or do you start with at a certain point it gets so confused with the episode

950
00:49:18.431 --> 00:49:19.720
numbers at this point?
It's kind of,

951
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.510
I think you've got to start with episode four,
right?
I mean,

952
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.930
actually my first star wars was return of the Jedi.

953
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.670
I think that might've been the first movie.
I saw it in a cinema.

954
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:32.530
It was return of the Jedi tricks and really funny and I loved it because I love

955
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:33.730
the eworks obviously.

956
00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:36.960
So I was well down with that and they changed the music for the rerelease.

957
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:42.380
Very weird.
Um,
but yeah,
so I,

958
00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:45.030
I make plus all the time about eighties movies,
I'm going to,

959
00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:48.540
I've already got like a stockpile of DVDs of what the kids are gonna Watch.
Um,

960
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:53.820
so yeah,
so back to the future,
Indiana Jones very much so.
Um,
Ferris Bueller,

961
00:49:53.821 --> 00:49:57.990
which I believe they will truly love at some point and so on and so forth like

962
00:49:57.991 --> 00:49:59.700
that Iti,

963
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:03.240
obviously 18 might be the first one even though I think my,

964
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:06.860
my kids got a bit bored by eating,
but love Ferris Bueller love.
But you know,

965
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.670
I was scared by ut and when I saw,

966
00:50:08.671 --> 00:50:12.420
I think I saw when I was at seven and I just thought it was disgusting and I was

967
00:50:12.421 --> 00:50:17.250
like,
why is this weird kind of tree trunk living in this little girl's closet?

968
00:50:17.251 --> 00:50:21.990
It's horrible.
So
I know,
I know.

969
00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:27.950
Can we talk about Ferris Bueller a bit more please?
So you talked about how uh,

970
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.140
<v 2>it's an interesting depiction for one thing.</v>

971
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:32.300
I love your take on it as a sort of fantasy,

972
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:34.730
which suddenly explains things and it's one of those,
yeah,

973
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:39.620
why didn't I think of that?
But it talks a lot about class.
Yes.

974
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:44.540
And I find the whole class and wealth divides in films interesting.

975
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:48.110
Particularly because it seems to be an international differences as well.

976
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.410
And I see it almost more in soap operas actually.

977
00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:55.170
So in the u s there's Dallas and dentistry and Australia,

978
00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.110
there are sort of middle class home and away neighbors.

979
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.590
<v 0>Well I could run in them and hope it away.</v>

980
00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.410
I remember when I moved here it was like they ran a trailer park.

981
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.100
Like I can't remember what their names were at home in a way,

982
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.410
but they literally ran for overlay here eastenders

983
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.020
<v 2>well,
exactly.
So there's no difference in middle class.</v>

984
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.200
Upper middle class in Australia is Australia.

985
00:51:12.201 --> 00:51:14.180
And then we have east enders and Coronation Street.

986
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.590
And if you look at a lots of the UK film industry output,

987
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.580
things like bras off billions up,
it tends to be more working class.
Um,

988
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.200
and we'll focus on the class divide more.
Yeah.

989
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.110
So I find it interesting how Ferris Bueller's day off focuses on the class

990
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:34.020
divide between sort of upper middle class and really,
really rich A.
Yeah,

991
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:40.430
I'm sort of feels like wealth as a sort of proxy for structure versus agency.

992
00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:42.953
Yes.

993
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:48.040
Which I only found out or learned about as terms reading girls will be girls by

994
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:52.280
Emory tool.
So very good.
Awesome.
Awesome book.
Go read.

995
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.950
What films should have watched to talk about structure versus agency?

996
00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.570
<v 0>I mean the most to me,</v>

997
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:03.650
the most obvious film about class is actually cited earlier.
John Hughes film,

998
00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:05.090
which is pretty in pink.
Um,

999
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:09.550
which is very much about working class kids versus the rich kids.
Um,

1000
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:12.530
Don Hughes himself was lower middle class and he grew up in an upper middle

1001
00:52:12.531 --> 00:52:14.450
class neighborhood in the suburbs of Illinois.

1002
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:17.210
So he was always very self conscious about class differences.

1003
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.320
And in his movie the rich kids are always kind of evil and the poor kids are

1004
00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:25.370
noble.
Um,
but the rich kids get everything and the poor kids have to struggle.

1005
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.950
Um,
and what he made,
Ferris Bueller,

1006
00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:31.340
he kind of recreated that but made ma so pretty in pink.

1007
00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:35.120
There's a character ducky played by Jon Cryer who is very working class,

1008
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.050
sleeps on apparently a mattress on the floor and,

1009
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.470
and seems to not have any parents.
Um,

1010
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.620
and he is up against the horrible rich kids in school,

1011
00:52:42.621 --> 00:52:45.830
played by James spader ultimate crush.
Um,

1012
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:50.120
who's this kind of awful drugs taking up noxious guy called Steph for some

1013
00:52:50.121 --> 00:52:53.330
reason.
Oh characters and John Hughes movies have really weird names.

1014
00:52:53.331 --> 00:52:54.710
I one day I want to do a decision,

1015
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.630
I want to go back to school and do a Phd dissertation on the kids names,

1016
00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:01.610
kept the names of kids and John says movies.
Anyway,
so there's stuff.
So anyway,

1017
00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:05.360
ducky is kind is unpopular because basically he's poor.

1018
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.070
Like that's kind of what pretty in pink is sag.

1019
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.960
And the same for Molly Ringwald character.
Andy,

1020
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:10.520
she's unpopular because she's poor.

1021
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.340
She literally lives on the wrong side of the train tracks.

1022
00:53:13.341 --> 00:53:15.470
They have her living next to a train for God's sake.

1023
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:19.670
So when he came to write Ferris Bueller,
he sort of rewrote ducky,

1024
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.960
but as a fantasy and he got Matthew Broderick to play the character of Ferris.

1025
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.260
Now,
Matthew Broderick and Jon Cryer as teenagers look basically identical.

1026
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:32.430
It's kind of amazing in the parade scene.
Exactly.
I mean,
he went with a quiz.

1027
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.410
I mean he's basically ducky.
Um,
but he made Ferris Bueller upper middle class,

1028
00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:40.650
um,
and lives in this big house.
And he made him exactly like Ducker.

1029
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:44.430
He likes weird British bands.
He wears weird two tones,
shoes.

1030
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:48.630
He knows about tech.
He's quite annoying,
but everyone loves him.
And

1031
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:57.820
Raul at read the room,
Freeman,
um,
um,

1032
00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:02.100
and um,
but they make it really popular and everyone in the town loves him.

1033
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:04.730
And so it's kind of ducky slash John Hughes.

1034
00:54:04.731 --> 00:54:06.960
His fantasy of what he could have been like,

1035
00:54:06.961 --> 00:54:10.050
what life could have been like if he'd been rich and he could've skipped school

1036
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:12.960
and gotten away with everything.
If he stayed off from school sick,

1037
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.630
they'd be banners in the sky saying,
get well soon.

1038
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.080
All that kind of stuff is a real teenagers fantasy of popularity.

1039
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.800
And for John Hughes,
popularity and wells were synonymous.
Um,

1040
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:26.640
I think it is interesting when British people see American movies that show

1041
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:30.270
social class device because British poverty and American poverty in a lot of

1042
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:34.720
ways are really different.
A really interesting illustration of that,
for me,

1043
00:54:34.721 --> 00:54:38.010
it was when I went to see Blue Valentine a few years ago in this country where

1044
00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:42.030
some friends are Blue Valentine starring Michelle Williams or Ryan Gosling.

1045
00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:43.920
I'm sure a lot of you have seen it.
I mean,

1046
00:54:43.921 --> 00:54:45.840
they're supposed to be quite poor in that movie.

1047
00:54:45.841 --> 00:54:48.030
I mean that's part of the movie is that are struggling with money,

1048
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:52.130
but they always have massive cars and I didn't even notice this when I stopped,

1049
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.200
when I came out.
My,
my best friend is bread.
It was like,
they're so poor.

1050
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:59.640
Why are they driving these massive four by fours?
As I see in America,

1051
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:02.760
obviously there's a whole thing about American,
like basically,

1052
00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.000
I don't even know what they call it now.

1053
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.710
We've had leasing cars and P in American suburbs,

1054
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:10.370
everybody has these massive cars that they lease and they're going for.

1055
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.870
And that's not saying brief poverty in American poverty like American.

1056
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:15.630
I don't know.
It's not like American people are poor,
British people are in poor.

1057
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:16.970
It's just a different attitude towards,

1058
00:55:16.971 --> 00:55:18.570
so a lot of times in these American movies,

1059
00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:21.750
I feel like British people see the people with massive cars and think,
oh,

1060
00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:22.561
they're not really poor.

1061
00:55:22.561 --> 00:55:25.500
And actually it's a whole different kind of weird poverty system in America.

1062
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.450
Anyway,
that's a different,

1063
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.970
different things but also the big houses in these movies.

1064
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.050
That's another thing that,

1065
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:34.290
that I find British people find really weirded out by particularly the suburban

1066
00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:37.890
houses and John Hughes movies.
Like you look at the house in home alone.

1067
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.590
I mean that house is like as big as it seems like as big as the White House.

1068
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:44.910
I mean that houses fricking massive.
Um,
but the truth is in the suburbs,

1069
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:46.710
um,
they are probably very expensive now,

1070
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:50.640
but there are a lot of bigger houses that don't necessarily denote massive

1071
00:55:50.641 --> 00:55:53.960
wealth that they would,
especially here in the countryside.
I mean,

1072
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:57.600
you can't get these big houses in the suburbs thing.
They find that don't,

1073
00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:00.510
that don't require you to be a billionaire.
Brilliant.

1074
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.880
I could chart with you all day,
but unfortunately we are running out of time.

1075
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:08.340
Does anyone have one final question for Hadley?

1076
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.530
I've got to go back and write a column about Ben Affleck.

1077
00:56:13.531 --> 00:56:16.800
So please help me fill my day with questions.
I use movies.

1078
00:56:16.801 --> 00:56:18.510
Anything anything's better than better than bath flag

1079
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:24.010
in that case remains for me to say

1080
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.920
<v 2>thank you so much.
This has been a complete treat.</v>

1081
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.990
And all of you who haven't read the book yet,

1082
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:33.700
have a treat in store and do book next week off cause you will want to just

1083
00:56:33.701 --> 00:56:37.480
spend the whole time watching films.
They go home and watch,
say anything.

1084
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.910
Certainly going to be on my list.
I spent,
uh,

1085
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.380
a happy,

1086
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.370
very happy plane journey having just finished the book for the second time

1087
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:52.720
watching I think four of the movies in here on one day.
It was awesome.

1088
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:56.140
So thank you ever so much.
Complete.
And Yeah.
