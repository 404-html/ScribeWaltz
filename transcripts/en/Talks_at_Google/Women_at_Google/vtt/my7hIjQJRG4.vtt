00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.320
Please help me welcome to the stage Tara Mohr.
Yeah.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.040
<v 1>Thank you for having me.
Everybody can hear me.
Okay,
great.
Oh,</v>

3
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.190
I'm so happy to be here.
Uh,

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.660
this is the neck of the woods where I grew up actually.

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.661
So nice to be back down on the peninsula and I'm really thrilled to be talking

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.790
with all of you about women playing big,

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.080
how we end up playing small and how we can play bigger.

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.740
And I want to begin by sharing with you why I started doing this work and how I

9
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.370
came to be thinking about these topics.
About 10 years ago,

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.000
I was starting to make a big transition in my own career.

11
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.980
I had identified that I didn't really love the work I was doing and I wanted to

12
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.010
be doing work that dealt with people's inner lives and helping them create the

13
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.090
lives and careers they really want it.

14
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.760
And I didn't know exactly what that would look like,

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.400
but I thought coaching would have something to do with it.

16
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.080
And so I had gotten trained as a coach and while I was still working full time

17
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.650
in another job during the evenings and the weekends,

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.860
I was squeezing in this exploration of this new area and starting to coach

19
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.280
mostly friends of friends and colleagues of colleagues who had heard.

20
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:24.870
I was exploring coaching and starting a little bit about starting a little

21
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:25.770
coaching practice.

22
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.390
And most of the women that came to that practice,

23
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.560
I had the exact same response to,

24
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.310
I would sit across from these women in a coaching session and get to hear about

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.090
their dreams,
what they wanted for their careers,

26
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.510
what they saw that was happening in their company or their organization that

27
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.090
they had a critique of or a better vision for what they thought their industry

28
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:57.990
was missing.

29
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.990
I got to hear all of these amazing reflections of their insights and their

30
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.560
brilliance.
And I just became so inspired by every single one of them,

31
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:12.270
by the ideas they had,
by their thoughtfulness,
by how ethical,
uh,

32
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:16.680
and conscientious they were in their approach to their work.

33
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.320
And so I just wanted to see them leading and having more influence.

34
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:27.270
And power in our world and yet over and over and over again,

35
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.030
I heard the same things from them.

36
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.900
I'm not ready yet to take that next step.

37
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.790
I probably need more training first.
I need a few more years experience.

38
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.240
Don't I need another degree?
If that was a good idea,

39
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:44.160
someone would have thought of it already.

40
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.950
Let me think about that more and do more research on it before I do anything

41
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:50.784
about it.

42
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.940
And I started to feel really pained by this because as we all know,
right?

43
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:01.510
We look in the news headlines or we see the decisions that are being made by

44
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:06.511
people in leadership and we know that seems like our world deserves better.

45
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.370
And here I was sitting across from these women,

46
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.800
I thought this is the better that we deserve.

47
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.190
And yet it's somehow not that brilliant isn't really making it to the seats of

48
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.590
power and the places of influence where it deserves to be.

49
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.320
And so that phenomenon,

50
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:27.190
that gap between potential and how people saw themselves,

51
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.260
I needed a shorthand way to label and playing small.

52
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.420
It seemed like a good term for it.

53
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.940
And about the same time I had started blogging about personal growth topics and

54
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.800
professional development topics and a few years into blogging my readership had

55
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:49.801
grown and I got very curious to learn more about who is reading and why and so I

56
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:55.231
sent out a survey to my readers and in the survey one of the questions was,

57
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.060
what's the biggest challenge in your life?
Right?

58
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.740
Probably many of you know from your work.

59
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.960
That's a great market research question.

60
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960
You want to know what are people feeling pained by and challenged by and knowing

61
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:08.650
that most of my readers were women.

62
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.510
I had this list of options on the multiple choice survey of things I thought

63
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.250
might be the biggest challenge in their life.

64
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.690
So of course I put work family balance on there because that's what everybody

65
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.170
talks about is huge challenge and women's lives.

66
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.700
I put a health issues up there and financial issues,

67
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.300
relationship challenges,
I'm not sure what I want.
Right?

68
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:33.760
A whole host of things from different domains of life.

69
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.870
And then I looked at that list and I thought it was actually nothing on that

70
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:42.430
list that reflects what I'm hearing from women in my coaching practice.

71
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.670
And so kind of on a whim I added,

72
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.020
I'm playing small as a possible challenge that people could choose.

73
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.020
And when the responses came back that was what the most women said was the

74
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:57.790
biggest challenge in their life.

75
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.540
I'm playing small and that was so striking to me that we,

76
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.850
so many of us are walking around with some sense that we're playing small and we

77
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.880
feel challenged by it.
Meaning we must somehow be stuck there.

78
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.980
We don't know how to fix that or change it.

79
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.210
And so that became the focus of my work,

80
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.250
trying to understand why are we playing small and then most importantly,

81
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.850
what really makes a difference,
what makes a difference.
So we stopped thing,

82
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:30.910
I'm not ready yet.
We stopped saying I need more qualifications.

83
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.090
We start sharing more of ourselves,
more bravely.

84
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.000
And I found through my coaching practice that there really were some tools and

85
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:45.001
some new pieces of knowledge and some every day moment to moment practices we

86
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:51.121
could do that produced really big change for people quite consistently,

87
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.510
whether they were in a junior or senior level of their career,

88
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.790
whether they were working in business or the social sector,

89
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.210
whether they were entrepreneurs or inside a large organization.

90
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:07.211
The kind of fundamentals have changed that needed to happen where the same and

91
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:12.491
those fundamentals became the basis for the work that I now do for leadership

92
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.100
trainings for the buck.

93
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.150
And we're going to talk about some of the key pieces of that today.

94
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.570
Before we jump into that,

95
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.290
there's one important thing I want to address because we are going to be talking

96
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:32.090
today about the inner barriers for women around our playing bigger.

97
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.720
And it can be easy for that to be misconstrued as then that disparity that we

98
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.620
see in leadership,

99
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.040
the challenges that women face are inside us all our own fault,

100
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.850
right?
And I certainly don't want to convey that in any way.

101
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.940
So first I want to give voice to,

102
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.880
of course there are huge external barriers,

103
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.780
many of which I'm sure through the women at Google work you're learning about

104
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:03.614
here,

105
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.650
all kinds of bias and implicit and explicit discrimination,

106
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:13.380
the pay gap,
so on and so on.
Right?
Um,

107
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.430
and there are these inner issues and the inner barriers that we face,

108
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:20.600
the kind of playing small I'm talking about,

109
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.860
I don't see as disconnected from those external barriers that at all.

110
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.170
So we didn't just make this up because we thought it would be great to play

111
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.760
small and hold ourselves back,

112
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.590
but rather that if you think about what it means to be a woman right in our time

113
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:41.570
right now,
we are in this amazing transitional moment in history.

114
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.870
We're coming out of thousands of years of a legacy where women were pretty much

115
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:54.950
marginalized entirely from professional life,
political life,

116
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.820
public life,
and the legacy of that,

117
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:04.090
the residue of that is still so alive in our culture in many ways in our media.

118
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.580
It's so alive in the messages we get at school and often at home as well.

119
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.130
And that has certain effects on how we see ourselves and how we behave.

120
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.650
And so when we talk about the inner barriers,

121
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:23.651
we're really talking about the inner imprint of that legacy and have that

122
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:28.700
culture.
Okay.
So with that,
let's jump in.

123
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:34.210
We'll talk about three areas today where I commonly see so many women holding

124
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:39.200
themselves back and where we can make really transformative change.

125
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.690
And the first one is our inner critics.
So anyone have one of these?

126
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.940
Yes.
Two hands.
Two hands go up.
Yeah.

127
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.750
Anyone feel like you don't have an inner critic that you're burdened by or

128
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:57.990
affected by as you move through your life or your work?
Okay.
Yeah,

129
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:02.220
so most of us are aware that we do have this voice in our head that says not

130
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:06.780
very nice things to us about ourselves,
that voices a lot of self doubt.

131
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.410
And as much as we're aware of it,

132
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.070
we also probably don't even notice.
For most of us,

133
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:19.071
we don't even notice about 90% of what it's saying because it's become so

134
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:23.400
habitual.
It's the water that we swim in,
right?
So that thought,
oh,

135
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:26.130
I'm just not good at that whole set of things.
Oh,

136
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:28.710
there's no way I could be the person to do that.
Right?

137
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.310
Things that maybe we just feel like that's true about us or that's our way of

138
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:34.470
thinking is often the inner critic.

139
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.760
So the first piece of work we need to do is start to recognize,

140
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.060
when am I hearing my inner critic and start to notice it as a voice in our

141
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:48.660
heads,
not just how my,
my thinking sounds,

142
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:50.010
not just that's who I am,

143
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.290
but start to notice it as one voice so that over time we can get connected to

144
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:59.790
some of the other voices inside of us.
So how do we recognize it?

145
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.040
We listen for when do you hear a voice talking to you in a way that you would

146
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.020
not intend to talk to someone you love?

147
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.130
When do you hear the voice of I'm not ready yet.

148
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.060
That's usually your inner critic for women.

149
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.500
Interestingly,

150
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.530
there is really not good research that says we have more self doubt than men.

151
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.150
That's a common misunderstanding.
Uh,

152
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.190
but there is data that suggest women do feel more self doubt than men around

153
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:33.660
those things that are traditionally associated with masculinity in our culture.

154
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.330
So that's quantitative work,

155
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.530
financial work and decisions,

156
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.680
negotiation and leadership.

157
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.090
There we see that women tend to have more self doubt about themselves in those

158
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.410
areas of skill and work.
On the other side of the coin,

159
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.800
there's some data that suggests that men feel more self doubt around emotional

160
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:04.590
and relational skills like listening,

161
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.590
reading nonverbal cues and communication.

162
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.200
So our self doubt of course is showing up and what's been conditioned in our

163
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:17.850
culture to have us think it's associated with us or people like us.

164
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:18.991
So listen,

165
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:23.370
particularly when do you notice that voice of I'm just not good at those kinds

166
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:25.440
of things.
That's your inner critic.

167
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.880
You might notice your inner critic is often also for women,

168
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:34.840
the voice of body perfectionism or self consciousness around our bodies.
Uh,

169
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.240
it tends to be a very repetitive,
broken record kind of voice.

170
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.141
Uh,

171
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:45.030
and it may take some cues from outer critics in your life,

172
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.490
right?
So you might notice,
oh,

173
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.630
that inner critic voice is saying a lot of things that when I really think about

174
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:52.140
it,

175
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:57.140
that sounds an internalized voice of that really tough first boss I had.

176
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.500
Or that professor who delivered that really,

177
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:07.210
really harsh feedback or that person in my childhood who was very critical of

178
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:10.420
me.
But it,
that's not true for everyone.

179
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.420
You don't have to find an external source for your critic.

180
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.370
You might just notice some echoes there.
So starting to notice that voice.

181
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.690
A question I get a lot around,
uh,

182
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.010
noticing the inner critic is what's the difference between the inner critic and

183
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.870
realistic thinking,
right?

184
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.870
What's there's good critical thinking that might realistically assess something

185
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:37.120
and come back with you now that's not that good.
You're not ready yet.

186
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:38.350
I'm not good at that,
right?

187
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.710
So how do we know when we're hearing that more irrational inner critic versus

188
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:44.830
realistic thinking

189
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.230
and the way you can tell the difference there is really the tone of the thoughts

190
00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:51.064
in your head.

191
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.240
It's not even a distinction of what those two voices say.

192
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.830
They might have the same concerns.

193
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.710
I'm not sure you're ready for that stretch assignment yet,

194
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.830
but the way they talk to you about that,

195
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.200
those those concerns will be very different.

196
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.030
So the inner critic will sound more anxious,
more chattery,

197
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.380
more repetitive.
I'm not sure if I'm ready.
I really don't think I could do that.

198
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:18.490
What if this worst case scenario happens more fearful about future consequences?

199
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.250
And you'll notice that if it's your inner critic,

200
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.280
it's not trying to move towards any solution or resolution of the problem.

201
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.220
Realistic thinking might say,
you know,

202
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.640
I am not sure if I'm ready.

203
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.630
If I have what I need to take that stretch assignment.

204
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.360
How can I find that out?
Who could I talk to?
How can I evaluate it?

205
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.470
How can I test it?
Is there a low risk way to do it?

206
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.550
Let's think through what would be the worst thing that could happen so you can

207
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:54.610
hear the tone.
Realistic thinking is curious.

208
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.570
It's generative and it's on your side.

209
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.070
It moves forward,
down and half of reasoning.

210
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.610
Whereas your inner critic is going to loop and loop and loop.

211
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.930
So why do we have this inner critic?
What is it?
What is it?

212
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.610
No mistake that I think a lot of us make and I used to share this misconception,

213
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.780
is that if we're not confident,
if we feel a lot of self doubt,

214
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.180
one that's a personal problem,

215
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.210
something missing from us as individuals and to that somehow if we look back

216
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:35.080
into our history,
we can find the reason for it.

217
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.090
Was it that I never learned to develop enough confidence doing competitive

218
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:42.880
things as a kid?
Was that these critical people in my life?

219
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:46.180
What is it that my parents were so supportive of me that now,
right?

220
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:50.110
The world feels really dangerous and scary and contrast and and everything feels

221
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:50.944
so critical.

222
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:56.020
We look to our biography for some sort of reason for that self doubt and after

223
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:01.400
talking to so many women about their inner critics and really digging into the

224
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.290
mechanics of self doubt,

225
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.730
I can say that that's not the place to find the answer.

226
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.860
There's nothing in your life experience that is responsible for self doubt,

227
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.460
that in fact we're all hardwired.

228
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.750
We're all hardwired to have that inner critic voice.

229
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.150
And the reason is this,

230
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.860
that we all have a very strong safety instinct,
right?

231
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:32.861
And the safety instinct is the part of us that wants to keep us safe from harm

232
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.450
at any cost.
It's a very old,

233
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.630
ancient reptilian part of that comes from the reptilian part of our brain that's

234
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:46.880
always on the lookout for danger and risk,
right?

235
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.860
And is trying to make sure we survive.

236
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.330
That was very useful when human beings were faced with a lot of life
threatening,

237
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:54.470
dangerous all the time.

238
00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.520
That instinct to look for danger and go into fight or flight when we perceive

239
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:05.060
any possible danger is still alive in all of us.

240
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.820
And in our modern time.

241
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:11.150
It doesn't just fire when there's a physical threat,

242
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.000
it fires when there's an emotional threat.

243
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.030
So when we feel an emotional threat,

244
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:21.920
like I might really embarrass myself saying that,
that idea,

245
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.230
I might really,
uh,
bring some conflict or criticism.

246
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.400
If I point out the elephant in the room that I see that nobody's talking about

247
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:35.330
here,
I might fail.
I might be criticized.

248
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.910
Those are all things we perceive as emotional threats.

249
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.230
And the safety instinct is saying,
no,

250
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.320
we got to avoid all of those.
Let's stay in the comfort zone.

251
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.650
But if every time you wanted to take a stretch,

252
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:57.430
a step in your life or make a change or do something that risked emotional harm,

253
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.050
if every time your safety instinct just said,
hi,
I'm your safety instinct,

254
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.740
I don't like that.
I think we should stay exactly what the status quo.

255
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.000
I think we should stay really safe over here.
Let's not try it.

256
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:15.380
Let's not speak up.
You would say,
no,
I want to,
I want to,
I,

257
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:20.270
I have a longing in me to try that thing.
I want to make this change.

258
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.060
And you would pretty quickly overrule your safety instinct.

259
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.180
So our safety instincts have developed a more sophisticated,

260
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.200
more effective strategy at getting us to stay in the comfort zone.

261
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.520
Instead of saying,
hi,
I'm your safety instinct,
please don't do that.

262
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.260
The safety instinct says you have no idea what you're talking about.

263
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.920
Who Do you think you are?
You're not ready to say that yet.

264
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.520
Let's go research it for a few months first and then come back and say it.

265
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.420
And that is an intimidating enough narrative to get most of us to stay in that

266
00:17:57.751 --> 00:17:58.584
comfort zone.

267
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:05.030
So the inner critic is a strategy that your safety instinct is using to make

268
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:11.031
sure you don't do things that raise that risk of emotional vulnerability or

269
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:15.030
possible emotional discomfort.

270
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.140
And the problem is that just like an accompany,

271
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.730
you end up a lot of problems when you have two departments that don't coordinate

272
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:24.564
it all.

273
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.840
The risk aversion department in us never talks to the fulfillment department or

274
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:32.790
the reward department.
It doesn't care.

275
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.450
It really doesn't care if you ever have a fulfill day in your life.

276
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.020
It has one mission stay in the comfort zone.

277
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.010
So if we listen to it,
that's what happens.
We stay in the comfort zone,

278
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.720
but we miss out on a lot.

279
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.450
And that's what happens when we listen to our inner critics.

280
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.690
So if we're hardwired for self doubt,
what do we do?

281
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.770
What do we do about that?
Safety instinct isn't going anywhere.

282
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.420
Our desire to do things that have us risking failure and criticism also isn't

283
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:04.254
going anywhere,

284
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:10.500
so the thing we don't try and do is become confident and this is where I am

285
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:13.590
against all this advice that women should just become more confident,

286
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:16.740
that we've got to encourage our girls to be confident that confidence is the

287
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:21.741
answer because I know that the women who are leading and risking and speaking on

288
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.660
and excelling don't feel confident as they're doing it.

289
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.060
A couple of my favorite examples of this one comes from Twyla Tharp,

290
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.360
who is many people I've heard of,
Twyla Tharp.

291
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:39.900
She's one of the most famous choreographers of our time.

292
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.650
She is one about 10 Tony Awards.

293
00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:45.990
She has tons of honorary degrees.

294
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:50.700
Her work is celebrated all over the world and she says,

295
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:54.630
every time I start a new dance,
when I go into the studio,

296
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.490
I am completely sure that this is the one where the audience is going to walk

297
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:04.491
out on opening night laughing because they're going to see my talent has run

298
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:05.364
out.

299
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.270
Another one of my favorite examples comes from Cherry Murray,

300
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.570
who is the dean of engineering at Harvard,
and she says,

301
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:16.750
every single day I feel unqualified for my job.

302
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.650
So what's fascinating about that,
right,

303
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.080
is that Twyla Tharp is doing the dance anyway,

304
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.210
and Terry Murray took that job and continues to show up at that job anyway.

305
00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.420
And that's the name of the game.

306
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.870
It's how do I hear the voice of self doubt?

307
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.500
It's going to be very loud if you are truly playing to your potential,

308
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.030
it's going to be very loud if you're sharing your voice and your gifts in the

309
00:20:46.031 --> 00:20:50.050
world because the safety doesn't like the respite comes with that.

310
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.050
So how do we let it be there and hear it,

311
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.330
but not take direction from it in just that way that Cherry Murray and Twyla

312
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:03.100
Tharp are talking about?
So to do that,
we need to one,

313
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.720
know that it's that voice when it's talking,
right?
Twyla Tharp actually says,

314
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:09.580
and then I think,
oh,
there's that voice again.

315
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:11.350
It's been there with me for every dance.

316
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.260
I've started to choreograph and I know if I listened to it,

317
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:18.130
I would stop choreographing entirely,
right?

318
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:20.590
So hearing the voice of self doubt,

319
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.480
recognizing it for what it is you can even ask yourself in the moment,

320
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.230
what does my safety instinct not like about this situation?

321
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.860
When you hear self doubt,
so if you here,

322
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.840
I'm really just always been horrible at that and I'm going to totally screw this

323
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:41.260
up.
What does my safety instinct not like about this situation?

324
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.550
And you'll see it immediately,
oh it doesn't like that.

325
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.780
I'm going to get feedback on this.
That might hurt.
It doesn't like that.

326
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:52.750
If I apply for this,
I may get it or not,
right?

327
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.640
And then you can start to see why the inner critic is speaking up.
Um,

328
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.970
it can also be fun.
Just a few more playful strategies you can use.

329
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:03.430
You can create a character for your inner critic.

330
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.550
So think about if you are going to give it a personality,

331
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.750
what kind of personality,
what kind of character personifies it for you.

332
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.580
And then when you hear that voice,

333
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:16.180
you can notice it come as coming from that character.

334
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.470
Whether you imagine that visually or it's a particular voice and that can just

335
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:24.400
add some lightness and you can see the humor in what it's saying and also it can

336
00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:26.860
help you remember,
that's not the core of me.

337
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.600
The core of me is the part that has that desire to fulfill my potential.

338
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.150
Um,
you can also even sometimes imagine it leaving the space that you're in.

339
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.510
So if you are writing an important email and you notice you're feeling like

340
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:46.810
you're being very perfectionistic and the editing of it and feeling like it's

341
00:22:46.811 --> 00:22:48.070
not going to come across right,

342
00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:50.500
and you're hearing a lot of self doubt about what you're saying,

343
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.310
to actually picture that inner critic voice,

344
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.460
leaving the room or picture of the character leaving the room and then come back

345
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:03.100
to your screen.
Okay,
now it's just me.
Let's go.

346
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.350
And it sounds hard to believe,

347
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:08.830
but that actually can make a really powerful difference for people and how,

348
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.600
how present that voices for them.

349
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.100
So noticing the inner critic voice,
learning to live with it,

350
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.840
not waiting on confidence.

351
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.870
Please do not wait on confidence for anything that you're wanting to do.

352
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.010
But rather the answer is it's not becoming confident.

353
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:27.370
It's having a new kind of relationship with self doubt.

354
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.370
Okay.
So let's move on to a second topic,

355
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.610
which is unhooking from praise and criticism and hooking from praise and

356
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:40.450
criticism.

357
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:45.990
And this is an area that that really surprised me in my work with women to see

358
00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:51.221
how many of the issues that people were coming to coaching with looked like.

359
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.970
One thing on the surface,

360
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:57.800
but really something else that had to do with their relationship to praise and

361
00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:01.410
criticism.
So one of,
uh,

362
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.870
my clients came with,
I've been working in my field for 25 years.

363
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.090
I have done really well in it,

364
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:13.091
but I see this huge problem with the conventional way things are approached in

365
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:13.994
my field.

366
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.370
She worked in a domestic violence prevention and and services.

367
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.820
I see this huge problem and I want to start my own program with a different

368
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:28.910
approach and my job is so demanding.

369
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.430
I'm so overtaxed I can never get to this thing.

370
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.320
I want a coach to help me carve out the time and hold me accountable so I can

371
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.960
make some movement on this thing.
Okay,
great.

372
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.450
While I didn't know yet what I know now,
it's just time is never the real issue.

373
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.680
It's maybe the real issue 0.5% of the time.

374
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.420
But when we delved a little deeper,

375
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:55.130
what was clear for her was she had always been a star within her field.

376
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.810
She had always gotten a lot of uh,

377
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
positive feedback and excelled in the conventional way and she knew that this

378
00:25:05.751 --> 00:25:09.590
new approach that she wanted to bring forward was going to be controversial.

379
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.850
And as someone who had always been a good student in school and done well at

380
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:17.990
work that moved to how am I going to launch something that I know will be

381
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:19.070
controversial,

382
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.130
can I live with the criticism and feedback and the polarized reactions that are

383
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:28.160
going to come my way was really what was keeping her stuck.

384
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.870
So that's one example.

385
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.730
Another was a woman who works in management consulting who said,
you know,

386
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:39.050
I love my job,
I love the analysis.
I really liked the work with clients,

387
00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:44.051
but I have been promoted to this new level and now where I am,

388
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.510
there's a lot of harsh feedback coming my way.

389
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:52.070
Some of it is at this level,
the way my colleagues and I,

390
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.190
the culture of how we talk to each other.
There's just a lot of criticism.

391
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.430
Some of it is that now when the client doesn't like something,

392
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:00.710
I'm the one that's hearing everything about it.

393
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.220
And I am finding myself so on such an emotional rollercoaster with that.

394
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:11.300
And so I'm uncomfortable with it that it's keeping me from liking my job.

395
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.950
So I'm coming to coaching to figure out should I change careers or wait,

396
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:18.770
that doesn't seem right because I love the actual heart of the work.

397
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.470
And so with her,
again,
we had to look at what,

398
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:26.300
what's this relationship to criticism and negative feedback and how does that

399
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:28.970
block us?
Uh,

400
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.820
I have really found that for every person,
um,

401
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.660
and particularly for women,

402
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.780
there is a point where we get stopped in our growth because of our relationship

403
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:43.280
to praise and criticism.

404
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.430
And that could be where avoidant of criticism we're seeking of praise.

405
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.900
For some of us,
it's that we're avoidant of a lot of praise.
Paradoxically,

406
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:54.300
if you grew up in a culture where you're not,

407
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.720
you're supposed to blend in and don't brag and don't do things,

408
00:26:57.721 --> 00:26:59.160
don't try and be in the spotlight,

409
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.850
you will unconsciously or consciously avoid the things that will bring a lot of

410
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:05.670
praise.
So that's another way we can get hooked.

411
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.500
And so part of this journey to playing bigger is unhooking from praise and

412
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:11.334
criticism.

413
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.890
This does affect women in particular in a few ways.

414
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.820
Certainly all of us human beings were affected by praise and criticism.

415
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:25.230
But there's some interesting dimensions of how it affects women in particular.

416
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.950
One is that we know women get more harsh criticism then men in the workforce and

417
00:27:32.191 --> 00:27:34.520
we get more personal criticism.
Um,

418
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.180
so some of you may have seen the study that was done by Kieran Snyder.

419
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.570
She's a linguist and a,
uh,

420
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.790
a tech entrepreneur.

421
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:50.050
And she did a study looking at a performance reviews from about 30 tech

422
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:56.751
companies and analyzing them using a variety of linguistic tools.

423
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:03.350
And she found that not only did women get a lot more negative feedback than men

424
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.550
in their performance reviews,

425
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:10.850
but 73% of the negative feedback that women got was criticism of their

426
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:12.450
personality.

427
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.730
And 2% of the negative feedback that men got was criticism of a personality

428
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:18.564
trait.

429
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:24.470
So this sense of the feedback we get is more personal and therefore more

430
00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:27.630
wounding for us,
of course,

431
00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:31.500
and more became something that we are more alert on avoiding.

432
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.400
There's a real gender gap there,
right in the kind of feedback we get.

433
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.150
So of course,
as a result of that,
we're going to feel more hooked,

434
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.470
more caught up in what's going on with the negative feedback we get.

435
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.800
Another interesting factor that has a gender dimension,
uh,

436
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
is what I call the noisy room.

437
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.550
And I call it the noisy room because I always felt when I was working inside a

438
00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:57.570
large organization,

439
00:28:57.571 --> 00:29:01.950
if I was in a meeting with 15 people around a conference table,

440
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.220
that room felt incredibly noisy to me with the cues and the dynamics of

441
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:13.470
everything that was going on amongst that group.

442
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.330
So when people were talking,
I would be noticing,
you know,

443
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.180
that person really seems to be resisting everything that person's saying and

444
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:24.720
that person's in a really grumpy mood today and that person's always just trying

445
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:28.320
to win over these three people.
All those dynamics,
right?
Very,

446
00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:30.360
very full of information.

447
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:36.080
And I found that for me that often sometimes got in the way of my ability to

448
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.890
really push forward in the midst of complex dynamics,
um,

449
00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.360
and kind of see the main,

450
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.400
see the main event or let those dynamics just be and let the project go forward

451
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:53.320
without feeling like they needed to be resolved.

452
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.690
So I had noticed that in myself and notice that I didn't see,
uh,

453
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.960
some of my male colleagues grappling with all of,

454
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:03.430
they weren't even aware of the things I was talking about.
You know,

455
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:05.270
if I had just to bring them up to be resolved,

456
00:30:05.271 --> 00:30:08.410
the often they weren't even aware and they certainly didn't think they needed to

457
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:09.244
be resolved.

458
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:14.440
And so then I was really intrigued when I read that there's research that

459
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:18.670
supports exactly what that experience was on,

460
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.073
uh,

461
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.140
one that there is a gender difference in the amount of information that women

462
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:28.900
and men pick up in nonverbal cues.

463
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.820
There's very few gender differences that actually are consistently borne out by

464
00:30:33.821 --> 00:30:34.654
the research.

465
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.930
One of them that there's a pretty solid body of studies around is that women

466
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.020
pick up a lot more information from facial expressions,

467
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.520
from body language.
And so if you think about what that means,

468
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:53.521
it means we're processing a lot more and that includes people's reactions to us,

469
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.030
right?
We're processing a lot more of people,

470
00:30:58.031 --> 00:31:02.260
subtle reactions to us than our male counterparts are.

471
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.270
And that's something that can be distracting for us.

472
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:08.590
Study.

473
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:13.120
This particular study done at Harvard also found that contrary to all that

474
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:15.820
research on the emotional,
uh,

475
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.550
the benefits of high emotional intelligence,

476
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.060
there's also some downsides of high emotional intelligence around morale and

477
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:27.250
productivity,
which I think really speaks to what I'm talking about,
right?

478
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:31.510
If you very high emotional intelligence,
you're picking up all those cues.

479
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.690
It can interfere with a certain kind of productivity.

480
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.700
You may feel kind of down about the dynamics you're observing that other people

481
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:40.660
aren't even noticing.

482
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.130
So that's another way we can get hooked on people's reactions to us.

483
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:47.860
We just get more information about that.
As women,

484
00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:50.110
we're oblivious to less and that can be helpful,

485
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:53.410
but we have to be really discerning about when it's helpful and when it's not.

486
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.950
Uh,
and then lastly,

487
00:31:56.951 --> 00:32:00.520
another factor that informs our relationship to feedback is,

488
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.450
is our history again.
And if you think about women's history,
right?

489
00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:07.510
For most of our history,

490
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:13.020
women could not survive through financial power,

491
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.620
political power,
physical strength.

492
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.070
We didn't have those things,
right?

493
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:26.310
We weren't going to be able to survive or ensure the survival of our dearest

494
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:30.640
ones through physical night,

495
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.270
through political rights,
through legal protection,

496
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.100
through financial ownership of property.
We didn't have any of those things.

497
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.520
And our primary survival strategy,

498
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:49.070
or you could also say our primary service strategy for thriving was social

499
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.860
influence and likability,
right?

500
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.160
Working through relationships to do what would be approved of or tolerable or

501
00:32:57.651 --> 00:33:00.740
met with uh,
a positive reaction.

502
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.970
And the reason that's so important is because for a lot of us,

503
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.990
there's a kind of legacy of that that still lives where conflict or harsh

504
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:16.271
criticism really does feel life threatening really can feel life threatening if

505
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:20.840
we really tune in to our inner experience of it.
And that's why.

506
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.850
So how do we unhook from praise and criticism?

507
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.450
There are a bunch of strategies in the book.

508
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.450
There's one I want to focus on today,

509
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.380
which is changing your story about feedback.

510
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.660
And the new story that I want to offer you today is a little bit,

511
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.300
it sounds a little bit radical to some people at first.

512
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.210
So hang in there with me and it's this,

513
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.590
that feedback never tells you anything about yourself.

514
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.620
It can only tell you about the person giving the feedback.

515
00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.740
So I'm guessing this is a pretty feedback oriented culture.
Yes,

516
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:05.270
we have to take feedback very seriously.
It's going to help us grow.

517
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.280
It's key to our development.

518
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.930
Integral something great leaders are always looking for a lot of feedback.

519
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:15.620
So to say,
feedback can never tell any,
tell you anything about you.

520
00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:19.220
It can only tell you about the people you're getting feed back from.

521
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.250
Kinda thought seems like it flies in the face of that.

522
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:26.640
So let's talk about that for a minute.
So let's say,
uh,

523
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:31.750
your manager says you are a really great,

524
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.590
you're really great with details and project management.
Um,
but you know,

525
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.430
I,

526
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:42.430
there's something missing in the sort of team interaction and the ability to

527
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:47.090
motivate people and make them feel comfortable kind of on the soft skills sky.

528
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.910
There's something missing.
So that's the feedback.

529
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.340
So what does that tell us about you?

530
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.940
Does that tell us you're a good project manager?

531
00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.530
Does that tell us there's something missing in the soft skill side?

532
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.330
Does it tell us any facts about that?
Really when you think about it,

533
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:11.410
the only fact we're actually getting there is the fact of that is the feedback

534
00:35:12.261 --> 00:35:17.250
my manager gave me.
That sounds like that's the feedback.
That is the uh,

535
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.710
his or her perception,
his or her experience of my work.
That's the fact.

536
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.290
That's his or her experience of my work.

537
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.430
What if your whole team says,
well,

538
00:35:30.431 --> 00:35:32.870
you're a really great project manager,
great with the details,

539
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:37.140
but we all feel kind of like we can't connect or you didn't know were not really

540
00:35:37.141 --> 00:35:41.520
motivated by you.
Does that give us any facts about you?

541
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

542
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.310
<v 1>Does that give us some facts about that group of people?</v>

543
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.210
Perhaps some facts about what's coming across to them.

544
00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:51.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

545
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.730
<v 1>Tells us about their experience of you.</v>

546
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.953
So,

547
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.850
<v 2>okay,</v>

548
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:03.170
<v 1>the next step there is not to dismiss the feedback.</v>

549
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.180
This is not,
oh,
that's all about them.
So I'm going to ignore it.
It's,
oh,

550
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.240
that's giving me information about these individuals and if these are people

551
00:36:14.391 --> 00:36:16.400
that I want to work with effectively,

552
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.300
if these are important stakeholders to what I'm doing,

553
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.820
I'm going to really listen to that feedback.

554
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.870
I'm going to try and understand what it is telling me about them,

555
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.740
what they need from me,
what they expect of me,

556
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.670
what they expect of someone in this role,
what works for them and what doesn't.

557
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.060
And if I want to work with them effectively,

558
00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:41.840
I may incorporate or adapt with some of that feedback.

559
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.700
So the power of that is that when we're looking at feedback,

560
00:36:46.701 --> 00:36:51.320
as that's information about them,
we don't get defensive.

561
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.870
You never have to decide if it's true or not.

562
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.830
You never have to call your friend and talk about how crazy your manager is or

563
00:36:57.831 --> 00:37:02.570
what they said because it really doesn't matter whether it's true in some

564
00:37:02.571 --> 00:37:03.920
objective sense or not.

565
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:08.930
What matters is you're getting information about someone who potentially as an

566
00:37:08.931 --> 00:37:13.580
important stakeholder for you.
And when we're not taking it personally,

567
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.930
when we're not making the feedback about us,
something interesting happens.

568
00:37:17.931 --> 00:37:22.490
We start to get really curious about the feedback because it's not personal.

569
00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:26.390
We're not defending against it.
Oh,
interesting.
They,
I hmm.

570
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.460
They think I'm not connecting with people.

571
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.620
I would love to understand more like what is their vision of what that looks

572
00:37:33.621 --> 00:37:38.240
like or,
uh,
how do they see that fitting into my job?

573
00:37:38.241 --> 00:37:43.070
Where would that happen in the flow of my work,
right?

574
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.830
We can ask a lot of questions.
We can learn more.

575
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:51.010
We can be truly open and then we can adapt and incorporate the feedback.

576
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.550
But from the perspective of that's what it takes to be effective here.

577
00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.630
Not from the perspective of there's something defective about me.

578
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.333
<v 2>Okay.</v>

579
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.110
<v 1>And that is so important for us,
particularly for women,</v>

580
00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.280
for people of color,

581
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:12.310
because the feedback we get is often going to be impacted by bias.

582
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.050
And we don't want to take that on and make it about us.

583
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.920
We want to allow it to be looked at more neutrally.

584
00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.540
And with mark curiosity,

585
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.920
what is this telling me about what it takes to be effective in this context?

586
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:30.350
So thoughts,
questions on anything we talked about today.

587
00:38:30.351 --> 00:38:31.550
And this is a great time.

588
00:38:31.551 --> 00:38:35.890
I always say this is a great time to not listen to your inner critic,
right?

589
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:40.720
Take that first step of if you hear the voice in your head saying that question,

590
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:42.850
does I not?
It's not well thought out enough yet.

591
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:46.840
Or it might not not be a good question.
Or maybe she said that and I wasn't.

592
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.750
I didn't catch it.
That's your inner critic.

593
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.190
So this is a great opportunity to practice not listening to that voice.

594
00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:00.150
While a woman may receive more negative feedback about their,

595
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.320
um,

596
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.320
about more personal attributes that they may leave a get actually less like,

597
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.033
um,

598
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.960
useful graphical feedback about things they can do to grow,

599
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:17.760
um,
that,
uh,
men in the same position do.
So,
um,

600
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:18.960
yeah.
Any,

601
00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:22.670
any thoughts on that and maybe strategies for getting more of that kind of feed?

602
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.740
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I'm not sure if you're referring,

603
00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:29.741
there was one study that came out last fall about the feedback that women get

604
00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:35.570
tends to be more general and more vague.
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Um,

605
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:39.170
just that it's another really important thing to be aware of.
Right?
I think for,

606
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.180
for men and women,

607
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.480
knowing these trends are so important because it means if you look at your

608
00:39:44.481 --> 00:39:46.880
performance review,
you can say,
oh,

609
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.220
this is a lot of this feedback is personality driven.

610
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:54.490
There's nothing specific here that's tied to the core objectives for my role.

611
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.450
Okay.
That's not just me.

612
00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:01.430
I know that's part of a larger pattern and that's potentially then something you

613
00:40:01.431 --> 00:40:04.080
might want to ask for.
And more specifically,
um,

614
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.460
if you're in the kind of team or department where you can have a constructive

615
00:40:07.461 --> 00:40:10.940
discussion outside of specific performance reviews,

616
00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:13.010
like circulate those articles,
right?

617
00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:17.090
And make sure everybody who's giving and receiving performance reviews is aware

618
00:40:17.091 --> 00:40:21.050
of those patterns so they can catch themselves in them.
Um,

619
00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.370
I spoke at a company a few years ago and was talking about this,
the,

620
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.910
the personality feedback thing and uh,

621
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.850
talking about the word abrasive and how abrasive as you know,

622
00:40:31.851 --> 00:40:35.660
it's very commonly used with women.
It's never used with men.

623
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:40.070
And there was a male
executive in the audience who said,

624
00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:44.960
I just use that word in three performance reviews last week with three women and

625
00:40:44.961 --> 00:40:46.970
now I realize I need to go change it.

626
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.760
So I think raising the awareness there is huge.

627
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:54.790
And then asking for more specific feedback and feedback around your objectives

628
00:40:56.301 --> 00:40:58.790
for your job is really important if you,

629
00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.090
if you see that happening in your reviews.
Um,

630
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.410
one thing that I think a lot of women at Google struggle with,

631
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:09.190
because tech can be a very,
very male dominated world,

632
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.830
and I personally work in sales at Google.

633
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:14.170
So business is also fairly male dominated world,

634
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:19.500
is that there's this constant conflict between discomfort in the situation that

635
00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:24.250
you're in and wanting to improve it and wanting to make sure that people are

636
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:27.760
educated about implicit bias and all that good stuff,

637
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
but at the same time yearning for a community where that doesn't have to be that

638
00:41:33.501 --> 00:41:37.100
it's already understood.
So in your experience coaching,

639
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:41.660
did you ever find women that were also dealing with that dichotomy and how did

640
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:44.340
you coach them through it?
Yeah.
Um,

641
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:49.220
I would just say I think that's a really important need.

642
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:52.100
I would even,
I would go further than to say it's a want,

643
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.690
it's a need to have that kind of likeminded community or community where you

644
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:57.800
feel like you're not,

645
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.760
you don't have to be in change agent mode and navigating,

646
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:05.440
how exactly do I be a diplomatic change agent,
right.
All the time.
Um,

647
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.950
and that can happen in a lot of ways.

648
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:11.060
It could happen with women inside your organization if there's an opportunity

649
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:15.060
for that.
Um,
it is the reason that I think a lot of women,
um,

650
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:18.620
do things that even our cross industry,

651
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:23.450
whether that's a group coaching experience or uh,

652
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.781
you know,

653
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:27.200
some other kind of cell form women's group or a book club that talks about these

654
00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:31.460
issues or whatever,
it's just so tremendously nourishing for people.

655
00:42:31.461 --> 00:42:35.240
And I would just really encourage you to create that whatever way you can.

656
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:36.610
Um,

657
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:41.610
what was the most challenging pushback you experience in trying to play big and

658
00:42:41.891 --> 00:42:46.730
speak up personally or,
yeah,
uh,

659
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:51.420
that's a great question.
Well,
I'm writing a lot of political pieces now,

660
00:42:51.421 --> 00:42:54.670
so that's interesting.
I get some pushback,
um,

661
00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.670
around that.
Uh,
and you know,

662
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.880
for me it's usually around political or social issues and that's definitely a

663
00:43:02.881 --> 00:43:05.720
playing big edge for me that I still grapple with.
Like,

664
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:10.590
how much do I really want and how much am I really willing to speak out about

665
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:11.910
what's Hap,

666
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:16.380
what I perceive as happening in our collective mill.

667
00:43:16.381 --> 00:43:20.700
You.
Um,
and yeah,
I just find the more radical I get with that,

668
00:43:20.701 --> 00:43:24.420
the more pushback I get.
So it's a good playing big edge for me and I think,

669
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.290
you know,
we should,
we're all always on this journey of what's,

670
00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:32.730
what's my playing big edge now?
What feels really scary but important now?

671
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.350
That doesn't end.
Yeah.

672
00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:39.630
In terms of educating those around us.
So the men in the room,

673
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:44.520
um,
especially when they're in very senior leadership positions and you can see,

674
00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.080
um,

675
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:51.170
certain characteristics and behaviors kind of trickle through all of the layers.

676
00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.930
Um,
how,
I mean,
coming to talks like this is fantastic,

677
00:43:54.931 --> 00:43:59.400
but how do we help bring that message outward?
Yeah.

678
00:43:59.401 --> 00:44:04.230
So the interesting thing is that I've,

679
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:09.360
I believe the education really needs to happen for everyone and not just women

680
00:44:10.651 --> 00:44:15.000
for themselves,
but women for how they manage and work with other women.

681
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.050
Um,
the research,
you know,
for example,

682
00:44:19.051 --> 00:44:24.000
the research on the double bind that women are often perceived as competent or

683
00:44:24.001 --> 00:44:25.500
likable,
but not both.

684
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:30.960
That phenomenon is worse with a female manager than a male manager.

685
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.220
And a lot of times there is a kind of policing that women have done of their own

686
00:44:38.971 --> 00:44:41.850
voices or their own expression or whatever.

687
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:46.350
They had to compartmentalize on the way up that really makes it hard for them to

688
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:49.950
fully support other women.
So I think,
you know,
it's,

689
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.690
it's really important to think of the education as in the conversation as

690
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:59.100
needing to happen for everyone.
Um,
and it's tricky because with,

691
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.280
with leaders,
and I would say even particularly with female leaders,

692
00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.700
the most important thing is that they're doing their own playing big work

693
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.770
because you,
you really can't support and another,

694
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.420
as a woman,
you cannot,

695
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:16.430
you will not end up supporting and another woman what you are not allowing

696
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.303
yourself.

697
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.750
So if you're walking on egg shells with the way you express your voice,

698
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:25.950
you really don't want it direct report who's not,
that's not gonna go over well.

699
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.070
Right?
So,
um,
that,

700
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:32.970
and I think that's really important for everyone to reflect on how do I do my

701
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:34.140
own playing big work,

702
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.130
knowing that it's going to change my ability to embrace and support others'

703
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:42.750
ambitions that's more effective than,
you know,

704
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:47.160
receiving an education.
Thank you everyone.
Thank you everyone.
