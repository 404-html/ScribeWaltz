1
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.320
This is from the second book,

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.300
but the only spoiler in it is that my main character is an astronaut at this

3
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.600
point,
which I trust is not a spoiler since the title of the series is the lady

4
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.900
astronauts series.
Um,
so you know,

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.600
uh,
so everything is ruined now.
Um,

6
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.220
so this is from the faded sky.
Uh,

7
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:30.720
and part of the reason that I'm reading this section is because it takes place

8
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.130
in the neutral buoyancy lab.

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.790
And I actually got to go to the neutral buoyancy lab,
uh,

10
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:40.680
and watch a full Dev run development run,
um,
with an astronaut.

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.730
And the astronauts,
uh,
Chell Lindgrin said,
you know,
when he was inviting me,

12
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.780
it's like,
do you want to,
do you want to come and watch me do this?
Um,

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.270
you'll be able to watch the suit up and everything.
You can hang out all day,

14
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:54.900
but you probably won't want to cause it will be really boring.

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.630
And I'm like,
so chill.
You know how I'm a professional puppeteer.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.200
Next time you're in New York,
if you want to go hang out on sesame street,

17
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.070
let me know.

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
But you probably won't want to hang out all day because it will be really
boring.

19
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.550
He acknowledged I had a point

20
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.330
and spoiler not boring at all.
So,
um,

21
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.760
so I also do the audio books.
Uh,

22
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.510
and what you're going to see aside from the presence of a microphone and

23
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:29.560
headphones is actually the way I recorded this,
uh,
in the studio.

24
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.720
<v 0>The thing about wearing a space suit on earth is that it's designed for lower</v>

25
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:37.554
gravity.

26
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.520
Even being in the neutral buoyancy labs pool didn't change the fact that gravity

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.790
pulled at me.
Sure it didn't sly,
it didn't pull it the suit.

28
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.791
But inside I slid around every time I changed orientation as a woman,

29
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.560
I was smaller than the men the suits had been designed for.

30
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.620
So I had to wear a pad and around my hips to sorta wedge me in.

31
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.550
Ms kept the air bubbles surrounding me inside the suit distributed evenly,

32
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.840
allowing me to move from horizontal to vertical over the course of the NBL run

33
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.980
without fight and gravity without the pattern and the air bubble acted like a

34
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:11.910
giant beach ball strapped my stomach always wanting to be pointed up toward the

35
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:15.080
surface.
It made it difficult to roll in any other way,

36
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.280
direction and truth.

37
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.290
Having an air bubble inside of the suit wouldn't be a problem in space.
Matt,

38
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.650
the NBL was where people decided if you had what it took to do a spacewalk,

39
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.760
so neither I nor any of the other women would complain.
No Sir.

40
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.030
Everything was splinted and we were a happy to be in the pool.

41
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.140
I hung sideways in the water with the fiberglass shell digging into my armpit,

42
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.590
my neck burn from holding my head up inside my helmet.

43
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.420
My fingers ached from forcing my stiff gloves to close on the edge of the solar

44
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:47.960
panel.

45
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.960
We were practicing repairing with the suits pressurized to 4.9 PSI above ambient

46
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:57.530
pressure.
Every movement felt like working against a heavy duty spring.

47
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.190
It wasn't exactly like in a vacuum,

48
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.950
but it gave us a sense of how exhausting it would be.

49
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.270
A wrinkle in my glove felt like a metal wire across my knuckle as the pressure

50
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.520
made it rigid,
but if you asked me how I was doing,
I would be so very,

51
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:15.080
very chipper on the other side of the panel.

52
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.550
Hafael Avellino swore in Portuguese as his gloves slid off the ranch.

53
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.230
Our support divers is floated in a pod around us and let the ranch drift away.

54
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.480
Their job was to keep us safe and ours was to learn how to do repairs in zero g

55
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.160
tethered to the mws or many workstation on the chest of a space suit.

56
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.420
The ranch didn't go far,
but it was still a pain reeling it in as how fails.

57
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:42.630
Curses buzzed over the comm.
I grinned inside my helmet.

58
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.350
I'm beginning to understand why Parker is learning Portuguese on my left and

59
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.850
slightly below me.
Leonard helped me study the panel is huff Ale,

60
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.610
got the wrench back into place.
We all need more languages to square it.

61
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.390
I've just got Latin and Greek and there's only so far that can take you.

62
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.600
Oh yeah.
What's a Latin class like?
I'll fail.

63
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:08.950
Place the wrench again and reseeded his feet and the foot restraints secured in

64
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:13.510
a wif mechanical receptor on the mockup Stereo of our craft.

65
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.100
What does with stand for no idea?
At a certain point,

66
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:23.101
the acronyms just become the name with was widget interface.

67
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:28.030
Forget about it.
That's the actual answer that I got from an actual astronaut.

68
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:29.260
When I asked what that meant,

69
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.940
one of the mini benefits to building the ships in space was that we didn't have

70
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:38.320
to worry about aerodynamics.
Whiffs and grips covered the surface of the ship.

71
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.980
Half a hills wrench slipped again,

72
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.981
but he didn't lose his grasp because I could use some more curses right now.

73
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.470
Leonard hesitated and then chuckled.
Actually,

74
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:53.220
most of them aren't things I can say in mixed company,
please.

75
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.010
I braced against my foot.
Restrain is how fail.

76
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:59.370
Finally they got the ranch engaged.
Say The fucking Latin.

77
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.740
That got a huge laugh from both men though.
My face flame did.
Having said it,

78
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.000
thank God the helmets meant they couldn't see me clearly.
Even for a laugh.

79
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.150
That kind of language was not in my normal vocabulary and then predictably Jason

80
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.030
Sour I sim soup Juju or crackled into our ears language vomit butoh can carve in

81
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.410
May.
Leonard intoned with great solemnity.

82
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.480
Hava hills had came up in his helmet that is close enough to Portuguese that I

83
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:35.010
actually understood it.
Mostly gentlemen,

84
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.730
lady for a guy from Chicago.
It,
it could be so prim.

85
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:42.250
Sometimes we have visitors and they are listening here.

86
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.560
The three of us exchanged glances and Hafael rolled his eyes.

87
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.100
What language do they speak?
English with the microphone.

88
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:55.310
We could just make out someone talking in the background but not the substance

89
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:59.540
of the conversation and the same soups response was sharp and biting.

90
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.620
No,

91
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.230
bringing them up early as absolutely out of the and then it might cut off.

92
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.620
What did that been through the water?
I couldn't see what the guys thought,

93
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.480
so I just stood there bracing the panel.

94
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.630
It wasn't like the sim soup to leave his mic open,

95
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.220
which raised the question of what sort of visitors would distract him that badly

96
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.610
to say nothing of who might be asking us to come out of the NBL early.

97
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.870
Half a hell got that bolt tightened down and we moved on as a unit to extend the

98
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:27.950
next piece of the panel.

99
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.240
This was the fourth time we'd done this particular NBL run and each time we got

100
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.140
a little faster.

101
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.070
Of course it wasn't likely that I would be the one doing the Eva,

102
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:41.990
but the IAC believed in over preparation and after my late start I supported

103
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.140
them in that.
Besides it would make being the ivy person,

104
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:49.040
the intro vehicular person easier if I knew what they were facing,

105
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.190
given the communication lags we would have during the mission.

106
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.090
We couldn't rely on ground control to coach the team.
In every scenario.

107
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.471
Folks,

108
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:01.550
we're going to stand down on extending the array and the Nissim soups voice

109
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.300
crackled.

110
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.670
Then the microphone rustled and shifted as though he were handing it off with

111
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:10.580
loaded underwater with the constant hum of fans and sound of our own breath.

112
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:13.640
His company then director Clemens came on the calm.

113
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.130
We have to pull dr flood route,

114
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.490
but Dr. York and Captain Avellino will stay and walks through the cleanup.

115
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.460
Dr Flattery,
I need you out of the Pool Pronto.

116
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.920
Leonard drew breath as if he was going to argue then snapped his mouth shut so

117
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:32.310
hard.
I heard his teeth click.
No Sir.
So you're top side.

118
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.910
I am ashamed to say that my primary emotion was not curiosity or even annoyance

119
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.290
than our training had been interrupted,
but relief that for once it wasn't me.

120
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.400
Leonard turned from us and let the divers drag him through the water to the

121
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:51.140
platform that would carry him to the surface.
Hafael and I floated in the pool.

122
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.490
I let my head slumped against the side of my helmet and closed my eyes for a

123
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:55.791
moment.

124
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.720
While our support divers reconfigured the ship mock up to the end state of the

125
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:00.554
run.

126
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.250
It took so long to get into the suits that it made sense to let us practice the

127
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.680
end of the run.
While we were already down there,

128
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.810
I kept listening to the comm waiting for sal to tell us something else about

129
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:14.900
what was happening with Leonard.
When the divers were ready for us,

130
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.510
we started the run again,
but kept conversation,

131
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:21.440
do the bare minimum required for work.
After I got over my relief,

132
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.260
I had a huge case of what the devil is going on.

133
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.120
I'm in pulled out of training before,
but not an actual NBL run,

134
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.150
not required.
Restarting the entire thing,

135
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.530
which was expensive and an enormous loss of training time.
Heck,

136
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.210
the way the suits were configured,

137
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.770
it took two days just to replace a crew member short of a medical emergency or

138
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:46.820
equipment malfunction,
nothing interrupted and NBL run.

139
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.140
So what would Clemons think was so important that it couldn't wait and why

140
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:52.370
weren't they telling us?

141
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.150
The lift out of the MDLS pool took ages as my helmet breach the surface of the

142
00:08:58.261 --> 00:08:59.160
water,
the stand,

143
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:02.340
I was strapped to supported the hundred and 40 kilograms of my suit.

144
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.270
Trying to walk and a full suit in earth.
Gravity is not possible.

145
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.510
Even just the bottoms are like,
well,

146
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.690
it's like wearing diapers in a snow suit made of lead.

147
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.220
The robot in lost in space had more grace than we did.

148
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.370
I hung in the dawning stand as a swarm of suit.

149
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:23.580
Tex helped us to disrobe when you want answers,

150
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.650
everything seems to take longer and waited for my soup tech to remove the tools

151
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.460
and tethers and like leg weights.
As much as I wanted to rush her,

152
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:36.960
everything had to be done in sequence.
On the other side of the donning stand,
ah,

153
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:41.190
fail was going through the same slow careful extraction from his space suit.

154
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.380
It was like my suit tech was moving underwater as she opened the valve on the

155
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:50.070
side to depressurize the space suit down to below one.
Sure.

156
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:53.940
I can talk now and she could hear me along with everyone else listening on my

157
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:55.920
coms,
my suit tech,

158
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:59.040
but her hands on the release of my gloves breathe out.

159
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.840
I exhaled is the remaining bit of Delta pressure popped released when she popped

160
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:06.450
the glove.
It wasn't likely that I would blow out a lung,

161
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:11.451
but over precautions where the ISC stock and trade the suit settled around me as

162
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:16.580
she pulled the glove away.
Then finally she reached for the helmet.
The moment I,

163
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.290
it was off,
I asked her what's going on.

164
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.100
She glanced over her shoulder at the control room.

165
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.410
We were told to get you cleaned up as fast as possible.
It's the FBI.

166
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.730
<v 3>Thanks for that reading.
Sure.
Um,
so,
uh,</v>

167
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:41.820
one of the first questions I wanted to ask you about since this was,
uh,

168
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.020
looking back at kind of an alternate history of the space race,

169
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.520
um,
how much research did you end up doing?
Um,

170
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.020
what was your favorite bit of research and was there a piece that just didn't

171
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:55.854
make the cut?
Okay.

172
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.530
<v 1>Oh,
um,
so researching,</v>

173
00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:02.000
this was a lot of reading autobiographies.
Uh,

174
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.780
I focused mostly on the mercury and Apollo era.
Uh,

175
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.400
and then also I looked at,
uh,
the WASPS,

176
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:12.900
the women Air Force or the Women Air Service pilots from World War II.

177
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.610
Um,
so those were kind of the primary areas of,

178
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.990
of book research.

179
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.890
The other thing that I did was that I lined up some topic experts.

180
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.780
So I had,
um,
I had,
uh,
Steven grenade.
I intro,
uh,

181
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.380
used him as my science consultant for the whole thing.
He read the entire book.

182
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.560
He's a,
does rocket science.
He does robotics.
Uh,
he was a chemistry major,

183
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.560
like,
um,
Nasa Goddard,
he's,
he's done all of that.
Uh,

184
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.860
then I also had a couple of astronauts Chell Lindgren,
um,

185
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.420
who was in the one who invited me to the NBL and Katie Coleman,
um,

186
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.110
who's a shuttle era astronaut and an actual lady astronaut.
Uh,

187
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.990
she's the one who gave me a lot of the details about having to put the padding

188
00:11:55.991 --> 00:12:00.340
around the hips in the NBL,
which is something the guys don't have to do.
Um,

189
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.640
and uh,
and then also had people,
um,
like I had a,
uh,

190
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.740
Judaism a consultant,
um,

191
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.300
because my main character is Jewish and I am not.
Uh,
so it was a,
lots of,

192
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.300
lots of that sort of reading.
Um,

193
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.690
one of the things that I would say was kind of surprising was I was,

194
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.050
I was aware of the mercury 13 and kind of like very loose.

195
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:32.020
Like I think someone has mentioned something about it at some point,
uh,

196
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.280
but I didn't actually know really anything about them.
Um,

197
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.310
and so the mercury 13 where people who were women who were put through the,

198
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.920
uh,
the mercury testing program,
um,
to see how women performed and the roof,

199
00:12:45.921 --> 00:12:48.670
some of the things that I was surprised by was that we actually performed better

200
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:52.210
than the guys.
Um,
and there are a couple of reasons for that.

201
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:57.040
One is that we tend to be smaller,
but also the way our circulatory system works,

202
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:01.850
partly because designed for carrying babies and things like that we handle g

203
00:13:01.851 --> 00:13:04.930
force is significantly better than men.
The other thing,

204
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:09.670
and this was my favorite thing,
was when they did the stress testing,
um,

205
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.760
all of the women performed better than the men in the stress testing.

206
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:14.980
And the one that I was like,
oh,
well that's why.

207
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.190
And the delightful surprise was one of them was a mother of eight.

208
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.200
So I just imagine her getting into the stress testing and being like,
what?

209
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.030
Oh,
there's unexpected noises going off.
Oh,
okay.

210
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.350
I have to do a complex task while someone is trying to get my attention.

211
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.540
What happens?
Is it nap time now?
I mean,
so,
uh,

212
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:40.750
so I loved that and I,
I do,
I mentioned her in there.

213
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.720
I wanted to actually get her in as a major character and couldn't quite get her

214
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:47.940
in.
Um,
and there were,
there were other things that like,
uh,

215
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.040
one of the things that I really wanted to get into the books that I couldn't

216
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.550
find a spot for,
it was a astronauts do survival training.

217
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.410
So they send them out and they're like,
okay,

218
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:59.590
we're going to drop you in a desert or we're going to drop you in,
you know,

219
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:03.580
in this snow a wasteland.
Uh,
we'll see you in seven days,
but by,

220
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.640
and couldn't,
just,
could not work that in.

221
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:08.890
There was a lot of training stuff that was like,
oh,
I want this.

222
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:13.891
I want this so bad light and no space in space for the mercury pity laugh for

223
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:17.170
the mercury 13,
like,
uh,

224
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.970
what was the sort of conclusion from some of the research or how did they couch

225
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:26.540
like,
Yo,
thanks for showing up,
but like,
no thanks.
Uh,
so,
um,

226
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.860
what happened is they got through the initial testing,

227
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.690
they were getting ready to go into the next stage,

228
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:35.730
which required using some special equipment at NASA.
And,
uh,

229
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.670
went to NASA and NASA went to Lyndon Johnson and he said,
no,

230
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.110
absolutely not.
Uh,
and he,

231
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:46.420
so he drafted a letter saying,
let's shut this thing down.

232
00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:50.710
He never sent the letter.
Um,
what the letter he sent was,
well,

233
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:54.140
of course I'll leave it up to you.
And strangely,

234
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.430
that meant that nothing happened.
Um,

235
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.820
the requirements then for who could become a astronaut shifted so that you had

236
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:09.650
to have a right around in this time.
And I'm sure it's completely coincidental,

237
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.780
um,
that shifted.
So you had to have so many hours as a pilot in command of a jet,

238
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.640
um,
which was something that only people,

239
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.720
military fighter pilots could have.
So it goes on to have,

240
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.510
they go on to have a congressional hearings,

241
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.450
like they fought this to continue the training,
um,

242
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:31.940
and the testing,
and they,

243
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:36.941
they go to congressional hearings and the congressional hearings are basically

244
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.670
lots of things like,
you know,
men go into space,
women,

245
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.260
women take care of the home.
Um,
and,
uh,
and,

246
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:46.700
and other things like,
well,
you know,

247
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:51.140
of course we'd take any woman who met the qualifications and they're like,

248
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.480
right,
right.
So lots of things like that.

249
00:15:56.481 --> 00:16:00.860
And one of the things actually that also came up in those hearings was,
uh,

250
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.220
so John Glenn was there and one of the women was like,
you know,
but,

251
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.380
but you wouldn't have qualified with the,
the,
the,

252
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.310
the,
uh,
the standards that they have now,
because when he qualified,

253
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.230
when they put him in there,
you know,
first,
first orbit,
their first man really,

254
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.590
uh,
uh,
uh,
shepard was the first up,

255
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:26.180
but Glen was the first orbit.
Um,
uh,

256
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.070
when,
when you did that,

257
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.640
they didn't have the requirement for advanced degrees and he got an advanced

258
00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:35.990
degree later.
Um,
but he wouldn't have qualified.
And they're like,
well,

259
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:38.420
you did,
you know,
why,

260
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.510
why not want to look at equivalent things.

261
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.520
And the other thing was that most of the women had more flight time than any of

262
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:50.330
the astronauts did before they went in.
Uh,
because they are service,

263
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.740
the wasps were flying constantly.
They had a lot of them,
I think.

264
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.610
I think all of the mercury 13 had like over a thousand hours of flight time

265
00:16:58.611 --> 00:17:02.480
clocked.
Uh,
it was,
they were very impressive pilots.

266
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.900
<v 3>Um,
so let's take a step back for a second.
So,
uh,</v>

267
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.800
we read that section of the book.
Um,

268
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.210
could you just talk a little bit about why you chose the particular point in

269
00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:17.080
time to start?
Sure.
The series a and,
um,

270
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.060
what were some of the decisions around that?

271
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.940
<v 1>Right.
So the [inaudible] series starts in 1952,
uh,</v>

272
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.840
when I slam a meteor into the Chesapeake bay,

273
00:17:27.841 --> 00:17:32.490
this is not a spoiler.
I literally do this on the first line of the novel.
Um,

274
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.840
so,
uh,
and that's my cusp point.
Uh,
there,

275
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.750
there is actually technically a cusp point before that,

276
00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:42.480
which is that I have Dewey as the president.
Um,

277
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.320
because I needed the space program to be slightly more advanced.
Uh,

278
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:51.350
the reason I chose the 1950s is that this was a at which computers were women.

279
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.040
Um,
that that was if you said computer,
you meant someone who did math.

280
00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.470
Uh,
and mechanical computers were not really,
I mean they,

281
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:05.940
they existed,
but they were definitely far from reliable.

282
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.600
So if you wanted a computer in space at that point it had to be a woman.

283
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.370
And what I was looking at basically was what are the things that would make

284
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:21.240
people change their mind about sending women into space,
um,

285
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.970
giving,
having a task that,

286
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.710
that was defined in that era as a woman's job,
which was computing,

287
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.690
um,
that,
that was one thing,
uh,
making it,
uh,

288
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.250
a,
um,

289
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.350
an extinction level event so that we had to be talking about colonies so that
we,

290
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:42.330
it's like,
you know,
and again,

291
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:44.880
one of the conversations they have in the book is like,
you know,

292
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:49.050
if you want to colony,
you kind of,
there's this component that you need there.

293
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.260
The guys don't house.
Maybe you want to send somebody a onetime colony,
you know.

294
00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:00.530
Um,
so,
uh,
but,
but mostly it was because of the,

295
00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:01.500
the computing.
Okay.

296
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.810
I needed technology to be at a point at which we had the ability to go into

297
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:09.390
space.
But,
um,

298
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.300
but before we had computers,

299
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:16.390
mechanical computers and 1952,
uh,

300
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.060
1952 also,

301
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.293
<v 4>uh,</v>

302
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.130
<v 1>there's a short story that comes before the novels that no one in the universe</v>

303
00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:27.830
of the novels is aware of that.

304
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.820
And for that there needed to be a plot point that it revolved around leap year

305
00:19:31.821 --> 00:19:36.410
and ms calculating something based on leap day and getting to it,

306
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.090
which
no one,
no one in their universe knows about,
but it was,

307
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.270
so that's why it's 1952 specifically and in March 3rd.
Okay.

308
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.233
Um,

309
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.460
<v 3>yeah,
I mean the events of the book takes place in,
you know,</v>

310
00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:56.170
an Arrow that a lot of us are familiar with.
Right.
Um,
and one thing is a reader,

311
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.300
you know,
it is a psi Phi series,

312
00:19:58.301 --> 00:20:01.060
but at the same time like you don't have to spend a lot of time explaining like

313
00:20:01.061 --> 00:20:04.810
magical,
infinite power sources are faster than light travel or other nonsense.

314
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.670
Right.
Um,
how did you make choices about like,
what to go into detail on,

315
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.510
on the sort of like hard Saifai side versus,
you know,
the,

316
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.730
the story elements are the characters.

317
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.790
<v 1>Um,
I am very sneaky about this.
Uh,
so I,
I am,
uh,</v>

318
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.570
like I was an art major in college.
I'm a professional puppeteer.

319
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.600
I read books out loud for a living and,
and write things.
Um,

320
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.560
math is a,

321
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.260
math is a magic system as far as I'm concerned.
You know,

322
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:38.940
it's like people can do amazing things with math and I understand that

323
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.550
intellectually and bully for them.
Um,
so I treated it like a magic system.

324
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.770
One of the things that I did was to set up the rules very clearly and to

325
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:50.190
establish my character's competence right at the beginning.
Uh,

326
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:55.330
there is a scene very early on in which a Elma is trying to calculate the size

327
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:59.140
of the media because it's gone into the Chesapeake Bay.

328
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:01.510
Tried to figure out how big it was,
um,

329
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.360
cause she's trying to prove that the Russians could not have moved it and named

330
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:09.090
it at the,
because it is cold war and right.
Of course.
Um,
so she's trying to,

331
00:21:09.091 --> 00:21:11.800
to demonstrate this and uh,

332
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.240
Steven grenade like gave me this very long email in which he walked me through

333
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.980
how this equate,
I found the equation.
I'm like,

334
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.990
I can tell that this equation does this thing,

335
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.080
but I don't understand any of the things that are actually happening here.

336
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.720
So he did the math,
walked me through it,

337
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.780
and then I just gave that to my characters.

338
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:31.720
And there's a conversation where they're throwing technical terms at each other

339
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.690
and you know how when you're working on something and you'll,

340
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:38.970
you'll just be like,
so,
okay man,
and a number of tools,
uh,

341
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.220
and you just say the occasional words out loud.
Um,

342
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.970
so I have my characters to do that,
which makes them sound super smart

343
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.850
and,
and like all of the math that they're saying out loud is correct.
Right.

344
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:56.470
Um,
and then later I can get away with the saying and then I did the calculations

345
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:58.840
and people are like,
oh,
well she totally knows what the calculations are,

346
00:21:58.841 --> 00:22:02.110
obviously.
Um,
so,

347
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:05.080
so I would explain it enough to establish competence.

348
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:10.060
And then the only other times that I would explain it is if it was something

349
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:15.061
that you needed to know in order to understand something further down the line.

350
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:20.230
Um,
so like the NBL scene is basically establishing a competence in space,

351
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.060
right?
Um,
uh,
and also giving me the,
uh,
you know,

352
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:29.350
it's like this is what a whiff is.
So that later when the Wifi is important,

353
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.580
I don't have to stop and say,
well is incredibly as tense scene is happening.
Oh,

354
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:36.070
whiff by the way is a widget interface now.
Right.

355
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.970
I can't remember what it actually does stand for.
He,
he did tell me later,

356
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.790
but he had to go look it up.
Now.
The first cancer is pretty good.
It is.

357
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:44.590
Which ad interface?
I told him,
I was like,
you know,

358
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:48.490
that's going directly in the book.
He's like,
abort,
abort.
I'm like too late.

359
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.840
<v 3>Yeah.
Well I like that.
Um,</v>

360
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:56.490
in the book a lot of that does feel very natural and like it is introduced like

361
00:22:56.491 --> 00:23:01.140
when it helps the story and uh,
yeah,
it's not,

362
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.560
there's,
there's no sort of longwinded section about like,
oh,

363
00:23:04.561 --> 00:23:07.680
let me geek out on this particular,
yeah.
Detail.
Um,

364
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.820
as a reader I can tell you did a lot of fun research around that,

365
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.050
but it also fits so well into the story and what the characters are up to at any

366
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:16.780
given.

367
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.620
<v 1>Awesome.
Thank you.
That's,
um,
so I find that that is very much about focus.
Like,</v>

368
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.220
just providing it when the character is thinking about it naturally.
Yeah.

369
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.680
<v 3>Um,
so let's,
uh,
let's go back and forward a little bit.
All right.
So,
um,</v>

370
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.700
is it correct that the lady astronaut of Mars was the first piece you did in

371
00:23:34.701 --> 00:23:35.534
this world?

372
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.390
<v 1>No.
Oh,
okay.
Um,
it's the one that I wanted the Hugo for.
Okay.</v>

373
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.680
The first piece that I wanted that I wrote in this world is a story that's

374
00:23:43.681 --> 00:23:45.210
called we interrupt this broadcast.

375
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.630
And this is the one that I said that no one in this universe knows.
Um,
and,

376
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.890
and I wrote something that I called,

377
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.840
I jokingly call this my punch card punk universe.
Um,
uh,
and,

378
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:01.841
and the story is basically a computer engineer who has decided that a society is

379
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.800
going to going nowhere good and that it needs a hard reset.

380
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.660
And,
and the media is actually aimed and targeted,
but he dies in the blast.

381
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.760
So no one in this timeline knows it ever.
It's never going to be a plot point.

382
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.950
No one will ever know it.
As far as everyone in this universe is concerned.

383
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:26.600
It was an act of God.
But that's the first thing that I wrote.
Um,

384
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.380
and then lady astronaut of Mars is the second thing.
Um,

385
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.710
and for that I,
uh,

386
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.470
and that,
that's what prompted these books.
So I knew that she had this backstory.

387
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.420
Um,
but the book,

388
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.520
that story itself came up because I needed to write something for,
um,

389
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.700
an audio anthology called rip off where we took a famous first line and I took

390
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:57.020
the first line of wizard of Oz and then wrote this,
this story.

391
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.680
Um,
and that honestly,

392
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:05.270
the reason I said it in the punch card punk universe for that one was that I had

393
00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:08.960
a deadline and I had this universe already created.
It's a good choice.

394
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.590
So I was like,
well,
I do this additional work when this is just here.

395
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:16.760
And also I like it.
Like,
I like the idea of,
um,

396
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:21.290
what we were able to do in that era.
You know,
the fact that there's,

397
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.520
you know,
the,

398
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.600
my cell phone has more computing power than we had in the entire planet.

399
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.710
Um,
and we sent people to the moon,
like in,

400
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:34.190
in basically these jiffy pop containers.
It's,
it's amazing.

401
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.550
You know,
and,
and all the calculations that were done,
you know.
Right.

402
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.450
Like with people just doing calculations.

403
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.560
So anyway,
so that's,
I don't think that answered your question.

404
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.890
<v 3>No,
no,
no.
That was good.
I clearly have to go back and read the other,</v>

405
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.740
the other piece because I have not read that one yet.
Um,

406
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:56.390
one of the things I love about the lady astronaut Marta's story is it feels very

407
00:25:56.391 --> 00:25:58.960
much like it could be kind of a,

408
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.170
in some ways like a last chapter of like the Martian chronicles or something has

409
00:26:03.171 --> 00:26:07.370
that same vibe.
You bring some Bradbury and later.
Yeah.
Um,

410
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.570
uh,
and you know,
that was me as a fan of that stuff.

411
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:12.770
I was very excited about that.

412
00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:16.580
But also it sets up this really rich world with so little,

413
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.760
like it is a very short story and it like has a really,

414
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:23.630
really powerful arc to it,
but it also is not heavy on detail.

415
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.710
Like it sets up just enough so that you can connect the dots and kind of nowhere

416
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.000
that,
you know,

417
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:31.700
how we count there are how the readers have those characters got there.

418
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.080
But then also when the,
um,
the first novel came out,
uh,

419
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.430
knowing that since that is set farther in the future,
then the first novel,

420
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.650
like I instantly cared a lot about those characters too.

421
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.190
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm so,</v>

422
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:48.940
I'm so glad that you felt the Bradbury vibe because that was actually a very,

423
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.600
that was something I thought of it as my own monster Bradbury when I was writing

424
00:26:52.601 --> 00:26:56.800
it.
I'm like,
I want,
I want the Martian chronicles,
but with,

425
00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.420
with more women,
um,
solid choice.
Yeah.
Yeah.

426
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.010
Uh,
and then it's basically,
it's like I,

427
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.300
I the the novels or I would like the Martian chronicles,

428
00:27:07.301 --> 00:27:12.040
but with more women and people of Color,
please.
Um,
and,
uh,

429
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.760
just not all white dudes all the time.
It's,
um,
but I,

430
00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.970
one of the things that was interesting about coming back to write to the,

431
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.280
um,
to write this original,
uh,
the,
the,

432
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:31.370
was figuring out,
you know,
it's,
uh,
there,

433
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.160
there's a 40 year gap between them.
Um,

434
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.840
so trying to figure out who Elma was,
who Nathaniel was.

435
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.240
One of the things that I knew going back was that I,

436
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.970
I wanted their relationship to always be rock solid.

437
00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.540
Like I did not want the marriage to ever be in jeopardy,
uh,

438
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.640
partly because I hate that trope a lot.
The,
Oh no,
we fight,

439
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:56.170
let me go and break up.
No,
no.
Were deeply in love again.
I'm like,
well,

440
00:27:56.171 --> 00:28:00.730
that's not predictable.
Um,
so I,
I didn't want to do that.

441
00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.230
Uh,
so I thought about those things,
um,
and,

442
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.010
and kind of how she would get there,
uh,
over that time.
Um,

443
00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.840
and also,
you know,
like how,

444
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.530
how do you become the lady astronaut of Mars?

445
00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:19.090
Like how does that become your name?
What,
what happened?

446
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.160
<v 3>Yeah,
as a moniker.
It's a solid Monica.
It is,
it's pretty good.
Um,
yeah,</v>

447
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:26.910
it was also fun in the bookstore to see a really,
uh,
exciting,

448
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:31.650
solid married couple as well.
And there's a lot of fun in that relationship.
Um,

449
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.350
and uh,
yeah,
as a longtime married person,
I was like,
oh yeah.
Well,
it's good.

450
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:41.260
Anyway.
Um,
so you have also written to,
you're not exclusively a Scifi writer,

451
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:45.930
correct?
Um,
you've written in,
uh,
several different styles and genres.

452
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.350
Um,
how do you think about what story is right?

453
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:53.190
Or do you start with your story idea?
Do you start with a setting?

454
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:54.720
Like could you just talk a little bit about your [inaudible]?

455
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.210
<v 1>Yeah,
so it varies from story to story.</v>

456
00:28:59.211 --> 00:29:01.940
Sometimes they'll come into it and uh,
like I know the world,

457
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.710
I know the setting and I have to find the character.

458
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.980
Sometimes I know the character and I need to figure out the world around them.

459
00:29:06.981 --> 00:29:11.960
Or I have just like a scene that I,
I know that I want to write.
Um,

460
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.590
and so,
so then it's finding the other pieces of it.

461
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.050
A lot of times we liken this to gardening,
um,

462
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.080
but in terms of whether I do science fiction or fantasy,
um,

463
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.800
these are for me,
I think of them very much as set dressing.
Um,

464
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.310
so there,
there are,

465
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.620
there's some stories that have a specific inherent structure like heist stories

466
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.240
have a specific inherent structure.
Romances have a specific inherent structure,

467
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.280
but set the,
the science fiction fantasy.
These are,

468
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.630
these are the set dressing.

469
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.840
This is the layer that goes on top of that structure because you can have a

470
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:54.250
science fiction story that is a hardcore romance and you can also have one

471
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:56.530
that's a heist novel.
Same with same with fantasy.

472
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.870
So what I tend to do is,
um,
I think about,

473
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.990
uh,
the,
the interstitial layers,
the stuff that,

474
00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:08.380
the connecting tissue because what I find booth things do the science fiction

475
00:30:08.381 --> 00:30:11.790
and the fantasy is they allow me to take the natural world,
tip it to the sides.

476
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.240
I can see all that connective tissue.

477
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.890
And then it also allows me to explore things that I am thinking about from the

478
00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:19.450
real world,
uh,

479
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.470
and it allows me to talk about them without all of the emotional baggage so I

480
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:25.510
can approach them much more as a thought experiment,

481
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.190
which then also allows my readers to engage with it more naturally.

482
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.980
So what I look for then is kind of what,

483
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.300
what scenic design is going to support that.
It's,

484
00:30:35.301 --> 00:30:38.110
it's very much the same process I go through when I'm designing a show.

485
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:41.320
It's like,
what is the aesthetic and that is going to serve this?

486
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:45.280
Is this a story that's going to be served by something that's darker and

487
00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:48.820
Grittier?
Um,
is this a story that you know,

488
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.240
the mechanics are going to serve?
Um,
do I,

489
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.310
do I feel like I really need,

490
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.310
I really need communication to be a difficult thing,

491
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.210
in which case a fantasy is going to work for me much better than science
fiction.

492
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.910
Like all of the things from like,
why didn't you just call them on a cell phone?

493
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.590
The number of that,
the difficulty and disabling cell phones,

494
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.110
like in removing communication,
that is like one of the,

495
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:14.260
the number one problems with writing science fiction today.

496
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.410
It's like you have why,
why are you just not instantaneous communication?
Yeah.

497
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.780
Yeah.
It's always like having to put people in Fairday boxes.
Um,

498
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.790
so,
uh,
so,
so I look at that kind of thing.
Okay.

499
00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.740
<v 3>Um,
so you,
uh,
so,
uh,</v>

500
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.480
calculating stars and faded sky are the two most recent novels.
Um,

501
00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.580
we were talking about it earlier.
Uh,

502
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.340
you didn't intend it to be two novels originally,
right?
Yeah,

503
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.370
<v 1>no.
Uh,</v>

504
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:47.230
my plan with this was to write a single novel,
um,

505
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.380
which I had just titled to the Lady Astronaut Book,

506
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.580
had no idea what it was gonna be.
There was a point where it was artimus one,

507
00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:59.170
like ridiculous.
We went through 20 titles for this.
I'm not kidding.

508
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.273
Um,

509
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.990
but what happened was that my idea had been that I was going to structure it as

510
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:09.400
three novellas because the lady astronaut of Mars was a novella and I was like,

511
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.850
I was structured is three linkedin novellas to mimic the structure of lady

512
00:32:12.851 --> 00:32:15.650
astronauts on Mars.
Um,
and I,

513
00:32:15.651 --> 00:32:20.170
it part one of calculating stores is that first novella more or less untouched.

514
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.280
And I got,
I was,
I'd finished part two and was starting part three and it just,

515
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.810
it felt awful.
Uh,

516
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:31.890
and what I realized was happening was that I was having to skip emotional beats

517
00:32:33.461 --> 00:32:37.390
in the second and the villa in order to save them for the third one.

518
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.100
So I didn't have repetition points.

519
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:44.390
And the other thing was that people read short fiction for a different thing

520
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:47.990
than they read novels for like people read short fiction for kind of a swift

521
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:52.940
emotional punch to the gut and people read novels for immersion and structuring

522
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:53.870
it is three novellas.

523
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:56.540
If I had actually published them as three independent Novellas,

524
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:57.500
I think I would have been fine.

525
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:00.020
I think it would have been able to hit all of the things I wanted to hit.

526
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.510
But because it was a novel form,

527
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:05.840
I was having to skip the immersion aspect of it.
I'm like,

528
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:10.070
this is not going to be satisfying for a novel reader.
Uh,

529
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.830
because reading these back to back like this,
uh,

530
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:15.440
so I went to my editor and I'm like,
as I said,

531
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:17.930
all of those things and um,

532
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.240
they were great and they let me split it into two books,

533
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:21.920
which allowed me to unpack everything.

534
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.740
So that part two is significantly more robust.

535
00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:28.130
I was able to do a lot more of the training stuff that it was going to have to

536
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.980
that in the original one I had to skip.
Um,

537
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.150
and then could really unpack the third one to include a lot again training and

538
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:39.070
some additional things,
uh,
that otherwise I just would have had to,

539
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.580
to skip in order to have that quick in that you would have for,
for an Avella.

540
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.930
Okay.
Um,

541
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.880
and you've had some exciting news recently on the new books front,
right?
Yes.

542
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:52.820
So we have more lady astronaut.
Yes.
Uh,

543
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:56.420
we just sold three new novels to tour.

544
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.280
Thank you very much.
And it's a six figure deal,
which I'm extremely excited by.

545
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:07.020
Thank you.
It's my first,
it's very exciting.
Uh,
and,

546
00:34:07.021 --> 00:34:09.950
and thank you.
Thank you for the,
uh,
the sympathy clap there.
Um,

547
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.280
um,
uh,
as I do humble brags up here,
uh,

548
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.240
but thank you.
I appreciate it.
Um,
uh,

549
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.670
for those of you who watch good place,
I'm totally Tahani.
Uh,

550
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.580
oh,
fork.
Yeah.
Um,
so the,
uh,

551
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.470
so the first book,

552
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:34.920
or I should say the third book is called the relentless moon.
Uh,

553
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.000
that'll come out in 2020.
I have to turn it in in June.
Um,

554
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.530
which I'm exhilarated and terrified by.
Um,
uh,

555
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.120
but that one,
um,
is a parallel novel to the faded sky.

556
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:51.590
So it's taking place wildly while everybody,
the faded sky,

557
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.500
again,
I don't feel like this is a spoiler.

558
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.180
If you look at the cover and you know that the books are coming from a series

559
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.890
began with the lady astronaut of Mars,
the fact that they are going to Mars,
um,

560
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.400
and it's a red cover of someone's standing on the surface of Mars.

561
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.210
I feel like a surprise.

562
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:16.880
So safe bet there.
Anyway,
um,
so this takes place a while.

563
00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:20.870
The first Mars expedition is going on.
Um,
and uh,

564
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.330
it focuses on Nicole Worgen and myrtle,
uh,

565
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.860
Lindholm who are two of the side characters in the first book,

566
00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:32.270
a first and second book.
And then,
um,
basically it's like,
hello,

567
00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:35.570
we are on the moon and we're trying to establish a life here in bridge parties

568
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:39.930
are difficult cause there's the gravity is so low and oh no sabotage.

569
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.380
Um,
so it's,
it's much more in the,
uh,

570
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.230
it's going to have a little bit more of a thriller vein and then some of the

571
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:50.340
other ones.
Um,
and then,
uh,
in 2021,

572
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:54.630
we have a non lady astronaut book,
which is the spare man,
uh,

573
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.000
which is basically,
if anyone's seen the thin man movies.

574
00:35:57.001 --> 00:36:00.870
It's basically the thin man in space.
It's an interstellar cruise ship.

575
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.530
It's a locked room,
murder mystery,
happily married couple and their dog,

576
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.010
Astra.
Thank you.
Someone has,

577
00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:15.990
what's the thin man movies and knows Latin.
Um,
and uh,

578
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.590
and then,
uh,
in 2022,

579
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:23.440
which does not sound like a real date at all.
Uh,

580
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.600
we will have the derivative base which picks up,
uh,

581
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.630
after the close of faded sky and it's Elma Nathaniel again.
Awesome.

582
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:36.030
<v 3>Yeah,
congrats again.
Thanks.
It's big news.
I'm super excited by it.</v>

583
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:40.180
Yeah.
So,
uh,
I wanna talk a little bit about,
um,

584
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.860
some of the other stuff around being an author now.
Yeah.
Right.
So,

585
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:49.880
uh,
people probably still have some notion of the author as like,

586
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.210
you know,
locked in a writing cabin in the woods somewhere.

587
00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.550
<v 1>Not Inaccurate,</v>

588
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.860
<v 3>but you know,
you as a modern author and especially with popular fiction,
right?</v>

589
00:36:59.861 --> 00:37:02.560
Like you have a lot of interaction with people like

590
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:03.700
<v 1>yeah,</v>

591
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.180
<v 3>probably partly as an obligation and partly for fun.
Um,</v>

592
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.280
can you talk a little bit about how you balanced

593
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.390
<v 1>outlet?
Yeah,</v>

594
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:14.450
so one of the interesting things about being an author is that the interaction

595
00:37:14.451 --> 00:37:18.220
with the public has always been part of the game.
Like the reason that,
uh,

596
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:23.060
Charles Dickens became so popular and Mark Twain was actually because they did

597
00:37:23.061 --> 00:37:26.930
public readings all the time.
So that was a,
that was a lot of what drove their,

598
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.730
their fame and fortune.
Um,
so that,
that audience engagement,

599
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.250
it kind of is always there.
It's just,

600
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.940
it's so much easier now and harder all at the same time.

601
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.850
Um,
so I spend a surprising amount of time on the road,
things that they,

602
00:37:43.851 --> 00:37:44.930
you do not,

603
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.710
they don't tell you when you sign these standard rich and famous contract that

604
00:37:48.711 --> 00:37:51.860
you are going to have to be.
Thank you for the people who watch the muppets.

605
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.340
Um,
so you,
you kind of travel all the time.

606
00:37:58.341 --> 00:38:02.420
So I'm like right now I've been home for two weeks.

607
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.830
Um,
before that I was,
had been on the road for 20 days.

608
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:11.831
I had been home for a day before that and then two weeks prior to that,

609
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.880
three days home.
And it's like,
this year has just kind of been like that.

610
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.370
And uh,

611
00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:25.340
it is partly in a,
partly my own fault because I,
I will say yes,

612
00:38:25.341 --> 00:38:26.600
I'd love to come do that thing.

613
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.500
I'm also partly because I have a couple of different careers running in tandem,

614
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:33.920
but,
um,
the thing that,

615
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.380
the thing that's nice about it is that you actually can have a career without

616
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.910
doing that in theory,
um,
through,
through the Internet,
uh,

617
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.470
which is both good and bad.
Like when I,
when I go to an event,

618
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.810
um,
the people who attend,

619
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.550
there's a certain buyin that they have to do to just show up.
So,

620
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.870
uh,
everybody that I'm interacting with is generally very pleasant.
You know,

621
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:03.871
I've had the occasional stalker but not terrible compared to some friends,

622
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.690
um,
on the Internet.
Uh,

623
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.550
I will have trolls come at me for reasons.

624
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.120
Um,
and,
and as far as I can tell,
it's just,
you know,

625
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.050
cause they felt like at that day.
Um,

626
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.310
and it's,
it,
it is interesting trying to,

627
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.200
that balancing act of um,
wanting to be present,
wanting to engage,

628
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:34.090
uh,
and also needing to,
uh,
preserve aspects of self.

629
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.570
So the thing that I talk about is that mostly what I think about is,
um,

630
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.640
it's not that I put on a persona,

631
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:44.170
but that I decide which parts of my life are public and which parts of my life

632
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:46.930
at private.
Like I've rarely talk about my family.

633
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:54.280
Uh,
and one of the things,
or when I do,
it's always just bragging about them.
Um,

634
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.990
one of the things we were talking about at lunch was,
um,

635
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.550
that I had had shingles,
uh,
during this 20 days of travel.

636
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.000
Um,
and I,

637
00:40:05.001 --> 00:40:09.460
I did not want to talk about it because as soon as you talk about anything

638
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:14.440
health related on the Internet,
everyone will give you advice.
Like,
everyone,

639
00:40:14.441 --> 00:40:18.130
I have a handout,
we'll have you tried.
I think at this point in my life,

640
00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:20.950
I know how to deal with a hangout.
Like,
it seemed like a sensible adult,
you know,

641
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:22.890
I try.
Um,

642
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.380
but I also had to cancel things and I didn't want to just be like,
Oh,

643
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:29.140
I'm just canceling things.
So,
you know,
and I didn't want people to go,

644
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.540
she's canceling things.
Is She dying?

645
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.980
Because they will also go there because in fairness that is,
you know,

646
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:40.750
has happened.
Uh,
so unfortunately,
um,

647
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:44.500
so,
so,
you know,
trying to decide how much to talk about.

648
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.820
So like I'll tell people I had shingles.
I do not talk about,
actually no,

649
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:52.360
in that blog post,
I did talk about the degree of pain that I was in.
Um,

650
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:53.290
but I talked about that.

651
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.500
What I tried to do was talk about it in terms of here's a learning experience

652
00:40:56.501 --> 00:41:01.300
for you.
The show does not have to go on,
don't use my public tiers,
work ethic,

653
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.420
take care of yourself,
be healthy.
Um,

654
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:09.820
and so it's learning to couch things in and shift them so that I maintain

655
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:13.900
control of the conversation.
Uh,
which is,
um,

656
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.310
which I'm very grateful for having years of theater before.

657
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.050
Like I learned all of this from dealing with third graders.
Excellent.

658
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.140
Um,
so your uh,
you know,
uh,
there's a lot of uh,

659
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.770
uh,
looking back at the events of the past and the most recent novels,
right,

660
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:33.980
with

661
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.980
<v 3>a modern lens and from the perspective of people struggling through that era.</v>

662
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.530
Right.
Um,
how has the reception been to that?

663
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.850
Or has that sort of like attracted some of the more unsavory fan elements

664
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.590
because you know,

665
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:52.620
you are criticizing some of their golden ideas or

666
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:57.870
<v 1>you know,
whatever nonsense yeah.
Up the thing,
the thing that uh,</v>

667
00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:03.300
like when people complain about these books,
for the most part it has been very,

668
00:42:03.301 --> 00:42:06.720
very positive.
I have to say a really super positive and,

669
00:42:06.721 --> 00:42:11.721
and one of the things I do deal with sexism and racism,

670
00:42:11.731 --> 00:42:13.320
I deal with mental health issues,

671
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.720
but at the same time I feel like it's not so much it like in my head I'm not,

672
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.560
I'm writing a book about these things.
I'm not,
I'm writing a book about space,

673
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:24.990
but I'm not ignoring those things.

674
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.260
And that because so many books do we ignore them.

675
00:42:28.261 --> 00:42:31.230
I think that that's what makes it feel like they are very,
very present.

676
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.740
These are things that affects the way characters move through the world.

677
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.460
And so I'm letting it affect the way that they move through the world,

678
00:42:38.461 --> 00:42:41.700
but I'm not like,
for the most part,

679
00:42:41.701 --> 00:42:45.450
they aren't one of those like one or two places where it's a plot point.

680
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.840
But for the most part it's like this is,
you know,

681
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.450
this is the way they move through the world.
Um,

682
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:55.480
sexism is a plot point for Elma because it's a plot point for me.
You know,

683
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.310
I get,
um,

684
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.340
when I was vice president of Sif was science fiction and fantasy writers of

685
00:43:02.341 --> 00:43:06.060
America and John Scalzi was president.
I got the hate mail.
He didn't,

686
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.950
um,
it's not that he didn't get any,
but I would get the,
the majority of it.

687
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.320
So,
um,
so it's just,
it's like,
it just affects the way you move through the world.

688
00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:19.950
So I was dealing with those things.
So when people complain about it,

689
00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.480
what they complain about is,
Oh,
she's shoehorning in the social issues.
I'm like,

690
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.670
no,
really not.
That's just daily life.
Um,
that's,

691
00:43:29.671 --> 00:43:33.150
that's the complaint that I'll get.
The other one that I'll get is a Elma.

692
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.530
The main character has,
um,
social anxiety disorder.
So,
you know,

693
00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:41.010
she's in a plane and it's going down and she's totally fine.

694
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.400
You ask her to speak to a room full of people and she's like,
no,

695
00:43:44.401 --> 00:43:48.870
I clearly do not have social anxiety disorder,
um,
theater,

696
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.530
although there are a lot of people in theater who do.
Um,

697
00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.990
but,
uh,
but what it,
what I would get,

698
00:43:57.991 --> 00:44:00.900
the other push back that I'll get is I don't believe that someone,
you know,

699
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.930
who gets this subset about talking to people,
like,

700
00:44:03.931 --> 00:44:06.210
no one gets that upset about it.
I'm like,
yeah,
actually.

701
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:10.470
And what I have found is that people with anxiety disorders are the best people

702
00:44:10.471 --> 00:44:15.390
in crises because they're like,
what?
Stress Hormones.
Come on,
bring it.
I got this.

703
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:16.710
Totally.
That's my daily life.

704
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.560
<v 3>So one more question and then I think we've got time for Q.
And.
A.</v>

705
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.350
I'm sort of on that topic of like working through a challenge.
Um,

706
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:30.390
earlier we were also talking about like how you approach writing as sort of a,

707
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.010
uh,
a as well as,

708
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.000
<v 1>uh,
uh,
you know,
a creative endeavor.
Right.
Um,
uh,</v>

709
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.860
could you talk a little bit about how you view that and how it related to any of

710
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:42.330
your work?
Sure.

711
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.870
So because I come at it from theater where,
uh,
you,

712
00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.250
you couldn't wait for the Muse to arrive.
It's like if I'm creating something,

713
00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:51.750
if I'm designing something,
I have to,

714
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:55.380
I have to be able to produce on a deadline because I,
um,

715
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.290
I put other people,
put other people's schedule behind it.

716
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.060
It's not a good team player thing to do.

717
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.440
So I had to learn to be creative on demand and uh,

718
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:09.630
and I also have depression.
Um,

719
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.490
so one of the things that I've learned is that,
um,

720
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:19.230
I can work through the three depression,
but it's incredibly difficult.

721
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.550
And like the,
the,
the,
the whole create,
you know,

722
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:27.450
the creator as the depressed genius.
It's like,
I just,

723
00:45:27.451 --> 00:45:28.530
every time that one comes up,

724
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:32.280
I get stabby because what happens for me is that my,

725
00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.190
my productivity just crashes and Burns.
And,

726
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.990
and I mentioned briefly at lunch,
uh,
forest of memory,
which is,

727
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:43.680
um,
a novella that was on tour.com.
Um,

728
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.810
I wrote that during like the worst depressive episode that I have had.

729
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.070
Um,
I had like my,
my grandmother had died,
my cat had died unexpectedly,

730
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:57.600
like right after that,
uh,
another multiple deaths,
like right in a row,

731
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:01.210
a whole bunch of other things,
chemical imbalance,
all of that.
And,

732
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.930
and upon realizing finally what was happening to me,

733
00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:08.250
this was the episode that finally made me admitted that I had depression and had

734
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:11.550
it all my life.
I'm in the middle of that.

735
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:16.000
I was trying to drop everything and there was this one anthology,
um,

736
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.250
Megatropolis Cascadia and uh,

737
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:25.280
my friend Jay Lake was the editor and it was the second book in a shared World

738
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.180
Anthology.
So replacing me was already going to be difficult.
Uh,

739
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:34.860
and Jay was in the process of dying from colon cancer.

740
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.980
Like these were,
he was terminal.
Um,

741
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.590
there was no way I was going to back out of this.
Like,

742
00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:44.340
really this was not something I could do to my friend.

743
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.990
So that meant that I just had to write it and I crafted my way through that

744
00:46:48.991 --> 00:46:52.860
story and people read it and they can't tell at the end of the day,

745
00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:57.300
it's because I understand my craft because I understand audience storytelling

746
00:46:57.301 --> 00:47:01.710
structure.
But I wrote that like there were some days that I wrote it.

747
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.530
I could only write three sentences.
That was my bargain with myself.

748
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:07.560
I'm like three sentences.
You can do three sentences a day.

749
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:11.610
And there's some days where I would catch fire and I could go longer.

750
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:14.670
And other days where I would write three sentences and there are a couple of

751
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.820
days where the three sentences were,
I hate everything.
I'm tired,

752
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:22.720
I'm going to bed.
But I sat down and I wrote them.
Um,
and,

753
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.760
and for me this is important because while I,

754
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.480
I can write that way,
but I don't enjoy it.

755
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.720
And my feeling now is if I am not writing and not loving it,

756
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.370
like if,
if I am dealing with depression,
um,

757
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:44.890
unless there is a really serious reason that I need to push through that,

758
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.960
that it is better for me to take care of myself and to go and,

759
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.450
and have some,
you know,
and,

760
00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:55.270
and do self care and then come back to it when writing is,

761
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.770
there's still joy there because honestly,

762
00:47:56.771 --> 00:48:01.240
we don't get paid enough to write when it's not fun.
Even with a six figure deal,

763
00:48:01.241 --> 00:48:04.570
it's like spread out over multiple years.
Um,

764
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.060
but it is good to know that I can,
that,

765
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.320
that the,

766
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:15.670
the time that I've put in learning my craft allows me to actually do this thing.

767
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.260
Um,
so it is,
it's,
you know,

768
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:21.401
it's kind of boast.

769
00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:25.660
It's like one of the things that I try to pay attention to when I start bogging

770
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:26.494
down is like,

771
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:30.790
am I bogging down because there's a problem with the story or my bogging down

772
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:35.680
because of something external.
And,
you know,
one of the,
you,

773
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.470
you handle those in different ways.
Sure.
Well Great.
Thank you.
Um,

774
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.320
so,
uh,
first off,
let's give a round of applause.

775
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:50.730
Thank you.
Thank you.
Um,
so we have a Mike over here.
Uh,

776
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.860
so we have time for questions.
We have like 14,

777
00:48:53.861 --> 00:48:58.270
13 minutes and I will answer questions about anything.

778
00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.440
So if you want to know,

779
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.900
like we didn't talk about puppetry or if you want to know about puppetry,

780
00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:04.320
if you want to know about regency underwear,
uh,

781
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.970
if you want to know about going to NASA and the NBL,

782
00:49:06.971 --> 00:49:10.810
if you want to know about trying on a space helmet,
um,
anything,

783
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:13.840
I'll talk about depression,
anything.

784
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:16.570
I will also just sit here and stare at you awkwardly.

785
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.490
I'd like to hear about more than a dozen typewriters.
Ah,
yes,

786
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:24.250
we have more than a dozen typewriters.
So I,

787
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.730
we have 19 manual typewriters.
Uh,
first of all,

788
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:32.710
I do not recommend that you collect typewriters.
They are heavy when you move.

789
00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:37.720
Uh,
they are very heavy.
Um,
all of your friends hate you if you have those.
But,

790
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.360
uh,
our early earliest typewriter is a Blickenstaff surfer,
uh,

791
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.360
which is a typewriter from 1890,

792
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.890
or I think ours is 1893 model our 1894.
Anyway.

793
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.880
Um,
but it has a rotary head and it's not a Cordy keyboard.

794
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:55.990
And this cool thing about the rotary head is you,
you remember the IBM Selectrix,

795
00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:01.270
um,
this predates and IBM Selectric by 70 years and uh,

796
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:05.260
and has a rotary head.
You can replace it to change the type font.
Really,

797
00:50:05.261 --> 00:50:07.120
really cool.
Um,

798
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.510
and my favorite is the corona number three,

799
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:15.820
which was the typewriter that Hemingway took.
A I don't like,
I don't have his,

800
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.440
that would be awesome.
Um,
but,
uh,
the,

801
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.470
it's the typewriter that he used when he was doing more reporting in the first

802
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:27.740
world war and it's a folding typewriter.
So it's this thing,

803
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:32.410
it's like about that big footprint,
um,
weighs about three pounds a,

804
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:36.710
there's an aluminum one that's just stupidly light.
Uh,

805
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:41.510
and then the,
the top flips back and forth.
Um,
I have,

806
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:46.100
uh,
I have a,
the corona number three special,

807
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.070
which is forest green.
It's beautiful.

808
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.670
And it has the extended keyboard that has mathematical functions on it.

809
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.593
It's very cool.

810
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.780
I will not give you a rundown of all of the typewriters probably.

811
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:05.840
Does having 19 of them help you write faster?
You know,
it is.
Uh,
no.
Um,

812
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.410
but I will actually bring out the typewriter to write some times,
uh,

813
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.690
because it changes the rhythms with which you rate.

814
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.920
And there are times when just changing the medium of communication is enough to

815
00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:19.300
shake the story idea loose or um,
or,

816
00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.580
or you want that rhythm because with a manual typewriter,

817
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:24.920
because you have to hit the carriage return at the end GVH line.

818
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:27.980
There's a moment where you were doing a little composition at the end of each

819
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:29.960
line and then when you have to change the paper,

820
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:33.190
there's another moment of composition.
So it does completely change the way,

821
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.520
right?
Yeah.

822
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.750
<v 5>I saw you at American writer's museum.
Oh yeah.
Pretty sure.</v>

823
00:51:37.751 --> 00:51:42.480
You gave this anecdote from your research where you found out that the,

824
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:48.180
the voice for computer and star trek is really modeled very much.

825
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.750
That was really surprising to me and I didn't,
but it actually,
it makes sense.

826
00:51:52.751 --> 00:51:54.820
Can you say more about that and what you've learned?
Sure.

827
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.350
Found that bit of information.
Yeah.

828
00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:00.600
<v 1>All right.
So I am,
um,
some of this is me extrapolating,</v>

829
00:52:00.601 --> 00:52:03.270
so let's,
let's be clear.
Uh,

830
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.800
so one of the interesting things about computer voices in the United States is

831
00:52:07.801 --> 00:52:12.770
that they tend by and large to be women.
Uh,
and we,
we know that the,

832
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:16.190
the people who,
um,
you know,
the people who have,
like with,

833
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:20.670
with Siri and Alexa and these other things that people have said very

834
00:52:20.671 --> 00:52:21.481
specifically,

835
00:52:21.481 --> 00:52:25.650
that they were thinking about the computer on Star Trek when they decide when

836
00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:28.410
they assigned to the female voice and when they were thinking about it.

837
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:33.450
What's interesting is that,
you know,
Star Trek,
California,

838
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.660
Jpl,
jet propulsion laboratory.

839
00:52:36.661 --> 00:52:39.210
So if you're doing research on space travel,

840
00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:42.530
JPL is the closest place that you're going to be able to go.
Uh,

841
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.890
when star trek was coming out,

842
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:49.140
JPL had a policy that the only people they hired for the computer department

843
00:52:49.141 --> 00:52:51.750
were women.
They did not hire him in as a policy.

844
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:57.190
Um,
so,
and,
and from early,
early days.

845
00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.220
So the computer voices,

846
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.360
so that means that you've got this room full of men at a launch.
Uh,

847
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.440
and someone will say,

848
00:53:05.441 --> 00:53:08.890
computer give us the philosophy and this one lone woman's voice will come out

849
00:53:08.891 --> 00:53:12.880
and answer.
When you look at Germany,

850
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.440
<v 2>yeah,</v>

851
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.600
<v 1>their computer voices tend to be male.</v>

852
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:22.420
When you look at their early space program,
their computers tended to be men.

853
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:27.180
Now I don't know that there a,
I mean I have,
I have correlation,

854
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:28.710
which is not the same as causation,

855
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.760
but there certainly seems to be a pattern there where it looks very much like

856
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:34.770
life or you know,

857
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.250
art imitating life imitating art again.

858
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.100
So I find this back and forth really fascinating.

859
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:46.220
So I have a daughter who I still the scar from and I was telling you about 'em

860
00:53:46.221 --> 00:53:49.190
and she's in a girl scout group that's focused,

861
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:53.870
they're doing this lego robotics focused on space exploration.

862
00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.700
And I would love to hear your thoughts on like a topic that would be,
you know,

863
00:53:58.701 --> 00:54:02.720
as you did all this research,
what would be an interesting topic that,

864
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:05.030
especially a group of girls,
you know,

865
00:54:05.031 --> 00:54:09.980
and kind of those dynamics with all those challenges that were there early on.

866
00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:14.690
What would be an interesting topic for them to pick as a research project?

867
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.000
So it's interesting,

868
00:54:17.001 --> 00:54:20.710
one of the things that you make me think about when you ask that is,
um,

869
00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.430
that when I was researching this,

870
00:54:22.431 --> 00:54:26.940
I watched a number of episodes of Mr Wizzard from the 1950s.
Uh,

871
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:31.690
and then I also wound up watching some of the reboot,
uh,
that the,

872
00:54:31.691 --> 00:54:35.840
the later reboot from the 70s and there was one in the 80s as well.

873
00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.630
And the interesting thing is that the one in the 80s,

874
00:54:38.631 --> 00:54:42.170
all of the science that they're having the girls do is very gendered.
It's like,

875
00:54:42.171 --> 00:54:45.770
let's see about,
you know,
the science of lipstick.
Um,
I'm not kidding.

876
00:54:45.771 --> 00:54:47.480
I have actually,
I don't think that was Mr Wizzard,

877
00:54:47.481 --> 00:54:51.950
but I have actually seen at the science of lipstick and I,
again,
very steady.
Um,

878
00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.170
the 1950s one is not gendered at all.
Uh,
you know,
the little girls are in skirts.

879
00:54:57.171 --> 00:55:01.610
Absolutely.
But they're like,
let's look at a thermodynamics.

880
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:04.940
Um,
let's look at how we create batteries.
And they are,

881
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.960
he speaks to them and addresses them exactly as he would little boys.

882
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.830
So in terms of space flight,
I think,
you know,

883
00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:16.340
space is a great topic.
And,
and that's,
uh,

884
00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:22.730
in terms of something that is specifically about women,
um,

885
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:27.230
one of the things that I would say is,
is have them look at the early,
uh,

886
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.590
early aviation pioneers.
Um,
I,

887
00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:33.290
her name is not in my head right now,

888
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:38.160
but does anyone want to make a guess about,
uh,

889
00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:42.230
what year?
Uh,
the,
so first of all,

890
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.980
the first professional arrow not,
um,

891
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:50.540
and that should give you a clue right there.
First Professional era,
not,
uh,

892
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.080
was a woman.
Does anyone want to guess about what year?
This was?

893
00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:00.680
18.
11,
right?
Eight,
10,
11.

894
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:05.720
This woman was employed by Napoleon for her ballooning skills.

895
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:10.250
Um,
so,
uh,
I would say,

896
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:14.060
I wish I could remember her name.
I would also say,
look at Bessie Coleman.

897
00:56:14.061 --> 00:56:18.500
Bessie Coleman was the first African American woman,
a pilot.
Um,

898
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:21.380
it was not legal for her to be a pilot in the United States.

899
00:56:21.381 --> 00:56:26.260
She couldn't get a license.
And this is in 19,
I think 19,

900
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.090
I want to say 1911,
19,
12.
Very,
very early.
Um,

901
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:35.800
so she,
the only place that she could get a license to fly was in Paris.

902
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:40.510
So she taught herself French,
went to France,

903
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:44.230
got the pilot's license,
came back.
Um,

904
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.940
so looking at,
at the early pioneers of,

905
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:54.040
I think they are the ones who often are most written out of history because

906
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:57.040
we've had the most time to write them out of history.
Um,

907
00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.900
so I would look at at those,
there's a great book called the Black Wings,

908
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:05.430
which is about,
um,
African American aviation that,

909
00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:10.090
that talks about Bessie Coleman.
Um,
I would also say,

910
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:15.120
uh,
promised the moon,
which is the,
uh,
the story of the mercury.
13 women.
Uh,

911
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:19.900
there's a good documentary about them.
Uh,
so mercury 13 is also like,
what would,

912
00:57:19.901 --> 00:57:24.100
what would space look like if that program hadn't been shut down?

913
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.840
I think about this all the time.

914
00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:31.170
<v 6>I'm interested in kind of like the releasing release timing between a</v>

915
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.870
calculating sky and um,

916
00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.860
calculating stars and getting and [inaudible] which are only like three months

917
00:57:36.861 --> 00:57:41.810
apart,
release dates,
not even three months.
And uh,
uh,
you know,
my wife,

918
00:57:41.811 --> 00:57:45.370
just red Marine Johnson's most recent book only to discover that it's really

919
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.100
half a book and that the rest of the thriller is still not yet to be released.

920
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:52.940
What was your sort of like thought process behind like,

921
00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:58.180
let's get that out in this timeframe and not wait a six months or whatever.

922
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:04.020
<v 1>So calculating stars came out July 3rd,
faded sky came out August 21st,</v>

923
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:06.500
which is very fast.
Um,

924
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.240
my basic thought process on that was that my publisher said,

925
00:58:09.241 --> 00:58:12.840
would you like to do this thing?
And I said,
yes,
I would like to do that thing.
Uh,

926
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:17.330
the reason that this is a,
uh,
uh,
uh,

927
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:21.090
an interesting publishing strategy to try when you have an author who can turn

928
00:58:21.091 --> 00:58:24.870
to books out that fast.
Um,
I wrote the second book in like six months,

929
00:58:24.871 --> 00:58:28.980
which is very fast for hard science fiction.
Um,

930
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.580
the reason is because there is a known,

931
00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:36.900
a known phenomenon that when the first book in a series comes out,

932
00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.920
there's a,
there's a bump.
Like I,
you know,
there's a,

933
00:58:40.921 --> 00:58:43.530
there's something we call the series death spiral.

934
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:49.130
So the fifth book in my series did not sell as well as the first book by a lot.

935
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.850
But the moment I have a book come out in a new series,

936
00:58:53.851 --> 00:58:58.410
there's a bump and we know that.
So,
so you want,
you want new books coming out.

937
00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:01.110
And then we also know that a lot of people are completed.

938
00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:05.340
They will wait until an entire series is finished before they buy any of them.

939
00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:10.980
And when the last book comes out,
there's a bump in the sales of the first book.

940
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:17.510
So if you can get both of them coming out within about a month of each other,

941
00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:22.850
you have both of those phenomena happening at the same time and the book sells

942
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:26.300
significantly better.
Um,
so that's basically,

943
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.780
that was the experiment that they wanted to try and it has worked.

944
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:33.860
Like when I look at the diagram of my book sales,

945
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.650
it's like these books are doing very nicely and then,

946
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.270
and then calculating stars happens and it's way up here.
Uh,

947
00:59:40.271 --> 00:59:42.290
so it definitely worked.
Um,

948
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.410
there's also a number of other things that are happening with calculating stars,

949
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.620
bringing out a space book the same year as the 60th anniversary of NASA and the

950
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:57.450
year before the 50th anniversary of Apollo.
There's a lot of,
um,

951
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.670
the,
the timing is good.
I hit Zeitgeists as well,

952
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.160
but that's why they wanted to bring them out back to back like that.

953
01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.990
And as a reader,
it was so exciting to get to the end of the first book and go,

954
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.060
Oh,
I only have to wait the shorter amount of time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
the,

955
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:16.490
the other thing that we did not think through was,
or when I said,
yes,

956
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:20.390
that sounds great,
was that it meant that I had to do all that promotion as well,

957
01:00:20.391 --> 01:00:24.380
because usually you promote the first book for about two weeks before it comes

958
01:00:24.381 --> 01:00:26.390
out.
Then there's another two weeks of Rah Rah,

959
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:28.640
a new book when they're coming out and back to back.

960
01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:32.480
It's just basically like just promotion all the time,

961
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:37.390
which was,
I mean,
fun.
It's a good problem to have,
but whoa.

962
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.330
Was not expecting it.
Sure.
Well,

963
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:44.810
thanks again for coming on and for the reading and for adding us to your

964
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:48.650
promotional docket with,
thank you for being in the city.
I live in.

965
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:52.520
Well,
great.
Thanks a lot,
Mary.
Robinet.
