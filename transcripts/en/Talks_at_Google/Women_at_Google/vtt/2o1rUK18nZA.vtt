1
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.363
Wow.

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.730
<v 1>Hello?
I like the oriental carpet.</v>

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.580
I,
uh,
uh,
last time I went around doing a round of talks,
um,

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.920
someone had cut and paste into my speaking contract,

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.160
something from one of the food network chefs that required an oriental carpet of

6
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.190
certain dimensions and flowers and they had to be all of one particular blue,

7
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.510
not another.
And I didn't know this.

8
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.600
And I kept showing up and people will be like,
hi,

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.750
are oriental carbon is a little too small,
like what is wrong with people?

10
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:45.090
And then I found out that,
uh,
my constant,
but this had happened.

11
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:48.060
It was horrifying.
So I would show up and go like,
it wasn't me,
it's not me.

12
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:52.830
I'm not looking at them anyway.
Hey.
Hello.
Hi.

13
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.020
Um,
it's lovely to be here.
And I,
uh,
I've been at the Google,

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.740
you know,
the mother ship down in Silicon Valley,

15
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.390
but I've never been here and it's very nice.
So,
um,

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.480
the book that I'm running around town promoting these days is called grunt,

17
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.930
the curious science of humans at war and,
um,

18
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.110
which is kind of thrown people a little bit because it seems like sort of,
uh,

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.730
uh,
dark and somber,
serious topic.
Uh,
and,

20
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.830
and it can be,
but,
but,
but the,
I,
the angle that I cover is,
um,

21
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.230
I'm not writing about a weapons and bombs and strategy.

22
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:39.030
I kind of leave that to the discovery channel and wire.com and,
uh,

23
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.080
lots of other places that do quite well covering that because,
um,
the,

24
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.820
the human body is always,

25
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.040
that's kind of my bag is a bag of sorts.

26
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.340
So,
uh,
I am covering the sort of,

27
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:57.180
the human experience of being in combat.
So,
you know,

28
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:02.181
we were talking about lethal heat and extreme noise and fear and panic and

29
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.880
maggots and flies and diarrhea and all these things you don't necessarily

30
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:13.650
associate with a military deployment.
Uh,
obviously,
you know,

31
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.830
the combat is what comes to most people's minds.
Uh,

32
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.110
and I got interested in this book.
Um,

33
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.130
I was in India and I was reporting a story for Smithsonian on the hottest Chili,

34
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.790
arguably the hardest,
hottest chili pepper in the world.

35
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.910
There are people who disagree,
but it's called the boots.
Jolokia.

36
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:36.310
And I was up in Naga land,
the extreme northeast of India,
uh,

37
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.780
reporting this story.
And while he was reporting on the pepper,
someone said,

38
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.130
you know,
the Indian Defense Ministry,
weaponized this pepper.

39
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330
And I'm like,
I need to know about this.
So,
uh,

40
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.340
I n the science arm or one of the science branches of the Indian Defense

41
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.970
Ministry is in the neighboring state of Assam.
So I went over there,
um,

42
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.820
and talked to folks about the pepper.
As it turns out,

43
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.200
they never deployed the pepper powder because it was prone to mildew.

44
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.390
And,
um,
so that,
uh,
that sort of got set aside.
But while I was there,
I was saying,

45
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.800
well,
what else do you guys do?
And in turn,

46
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:16.360
they were testing a Leech repellent that day,
uh,
or had been testing.

47
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.670
And I said,
well,
you know,
what's that entail?
And he said,

48
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.590
just scribed going down to the river.

49
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.950
And during monsoon season going down to the river,
rolling up their trousers,

50
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.630
trying on these,
these leacher repels and I thought,
God,
military sciences,

51
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.830
it's kind of Mary Rachel,
kind of not what you would think.

52
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.000
And uh,
I had expected to spend more time with the Indian defense ministry,

53
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:38.620
but they were,
um,

54
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.530
they had finished up with the leach repelling project and they were not

55
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.440
particularly interested in my poking around there.

56
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:49.441
So I came back to the u s and pursued it there and assumed that it would be

57
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:55.120
very,
very difficult to get access.
Uh,
but in fact the,

58
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.110
uh,
the,
uh,

59
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.700
office of the Secretary of Defense of the United States has a public affairs

60
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:05.701
office that deals with books and you can send them a very brief kind of larval

61
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:10.210
in my case proposal saying,
this is what I'm interested in doing.

62
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:15.211
And they will sort of give you a kind of a generalized nod of support.

63
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.310
Uh,

64
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.570
w when initially I had thought that it would be a very formal support with like

65
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.830
embossed letters and gold trim and something that I could present,

66
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.610
but in fact just an email that I could very easily have taken out.

67
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:31.990
The not a,
when they say we yes,
we support,
we're fine with this.

68
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.960
Um,
because as one,
one of the people they're putting,
you know,

69
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.560
Mary Roach writing about this science is really not,

70
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.600
this is not a big concern for us.
Um,
you know,
we're concerned about zero,
dark 30.

71
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.600
I mean,
we have other kids who are you,

72
00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:49.601
I'm just sort of this trifling piffle that they go and do your little science,

73
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.600
diarrhea,
whatever thing you're going to do.
So,
uh,
so,
uh,

74
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.490
people were,
were fairly helpful.
It's also,
it's a side of,
uh,

75
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.990
the military's work that doesn't get a lot of,
uh,

76
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.630
coverage and some of the work that goes on is,
is,
is pretty cool.

77
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:09.160
And is,
uh,
you know,

78
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:12.460
it's nice for those people that get a little bit of a little bit of the

79
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:16.300
spotlight.
So that's what the book,
that's what the book is about.

80
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.590
So I,
uh,
and I started out,
uh,

81
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.930
I started out at the end of the book,
so it's kind of a,

82
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.090
it was kind of strange process.

83
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.870
The first place I went was the armed forces medical examiner system in Dover.

84
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.150
And that's where the military is main mortuary and morgue are.
So,

85
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.961
and when I went there,

86
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:38.650
I kind of knew that this would probably be the end of the book because it's

87
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.140
pretty,
it's,
it's a little dark or it's just,
you know,

88
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:46.141
it was a way to kind of wrap up in a way all of the various wanderings of the

89
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:50.590
book,
they,
the,
the science that I was reporting on there,
it was kind of,

90
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.810
it was pretty amazing.
It was a,
um,
it's called feedback from the field.

91
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.110
And anytime a comes in to the morgue in Dover,

92
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.090
it's given an autopsy.
All bodies are autopsies.

93
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:08.180
And what's different about these bodies is that all of the life saving equipment

94
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.380
is left in place.
You know,
whether it was a,
you know,

95
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:16.381
a needle decompression for collapsed lung or a tourniquet and there's some new

96
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.550
technology and tourniquets or,
uh,
an airway device to,
to create a secondary way.

97
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.900
All of that's left in place and it's part of the autopsy.

98
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.630
And then every month there's something called a

99
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.280
combat mortality teleconference in which all the people at the morgue and also

100
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.220
some of the research facilities.

101
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.560
And then folks that for the actual folks oversees that who had done them,

102
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.240
provided the medical care,
the emergency medical care.

103
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.040
All of those people are in this teleconference and they go case by case.

104
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:57.041
They take seven or eight cases and they sh they have slides and they discuss it

105
00:06:57.621 --> 00:07:02.140
with the aim of identifying things that have been possibly going wrong.
Um,

106
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.570
equipment that isn't working the way the manufacturer thought or it wasn't

107
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.110
placed properly.
Like just getting at the question,

108
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:11.630
is there anything that could've been done differently,

109
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.000
any way we might have saved this person's life.

110
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.660
So that was a really interesting and of course,
very sobering.
Um,

111
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.030
afternoon.
And one of the things they'd recently figured out there was,

112
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:25.850
this is kind of just,
just kind of an amazing thing.
You don't really think about,

113
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.150
um,
the,
uh,

114
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.670
number one pastime on these big bases in Afghanistan.
His weight,

115
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.030
it's bodybuilding and uh,
some of the,
the soldiers are there,

116
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.900
their pectorals are so buff,
uh,
that the needle,

117
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.320
the needles they were using for a needle decompression,
which is,
you know,
if you,

118
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:45.980
uh,

119
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.480
if you've been shot and the air that you're inhaling is ending outside the lung,

120
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:54.230
it can become difficult to inhale and you can die.
It's like,

121
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:59.231
I think the second most common cause of fatality in combat anyway.

122
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:00.860
So the,
um,

123
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.940
they realized the needles weren't making their way through the muscle to the

124
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:08.130
space that they needed to decompress the pressure.
So that,

125
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.840
cause I'm not sure why this,
why,
you know,
what's going on,
why aren't,

126
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.850
why were these people dying?
And it was,
so it was a,
um,
it was kinda great that,

127
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:18.140
that they were able to figuring this out,

128
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
get the information out there quickly through a teleconference rather than

129
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:24.150
waiting for somebody to publish a paper,
which is usually,
you know,

130
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.030
kind of the traditional route to,
um,
making that information available.
So,

131
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.900
uh,
so,
but along the way,
you know,
and,

132
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.860
and because it's a Mary Roach from people like,
well,

133
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.890
how's she going to make that funny?
Uh,
how's she going to make it?
What,

134
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.130
how is this book going to work?
So I ended up,

135
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.870
there's a couple of historical chapters that dealt with the,
um,

136
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.990
they were both,
they both had to do with the oss,

137
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:49.940
which was the precursor to the CIA.

138
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.060
And the oss had some interesting projects and world war two,
including a,
um,

139
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.180
something called who me,
which was a,
um,

140
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.170
a foul smell in a tube that was,
uh,
would be,

141
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:08.670
the idea would be to distribute it to resistance groups and occupied occupied

142
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:12.790
countries.
And so motivated citizens could go up behind the German officer say,

143
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.110
and like discretely squeezed this fire this too.
And,
uh,

144
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.600
and spray this.

145
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.870
And it was interesting because the language was all like describing it as a

146
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:26.670
weapon.
They had specs like it has to be lastingly penetrative.
It cannot,

147
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.920
it has to withstand,
uh,
rain dry cleaning solvents.

148
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.120
It has to be,
um,
uh,

149
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.000
there was a range that it had to cover and it had to do this at 70 different

150
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:42.000
hedge funds distinct for at least a two hours.

151
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:44.250
It's 70 degrees Fahrenheit at a certain level.

152
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:48.150
And their whole thing was sort of documented and they hired out this chemistry

153
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:49.040
company to figure out,

154
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:52.800
and there were all these memos that went back and forth about what is a stink,

155
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.030
it's all in the context actually a cause it could,
you know,

156
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.080
if something like butyric acid could smell depending on the cooker and a deli,

157
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:05.070
it would smell like parmesan cheese.
Uh,
but if you're not in a deli,

158
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:09.390
it smells like dirty feet.
I think it is,
unless it's vomit anyway,

159
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:13.460
vomit it.
But so it,
uh,
they were looking for something that would be,
you know,

160
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.510
universally repellent.
So there's all these,
you know,

161
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.350
conversations back and forth.
Oh,
the other,

162
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:24.351
the other example in this memo about what is a stink well as a trimethylamine

163
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:28.380
and they said,
which is a fishy smell,

164
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:32.550
which could be pleasant or unpleasant according to circumstances.

165
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.900
And uh,

166
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.900
trimethylamine is in the tampon world used for testing the powers of deodorant

167
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:43.170
that of the product that you have.
Anyway,
enough said.

168
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.480
So the,
um,
anyway,
the tubes,
uh,
the tube,

169
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:55.620
there was all manner of,
uh,
problems with,
um,
backfire.

170
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.790
The weapon was backfiring,
the tubes,
the back that the little led tube,

171
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.110
the crimping wouldn't hold.

172
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:06.111
There was one guy who at the oss are actually set up a mannequin with a uniform

173
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.570
and he took a box of the tubes and he tried to spray them and there's this very

174
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:14.280
testy memo saying that most of them had sprayed back at him.
And anyway,

175
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:17.630
it was just sort of a delightful chapter and,
uh,

176
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.160
military espionage and goings on.
So the,
uh,

177
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.200
the who me was,
uh,
this was,
um,

178
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.630
the tradition of nonlethal bad smells is nonlethal weapons has carried on.

179
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.350
Um,

180
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.060
at the Monell chemical senses center where I spent some time there,

181
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.550
the late nineties,

182
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:43.551
the joint nonlethal weapons directorate commissioned a sensory chemists as in

183
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:49.581
smell and taste at manel to come up with a universally horrible smell at this

184
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:55.510
woman.
Pam Dalton went gathering data all over the world.

185
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:57.790
She had in her suitcase,

186
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:02.791
she had little bottles labeled a burnt hair,

187
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.310
sewage,
US government,
standard bathroom,
Mel odor,

188
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.780
garbage,
sewage.
And she described when she was,

189
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.650
she was doing a project in South Africa and she thought,
well I could,
you know,

190
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.640
get some more cross cultural data here.

191
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:20.050
And she had this 15 hour flight and she in her carry on,
she had all the hurts,

192
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:25.051
smells and she describes getting up from her seat after three hours to go to the

193
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:29.660
bathroom and standing up.
So her nose is about the height of the overhead login.

194
00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:33.010
She'd be like,
Oh my God,
those are my smells and her smells.

195
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.830
You forgot about the change in pressure and they were leaking.

196
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.450
And so she said to her,
a seatmate,

197
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.180
you cannot open this overhead bin for the entire 15 hours.

198
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.000
Everything will you have at your feet?
That's all we can have.

199
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.420
And that she did this.
Just like,
you know,
when we land,

200
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.790
I know what I'm going to do.
So they land,

201
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:52.960
she waits for the doors to be open on the plane before she opens the overhead so

202
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:57.610
that people will go,
Huh,
I guess that's just how it smells here or something.

203
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.080
So this,
um,
uh,
and in the end,

204
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.750
the winner among burnt hair,

205
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:07.490
which was kind of a stand in for burning body,
you know,

206
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.810
who just thought to be that would be universally abhorred.
But in fact,

207
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.510
when you interviewed some,
you know,
there are all these,
uh,

208
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.010
different cultural groups that had had to say,
is this pleasant,

209
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:21.820
unpleasant,
wearable?
Is it a wearable?
Sent an edible scent?

210
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:24.370
And they were for every one of these horrible sense,
there'd be some groups like,

211
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:28.090
yeah,
all I'd wear that Edward,
I was perfume.
I need that.

212
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.930
Cause he's all out of context,
you know.
So,
uh,
the one that,
that just,
um,

213
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.010
upset and horrified everyone was us government standard bathroom,
Mel Odor,

214
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.780
which you could still get.
And that is something that was devised to,
um,

215
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.510
where,
uh,
come up.

216
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.570
They're trying to come up with a deodorizer for latrines and then World War II,

217
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.770
you know,
some of the open pit latrines,
I'm really nasty,
smell intense.

218
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.580
So they tried to mimic that smell so they could test deodorizing compounds.

219
00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:59.140
So this is a really vital smell.

220
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:04.030
I have smelled US government standard bathroom now loader and it is pretty bad.

221
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.530
So,
um,

222
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:09.850
what the,
what the,

223
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.970
so that was where they started and then they're very clever and Ronell,

224
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:16.270
they kinda,
they really know their,
their smells.
They,
they,

225
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.610
what they did for this mallow,

226
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.780
a nonlethal weapon is they came up,

227
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.780
they added a kind of floral,
fruity,

228
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.770
sweet top note to it.
So when you take,
you know,

229
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:32.050
because when you're presented with an unknown smell,

230
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.460
you take a tentative little whiff and if that top note is nice,

231
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.650
then you do,
it's called the keeper inhale.
So people go,
oh,

232
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:43.870
this is nice.
And then they'd get this,

233
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:48.460
this like wall of smell and it tends to stay at,
keeps write something about it.

234
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:51.440
She said she was the Pam Dalton is the chemist.
She was like,
it,

235
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.040
it keeps re binding to the receptors and you kids stuck in your nose.

236
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.720
And um,

237
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:02.110
I have in my closet a sample of stench soup that is in a bottle sealed with

238
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:07.610
paraffin,
double bagged in a box.
And I haven't had the courage to open it.

239
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:08.480
It's kind of a,
you know,

240
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:12.410
it's like this mystery box that's just sat there for over a year and I don't

241
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:15.080
really know,
thought may have a bringing of the Republican National Convention.

242
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.320
Um,
I dunno what I'm going to do with it,
but I will open it somewhere.

243
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.500
I was going to bring,
you know,
I thought maybe like,
oh,
I'll bring it a lot.

244
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.140
Good broken brain to Google.
And then I thought it could get into the,
you know,

245
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:28.470
the air conditioning is a system,

246
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.090
the ventilation and you guys could be out on the street for days.

247
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:36.720
So I have to be a little bit careful with my stanch soup.
Uh,

248
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.620
so anyway,
that stench soup.
Um,
but for the most part,
I mean the,

249
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.160
so some of the,
the,
um,
the humor is kind of the historical elements.

250
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.960
And the other thing is just,

251
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:52.490
I'm such an outsider to the middle of the military culture and it really is a,

252
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.690
a culture,
a foreign culture.
And I've not spent any time in it.

253
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.700
I know my family is not military.
My Dad was 65 when I was born,
so he,

254
00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:05.780
uh,
he enlisted,
he came over on the Lusitania in World War One.

255
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.600
He enlisted in the military,
born in England,
uh,
and he was,
uh,

256
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.870
I found his papers at Fort Moultrie.
Um,

257
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.910
but my dad got a hernia in basic training and that's as far that's the

258
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:21.680
illustrious roach military saga.
So it's not a personal,

259
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.030
uh,
it's not a personal history,
uh,
by any means.

260
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.950
I'm very much so,
and I don't really,

261
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:30.880
I don't know a lot of people in the military.
So it was fascinating to me too,

262
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.790
to be kind of in this world of sort of thrashing around.
Um,

263
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.140
and I would find myself,
I mean sometimes the humor came just from that,

264
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:41.510
that kind of where I,

265
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.570
I'm really out of my element here.

266
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.400
I was in Djibouti,
which is,
uh,
uh,

267
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.210
kind of,
uh,
uh,
it's north,
that and north African nation above Somalia,

268
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:56.750
across from Yemen,
which obviously gives you a sense of what goes on there.

269
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.780
It's like,
it's a lot of counterinsurgency,

270
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.860
special operations stuff goes on there and I was on the base.
The,

271
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:07.010
the special operations to those folks are in a restricted zone that you need

272
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:11.420
clearance to go into.
Okay.
So I went over there with Captain Mark Rydell,

273
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:13.640
who is a diarrhea researcher.

274
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:18.641
He's an MD and he was testing a much faster one dose regimen for um,

275
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.070
for diarrhea,
traveler's diarrhea,
um,

276
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.160
a particular kind of e coli that's fairly common and is pretty nasty.

277
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.060
He was a,
he was over there testing that and the rates of diarrhea,

278
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:35.870
just among the average deployed soldier mean that in 2003 to four,

279
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.380
so 77% of soldiers and personnel had come down with diarrhea.

280
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:46.280
40% needed bad enough that they sought medical care.

281
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:50.970
And 32% had it bad enough that there was a time when they didn't make it to a

282
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:52.080
bathroom in time.

283
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.590
And if you could imagine a special operations mission that you know,

284
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:57.180
these are fairly critical,

285
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.440
high risk kind of take out Osama bin Laden style things and if you are hit with

286
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:04.520
this
sudden extreme urgency,

287
00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:08.120
you can't just go cause someone else cover me because I've got a whole not

288
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:09.050
feeling well.
So it's,

289
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.490
so it's kind of a matter of national security and if that was my take on it.

290
00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:14.271
So I thought,
okay,

291
00:18:14.271 --> 00:18:18.530
I need to just talk to some of the special operations guys and they're easy to

292
00:18:18.531 --> 00:18:20.750
pick out cause they have beards and no one else there.

293
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.010
Everyone else clean shaven.

294
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.910
They need to fit in with the local population in these villages.
So,
um,

295
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.750
and they only a,
you know,
the public affairs guys like Mary,

296
00:18:29.751 --> 00:18:32.900
I sent out an email for you.
I've already humiliated myself.

297
00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:35.180
They're doing it sort.
It became known as the diarrhea email.

298
00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:40.130
Will somebody please share their stories of diarrhea with our visiting writer?

299
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.520
And nobody will have,
some people did,
but no one from special operations vote.

300
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:49.260
Oh I will.
So he said,
you know [inaudible] mmm.

301
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.770
So well mark,
Captain Riddle said,
you know,
you're probably a,

302
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.740
you're going to have to talk to him over dinner.

303
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.580
They only come out to eat and train was the public affairs guys.
Go,

304
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.910
guy goes and to steal our women.

305
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.900
Anyway,
so the my only opportunity to talk to these,
um,

306
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.250
individuals who are a little intimidating to someone like me was over was in the

307
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.400
dining facility.
So it created this kind of,
um,

308
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.340
wonderfully awkward scenario of crossing the room to approach this very sort of

309
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:26.940
stony and omnipotent seeming person eating by himself,

310
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:30.780
who just kind of looked up at us and said,
I'm done.
And Seamus said,

311
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:34.290
oh well could ask you just what line of work are you in?
And he said,
I'm leaving.

312
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.190
And he got up to go and I had to jump in and sort of say,
the old mine,

313
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.120
my name is Mary Roach.
I'm working on a book and I actually have,

314
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.340
I wanted to talk to you about diarrhea.
I know that it sounds like a silly,
yeah.

315
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.500
Topic.
And he said,
he looked up and said,

316
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.100
it's not,
you're welcome to sit down.
So it was a very,

317
00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:54.720
it was a very interesting conversation in a very,
yeah.
Um,

318
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.290
unusual reporting challenge.

319
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.060
Anyway.
Um,
so the thing about the book is

320
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.080
one of the,
uh,

321
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.790
one of the reasons I went ahead with this book is because the topics are things

322
00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:19.900
that anybody in the military deals with is a really extreme version of whether

323
00:20:19.901 --> 00:20:24.901
it's overheating or back pain from heavy loads or sleep deprivation or hearing

324
00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.930
loss from loud noise.
So it's some that,
you know,
they're all topics.

325
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.810
The science of these topics would be,
you know,
sort of applicable to anybody,
uh,

326
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:38.090
who has a body and ears and a back.
So,
um,

327
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.770
the hope is that the,
you know,
the,
the,
the middle of the,

328
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.620
the culture of the military is,
is interesting,
but also just the science of,

329
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.930
you know,
like the science of sweat and,
and heat stroke.

330
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.950
Um,
I mean they,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a big problem,
um,

331
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:59.370
because the situation that creates heat stroke is this competition for bodily

332
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:04.150
fluid,
like specifically blood because your,
this,
your sweat is plasma.

333
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.600
It's the clear portion of your blood.
And when you start to overheat,

334
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.810
I mean your body is a machine that wants to be in a set temperature range.

335
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:13.750
And if you stray from that,
it does what it can to bring it back.

336
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:16.810
And the first thing it does is it generates sweat.

337
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.670
So all the blood is shunted to your skin and off the,
you know,

338
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:24.780
the plasma comes out through the sweat glands and then the heat kind of

339
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.660
vaporizes and takes away the heat from your body.
And that's great.
And it's very,

340
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:32.140
very efficient.
However,
if you're exerting yourself,

341
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:33.970
if you're carrying a heavy pack and you're running,

342
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.090
especially if you haven't hydrated yourself well,

343
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.420
you have this competition for a limited amount of resources and a certain point,

344
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.151
you know,

345
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:46.450
that someone's got to go to the muscles and Scott to go to the blood to cool.

346
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.260
You and your body will start to shut down.
Other things,
uh,

347
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.370
that you might not get out of blood to your head that it's why people pass out,

348
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.710
um,
when they're very,

349
00:21:56.711 --> 00:22:00.170
very hot or your gut can start to shut down.

350
00:22:00.171 --> 00:22:05.171
And that leads to a sort of a chain of events that can result in delirium,

351
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.770
coma and then your debt and you're dead.
So it's uh,
um,

352
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.320
the military was trying the um,
medical school,
uh,

353
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:16.240
use this uniform services,

354
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:21.070
University of Health Sciences was working on trying to figure out because a lot

355
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:25.690
of individual differences in how well you acclimate to heat and how badly you

356
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:26.524
suffer from it.

357
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.210
So the idea was well could we find a blood marker or some sort of,

358
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.730
is there some sort of genetic difference between people?

359
00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:38.731
Can we identify who is really at risk and keep them out of this scenario,

360
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.420
which is a great plan.
And the um,
the,
the work,

361
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.490
it was interesting cause I have the cook box there,

362
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:48.820
which is a box that they can adjust the heat and humidity and sort of create a

363
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:53.821
really god awful hot day in the Middle East with a treadmill and a backpack.

364
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.810
I lasted seven minutes out of the hour and a half.

365
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.740
[inaudible] it's,
it's pretty brutal.
And my pack only had 30 pounds,

366
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:05.760
which is about what the body armor itself would way.
So it's,

367
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.900
it's unbelievable how,
um,
how fit and how these people are,

368
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.010
what they endure.
Um,
and,
but like anything,
you know,

369
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:17.170
that the something that seems like it'd be a good answer.

370
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:19.210
It's a little tough because

371
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:25.120
I'm s what happens?
You take people out of the things like,
okay,
this guy,

372
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.230
obviously he,
you know,

373
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:29.980
we've been able to identify these people are not going to farewell and extreme

374
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:31.540
heat,
so let's hold them back.
And then,

375
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:35.080
so the people who are fit ended up doing more than their fair share.

376
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.840
They're the only ones you can call in to do a really hard job.

377
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.070
And so they push themselves and then collapse.
So,
um,
it,
it's just,

378
00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:44.290
it's just really hard.
And the,
yeah,
the,
the,

379
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.710
there's an environmental medicine unit at Natick labs that has a mannequin that

380
00:23:49.711 --> 00:23:53.630
sweats that they figure out like these sweat prediction equations where,

381
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.990
you know,
give me how much,
how many miles,
how hard is it,

382
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.470
how much are they carrying,
what's the body armor?

383
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.370
And you plug it all into a formula and it tells you this is how much water per

384
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:08.480
person to carry.
So they're trying to get it dialed down to a science.

385
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.240
But ultimately it's,
you,
you know,

386
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.300
when you get into the real world of a,
of a mission,

387
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.750
there's always five or six things nobody counted on and you can't,
it's just,

388
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.160
it's just really hard to hand someone a formula that's going to solve all their

389
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:29.070
problems.
And the soldiers are like,
God,
there was scientists,
you know,
they do,

390
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.600
you know,
these rules that these guys and air conditioned offices come up with.

391
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.050
So there's kind of a tension between the soldiers and the scientists,

392
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.030
but they're all trying to do their job.
Um,
anyway,

393
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.110
so it was a,
you know,
I,
and the one,

394
00:24:44.111 --> 00:24:46.100
one thing I wanted to do for the book,

395
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:51.610
I initially had planned to embed this was um,

396
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.601
when we were,

397
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:57.200
there was still stuff going on in Afghanistan and I was going to embed my,

398
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.230
I initially had an idea I wanted to embed with the fourth Marine Corps dental

399
00:25:03.501 --> 00:25:08.501
battalion just because I really that they are whole concept of a Marine Corps

400
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:11.870
dental battalion just really appealed to me.

401
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.980
As I said this I own notion of these guys parachuting in with a little picks

402
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:21.350
smocks and um,
of course that's not the case but,
but anyway,

403
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:24.000
and they are like,
yeah,
well we're not going anywhere.
Um,

404
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.010
thanks for your interest.

405
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.760
So the Marine Corps dental battalion was off the list sadly,

406
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:33.530
but I still like to talk about the fourth Marine Corps dental battalion just

407
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:38.210
cause there's a dental battalion.
Yeah.
I'm Marine Corps to dental battalion.
Yeah.

408
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:41.930
Similarly,
I want to,
I at one point I thought it would be,
um,
because my editor,

409
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.240
of course it's like special operations.
Can you,

410
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.970
can you go out with a special operations team?

411
00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:51.590
And like kind of think that's classified stuff,
but I'll try.

412
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:56.591
So I called the Special Operations Command Public Affairs Office and I thought,

413
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:58.790
okay,
I know I'll cover,
I'll,
what about,

414
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:02.120
because they have their own weather command there.
They were on whether people,

415
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:03.250
cause that's a big,

416
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.160
if you're flying in somewhere or however you're getting them mean whether it's

417
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.920
important and it's a critical element.

418
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.650
But I could just imagine if you made it,
I mean it's a very,
yeah,

419
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.350
just very elite group.

420
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:19.100
And if you made it into special operations and then you get to brag about that

421
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:22.160
doing,
I'm special operations,
special operations,

422
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.440
weather command.

423
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:28.430
So I thought that would be interesting.

424
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:31.520
And like these folks that would do an interesting take on the whole thing.

425
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:35.930
And I explained that to pub to public affairs guy and he said,
yeah,

426
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.260
that's just not gonna.
That's not gonna happen.
It's,
it's classified.

427
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.600
And I actually,
I actually said to him,
um,

428
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.840
but I'm only gonna ask questions about whether,
so I won't actually,

429
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:50.400
I won't pay any attention to anybody else's what they're doing.
A No,

430
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.890
no.
So,
uh,
so there were,
there were some,
some walls that were thrown up,

431
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:59.760
understandably and my efforts to report this book.
But,
um,

432
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.680
I made my way onto a,
uh,
a,

433
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.320
a ballistic missile submarine,
the USS Tennessee,

434
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.240
which was a fascinating place to be.

435
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:13.950
They were trying out there have a serious issue with sleep deprivation.

436
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:19.410
Um,
the,
most of the guys at that time had been averaging around four hours sleep.

437
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.680
It's kind of not what you want on a vessel that is powered by a nuclear reactor

438
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:28.410
and carries a 20 some trident missiles.

439
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.470
So they were trying out a different watch cause they kind of,

440
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.760
because you have a submarine is a isolated from the normal cues of day and
night.

441
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:36.930
You can,
they thought was,

442
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:40.020
well maybe we can muck with circadian rhythm and create a different length of

443
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:43.200
day,
thereby making things more productive.
But in fact,

444
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.890
you had a situation where they might've been a little less sleep deprived,

445
00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:51.270
but it was like flying to Paris every day is how someone put it.
Cause they were,

446
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.770
the circadian rhythm was just off.
Their body rhythm was off with the clock.

447
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.500
Uh,
so they were,
they were trying something,

448
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.660
it'd be a moving it back onto a circadian friendly time schedule so that that's

449
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:07.260
what was going on on the USS Tennessee.

450
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.690
It took me a year and a half to get on there.

451
00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:12.560
Not because anybody was saying no,

452
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.520
just because it was very hard to find somebody who's,

453
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.900
who had the authority to say yes.
So you get a lot of it seems okay to me,

454
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.820
but I'm not the one who could say yeah.

455
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:27.960
So you'd kind of get bounced around the um,
the Djibouti trip,

456
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.310
I think there are probably 60 or so emails flying around over the span of three

457
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:37.140
weeks to just try to like go with the diarrhea researcher to Camp Lemon.
Yay.
And,

458
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.930
and,
and the,
the navy public affairs person was like,

459
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.820
it seems fine to me.
I don't even know is it's Centcom,
is it?

460
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:47.640
AFRICOM is a joint Horn of Africa.
Is that the Pentagon?

461
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.000
I have no idea who to ask.
I don't know who can sign off on it.
So it was like,

462
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.240
and finally it came down to that guy Seamus on the ground and camp lemon,

463
00:28:56.281 --> 00:29:01.080
Yay.
Who had seen all these emails pinging around and finally said,
he said,

464
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.710
cause I asked him,
how did you make this happen?
He said,
well,
you know,

465
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.870
certain point,
I thought,
this is not like diarrhea.

466
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:10.960
You can't just hydrate and wait for it to go away.
Uh,
we're going to,

467
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.210
somebody has to,
somebody has to do something.
So he met me,

468
00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:15.090
I went into the base commander's office and I said,

469
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:18.180
do you care if this woman comes here to talk about diarrhea with people?

470
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:21.390
And he was like,
I don't care.
So they should,
they said,
yes,
that's fine.

471
00:29:21.391 --> 00:29:23.010
So weeks of,
you know,

472
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.640
formally petitioning the wrong person over and over and over.

473
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.390
And in the end it was just the guy on the ground.
Sorry,

474
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:33.750
I have a little bit of a lost Lou.
I've been talking a lot lately,

475
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.120
so I should probably sort of wind it down and take,
um,

476
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.170
take questions from any,

477
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:44.080
from anybody who has questions or if you wanted me to talk about any of the

478
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:48.400
other,
um,
any of the other subjects.
You know,
in the,
in the book there's,
um,

479
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.390
I talked also about,
uh,
genital injuries,

480
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:54.300
which is something we've been seeing lately.
And,
uh,

481
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.910
for two reasons as there's been that the bombs have gotten bigger and also the

482
00:29:57.911 --> 00:30:02.860
emergency medical care and medical evacuations have gotten better and faster.

483
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:06.490
So,
um,
bigger injuries and more people surviving them.

484
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:10.810
It used to be if there was a bomb big enough to damage the pelvic region rather

485
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:12.970
than just blow off your foot,
you didn't survive.

486
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:17.950
And now these guys are surviving.
So there's,
um,
interesting reconstructive work.

487
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:19.330
Some of it,
uh,
uh,

488
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:24.331
some of it coming out of a cooperation with the transgender community,

489
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.940
which who build penises all the time.
Like,
what do you need to know?

490
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.460
So anyway,
um,
so there's that.
And,
uh,

491
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.640
Oh I,
lots of other fun topics,
but I'd be happy to,

492
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.730
to talk about any questions people have or you know,

493
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.480
by what we're about.
Any of my other books or,

494
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.150
<v 2>so you do a lot of research.</v>

495
00:30:47.151 --> 00:30:50.930
How much actually makes it into the book and how many of these gems are just

496
00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:51.890
left on the floor?

497
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.380
<v 1>Oh well I write everything down because I don't,</v>

498
00:30:56.381 --> 00:31:01.210
when I go somewhere I don't really know what the chapter's about quite I cause I

499
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.610
haven't met these people.
I don't really know what's going to happen.

500
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:05.590
So I'm just writing everything down.

501
00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:09.640
I would say 0.01% of what I write down.

502
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:14.260
I actually use,
it's insane.
It's so much just stuff that,

503
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.300
and I'll go back and look at a notebook.
I don't eat,

504
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.480
I have no idea what I was even writing down.
Um,

505
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.010
so no gems,
the gems?
No,
the gems go in the book.
In fact,

506
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.580
when I,
like when I go on a reporting trip,

507
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.870
I go back to my,
um,

508
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.240
to my room and I go through my notebook and I have a system where if it looks

509
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:39.030
like a promising something somebody said or something that was interesting and

510
00:31:39.031 --> 00:31:42.130
I'll circle it.
And if it's really good,
I'll circle it and put three stars,

511
00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:44.500
next one,
two or three stars.
We have this rating system,

512
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.740
then I pull that stuff out into a transcript and then I print that out and then

513
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:51.580
I go through and circle stuff in there.
So,

514
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.640
and I moved the really good stuff to the top,
kind of just like,

515
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.360
this is the good shit.
This is going to go in somehow.

516
00:31:58.361 --> 00:32:02.320
And that actually influences how I shaped the chapter.
Like they're,
you know,

517
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:03.370
if there's a scene that I,

518
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:08.170
that is really great that seems like it'll be really fun to read,

519
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.560
you know,
all figured out now what,
what's the order of these two or three scenes?

520
00:32:11.561 --> 00:32:15.610
So identify the scenes and then quotes and,
but most of it,
yeah,

521
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.760
most of it just,
and on that,

522
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.450
when I was on the submarine at one point I was interviewing someone and I,
and,

523
00:32:20.451 --> 00:32:25.300
and um,
something was said over the intercom that was classified and the,

524
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.510
uh,
the ship's commanding officer said,
I'm really sorry,

525
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:30.630
you're going to have to delete that.
And I said,
it's a,
it's an a,

526
00:32:30.631 --> 00:32:33.520
it's an MP three file.
I can't go in.
I mean,
you guys probably could,

527
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.590
you can't go in and just delete a word.
Uh,
and he said,
well,
you have to,

528
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.020
you know,

529
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:43.220
you're either gonna have to delete the whole file or I guess I could transcribe

530
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:47.950
it.
I'm like,
so this guy,

531
00:32:47.951 --> 00:32:50.260
this guy,
he's so busy,
he's got so many,

532
00:32:50.261 --> 00:32:53.770
so much on his plate and this annoying journalists do there for four days out at

533
00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:56.290
sea.
He's like,
I kept going by his state.

534
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.330
He was a little state room and he's hunched over a computer and it was the most

535
00:33:01.781 --> 00:33:06.100
beautifully transcribed.
Every word written out spelled perfectly,
you know,

536
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.300
Mary Roach Colon.
And then,
you know,
it was like a,
uh,
like a screenplay,

537
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.970
whereas when I type it,
it's just,
you could barely figure out,

538
00:33:12.971 --> 00:33:15.850
I abbreviate every word and um,
anyway,

539
00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:18.880
so that's kind of my haphazard procedure.

540
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.960
Yeah.

541
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.440
<v 3>Hi,</v>

542
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.150
I was very interested to hear you talk about the autopsies in the beginning of

543
00:33:27.151 --> 00:33:30.270
your remarks.
Picked her because in the nonmilitary world,

544
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.370
a lot of doctors are concerned that they're not doing enough.

545
00:33:32.371 --> 00:33:35.460
Autopsies are not learning enough from their mistakes or the problems.

546
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.370
Do you know anything about how the information might flow?

547
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.760
Like do the military doctors write papers or data summaries from what they

548
00:33:41.761 --> 00:33:43.050
learned in their autopsy work?

549
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.900
<v 1>They,
uh,
I think they do write papers.</v>

550
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:47.690
I mean they do the mortality costs though that conference just to get the

551
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:51.830
information back to the emergency,
the medics and the emergency room people.

552
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:52.690
But I think they do.
Yeah,

553
00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.930
I do go on and write papers based on what they're learning from autopsy

554
00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.580
autopsies,
like hospital autopsies.
That's an interesting realm.

555
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:05.230
Like I know the medical examiner in the bay area.
Of course I do.

556
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.370
We go have lunch and she'll go,
oh,
I've got a decomp today.

557
00:34:09.371 --> 00:34:13.840
Do you want to come over?
I'm like,
Hey,
not so much before lunch.
No.
Um,

558
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:19.310
and she said there are some like that.
Um,
there is sometimes,

559
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.900
I mean it didn't give you the specifics were but like,
you know,

560
00:34:21.901 --> 00:34:25.740
hos there might be pressure on the metal cause laminar medical examiner not to

561
00:34:25.741 --> 00:34:30.180
find negligence,
which would,
that was upsetting to me like that the,

562
00:34:30.181 --> 00:34:33.480
well the whole idea with an autopsy is to get at the truth of why did what

563
00:34:33.481 --> 00:34:37.380
happened.
Know I probably,
that's not a regular occurrence,

564
00:34:37.381 --> 00:34:38.700
but that was sort of disconcerting.

565
00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.950
So I think there's some politics behind the prevalence of,
of autopsy.

566
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.200
Um,
well,
so it's,
it's tends to be done.
Yeah.
In,
you know,

567
00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:50.430
when the cause is an obvious,

568
00:34:50.431 --> 00:34:53.700
when it seems to be no suicide or homicide is suspected.
But there's lots of,

569
00:34:53.701 --> 00:34:57.450
you know,
like people die in hospitals and the family wants to know you can,

570
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:02.700
you can get a private,
you can call 1-800-AUTOPSY and they drive up in a van.

571
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.800
No,
there,
there are,
there are actually you can,

572
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.390
you can contract someone to do an autopsy.
So there's a,

573
00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.600
that would be an interesting realm to explore.

574
00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:13.890
I don't know that much about it or whether I have even answered your question.

575
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.690
Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
Um,

576
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.320
I am a huge fan of your box there.
Oh,
thanks.

577
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.060
[inaudible] very educational and it in,
I have not read grant yet.
Done.
Very Sad.

578
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.410
And a lot of the things that you've spoken about are the physical,
the smell.
Yes.

579
00:35:30.411 --> 00:35:32.840
The bodies.
Um,
do you touch your,

580
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:37.170
have you touched on the mental side of things and technology and innovation in

581
00:35:37.171 --> 00:35:40.890
that space?
Um,
I was going to,

582
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.360
when after the Fourth Marine Corps Dental battalion turned me down,
um,

583
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.120
the,

584
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:51.120
I had planned and got permission to embed with the chaplains core because they,

585
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.350
they were,
you know,
I wanted to cover,
um,
PTSD or,
or not PTSD,

586
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:59.460
but just specifically emotional issues and how a variety of them like dealing

587
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:03.340
with,
you know,
a death in a unit or whatever comes up.
Um,

588
00:36:03.341 --> 00:36:07.320
and the chaplain and the chaplain's assistant who has a weapon and covers for

589
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:12.040
the chaplain,
they go out on missions with you with a unit.
They early,
um,
uh,

590
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.290
which I didn't realize,
I hadn't realized that,
that I thought,

591
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.210
I thought they stayed back on base and had an office with people would come to,

592
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:21.210
but they'll actually go out like on a route clearance mission or whatever it is.

593
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.580
So there that they can offer this empathy.
I wasn't interested in that in,

594
00:36:24.581 --> 00:36:29.310
in the religious elements so much is their ability to empathize because they've

595
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:33.030
kind of been through similar hardships and that fascinated me and I was really

596
00:36:33.031 --> 00:36:36.360
disappointed.
I was approved by the u s but then I saf,

597
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:40.920
which is the coalition umbrella organization said no because it's the draw down

598
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:45.921
and we don't have hardly any journalists and I'm no,

599
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.320
and I think it was more like,
hey,
you didn't ask us who says you can go?
He like,

600
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:52.920
somehow he saw an email.
It's like,
hey,
did you didn't talk to me?
I don't know.

601
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.810
Do you know what they say?
ISF stands for and I suck at fighting.

602
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.630
That's my little dig at Isat fraternity.
No,
now there I didn't even,

603
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:06.090
I stopped being international.
I didn't even know what does it,
what does it eve,

604
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:09.480
what does ICF even stand for?
International?

605
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.700
It's those guys,
the overseers.
It's the coalition.
But anyway,
um,
I had,

606
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.300
because I didn't really have a narrative that,
um,
there wasn't a,

607
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.410
I didn't find another way in that would afford kind of,
I like,

608
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.900
I like to have a sort of a scene in a setting and things.
So,

609
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.790
and I'm usually not doing,

610
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:30.780
I think I had a chapter in packing from ours that had to do with sort of unique,

611
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.620
uh,
psychological components of being in space.
And I had,

612
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.770
I had planned to do that but didn't end up.
And there's this,

613
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.960
there's a lot of coverage of that as well,

614
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.920
that other people I think have done a nice job with.
Yeah.
Cool.
Thank you.

615
00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.660
I'm looking forward to reading it.
Thank you.

616
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:51.860
<v 4>Hi.
Hi.
Uh,
after spending so much time,
um,
in your research,</v>

617
00:37:51.861 --> 00:37:55.940
did you find your opinions related to the military?

618
00:37:55.941 --> 00:38:00.200
It's command structure.
It's politics,
the soldiers,

619
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.260
their lifestyle or their worldview.
Did,

620
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.090
did you find your opinion's changing on that at all?

621
00:38:05.091 --> 00:38:07.130
And what was kind of the before and after that?

622
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.280
<v 1>Well,
but the,
the before was that I had a very,</v>

623
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:15.170
I had this view of the military as this sort of monolithic entity,

624
00:38:15.171 --> 00:38:17.870
which is the more time you spend in that realm,

625
00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:19.430
the more you see how fractured it is.

626
00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:23.600
There's not just the different branches of the military,
but there's,
you know,

627
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:28.520
there's the policy people in the Pentagon and then there's the scientists and

628
00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:31.580
the medical people and the civilians who work.
And so it's,

629
00:38:31.581 --> 00:38:36.340
so it became really hard to have a opinion.
Um,

630
00:38:36.341 --> 00:38:41.341
I ended up having a tremendous amount of respect for the researchers to do this

631
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:42.910
work,
you know,

632
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:47.230
which is going toward trying to make this God awful experience somewhat more

633
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.030
tolerable and survivable.
Um,
though those guys,
those people,

634
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.050
a lot of them were women actually in the book or were great.
And so that,

635
00:38:56.051 --> 00:38:59.150
that's the main world I inhabited and I didn't,
so I didn't,

636
00:38:59.151 --> 00:39:00.310
I don't really have a,
I mean,

637
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:05.311
my views on the larger entity of war and military policy,

638
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:11.610
et Cetera,
have not changed,
but that,
that didn't change.
Excellent.
Yeah.

639
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:15.681
<v 4>I was interested to hear,</v>

640
00:39:15.681 --> 00:39:19.230
you're talking about the circadian rhythm stuff on the submarines.
Yeah.

641
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.300
Especially because since I read,
uh,
you know,
I think bonk and stuff for the,

642
00:39:24.301 --> 00:39:25.250
the first two books I read,

643
00:39:25.251 --> 00:39:28.520
I've been wondering if you were ever going to do a book specifically about
sleep.

644
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.910
<v 1>Yeah.
You know what?
People have suggested that.</v>

645
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:35.030
Did I cut you off or was that yours?
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,
do you think,
you know,

646
00:39:35.031 --> 00:39:36.920
sleep well,
two things are going on.

647
00:39:36.921 --> 00:39:41.750
My editor at ww Norton just edited a book called Dreamland,

648
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:46.440
I think on sleep,
the science of sleep,
but more than that,
um,

649
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:51.620
because it's an dreaming and sleep.
It's an internal state,
a lot of,

650
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:56.210
uh,
I'm trying to imagine what would be the scene in the setting.

651
00:39:56.211 --> 00:40:01.211
It'd be like chapter after chapter of a guy on a bed with electrodes asleep.

652
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.930
So it was kind of hard to you then.

653
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.890
You know how when you tell your spouse or partner your dream and they're like

654
00:40:06.891 --> 00:40:11.600
instantly like,
shut up,
it's so boring.
I don't,
please don't tell me your dream.

655
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:16.580
Um,
so trying to describe,
I mean not that it would be entirely about dreaming,

656
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.570
but it felt a little confining in terms of the,
the,

657
00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.100
the color and the scenes and the kind of the,

658
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:27.030
the narratives that would bring the research to life.
So for that reason,
but I,

659
00:40:27.031 --> 00:40:31.080
it is a good time and I have given it thought.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
Well thank you.
Yup.

660
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.770
<v 4>Hi.
Thank you for coming.
My,</v>

661
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.440
my wife was very jealous that she wasn't able to come see your,
your,

662
00:40:36.441 --> 00:40:37.430
one of your favorite authors.

663
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.270
Have there been any themes for books that you've started pursuing and then

664
00:40:41.271 --> 00:40:44.270
abandoned because they didn't actually bear enough fruit and if so,

665
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.150
<v 1>what were they?
Yeah,
there was one that,
um,</v>

666
00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.730
there was one idea I had for a book that morphed into packing for Morrison,

667
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.090
but originally,
um,
this,

668
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:59.170
this guy I knew from way back when had gotten a job in Galveston at the bed rest

669
00:40:59.451 --> 00:41:00.730
facility at um,
that,

670
00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:05.520
that connected to NASA [inaudible] where are they are they're studying um,

671
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.260
muscle wasting and bone loss from,

672
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.820
from being in weightlessness because your body to kind of just takes apart your

673
00:41:13.821 --> 00:41:15.980
muscles or we don't need these,
we're going to take them apart.
There's a lot of,

674
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.550
a lot of bone loss and muscle wasting and to at the analog for that,

675
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.560
that's this simulation is to have people lie in bed slightly head down and not

676
00:41:26.391 --> 00:41:28.950
get up for three months and um,

677
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.710
be they're paid like $17,000 or something so that world and thought,
wow,

678
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:38.600
the whole human Guinea pig world seemed kind of interesting and bizarre.

679
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.560
Um,
but yeah,
I talked to my age and he's like,

680
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:46.010
it seems like it would be a little repetitive and there is there enough variety

681
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.340
to widen me.
A lot of people are testing drugs,
pharmaceuticals.

682
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:52.550
That is an interesting world,
but that has been covered a fair amount.

683
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:55.700
And so again,
it was a situation where I didn't think there was,

684
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:59.240
I didn't know that there was enough variety or my agent didn't think that there

685
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:03.550
would be quite enough variety to the landscape to make it,
um,

686
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:08.840
to make it a go.
So,
so I folded that into packing for Mars.

687
00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:13.720
<v 2>Uh,
you do a lot of traveling for your research and uh,</v>

688
00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.670
it seems some,
some places kind of recur from,
from book to book.
Yeah.

689
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.880
And I was wondering,
uh,
on any given trip,

690
00:42:21.881 --> 00:42:24.500
how many different projects are you working on at a time?
Okay.

691
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.800
<v 1>Uh,
on any given trip,
often just one chapter.
Oh yeah,</v>

692
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.630
the,
well,
the India trip,

693
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.900
I was traveling with a friend who was doing some charitable work for a

694
00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:39.970
organization called books and water that tries to,

695
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:44.680
or the puts in a wells in villages and portable libraries.
So we,

696
00:42:44.681 --> 00:42:46.510
I was traveling with her and then I,

697
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.080
she was going to be in Nagaland and I was like,
Naga land,
I've never heard of it.

698
00:42:50.081 --> 00:42:54.580
So I looked it up,
heard about the chili pepper contest and pitched that.

699
00:42:54.581 --> 00:42:58.570
So I was doing two things there.
But usually when I travel somewhere,
I'm,
I'm,

700
00:42:58.571 --> 00:43:03.340
I'm only doing one,
uh,
one chunk of research.

701
00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.460
<v 2>Yeah.
And here I was envisioning some huge master plan.</v>

702
00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:11.440
<v 1>Yeah.
You know what,
I'd love that,
but I can I,
yeah,
it never works out that way.</v>

703
00:43:11.441 --> 00:43:14.260
It never,
it's always,
and sometimes they'll be like,
oh,

704
00:43:14.261 --> 00:43:15.970
I've got to go to London for this.

705
00:43:15.971 --> 00:43:18.250
And then six weeks later there's another thing,
you know,

706
00:43:18.251 --> 00:43:22.270
so I can't combine them because it's all their schedule,
not mine.

707
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.890
So I'm constantly sort of being buffeted here and there by researcher schedule's

708
00:43:26.891 --> 00:43:30.680
good things get pushed back and delayed and I,
so I,
uh,
you know,

709
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.180
so I never go on a vacation myself cause I'm like,
Whoa,
that cadaver project,

710
00:43:34.181 --> 00:43:36.720
when come through next month.
Oh,
it's been delayed,
you know,

711
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.380
so I'm constantly not,

712
00:43:38.381 --> 00:43:42.230
and I don't do a lot of talks outside of book tour for that reason as well

713
00:43:42.231 --> 00:43:46.450
because I just,
I may need to up and go quickly.
Yeah.

714
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:52.120
I wish anyone else.
All right then.

715
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.290
<v 0>Thank you.
Thanks a lot.</v>
