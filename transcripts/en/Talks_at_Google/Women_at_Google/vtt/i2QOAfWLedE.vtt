1
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.530
Uh,
I'm Karen Sunburg.
I'm the diversity lead for tech.
Um,

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.880
and I probably wouldn't normally be the person introducing this session,
but,
um,

3
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.990
I used to work for Sylvia at the center for talent innovation and I joined

4
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:16.980
Google last year,

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.190
so it was very exciting to welcome her back here today to talk about executive

6
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:22.651
presence,

7
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:26.520
which was a piece of research that started happening when I was still at the

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:31.440
center and was really transformative for me and for others as we talk to

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:35.800
companies about thinking about how,
you know,
what is leadership,
what does it,

10
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:38.770
what are the leadership archetypes and,
um,
and how do,

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180
how do you become an effective communicator?
And you know,

12
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.930
what does it mean to have gravitas and all these big pieces that we don't often

13
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:47.340
think about.
Um,

14
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.300
but that are crucially important in addition to doing our work.
Um,

15
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.570
also how we come across and how we relate our messages.

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.990
So I'm excited to welcome Sylvia here today.
Um,

17
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.740
one thing that I learned about executive,

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.920
why I learned a lot of things about executive presence from Sylvia,
but,
um,

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.380
one was that you should always have one fun piece of,
you know,

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.780
maybe in your appearance,
some fun piece of clothing.

21
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.350
That was always something that I noticed that she did and used very effectively

22
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:15.400
actually.
And so in honor of her today,

23
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:18.590
I wore leopard shoes because she always had leopard and she,

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.290
I think she has a bag that's leopard.
So I'm right on target today.
Um,

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.610
but I wore like Google safe leopard,
you know,
like not too much.
Um,

26
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.430
but I'm very excited to welcome Sylvia here to talk about her new book on

27
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.270
executive presence,

28
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.450
which was voted the best book of the month by Amazon this month.

29
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:37.530
So pretty awesome.
Um,
and so without further ado,
Sylvia,
welcome.

30
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
So it is fabulous to connect with Karen.

32
00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:49.270
She has much more important things to do this morning,

33
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:53.080
but we already did a little catch up over breakfast,
so that was fabulous.

34
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.140
I want to begin with a story,
uh,
because this,
uh,

35
00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:00.250
topic,
uh,

36
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.280
goes to the core of some of my failure and some of the challenges I had early in

37
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:06.664
my life.

38
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.160
I grew up in the coal mining area of south Wales.

39
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.300
Uh,
this is a very depressed piece,
sub to UK.

40
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:21.100
The unemployment rate in my valley when I was growing up was 38%,

41
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.110
uh,
because the coal industry was closing down.
And you know,

42
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:31.111
I did come from a hard scrabble hardscrabble family and partly because of the

43
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:32.261
woman's movement,

44
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:36.520
partly because they were trying to get our folks on the wrong side of the tracks

45
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:41.440
to made universities.
I did end up at Cambridge when I was 18 and I was broke.

46
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.030
I did pass a lot of exams,

47
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.170
but I spoke English with this thick working class while Jackson,

48
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.930
which was the kiss of death and polite English society,
which is very,

49
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.930
um,
you know,
very class conscious.

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.060
I also did not use gramma,
uh,
you know,
kind of correctly.

51
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.530
I grew up with a lot of bad habits because you know,

52
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.250
this was on a reading household.

53
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.640
And I remember knowing when I was 18 that no matter how great I was at my work,

54
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.240
every time I open my mouth,
I let myself down.

55
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.310
It was also true that Cambridge was only 7% female at the time.

56
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.270
So there was enough going on in terms of the gender barriers to make me feel it.

57
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:36.220
At least I had to fix the way I talk if I was going to get anywhere.

58
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.650
So I spent two years listening to the BBC will service

59
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.540
practicing those modulated tones and also fixing my grandma.

60
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.380
And it did make me much more accessible,

61
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.700
much more successful,

62
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.740
much more able to actually communicate my thoughts.

63
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.860
Now looking back on it,

64
00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:08.820
there was a lot of bias going on in that story,
right?

65
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.350
What's wrong with regional accent?

66
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.600
<v 1>Uh,
what's wrong with looking clause accidents?</v>

68
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.570
Now I didn't need to fix my grandma.
That was a good IPO.

69
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.493
Right?

70
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.600
You do want to use the language that is your main vehicle.

71
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.493
Well,

72
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.070
<v 2>okay,</v>

73
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.250
<v 1>but back then,
because Kloss was such an issue,</v>

74
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:36.670
I also really had to change the way I spoke.

75
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.011
So,
I mean,

76
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:44.011
this business of how you communicate there is this tension between authenticity

77
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.790
and conformity.

78
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.000
And I think all of our corporate cultures present us with some of these

79
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:55.740
challenges.
What works,

80
00:04:55.741 --> 00:04:59.340
what gets you over the next hurdle,

81
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.770
but what is tutor yourself?
So let's look at this data.

82
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.750
We've got some amazing data on what is going on in corporate America right now.

83
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.780
Uh,
we looked at 14 sectors,
including the tech sector,

84
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:17.781
and I will talk some about the specificities of the silicon valley challenge.

85
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.220
So first off,
uh,

86
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.020
I founded the task force on talent innovations some 10 years ago.

87
00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:29.580
Google has been a leader in this group for the last six years.
Uh,

88
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.770
so I have been,
uh,

89
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.190
very much involved in your talent journey here.

90
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.410
In terms of this study.

91
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.980
We have collected incredible data around what allows you to be seen as having

92
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.640
potential as being leadership material,
uh,

93
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.850
as being ready for the next big thing.
Right?

94
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.970
And one thing I want to emphasize here is executive presence.

95
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.860
It's really not about performance.

96
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.710
It's not about whether you really do deliver the goods,
hit the numbers,

97
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.900
you know,
really no.
You'll craft and have the skills.

98
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.800
It's about what you signal about your preparedness for the next big chats

99
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.460
we find right across sector that there are three main pillars,

100
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.960
the executive presence,
which would lead us look for,
I didn't this data,

101
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:40.380
we went out to hundreds of representative leaders,
uh,

102
00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:45.100
across the private sector.
We also did a ton of focus groups and interviews.

103
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:50.101
So this really reflects a lot of data collection in terms of what is important

104
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.170
in the eyes of your boss.

105
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.360
So these are the three dimensions that think rabbit tests.

106
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.370
<v 2>Wow.</v>

107
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.230
<v 1>That is a biggie.
What we think of that would,
what comes to mind,</v>

108
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:09.350
I mean,
what do you associate with the word?
Grab a tess

109
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.260
poss confidence

110
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.860
happed in terms of being seen as a intellectual heavyweight.

111
00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:24.040
I mean,
how would you signal that?
Right.
Credibility,

112
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.670
<v 3>eloquence.</v>

113
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.960
<v 1>Remember we're talking about communication a little separately here,</v>

114
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:37.040
but are you think that that is part of the grab a task piece?

115
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.960
<v 3>It impact very good work.</v>

116
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.850
<v 1>So we have a bunch of words right that seem to describe it,</v>

117
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.930
but we probably don't know what is most important,
right?

118
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.710
So let's take a look at what the data is telling us,

119
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.390
realizing that there is some intermingling of these things.

120
00:07:58.391 --> 00:08:02.110
For instance,
you can have the most amazing haft

121
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:03.590
<v 2>okay?</v>

122
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.610
<v 1>But if you can't be compelling in how you talk about it,</v>

123
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.990
it remains locked up,
becomes a wealth of kept secret,
right?

124
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.530
So obviously these things are interlinked.
Okay?

125
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.680
So what we find in the data is the gravity tass Willie right across the spectrum

126
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:29.081
here is seen as the most important piece signal signaling to the world that you

127
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:31.640
know your stuff cold,

128
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.390
but your five questions deep on your domain of expertise that is at your

129
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:43.220
fingertips,
right?
There is a very interesting,

130
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.580
uh,
picture emerging here across ethnicity.

131
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.370
And basically what senior leaders at telling us in this survey is what they're

132
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:55.800
looking for in terms of their team.

133
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.360
That middle level managers,
they're high potential younger folks,
et Cetera.

134
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.850
As we can see whether you're Caucasian or Asian or female or male,

135
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.010
there's tremendous uniformity in terms of the rough proportions,
you know,

136
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.540
grab a test is the biggie.

137
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.880
Communication skills is the second piece that is important and then the

138
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:19.920
appearance piece seems to be quite small.

139
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.570
There are interesting differences here.
For instance,

140
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.000
for African American leaders,

141
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.990
they are particularly looking for a test and they say,
look,

142
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:34.560
we know that we struggled with this ourselves.

143
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.370
There is the specter of affirmative action.

144
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.780
They say it's as though we've got a real audition for our jobs all the time

145
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.780
because perhaps way back we got an unfair chance

146
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.300
and in our interviews we found that our gravitas seem to be a potentially big

147
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:56.070
hurdle for African American.
Want to be leaders

148
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.400
for Asian individuals,
communication is often somewhat more difficult.

149
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.920
Did you come from a B Spec fill deferential culture,
right?

150
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:09.270
And you value consensus.

151
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.600
How'd you get to be forceful enough in an American centric corporation?

152
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.560
And again,
bias very infused in this data.

153
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.060
But the main messages here is that there's tremendous agreement in terms of what

154
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:32.400
matters.
So moving on,
let's look at the top picks.

155
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.630
We presented our leaders with about 50 traits.
These are the top six

156
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.430
and again,
amazing agreement,

157
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.040
female and male leaders really picking a very similar list.

158
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.940
Top of the list there is this confidence pies.

159
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.560
Quite a bullet.
See Grace under fire.

160
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.040
Someone who can keep that cool and credibility and depression tremendously.

161
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:07.920
Admire
that.
Would you say that translated in the tech sector?

162
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.370
Is that something that is important?
I see some nods.

163
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:17.570
Many people told us in fast based industries or industries where business models

164
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:21.750
are changing,
this is particularly valued.

165
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.660
<v 2>Okay.</v>

166
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.540
<v 1>Interestingly,
charisma is number six.
Write it a little down the list.</v>

167
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.080
People are suspect are big personalities these days.

168
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.290
They prefer the,
the con confidence.

169
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.630
<v 2>Okay,</v>

170
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.600
<v 1>now,
but to decisiveness showing teeth.</v>

171
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.680
Now when we look at our middle level employees,

172
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.600
we find that women have a problem with this.
That being tough,

173
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:56.650
being really forceful can be hard for a female because she seen oftentimes as a

174
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:03.670
little unlikeable the B would gets rolled up quite a bit.

175
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.760
So there's tough showing.

176
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.260
TC is actually easier for men than for women.

177
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.310
And again,
it reflects,
uh,
the dominant culture,

178
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.310
the mainstream leaders.
You know,
there's bias here.

179
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.590
This is how it's been done by the dominant group.
Right?

180
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.820
So I need reaction here.
Is it harder?

181
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:32.330
Do you feel for a woman to be super strong minded,
uh,

182
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.880
and remain are someone who is admired?
You know,

183
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.860
two weeks ago,
Jill Abramson,

184
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:43.120
Bush shot down as the executive editor of the New York Times.
Why?

185
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.350
Well,
we probably read the press.
She was seen as pushy.

186
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.380
She was seen as abrasive.
She was seen as lacking charm.

187
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.790
She did knock a sufficiently mate nice to her,

188
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.920
particularly senior male colleagues.
She was a fabulous leader.

189
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.270
No one was criticizing her track record or what she'd done in China.

190
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.440
So it is tough,

191
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.470
particularly in somewhat traditional fields baps but if you look at number four,

192
00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:21.240
it's fascinating.
Emotional intelligence.

193
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.930
This is where we find women really do amazingly well.

194
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:30.710
There is more of an empathy factor that women are able to get out there at work.

195
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.620
And these days,
why is emotional intelligence newly prize?

196
00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:40.050
And usually on this list,
a lot of leaders said,
look,

197
00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:43.980
it's shooting up the charts didn't,
he didn't use to be on the list.

198
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.900
But now it is.
So why is emotional intelligence important?

199
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.510
If you want to be a leader,
right?

200
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.660
And your team is probably diverse,
right?

201
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.510
So sitting in someone else's shoes,

202
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.070
pretty important and valuing difference.

203
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.413
Pretty important.

204
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.370
The other thing we find is that customers and clients can be very diverse.

205
00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:15.360
They can be big global these days don't we all look and global teams.
So they'll,

206
00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:17.280
empathy builds trust

207
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.180
and you can't just be the top down command and control guy anymore.

208
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.530
I'm happy at work.
So in a way,
this is nicely mixed up.
You know,

209
00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:32.531
some of these prize attributes are more natural or perhaps more instinctual for

210
00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.280
men are this for women.

211
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:37.220
We don't know whether that's socialization or really how we're born,

212
00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:40.010
but it's devil as true.
And uh,

213
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.550
the thing that we find in the final pick here,

214
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.180
vision yes,
is prized,

215
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.700
but it measured vision.

216
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.450
One that can put data around one that you have a lot of evidence around the

217
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.000
charisma bit,
which is just,
you know,

218
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:03.620
turning people on about your path forward does not work so well anymore.

219
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.680
So moving on,
we asked leaders,

220
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.280
who is that icon who brought off grab a tests better than anyone else?

221
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:16.500
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

222
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.690
<v 1>top choice.
What's Mandela?</v>

223
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.340
We explored why he was so admired.

224
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.420
He was thought to be the complete package,

225
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.830
the extraordinary integrity force and vision nop,

226
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.830
his journey,

227
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.180
the ways in which he had and leadership,

228
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.830
but also his amazing ability to understand the power of symbolism

229
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.300
and to connect on a very human level.

230
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.540
This particular episode,
uh,
what you probably a,

231
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.440
well maybe you're all too young to remember this,

232
00:16:01.441 --> 00:16:04.890
but he was newly president of South Africa.

233
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:06.840
The rugby team,

234
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.940
the springboks had just won the world championship.
Uh,

235
00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:13.350
the springboks team,

236
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.680
we're recalcitrance Afrikaans 100% of the team,

237
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:24.380
well,
white South Africans from the,
uh,
Afrikaans group,

238
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:29.550
which was the group that had actually designed and fought for a pocket.

239
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:35.630
So this was the group that Nelson Mandela had spent 23 years in jail.

240
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.840
Poor.
But they won.

241
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.120
South Africa was the champion.

242
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:49.610
So Mandela leaps out of the stand.
Dawn's the Springbok Jersey.

243
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.020
I'm hugs the captain,
this flash round the world,

244
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:55.543
this image,

245
00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.240
because what did show was this new president was really about reconciliation and

246
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:02.834
healing

247
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.270
and this set right?

248
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:12.570
This man had the most amazing emotional intelligence as well as half

249
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.150
as well as integrity.

250
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.433
<v 2>Okay,</v>

251
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.700
<v 1>Jamie diamond's on this.
This,
do you know,
Steve Jobs is kind of on this list,</v>

252
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:27.701
although he was thought to be a little suspect because of just the eccentricity

253
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.860
of his personality.
But it's an interesting,
yes.

254
00:17:31.861 --> 00:17:35.060
Do you know what leaders choose as their icons?

255
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.190
The other thing we find out from grabbing task is how does it go badly bar?

256
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:46.030
How'd you cut yourself off at the knees so that no matter how good you're out of

257
00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:51.850
here,
so know sexual impropriety seems to be a,

258
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.030
uh,
a way in which men,
uh,
you know,
hit the skids.
Uh,

259
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.350
think of Petraeus.
Spitzer,
Robina,
you know,

260
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:04.400
Clinton was impeached after all.
Um,
you know,

261
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.910
there is a way in which a senior man,

262
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.300
I really do know that this is a way of,
uh,
getting,
uh,

263
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.980
written out,
but other,
uh,
uh,

264
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.050
behaviors that get you in trouble is a lying,

265
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.490
covering up a,
the bully piece,
you know,

266
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:30.900
does not get you anywhere these days and tends to again,

267
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:35.901
get you crossed off the list and an off color or racially insensitive set of

268
00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:37.650
remarks.
We'll do the same.

269
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.730
Mitt Romney famously was seen as someone who had a tin ear,

270
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.650
was clueless about how most people lived.
He was in this bubble.

271
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.630
It was such a privilege man.
He,
uh,
really didn't know how the world work,

272
00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.200
so he could talk about having binders full of women or he could tell the world

273
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:01.764
that,
you know,

274
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.920
47% of the population were losers because they were on benefits and he included,

275
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.140
um,
uh,

276
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:15.060
veterans and the disabled in terms of the losers on his list.
Uh,
in other words,

277
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:20.061
the reason he lost that election was that he was so profoundly insensitive as to

278
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.960
how other people lived or what their challenges were out of course,

279
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.670
is in the middle of his scandal right now.
He's seen as a bully.

280
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:37.170
He's seen as someone who trying to cover up.
And again,
you know,

281
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:40.470
you couldn't see the blunders as being,
uh,

282
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.680
elements which will probably be a ensure that he does not run for president next

283
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:48.024
time rock.

284
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.300
So he has some tactics.

285
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.323
How do deal

286
00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.360
with some of these issues that are problematic for you?
For instance,

287
00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.530
if you're a woman,
how do you make your force?

288
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.710
You are very strong opinions.

289
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.060
Your track record really saying,

290
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.890
we did lots of interviews for this research and you know,

291
00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:24.891
maybe you sugar coat your strength with some humor or you when you have a

292
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:32.520
massively important,
a new campaign that you totally believe it,

293
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:37.050
you also go on some kind of charm offensive to make sure that people find it

294
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:37.884
palatable.

295
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:43.490
Maybe you do none of the above because you know your non negotiables and there's

296
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:50.391
no way in which you want to bend your demeanor

297
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.060
or your approach to just please

298
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.820
the culture you're in.

299
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.810
So I think we all face tension here.

300
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.680
Maybe we all willing to bend at the margins if one is a,

301
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.453
uh,

302
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.300
a man who has lived in a pretty straight arrow environment,

303
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.400
the way you bend at the ages,

304
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.420
I really listening for bias in your environment and forcing yourself to

305
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:33.160
understand the other,
right?
So again,
you know,

306
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:38.161
we find that the tension between authenticity and conformity between standing in

307
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:44.260
and standing out,
uh,
you know,
is really permeates these things.

308
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.520
But by and large,

309
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:51.090
women do need to understand that making this dress somehow work for them

310
00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:00.450
is a challenge in a lot of organizational culture and for men figuring out how

311
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:05.560
to show empathy.
Yeah.
Again,

312
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:11.050
a commonplace challenge in their teamwork.

313
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.640
The other thing I wanted to say is,
uh,

314
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:21.210
if fuel reputation and the wood at the water cooler precedes you,

315
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.810
how would you signal

316
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:33.050
your reputation,
your statue,
in ways that aren't annoying?
You know,

317
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.380
you're in a company,
I guess,
which doesn't have a whole lot of titles,
right?

318
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.640
So sometimes it's a little hard to show your experience.

319
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.490
I show you're legally credentials.

320
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.780
So any ideas here in terms of how to again,

321
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.560
just signal that gravitas somehow established from the get go in a meeting that

322
00:22:57.771 --> 00:23:02.120
you know what you're talking about,
that you have,
uh,

323
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.290
the chops.
Is that an issue at Google?

324
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.740
It is in a lot of young,
you know,

325
00:23:09.741 --> 00:23:12.920
highly geared companies,

326
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.590
few are hired in a,

327
00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:18.110
there's this wonderful assumption that of course you're exceptional.

328
00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.600
You're still faced with how do you stand out at Google?
How do you progress?

329
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.830
How do you end up by being tapped on the shoulder for?

330
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.640
It's a major opportunity because we know that they're given,
not not to everyone,

331
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.800
but to those who are seen as ready.
Uh,
so I,
I think,
you know,

332
00:23:36.801 --> 00:23:40.580
this is true of all organizations,
but I thought that was very well expressed.

333
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.900
Thank you.
So let's move on and take a look at a communication

334
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.190
because in some ways,
this is the way in

335
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.740
we find this is oftentimes the icebreaker.

336
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.600
So the top pick and it's very contemporary,

337
00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.760
the ability to have kind of this mini Ted talk,

338
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.160
that concise,
compelling value add huge.

339
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:11.411
Um,

340
00:24:11.411 --> 00:24:16.411
what we find is that leaders particularly price this,

341
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.490
if you couldn't do it seemingly extemporaneously,

342
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:27.340
it's the kiss of death to rely on notes.
Oh,

343
00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:32.210
too many slides you got to win,
which goes to your point.

344
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.040
This is very hard to bring off.

345
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.380
Not only is it valued in a very fast moving,

346
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.540
um,
incredibly talented cultures like a Google,

347
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.490
but this is true,
you know,
in media on,
on Wall Street.
Uh,
you know,
uh,

348
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.990
at Walmart,
I mean,
this is a demand of the modern workplace.

349
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.030
Attention spans are short,

350
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:57.570
<v 2>okay.</v>

351
00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:02.430
<v 1>To find your voice,
to make it be heard.</v>

352
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.730
The concise,
compelling thing is a must.

353
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

354
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.720
<v 1>On,
it's not easy.
And again,
my own story,</v>

355
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:15.280
I had some pretty terrible habits 12 years ago.

356
00:25:15.281 --> 00:25:19.450
I just spent a bunch of years in academia being a professor,

357
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.160
a very boring professor,
I think.
But,
uh,

358
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.740
I was doing intermediate macro theory is my main thing,
right?

359
00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:31.090
So hard to make that too lightly.
But he was,

360
00:25:31.091 --> 00:25:33.820
he admired style in my department.

361
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.430
You delivered information in 15 minute chunks.

362
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.970
You known people with Abbott turns right and,

363
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:45.760
and very complex proofs.
Try that out on a book tour.

364
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.540
I was a disaster.
I couldn't do anything without my notes.

365
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.740
So I made myself walk ship.

366
00:25:56.741 --> 00:26:01.090
It's particularly bad interview I did on Charlie rose,

367
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.120
which was particularly galling because it was a big chance to get my message out

368
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:11.050
and I was terrible.
I was just yawn inducing and I really was a,

369
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.430
with my three by five cards,
you know,

370
00:26:12.431 --> 00:26:17.431
I could not let go of the notes and I force myself to learn what was going wrong

371
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.560
and did I practice practice like crazy.

372
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.950
And before I went to any meeting or made any speech I bang did into my brain.

373
00:26:34.501 --> 00:26:36.570
So I knew the AUC of what I was going to say.

374
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.600
And I knew three different Bush.

375
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:41.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

376
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:46.440
<v 1>Just in case the conversation went in a different direction or someone said what</v>

377
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:50.160
I was about to say and I learned to tell stories,

378
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.713
<v 2>not long story.</v>

379
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.560
<v 1>So it can be low.
Well,
it's dark could be luck,
but that</v>

380
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.820
is how you get your confidence.

381
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.520
This is why you know communication is often the way to build the gravity.

382
00:27:06.521 --> 00:27:08.450
Last piece that we were talking about earlier

383
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.550
because it establishes your credibility.

384
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.310
I didn't insure us

385
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:17.803
<v 2>that you'll hurt.</v>

386
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.931
<v 1>Okay,</v>

387
00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:25.931
so how do you move that into the ability to command a space?

388
00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:30.020
A room was the team room or an audience and that is the linked one,

389
00:27:30.021 --> 00:27:32.370
which is at the top of the list here.

390
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:38.470
This requires a bunch of other things which are actually the surround sound.

391
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.100
It's positive.
How do you sit at a table,

392
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.190
how do you stand in a space?

393
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.270
Some of it is just he knows trading that backbone

394
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:55.310
<v 2>and looking competent,
paying attention.</v>

395
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:02.890
<v 1>The other piece of it is to let go of that which is between you and your</v>

396
00:28:05.181 --> 00:28:06.014
audience.

397
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.780
<v 2>Podiums spectacles and again notes.</v>

398
00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.310
Get rid of the
and devices,

399
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.740
eye contact,
eye contact,
eye contact.

400
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.360
<v 1>So we find that,
you know,</v>

401
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.430
we're rolling out a whole bunch of high touch workshops up like this around eep.

402
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.180
This is where one can be transformative

403
00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.720
really rather easily.
Any comments in terms of this culture,

404
00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:44.560
what works here
or what is problematic here?

405
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.570
<v 2>Yeah.
So,</v>

406
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.560
<v 1>but if you have in your mind,
uh,</v>

407
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.870
a playbook arb,

408
00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.280
exactly what you can say,
uh,

409
00:29:00.281 --> 00:29:03.630
several versions of it,
which,
you know,
we'll grab,

410
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.740
<v 2>it's easier to do that or manipulation of that general conversation together.</v>

411
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:15.610
<v 1>So is this a brilliant example of having your emotional intelligence connect</v>

412
00:29:16.431 --> 00:29:17.750
with your communication skills?

413
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.430
Because you know that the leaders need to take ownership of this idea.

414
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.560
You've got to prod them along,

415
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.300
you've got to become indispensable and you've suddenly got to be value add,

416
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.193
right?

417
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.360
But this can be transformative of ones.
How you see,

418
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.250
right?
Um,
are your own

419
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:48.070
confidence.
Okay.
So moving on,
uh,

420
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:53.320
what was the top pick here?
Interestingly,
a woman,
um,

421
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.910
Sheryl off course,
we all know,

422
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.600
not only is she seeing him someone of enormous credibility,

423
00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:03.580
but her communication skills,
right?
She did do that Ted talk,

424
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.540
right?
One of the most,

425
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.740
I think it was the most watched ted talk that particular year because she has

426
00:30:08.741 --> 00:30:09.730
this ability

427
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:16.290
of delivering a clear message and then revealing some of our own vulnerability.

428
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.620
So you can relate to her.

429
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.320
She would be obnoxious if she did not do that because you know,

430
00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:28.210
this is a person who's had a golden path.

431
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.250
<v 2>Okay,</v>

432
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.360
<v 1>how do we relate to someone like that?
But she tells us,
you know,</v>

433
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:37.450
that she put on 60 pounds with that first child.
And you know,

434
00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:40.570
some of her struggles,
I mean,
you can reveal any part of you.

435
00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.320
It doesn't have to obviously be family.
You probably shouldn't overshare.

436
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.620
But this is part of embassy

437
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.650
sharing our roots,
you know,
sharing a little piece of failure

438
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.290
and it makes her someone that people want to hear.

439
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.660
And this other thing about the blunders,
because again,

440
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:08.370
we did look at the blunders.
Are we see again,
bias all over these blunders.

441
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:13.670
The interesting thing about bias is that executive presence is oftentimes the

442
00:31:14.641 --> 00:31:17.340
place where you see bias revealed

443
00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.660
because you're talking about a leadership archetype,
right?

444
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.520
That crying take right?

445
00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.940
Turns out men can cry.

446
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:33.920
Women cannot in the workplace,
think of,

447
00:31:33.921 --> 00:31:37.520
um,
Obama's speech around Trayvon Martin.

448
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.680
He led a few tears

449
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.990
<v 3>out of his eyes.
We liked him for that.</v>

450
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:49.840
It showed that this really distant man had hot

451
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.950
<v 1>and connected to the tragedy of this young person's life.</v>

452
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.400
But when women cry in public,

453
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.490
they're seen as just way too emotional,

454
00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.180
<v 3>who can deal with them,</v>

455
00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.840
kind of saying it takes us down and our statue.

456
00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.660
<v 1>So if we look at this lists,</v>

457
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.690
we know that we want a world where there isn't so much bias,

458
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.890
uh,
such a,
you know,
a gendered for instance,

459
00:32:21.891 --> 00:32:24.020
take on what leadership needs to look like.

460
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.860
But this is what's happening this week,
next week,
last week.

461
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:32.890
This is how people are judged because this is data in terms of what leaders

462
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:36.050
right now find does not work.

463
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.890
One day,
which I find interesting.

464
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:43.790
The number one blunder is constant device checking.

465
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.980
Leaders find that profoundly discourteous,
um,

466
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:55.150
profoundly undermining up a more junior person's gravitas that they are not able

467
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.930
<v 2>to pay full attention.</v>

468
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.220
<v 1>So what is the deal at Google?
Because you know,
I think</v>

469
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:14.220
high silicon valley,
you know,
devices must be so omnipresent.
Um,

470
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.660
but is there a kind of unwritten etiquette here in terms of what happens in key

471
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:21.794
meetings?

472
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.560
What about iPhones?

473
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.480
I think he get someone who's holding this or maybe it's not an iPhone,
maybe it's

474
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.080
an android.
So tell me what the,
the,
the,

475
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.013
<v 2>uh,</v>

476
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:46.010
<v 1>behavior,
you know,
the dominant behaviors,</v>

477
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:53.690
but if it gets in the way of you making eye contact with your boss and weighing

478
00:33:56.551 --> 00:34:01.551
in with your power source and doing the clever stuff of linking your emotional

479
00:34:05.281 --> 00:34:09.140
sense of who is really needing to buy in,

480
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:12.960
in this meeting to my idea and how do I demonstrate my,

481
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.003
<v 2>uh,</v>

482
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.950
<v 1>indispensability to this project going forward?</v>

483
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.360
It truly does get it away.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I know,

484
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.950
I'm not saying you personally don't feel it as an attack.
You see what,

485
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:32.570
what leaders say,
no matter what the technology,
no matter what the value add of,

486
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:32.930
you know,

487
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:37.930
being able to complete your sense of some link or whatever the most important

488
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.820
activity,
the main,

489
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.160
uh,
goal of meeting is

490
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.800
to leave it.
Having impressed,

491
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:03.030
having pushed the ball forward and having a newly central role

492
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:09.350
and whatever was decided.
So,

493
00:35:09.351 --> 00:35:13.550
I mean I do feel,
I mean,
uh,
I have five kids,
so I have,

494
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.200
I am in touch with,

495
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:20.010
I mean I don't tend to use devices that much because of my age.
Right.
You know,

496
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:24.140
it's not a habit I have,
uh,
developed.
Uh,

497
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.850
but I do feel that there is a way in which we can undermine ourselves.

498
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.810
And one thing that is valued above all other things by senior leaders is eye

499
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:43.701
contact and having the full attention of a younger person.

500
00:35:44.131 --> 00:35:47.790
They bet here.
Okay.

501
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.840
So some more or less humorous examples of what people feel,

502
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.420
uh,
has gone wrong in terms of public displays of this.

503
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.780
Tim Geitner famously cannot make eye contact.

504
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.670
He always accused of looking Naca,

505
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.880
frightened teenager because he deflects,
um,

506
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.190
eye contact.

507
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:14.190
He almost cannot do it tremendously undermined his credibility

508
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:21.470
and the forcefulness assertiveness of statements coming from women of color

509
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:23.280
really on display.

510
00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:28.281
I think with Indra Nucci she gave a very famous speech or not long ago at the

511
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:32.640
Columbia business school where she took on American,

512
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:34.020
our arrogance in the world.

513
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:39.660
She was coming from a very secure place.
Uh,

514
00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:43.740
she was born and brought up in India.
She's been,
you know,

515
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.730
very successful global executives and she is CEO of Pepsi.

516
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.930
But because she's a woman of color,

517
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.290
she got trashed by the press,

518
00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:03.370
which I totally buy white guy reporters who saw her as out of line the

519
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:10.260
criticizing a country that she had done so well.

520
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.970
So,
you know,
again,
you know that the degree of forcefulness,

521
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.660
the degree of edginess you can show as a woman of color,

522
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.360
really constrained by bias,

523
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:26.370
by the stereotypes and the archetypes of leadership.

524
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.270
Okay?
So we all know this,

525
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:35.271
that 80% meet you first time online and you better make sure that you're very

526
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:38.820
happy with your linkedin,
you know,

527
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.880
manifestations and that you are showing up online in ways that you're proud of.

528
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.880
This is where colleagues and bosses,

529
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.740
where folks who are perhaps interviewing you for an opportunity will really

530
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:53.970
first meet you.

531
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.950
And I'm sure you all know that very profoundly here.

532
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.810
So I view tactics first,

533
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:08.640
I lose the prompts,
get rid of the security blankets.

534
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.730
We find that women use,
uh,

535
00:38:12.731 --> 00:38:15.600
about one third more PowerPoint sides of men

536
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:22.370
because women oftentimes feel that they have to show that they're super well

537
00:38:22.671 --> 00:38:24.840
prepared,
that they really did do all our homework.

538
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.400
Oftentimes they feel that there are very few of them around the table,

539
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:30.870
particularly a more senior levels.

540
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:35.871
So they have to show how much work they put into this presentation.

541
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.800
But what it does,

542
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:43.801
it undermines them because you do above all the to show you can wing it that,

543
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:49.120
you know,
you stopped cold,
I contact

544
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.080
lower your voice.
This is interesting.

545
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.370
Voices go up under pressure and a stretch

546
00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:00.710
keeping

547
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.450
obvious control,

548
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.040
not speeding up,
not lifting your voice.

549
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.400
Very important in terms of being heard.

550
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:18.850
We've been using some opera coaches in the workshops we are doing around Erp and

551
00:39:20.751 --> 00:39:25.310
it's fascinating how much you can manipulate your voice.

552
00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.660
So as your herd,
and again,

553
00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:33.840
it's got nothing to do with accident.
Most opera singers,
you know,

554
00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:36.150
don't speak any other languages very well at they sing it.

555
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.920
It's all about tone and projection.

556
00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:42.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

557
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.500
<v 1>And the last one you silence as a weapon.</v>

558
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.670
It's probably a little hard to do at Google because you're describing a very

559
00:39:49.671 --> 00:39:53.750
crowded meeting,
um,

560
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.150
culture where people are

561
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.750
fighting for space,
right?

562
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.880
But in some cultures and on Wall Street is a very good example.

563
00:40:04.881 --> 00:40:07.220
I did an amazing interview with Sally Korczak,

564
00:40:07.221 --> 00:40:09.290
who was head of Merrill Lynch for many years.

565
00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.920
She said that as a southern woman,

566
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:18.160
she was brought up to fill all space with words,

567
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.243
Chitty chat,

568
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:27.190
because a nice girl was supposed to make everyone else feel comfortable and

569
00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:33.560
silence was awkward.
So she made it her business to Philip all space.

570
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.410
She was totally discounted,

571
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.390
almost three because chitter chatter in southern women,
you know,

572
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:42.620
don't make much impact.

573
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.990
So what she learned to do was become much more economical.

574
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.820
And what she said,
and she was an audacious,

575
00:40:52.821 --> 00:40:56.720
I mean this was a woman who did not take prisoners in terms of her viewpoints,

576
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.190
<v 2>okay?</v>

577
00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:03.190
<v 1>But she learned to surround her very important thoughts with silence</v>

578
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:13.630
to deliberately make people feel awkward so that they actually listened.

579
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:20.360
So there's all kinds of tools,
but it's,
it's a performance,
you know,
this is,

580
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:26.470
this is something that we can all manipulate and it in a way,

581
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:31.790
this isn't bias.
This is how

582
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.780
you get your boys to camp,

583
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.680
which is why I see the communication thing as the way in,
ah,

584
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.310
too many of the,
uh,

585
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.390
demands of growing competence and credibility.

586
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.670
Okay.
So into appearance,

587
00:41:50.671 --> 00:41:55.671
this is the least important is about 7% of what our leaders say as important.

588
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

589
00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.880
<v 1>Very good news here.
Grouping and Polish and being appropriate.</v>

590
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

591
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.890
<v 1>So much more important than you know,</v>

592
00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:11.720
the sheer size of your body or the texture of your hair or you know,
uh,

593
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.501
uh,

594
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:17.501
exactly what's happening to the in style that you choose to wear.

595
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.030
So what is grooming and Polish?
You know,

596
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:28.031
we find again in the data that are seemingly casual cultures can be actually a

597
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.680
potter figure out then formal cultures and there are weird trip wires.

598
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.313
For instance,
you know,

599
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:41.500
remember the IPO of Facebook or the Hoodie Schlubby nerdy people and then they

600
00:42:42.531 --> 00:42:46.730
were Sheryl Sandberg looking quite formal because it's hard to do the hoodie

601
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.150
thing.
And look leaderly if you're a woman,

602
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.720
it's pretty easy to look like a graduate student or someone's assistant,

603
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.970
you know.
In other words,

604
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.870
it is surprisingly tough to negotiate casual cultures and somehow crack it

605
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.900
because there are admired styles even though that would seem to be few rules.

606
00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.230
Uh,
one thing that I experienced last summer is,
um,

607
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.790
I was invited to the advertising,
um,

608
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.290
celebration in a can where they give the awards in the industry.

609
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:28.130
It's called the Cannes lions awards.
And uh,

610
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:33.260
it's a little like 1963 and that only 3% of the creative directors,

611
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:38.150
uh,
in the top 50 advertising companies are female.

612
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.710
This is largely a male crowd.
Uh,
it's the rockstars,
you know,

613
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.130
giving each other awards and it's profoundly mail.

614
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.520
So you walk in and you try and figure out what the lockets and it hits you

615
00:43:51.831 --> 00:43:52.730
between the eyes.

616
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:58.390
There was almost a uniform four day old stubble within,

617
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.940
I mean,
they didn't have a whole lot of hair on their heads,

618
00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:06.050
so they were trying to look very natural,
I think.

619
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.250
And then there were the bespoke shorts.

620
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:12.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

621
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.500
<v 1>The incredibly expensive watches and flip flops.</v>

622
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.533
That was it.

623
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.390
The few women in the room did not want know what to do.

624
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.830
I mean that they couldn't quite do the stubble saying that what I'm done a much

625
00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:31.830
good.
Right.
And you know,
the shoe thing is hard

626
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.240
because mostly,
mostly the [inaudible].

627
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.230
These would be the net 50 say went the pinnacle of their careers.

628
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:42.590
Most women don't look that great short 50 well either.

629
00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:45.250
So,
you know,

630
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:49.810
I guess what I'm trying to say is that there was a code in this room,

631
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:56.000
but it was a tough one.
I really tough one.
So you know,

632
00:44:56.001 --> 00:45:00.770
again,
what we say is find yourself,
you know,
some role models.

633
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.730
Find what works,
you know,
in your micro climate.

634
00:45:04.731 --> 00:45:09.731
Because I imagined that tech and sales and HR have different demands even at

635
00:45:10.581 --> 00:45:11.414
Google.

636
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.290
<v 4>Okay?</v>

637
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.020
<v 1>Because you got to get rid of this.
I mean,
it's not very important,</v>

638
00:45:15.021 --> 00:45:18.560
but it's good not to have this get in your way.

639
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.480
Because the thing about appearance is the first filter,
right?

640
00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:28.370
If you get it profoundly wrong and turn up looking like,
you know,

641
00:45:28.371 --> 00:45:31.070
Hillary Clinton in your pants suits it can,
you know,

642
00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:35.600
it would not do you much good.
So it's not that in the end it's important,

643
00:45:35.601 --> 00:45:40.010
but it is surprisingly tricky.
So,
um,

644
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:40.701
again,

645
00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:45.410
admired folks in terms of the well put together piece.

646
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.690
Uh,
Christine Lagarde thought to be the very elegant,
you know,
uh,
executive woman.

647
00:45:50.691 --> 00:45:55.010
It's great that she's allowed to have white hair.
And then of course,

648
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.960
cancer is hugely admired for his style.
And you know,
uh,

649
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.990
we find that the other thing that was a big tip from this work is that looking

650
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:09.050
as though your toned and fit is very important.

651
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:14.570
It's actually much more important than say,
being physically,

652
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:19.880
uh,
uh,
attractive in some,
you know,
chocolate box way.

653
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.230
You've got to look as though you have some resilience these days.
You know,

654
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:29.270
jobs are demanding to,
to show that you actually work out and you can,

655
00:46:29.271 --> 00:46:33.200
you know,
deal with the travel and deal with the long work weeks.
Uh,

656
00:46:33.201 --> 00:46:37.520
you are signaling vigor and resilience.
Yes.

657
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.810
No,
no.
It's interesting.
It's not,
we tested that,
uh,

658
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:49.930
and it was particularly important for African American talent that we test that,

659
00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.080
uh,
we are very forgiving.
I mean within some limit,
you know,

660
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.580
being obese is not a good idea,

661
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:59.870
but if you are clearly looking after yourself and fit,

662
00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:04.010
there's a big range,
which is actually very good news.

663
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.073
Um,

664
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:10.370
and then finally the weird way in which women really are scrutinized more than

665
00:47:10.371 --> 00:47:11.610
men.
Uh,

666
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:17.500
700 people were invited to look at these pictures for 250 millisecond.

667
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.820
At 86% of them decided a silvery quickly.

668
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.610
Which one of these one,
two,
three,

669
00:47:25.611 --> 00:47:29.590
or four was the most competent.
The leisurely

670
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:35.890
<v 3>we should number
four,</v>

671
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.890
<v 1>she was seen as being in control and they get together.</v>

672
00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:48.460
Number one got no marks.
But when asked,

673
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.650
which one is the most trustworthy
to whatnot,

674
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.300
so it's treacherous,
right?

675
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.980
Wouldn't you want to be a competent,
trustworthy leader?

676
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.070
I that just remind ourselves,
you know,
men don't have to deal with this and told,

677
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.000
unless you're a TV anchor,
you know,

678
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:14.590
we're in the business of makeup so women do get scrutinized more.
So,
you know,

679
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:17.980
that's the day two.
And,
uh,
I,
uh,

680
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:21.190
I'm just going to end with this last slide.

681
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.510
Women and also people of color.

682
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.990
Multicultural folks have little attitudes,

683
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.850
less latitude than the main stream leader type.
You know,
again,

684
00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:35.260
the power of bias,

685
00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:39.340
the power of the existing models of leadership.

686
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.090
So it's very easy to be seen as,
you know,

687
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:48.370
too provocative to dowdy,
too pushy,
too self depreciating.

688
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.170
The one I love is,
you know,
too young,
too old as one,

689
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:56.320
very easy to be seen as too inexperienced and not ready,

690
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.430
but also easy to be seen as over the hill.
Right?

691
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.100
There are three years in there when we're just right

692
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:09.280
men as a whole get 17 years.
So,
you know,
there is,
you know,

693
00:49:09.281 --> 00:49:14.281
this gendered thing going on and clearly this does Pete so,

694
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:20.670
so much into the amazing work that Google is doing on buyers because there is a

695
00:49:22.181 --> 00:49:26.500
need to widen and make more inclusive.

696
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.630
How we see leadership in terms of

697
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:37.160
<v 3>how we act,
how we speak and how we look.</v>

698
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.780
<v 1>But if we're interested in dealing with figuring out how to succeed</v>

699
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.460
<v 3>this week,
this data's pretty important.</v>

700
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:47.703
So thank you.

701
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.840
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

702
00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:02.340
<v 1>my question is around the makeup piece.
There's conflicting evidence.</v>

703
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:07.920
What would you do if you are a woman in terms of what amount of makeup that you

704
00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:12.730
would wear?
You know,
I think it's the kind of well put together saying,

705
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.520
you know,
I kind of good version of you.

706
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.410
You certainly don't want to come out over as you know,
someone quite different.

707
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:20.483
Uh,

708
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:25.080
faking some persona is not a good idea,

709
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:29.690
but it does seem you get for effort that,

710
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:30.290
you know,

711
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:35.290
it's good to show that you have put some energy into looking good.

712
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.280
Uh,
it shows respect for yourself,
respect for the team.
Uh,

713
00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.800
and perhaps respect for other stakeholders.

714
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.200
Dishevelment uh,
you know,
both men and women you get,

715
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.940
and I think it was a given as part of the example.
You know,

716
00:50:55.941 --> 00:51:00.200
that you've got to look as though you're didn't just fall out of bed,
you know,

717
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:02.420
the,
uh,
you

718
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:09.150
put some effort into showing up ready.
Um,

719
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:12.180
so it was making sound informed decisions,

720
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:16.260
something that leaders just don't consider
it.

721
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:17.950
That is a performance,

722
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.520
this is not performance.
This is how you signal.

723
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.110
What do you telegraph in terms of how you act,

724
00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.750
speak and look.

725
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.370
Judgment calls.
Incredibly important.

726
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:41.200
There's another ton of books on that,
right?
This is about,

727
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.540
um,
your image,

728
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.720
but it's about 30% of that basic because it does allow you to be tapped on the

729
00:51:53.341 --> 00:51:57.900
shoulder for some big opportunity you then might screw up,
right?

730
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.580
You don't deliver the right stuff in terms of performance,
in terms of,
you know,

731
00:52:02.581 --> 00:52:03.990
the great judgment calls,

732
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:11.150
but how would you stand apart from the crowd?

733
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:14.550
How would you get singled out in the first place?
And,
uh,

734
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:18.290
given the shot I had a big opportunity.

735
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:25.400
No,
I'm not trying to say that there aren't some fundamental,
uh,
performance,
uh,

736
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:30.110
you know,
elements that,
uh,
in the end will fuel your journey.

737
00:52:30.111 --> 00:52:35.111
But this is really about the telegraphing of confidence,

738
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:41.480
the ability to be compelling about what you have to say

739
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:46.980
and the ability to look the pot enough

740
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.350
<v 3>so that you don't get knocked off the list.</v>

741
00:52:51.351 --> 00:52:55.730
Because of the fact you've got super near tile.
I don't know what the,

742
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.480
you know,

743
00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:01.480
there's a lot of things that you could no ties a soup on your tee shirt.

744
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.770
Who knows.
There are,
you know,
very culturally specific things.

745
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:12.040
<v 1>And if I were to choose my category of,
of what really,</v>

746
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.490
<v 3>uh,
is,
um,</v>

747
00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:21.210
magical and turbo charging a progression,

748
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:23.620
it is the communication piece.

749
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.100
<v 1>Yes.
No,
Yay.
Totally,
totally on.</v>

750
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:37.101
It needs to be evolved always because you know the demands of the ear or cheek.

751
00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:39.693
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

752
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:45.030
You give the example of Sheryl Sandberg and how she shares personal anecdotes

753
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.320
just to relate to people better.

754
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:51.650
Do you feel that if like women share the personal stories about their families,

755
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:56.100
they will come across as more emotional?
Yeah.

756
00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:00.300
<v 1>No,
that's a great story.
You can totally over share and,
um,</v>

757
00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.900
it's not a good idea to weigh your family on your sleeve.

758
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.940
<v 3>Um,
that tends to undermine a,</v>

759
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:16.450
your edge because there's a lot of bias around working moms.

760
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.000
<v 1>But I'll tell you a story.</v>

761
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.700
I interviewed someone who is head of the global yeah.

762
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:27.150
<v 3>Division that American Express last week.
Uh,
he's African American.</v>

763
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:33.790
<v 1>He was wrestling with the challenge of connecting to his global team.</v>

764
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:38.220
His team is spread around,
I dunno,
52

765
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:39.243
<v 3>countries</v>

766
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:44.630
and obviously much off his contact is virtual.

767
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.260
<v 1>He is seen as an enormously,</v>

768
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.880
<v 3>um,
effective leader.</v>

769
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.950
He is much a love it.
I wanted to know how he did it.

770
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.790
<v 1>He understands the importance of</v>

771
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:09.990
<v 2>okay</v>

772
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:14.710
<v 1>being known
to his key</v>

773
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:19.990
people around the world.
So he goes to,
you know,

774
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:24.050
every market one supporter and does a town hall.

775
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.680
He also does monthly phone calls so that it's not just email and you know,

776
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.030
uh,

777
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:37.850
really abstract kind of connection.
So I say,
well,

778
00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:42.851
what do you do at these town halls or what do you do on those calls that make

779
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:48.200
you so beloved?
I mean,

780
00:55:48.201 --> 00:55:52.040
he's a great before and he does all the other step two but he's seen as someone

781
00:55:52.041 --> 00:55:52.880
you want to go work for.

782
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.673
<v 2>Okay.</v>

783
00:55:55.730 --> 00:56:00.730
<v 1>He tells stories for the surface three minutes,</v>

784
00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.650
you know,
not a whole bunch of time.
I mean,

785
00:56:03.651 --> 00:56:05.540
there's our business like it needs to get done right.

786
00:56:05.541 --> 00:56:10.100
And these very precious one hour phone calls.
He said,

787
00:56:10.101 --> 00:56:15.090
for instance,
he did a call out of London and the buffer,
uh,

788
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.130
awards,
we're just going on.
He loves.

789
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:23.770
So he told why he was totally rooting for this and invited folks to get back to

790
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.970
on this movie and you know,
give him some sense of what they love to.

791
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.700
Uh,
and he said,
look,
it's so simple,
but the fact that they knew that,

792
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:41.380
you know,
I kind of totally screwed up the weekend because I had a seal.

793
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:44.170
All these movies,
I mean,
mating human,
you know,
in,

794
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:47.200
in a way that was very,

795
00:56:47.201 --> 00:56:49.330
very important in building trust.

796
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.050
Sometimes a little deeper than that.
For instance,

797
00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:54.820
he grew up in the projects of Oakland

798
00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:59.470
and the first legs of his career were full of struggle.

799
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.150
He'll chat a little piece of that,
not much,

800
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:06.940
because you don't want to kind of kiss all,
you know,

801
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:10.390
kiss and tell all kinds of thing that's not gonna work.
You know,

802
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:13.540
you two need to stay in the business,

803
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:18.310
a strategic world.
So,
you know,

804
00:57:18.311 --> 00:57:21.820
oftentimes it's not family.
It can be roots,
it can be passions.

805
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:24.220
But to reveal another dimension of yourself.

806
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.750
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

807
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:30.520
<v 1>Is this empathy thing.
Uh,
and allows,</v>

808
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.100
he said then people read his emails

809
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:37.450
with a different mindset.
They think they know him.

810
00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.400
So you know,
there are things that are quite simple that,
you know,

811
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.090
create a,
an aura of

812
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.900
your ability to lead.

813
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:57.090
Just a bit of a comment on what you were saying.
I think that the,

814
00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:59.860
the sharing thing,
it shows you as a leader,

815
00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:03.590
but when you're lowish and the organization and you're looking up,
yeah,

816
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:07.060
sharing is not generally very valuable.
That's a very good,

817
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:11.320
that's a very wise point.
It actually goes against your job.
But you see,

818
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:15.610
I think that it's not a to two wells,

819
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:16.510
uh,

820
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:21.510
many people in this room both lead small teams and,

821
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:26.550
uh,
our junior in other contexts.
And,
you know,
the,

822
00:58:26.551 --> 00:58:30.700
it's the rare person who doesn't have a sphere of influence.

823
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.033
But you're right,

824
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.380
it is particularly magical coming from someone who's seen it.
So,
um,

825
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.820
I think at Google I feel a lot more comfortable being myself and,
you know,

826
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:47.630
sharing more than I have elsewhere because there's just turned to Lee.

827
00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:51.560
More respect.
People treat each other really well.
Um,

828
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.770
but I just still have a question about,
you know,

829
00:58:53.771 --> 00:58:56.350
as a woman being able to share things where,

830
00:58:56.351 --> 00:58:59.170
because I've seen these things done very badly.

831
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:04.060
So is there a bad way to share information about,

832
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.080
you know,
so that you're bringing your whole person to work as opposed to having

833
00:59:08.081 --> 00:59:12.100
completely different personas of work and you know,
your personal life.

834
00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:15.280
One type of sharing,
which is incredibly effective

835
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.680
is how you get feedback.
Right?

836
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.990
Again,
in the data,

837
00:59:23.991 --> 00:59:28.991
we find that a very few high-potential Yancha people get unvarnished feedback.

838
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:34.280
Uh,
senior folks can't be bothered.

839
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:39.281
They avoid it because it can be embarrassing to give honest feedback sometimes,

840
00:59:39.741 --> 00:59:44.240
particularly across lines of gender or race.
So it doesn't happen.

841
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:50.270
It happens between mini me's
again,
you know,

842
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:55.300
straight Caucasian guys from the right schools do a lot of sharing on the

843
00:59:58.041 --> 01:00:01.490
feedback part,
but oftentimes at a very diverse,
uh,

844
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:03.770
in a very diverse workplace.

845
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:07.250
Very little feedback happens and we get a lot of data on this.

846
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.010
So how do you get feedback and how do you give it

847
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:20.870
and revealing some of your aspirations?

848
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.750
Some of your,
um,

849
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:28.380
sense of where you see,
uh,

850
01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:32.090
your journey going isn't magical in this regard.

851
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:38.170
If a younger person says to a supervisor or a mentor or a sponsor or a manager,

852
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:44.240
I'm giving this presentation next week,

853
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:49.520
I'm really white hot.
You know,
I think I can nail this,

854
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.770
but there are two areas where I feel I could do some fine tuning.

855
01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:59.420
Can you listen and pay attention and give me feedback?

856
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.900
I mean,
there's ways of presenting this that do not make you vulnerable.
I mean,

857
01:01:05.901 --> 01:01:10.010
you're saying,
look,
I got it.
I'm excited.
I'm going to do it well,

858
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:14.360
but please pay attention to this,
that,
or the other seat.

859
01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:19.040
It opens the doors the most amazing day,
useful feedback.

860
01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.950
And similarly,
you can do that about,
uh,
you know,

861
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:31.430
the way you present yourself in other ways and the older person or the most

862
01:01:31.891 --> 01:01:35.760
senior person,
you know,
feels permission to be real.

863
01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:40.260
And of course,
that's how you grow.
Thank you so much.

864
01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:43.560
Amazing conversation.
Enjoyed the questions.

865
01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:45.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>
