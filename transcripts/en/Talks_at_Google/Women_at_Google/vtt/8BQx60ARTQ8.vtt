1
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.120
Dude,
what did you call me?
He stopped talking like that.

2
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.610
I have a philosophical question.
Ooh,
I love those.
Go ahead.

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.740
<v 0>Do you think our social station is circle mountable or is it a mutable Oh,</v>

4
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.810
good question.
Immutable.
Oh no,

5
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:26.230
but don't you think we can overcome our circumstances given sufficient cutting

6
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:27.010
and skill?

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.630
<v 1>No.
No I don't,
but I'm not like you yearning.</v>

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.630
The fly beyond nature is boundaries.
Like some sort of disabled nerd ICARUS.

9
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.310
Anyway,
why do you ask?

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.540
<v 0>Oh,
no reason.
Buckingham,
but Barbie,
it's just that,
uh,</v>

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.690
I've got plans for a date a day.

12
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.250
<v 1>You,
who's going to date you?</v>

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.620
<v 0>Well,
I was thinking of grabbing a date to the city.
Hawkins.</v>

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.130
<v 1>No,
I get it.
You think by going to the dance,</v>

15
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:51.620
you'll seem like less of a creepy renaissance.
Fair talking Weirdo.

16
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.330
We'll and Ri specify circumstance.
Yes.
I can help if you want.
Oh,

17
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.090
do you want to go with native dance?
Not as like a date or whatever,

18
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:03.590
but it was like friends or pass whatever.
Jerk face.

19
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.480
So like I want it to be that matchy matchy disabled cover.
Fine.
That's fine.
Okay.

20
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.920
You do know this 80 Hawkins dance is where the girl asks the guy out.
Right.

21
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.800
And I'm like the only girl that talks to you.

22
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.610
<v 0>Oh,
that's fine.
I was thinking of going with an</v>

23
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.050
<v 1>and Margaret,
but she's the most popular girl.</v>

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.370
<v 0>Formerly the most popular.
Eddie broke up with her over winter break.</v>

25
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.490
<v 1>So what?
She's still super out of your league.</v>

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.290
<v 0>Is She buck?
Is she,</v>

27
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.790
or maybe it's just that you don't know what league that I'm in?

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.730
<v 1>No,
she's out of your league.
She's hot.
She's smart.
She's super talented.</v>

29
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.890
You know she's a professional dancer,

30
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.530
<v 0>but now she's in wounded bird mode.
See if I can get her to ask me to the dance,</v>

31
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.250
then I will instantly vault paths my current inglorious station and for once

32
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.330
people might see me.

33
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.090
<v 1>Oh,
Richard had to ask Andrew the dance.</v>

34
00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:59.600
That would already be a humiliating rejections situation.

35
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.300
But getting her to ask you,
I mean,

36
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:07.301
what's your angle if gnosis or cash plus why Eddie's ex girlfriend?

37
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.760
Is it like a copycat day revenge thing,
sex thing?

38
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.780
Is it a sexual bench copycat thing?
Wait,
where's your,

39
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.180
is this a scheme?
What you always scheming.
Ha Ha.

40
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.960
Are you running for president?
What

41
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.120
is getting a day with Ann Margaret?

42
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.060
The first step is some elaborate multistep scheme for getting elected senior

43
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:33.320
class president.
It is,
isn't it?
No,

44
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.450
it's not a scheme.
I just want to date.
Yeah.

45
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.700
And I want Chris Evans to sit on my face.
Only he has to ask.
Well,

46
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.390
who's Chris?
Chris Evans is Captain America.

47
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.430
He's been captain America for like 19 movies.
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.360
Do you watch movies or you're too busy?
Tune into the voices inside your head.

49
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.820
Softer.
Soft.
Do now who talks like that?
Whatever path.
Follow your dreams.

50
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.480
<v 0>Well,
books,
right?
Of course.
Landing a date with Ann.</v>

51
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:04.670
Margaret is part of an elaborate multistep scheme.

52
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.830
If I can capture Eddie's ex girlfriend,

53
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.430
the people will know that I am the most redoubtable nave.

54
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.500
Someone who's not to be fucking with.
And so Roseland high school.

55
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.460
Prepare for your feet.
My first step to power is to land a first date.

56
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.983
<v 2>Oh,</v>

57
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.580
<v 0>and I believe you had something you wanted to ask me.
I did.
Aha.</v>

58
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.730
So go ahead.
I really can't think of anything.

59
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.500
Can you get out of my way?
Oh nope.
That's not it.
I don't know what your deal is,

60
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:41.280
but I'm not into guessing games,
Richard.
Oh,
this isn't a game.
It's an invitation.

61
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:46.130
So go ahead and bite me to say the Hawkins.
All you have to do is ask,
oh,

62
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.430
excuse me.
Look,
I know you're differently abled,

63
00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:54.210
but you got to know that's not happening.
Um,

64
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.180
because I don't like you.
You don't even know me.
I mean,

65
00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:58.590
we've known each other since middle school,

66
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:00.990
but this is the most that we've talked.
You're right.
I don't know you.

67
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:04.290
So why would I ask you out?
Cause I pity you.
Whoa.
No one's asking for pity here.

68
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.480
Why do you pity me?
Or do you fear me?

69
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.350
Are you afraid you'll contract cerebral palsy just by the very tainted my touch.

70
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.120
See,
you hate me for what I am.
No,
I don't.
I just,

71
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.680
Richard,
I don't mean to be mean.
I'm just trying to stay in my lane here.

72
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:23.280
You know?
Well,
which is it?
And pity me,
hate me or fear me.
I don't even know you.

73
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.210
I nothing you there.
Exactly.
I'm not even relevant here.
See,

74
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.850
the real reason you're going to ask me to save you Hawkins is because it's the

75
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:31.740
best way to get back in Eddie,
Eddie.

76
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.320
But I don't want to get back at Eddie really.

77
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.440
Even though he was hardcore dating you all through winter break,

78
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:41.730
only to immediately start dating Liz Woodville Eddie's dating Liz.

79
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.800
No,
he's not.
Clearly you don't follow Lids Woodville on Instagram.

80
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.593
<v 2>Okay.</v>

81
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.030
<v 0>Whatever hits done now he can date who he wants.</v>

82
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.250
I've seen you on campus in seeing the happy go lucky social butterfly cocooning

83
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:00.840
herself in a Chrysalis of melancholy and doubt.
Yeah.

84
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.260
Well it's been a really hard year,

85
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.960
but which is why it's so brave of you soldiering on like this.

86
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.610
You know something in,
I've never known the tender pleasures of dating really,

87
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.940
but then again,
I've never been unceremoniously dumped.

88
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.530
<v 2>That's okay.</v>

89
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.530
<v 0>Is that what people are saying?
Well that's right,</v>

90
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:20.170
and he's still the most popular person in school where it's you.

91
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:24.220
You were nothing now nothing.

92
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.360
I'm just me.
Well,
being you isn't enough.
Not In this rose land wasteland.

93
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.300
If Eddie and Liz Woodville go to the dance,
what's your counter attack?

94
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.780
You even need a counter attack.
I swear to God.
High school drama.

95
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.810
Such bullshit asked me to dance.
If you go with me,

96
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:41.470
everyone will see what a good person you are that you did the selfless good deed

97
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.740
of taking Richard the cripple to his very first dance.

98
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.810
I'm your charm offensive.

99
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.723
<v 2>Okay.</v>

100
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.970
<v 0>If I did go with you,
I'd only be doing it to be a good person.</v>

101
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.980
It doesn't mean that we're like dating.
Not ever.

102
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 3>Not ever.
Yeah.
God.
Richard,</v>

103
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.530
what kind of crazy fantasies go on in that hat?

104
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.530
<v 0>So many and you have no idea.
So what's it going to be?</v>

105
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.180
<v 3>Fine,
Richard will you got a Sadie Hawkins with me?</v>

106
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.660
<v 3>No,
no.
You fucking ass crack.</v>

108
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.730
<v 0>Go to the dance with you.
And because I never learned how to dance.</v>

109
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.300
<v 2>Oh,
well</v>

110
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.430
<v 3>could I teach you or something?
I do have a dance background.</v>

111
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.870
Hit the date,
but it's not

112
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.890
<v 0>too spicy and me thinks the lady does protest too much.</v>

113
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.210
<v 3>Hi,
I think I'm protesting.
Just write.
Hey Man.
Jesus what?</v>

114
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.260
You're a good person.
Thanks.

115
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.120
Did you fucking fee that

116
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.690
<v 0>every woman's so easily.
One.</v>

117
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.650
We're going to be like Lancelot and Gwinner view Pyramus and Thisbe,

118
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.810
Michelle and Barack

119
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.990
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

120
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.930
<v 0>Um,
I'm Greg most gala and,
uh,
I'm thinking Richard.</v>

121
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.990
<v 3>Nice.
Thanks Charlie.
Hi,</v>

122
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:19.270
I'm Tiffany Villarin and I'm playing and Margaret.

123
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.813
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

124
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.990
<v 3>I'm Rhonda Anderson and I play Elizabeth,
Ms. York,
also known as Miss Shore.</v>

125
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.703
<v 2>Okay.</v>

126
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.500
<v 3>Uh,
I'm Shannon Devito and I play buck.</v>

127
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.940
Wonderful.
Well,
I hope you all enjoyed the gene.
Uh,

128
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.410
I know some people have actually been to the show already.
If you haven't,

129
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.770
go get your ticket to now selling out really fast and they've already announced

130
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.930
an extension actually,
so you can go and get tickets.
Um,

131
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.460
so teenage Dick is a modern retelling of Richard Third,

132
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:58.400
Shakespeare's Richard the third.
You'll probably recognize some of the dialogue.

133
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.030
Um,
so let's talk about the title,
right?

134
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.140
I know it caused a little bit of hand wringing.
Um,
Craig,

135
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:08.540
you actually commissioned the play from Mike Lou.

136
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.810
<v 0>That's right.
Yeah.
Um,
and,
and he mentioned in the video,
right?
It was that,</v>

137
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:17.250
it was as simple as that.
I just,
um,
thought,
uh,
Mike,

138
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:19.570
I want you to write Richard the third set in high school,
uh,

139
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.740
and call it teenage deck.
So,
um,
yeah,
so I,

140
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:26.230
I run a theater company called the empathy team.
We focused on plays that,
um,

141
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.270
we produce,
works that explore and eliminate the disabled experience,
um,

142
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.800
which is really an exploration to figure out what that is.
Um,
and I thought,

143
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.431
you know,
Richard,

144
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:39.510
the third is arguably the most famous disabled character in western dramatic

145
00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:43.350
literature.
So he's a great character.
Just sort of take on and explore.

146
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.240
<v 3>You mentioned,
uh,
at the CTA,
um,
where,
where did that name come from?</v>

147
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.870
<v 0>So,
uh,
the inspiration for the,
the namesake of the company,</v>

148
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.070
there was a disabled playwright,
a named John.
So,
uh,

149
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.730
who had worked in theater extensive.
Liam was all,
uh,
also writing for.

150
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:02.880
So I was like deadwood on Hbo and some network shows.
Um,

151
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.530
he actually passed away in 2006 and in 2007,
I was in the New York Premiere,

152
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.930
uh,
of a show of his called the rules of charity.

153
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:13.640
And a character actually mentions the [inaudible],
uh,
which was a split,

154
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.040
a place in ancient Sparta in Greece,
uh,
where,
you know,

155
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:21.970
the Spartans were known for their very sort of fascistic,
um,
um,

156
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.780
physical worldview,
right?
Uh,
they were very militaristic society.
So if you don't,

157
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.000
if you didn't fit that worldview,
the empathy tay was a place,

158
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:33.330
a chasm in the ground were disabled and deformed infants where we're left to the

159
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:38.010
elements.
Um,
so roughly translates to the place of exposure.
Um,
and I'm just like,

160
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.520
I thought that was a really beautiful,
and I'm,

161
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.720
so I'm playing on that double entendre to shed light into dark places and also

162
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:49.130
exposed or make visible,
uh,
sort of,
uh,

163
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.600
and is able to experience or make the history of disabled people more visible.

164
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.960
<v 3>And we talked a little bit earlier about authentic Caspi.
Um,</v>

165
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.250
and if we think about stories that,

166
00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:04.420
that feature disabled character so often these narratives fallen a very few

167
00:10:04.421 --> 00:10:08.590
limited number of buckets,
you know,
inspirational,
overcoming adversity.

168
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.460
Why do you think the narratives are so pervasive in our culture?

169
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.730
<v 0>Whoa.
Uh,
I,
that's a,</v>

170
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.970
that's a big question.
Well,
I think,
again,

171
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.370
this is a incredibly representational cast,
right?
Uh,
and like,
um,

172
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.040
I think that was intentional.
And,
and by partnering with my EA,

173
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.570
which is an Asian American theater company,
right?
Um,
we have,
uh,

174
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.890
this incredible cast and production team that is,
uh,
uh,

175
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.600
a diverse,
uh,
ethnically,
uh,
gender ability.

176
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.350
Um,
it just all kinds of ways,
which is really great.
I think I'm,

177
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.260
and I can't speak on the,
uh,
being Asian American or African American,
but,

178
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:53.820
uh,
from a disability perspective,
I think disability is very hard to deal with.

179
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:57.540
I mean,
there's a lot of anxiety around the issue in the topic.

180
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.000
It's not discussed or hasn't been discussed as openly as,
uh,

181
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.790
the experience of other marginalized groups because that work is being done for,

182
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.030
um,
for decades and decades and decades now.
And we're,

183
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:12.570
we're disabilities behind in that regard.
Um,

184
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.930
but the pervasive narratives are being an inspiration,

185
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.480
overcoming adversity or death with dignity,
you know,
and I think,
um,

186
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.370
those are sort of the three that I would,

187
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.910
three buckets that I would put these in.
Um,
I don't know,
not to be a downer,

188
00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:30.840
but I think disability is the context of disability is not a geographic location

189
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:34.590
or like a specific culture.
Right.
But the,
the,

190
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.820
the context of disability is illness,
trauma,
pain and death.

191
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:44.130
So,
um,
that's difficult.
That can be difficult to deal with because it is,
uh,

192
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.840
it reminds me one of their own vulnerability and ultimately their own mortality.

193
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.340
I think,
um,

194
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.330
which again is that can be a pill to swallow,
but I think there's great,

195
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.170
uh,
that can be seen as a deficit or that can be seen as a great strength,

196
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.440
you know,
because if someone has undergone trauma,
becomes disabled,

197
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.080
that's difficult.
Yes.
But the other,

198
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.770
the flip side of that is that they've had an encounter with death and beat it.

199
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.680
And I think there's great,
there's great strength in that.
Um,

200
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.120
and so I'm interested in focusing on both the dark and the light and all the

201
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:16.954
spaces in between.

202
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.050
<v 3>Excellent.
Now you mentioned,
um,
my age very focused on,</v>

203
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.760
on diversity and representation in the arts in general.
Um,
not just on stage but,

204
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.650
but a offstage as well.
And the crew and in writing and directing,
um,

205
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.050
there's been a lot of,

206
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.770
of stories in the media lately about movies in particular and TV,

207
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:37.670
um,

208
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:42.670
and representation in those roles either be a traditional role being played by

209
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.760
white actor.
Um,
how,
you know,
and,

210
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.300
and Shannon and I were having a quick conversation about this earlier and you

211
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:53.000
never want to take work away from people,

212
00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:57.410
but you also want to be in control of your,
the narrative that you identify with.

213
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.430
Uh,
so how do you guys kind of handle that in,
in your day to day in,

214
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:06.050
in,
in going to cat scan calls and choosing productions you've work on?

215
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.930
<v 4>Hmm.
I think,
um,</v>

216
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.360
<v 5>one of the reasons why I love being an actor in New York is my theater because</v>

217
00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:19.361
they are the largest gathering of Asian American playwrights in history in the,

218
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.970
in the country,
in the world.
And

219
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.953
<v 4>MMM.</v>

220
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.520
<v 5>And I feel very fortunate to be able to have gotten to know a lot of them,</v>

221
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.730
a lot of those playwrights,

222
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.110
and to be in on the ground level of new works that they're creating.

223
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.413
Um,

224
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.140
because that conversation about representation and about being in charge of our

225
00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:45.141
narratives and not having the narrative always be about explaining my race for

226
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.270
white people,
frankly,
you know,
is,

227
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.280
is at the top of,
of that awareness for those writers.

228
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.010
And,
um,
and it's,

229
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.500
it's important work I think,
to be,
to be doing.

230
00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:05.580
And,
and Mike is,
is,
is,
he's the,

231
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.110
he's the head of the head of,
he's the head of the Myers writers laugh right now.

232
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:10.960
And,

233
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.550
<v 4>um,
uh,</v>

234
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.670
<v 5>and I think that this play in particular is doing all of those things on all the</v>

235
00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.410
different levels,
not just about race,

236
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.940
but also about ability and disability and,
and,
um,

237
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.290
<v 0>it also happens to be incredibly smart and funny.
Yeah.</v>

238
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.380
<v 5>And it's hard and it's funny and that's,
you know,
yeah,
that's it.
That's it.</v>

239
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.980
It's all of those levels of things.
And it's Shakespeare.
So,
you know,

240
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.030
people who laugh at the funny inside Shakespeare jokes are,
I'm like,

241
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.520
<v 3>Oh,
you're the,
you're the Shakespeare nerd.
I hear you.
You know,
I was like,
so</v>

242
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.390
<v 5>all in there.
Um,</v>

243
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.810
and that's the work that I want to be in.

244
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.080
And I that I think is the future of like what audiences want to experience or,

245
00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.140
or like that's the possibility.
That's where theater could go.
Yep.

246
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:05.220
We're storytelling could go in that direction.
Yeah.

247
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.573
Great.

248
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.950
<v 3>Oh,
um,
anything you want to add?</v>

249
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.690
I know I agree with that.
Um,
yeah,
I mean,

250
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.550
being an actor,
going into these auditions,
you know,
a lot of the times,

251
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.780
you know,
you do get into a play and a lot of the times they're not really,
um,

252
00:15:24.781 --> 00:15:27.210
welcoming of your experience as,

253
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.440
as it for me as a black woman into the room,
you know what I mean?
It's like,
Yay,

254
00:15:31.441 --> 00:15:34.020
we want to be diverse,
Yay.
But you know what I mean?

255
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.080
Can I also bring myself into it as well?

256
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.720
And that's not been this experiences at all.

257
00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:44.721
It's so inclusive and I feel very welcomed and feel very represented and,

258
00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:48.750
and,
and not in a way of like,
I'm glad you get an he just like,

259
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.030
I'm a teacher and I'm doing my job.
You know what I mean?

260
00:15:51.031 --> 00:15:53.250
I don't have to explain it.
Yeah.
Look at what you were saying.

261
00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:54.610
You don't have to explain what I am,

262
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.090
<v 5>where I am.
Um,
and,
and with this play,</v>

263
00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:01.820
it's just,
it's just all,
like you said,
it's all there.

264
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:05.930
It's just brilliant and so easy to dive into and have so much fun.

265
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.200
So I felt very welcome.

266
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:15.760
<v 3>Brenda,
you,
you mentioned that you play,
uh,
the teacher.
Yes.
You work,
um,
he,</v>

267
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:18.520
your character,
you guys really should go watch the play.

268
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.630
Your character has these really great moments where you're,

269
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:26.750
you're cringing at at kind of some of the moment and then you're just laughing

270
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.710
out loud.
Um,
you,
you know,
I don't,
I'm not going to give any spoilers,

271
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:33.940
but you have,
oh,
I'm cringing.
You're cringing kind of some of the,
the,
the,

272
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.340
the lines and the,
and the gestures.
Um,

273
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.860
but then toward the latter end of this show,

274
00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:43.861
you have this spectacular kind of solo moment where I feel like Ms. York really

275
00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:48.880
kind of finds her own.
Um,
you're awesome.
Kind of the only adults in the room,

276
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:52.120
if you will.
You know,
everyone else.
She's a high school teenager.
Um,

277
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:56.590
so we'll be it like kind of playing that adult in such an ensemble show.

278
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.700
Um,
it's funny cause I was like,
Oh,
this is so fun.
It's like,
you know,

279
00:17:00.701 --> 00:17:05.010
set in high school.
And I were,
I don't actually know how old everyone is.

280
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.490
I assume we're all in actually the same age ish.
Um,
but,
um,
I was like,

281
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.350
Oh yeah,
we get to play teens.
I'm like,
oh no,
I have to be the adult that person.

282
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.960
And it's funny because I'm also the deputy and I'm also putting the fire
captain.

283
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.670
So it's funny having all the responsibility all of a sudden became the

284
00:17:21.671 --> 00:17:26.410
responsible one,
which is not to do it as Marinda.
So,

285
00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:31.360
but um,
it's funny how that just kind of seeped on over.
Um,
but it's,

286
00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:33.570
it's,
it's been fun.
I've actually never heard.
Oh,

287
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.190
we deserve and we get when we're ready.
Thank you.
All right.

288
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.910
Um,
I never felt like the adult in the room though during rehearsal.

289
00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:47.800
I just felt like one of the clowns and just so,
you know,
having fun.
So it's,
it's,

290
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.810
I don't really feel the teacher,
I mean in those moments of like,
Oh God,

291
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:56.430
what is she doing?
I'm like,
oh,
very,
that's when the awareness comes in,
I guess.

292
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.360
Um,
but it's just such an ensemble.
I don't really feel like,
oh,

293
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:04.440
I'm like the adults playing the adult here.
But,
um,

294
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.250
yeah.
Did I answer your question about it?
Now?

295
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.640
You mentioned you're a deputy and a fire

296
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.230
fire
hold it very well.
No,
I'm a,

297
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.450
I'm the,
I'm there,

298
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:26.451
we are in a union actors Equity Union and each show has a deputy.

299
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:31.140
So it's like,
if anything,
any troubles arise,
they come to me and I told them,

300
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:33.720
don't come to me,
don't do it.

301
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.750
But it's always that thing at the beginning of rehearsals were like,

302
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:40.590
who wants to be the deputy?
And was like,
well yeah,
I did it before.

303
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:41.960
I don't really need to do it again.

304
00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:45.630
And so I just went ahead and volunteered and then I also became the fight

305
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:48.650
captain to make sure people stay safe.
Wow.

306
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.280
There are a few little tiffs in the show,
so I just make sure we say safe.

307
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.280
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Now you had mentioned early,
you know,

308
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.490
you have a fight call earlier before the shell.
Um,

309
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.180
and there are some fight seems dancing's there's,

310
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.650
there's a lot of query raf kind of elements to the show.

311
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.970
What kind of special training did you guys have to go through to prepare for

312
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:11.700
that?
You know,
the choreographer he brought in kind of,

313
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:13.320
what was that experience like?

314
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.500
<v 0>Well,
we have a,
so neither a TIF TIF.</v>

315
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:24.110
<v 3>I have a dance background.
Right.</v>

316
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.760
<v 0>So it's,
um,
but,
uh,
I mean I have had experience,</v>

317
00:19:28.761 --> 00:19:32.660
I was in a dance piece several years ago.
Um,
but that was it.
I mean,

318
00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:35.990
I was hired as an actor to be in that dance piece and handling sort of learn all

319
00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:40.180
those skills.
Um,
but this was a very different style.
I mean,
it's,
um,

320
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.540
all great high school story should end at a high school dance and,
um,
you know,

321
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:48.920
teenage stick does.
Um,
and so,
um,
and they're really,
I mean,
again,

322
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:52.640
you saw on that scene,
it's like their relationship,

323
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.500
most of their scenes take place within an stance studio a where she is teaching

324
00:19:57.501 --> 00:20:00.940
Richard how to dance and,
and they meet through the body,
right.
And develop.

325
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.250
I think it's really beautiful in life what he's constructed here because they

326
00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:08.670
develop this really incredible level of intimacy.
Um,

327
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.890
that isn't,
um,
that later becomes sort of romantic but doesn't start that way.

328
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:18.420
Um,
but yeah,
we've had,
we had two incredible choreographers,
uh,

329
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.110
Jen Webber,
uh,
who worked on my production,
um,
God k-pop,

330
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.790
right.
Which was about a Korean pop,

331
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.650
Korean prophesying and um,
and Liz Tenuto,
uh,

332
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.840
associate choreographer.
Um,
and we just,
uh,
yeah,

333
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.540
<v 3>we started every rehearsal with 90 minutes of dance.
Yeah.</v>

334
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.370
So the first week I was like,
oh my God,
these muscles are hurting.

335
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.690
And that were just built it up where like,
okay,
I can do that.

336
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.690
<v 0>But again,
I'm in what,
that's what the difference between dancers and actors,</v>

337
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:53.410
his dancers practice their craft every day.
Like,
if you're not in a show,

338
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:56.590
you go and you,
you go to the bar and like you go,
you take a class,

339
00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:58.180
like actors aren't that decision

340
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.380
<v 3>plenty also go to a bar.</v>

341
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:06.640
<v 6>Right?
Right now we're at the bar.
While yeah,</v>

342
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.660
we
find them later.

343
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.290
I come from a long line of people who have never picked up for it.
So,

344
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:18.450
um,
yeah.

345
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.680
<v 0>Yeah,
I think it's,
I,
it's just,
it's just another element to the play again,</v>

346
00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:26.810
I think because at the high school nature of it,

347
00:21:26.811 --> 00:21:30.390
the ending at prom or like the big spring fling or whatever,
you know,
you,

348
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.710
you have to have that.
And Mike said in a conversation of the day that he,

349
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.540
because of Richard,
the third ends of the battle,

350
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.900
the battle of Bosworth is the big climactic event.
Right.

351
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.650
And so he said he was transplanting sort of the world of the high school dance

352
00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:46.550
into the Shakespearean sort of battle.
And I thought that was really,

353
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:51.140
really amazing.
Um,
I just really like,
I just really loved that idea.

354
00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.610
So,
but yeah,
we,
we,
but we drilled and drilled and drilled,

355
00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:00.850
<v 3>excellent movement.
His structure is such a scene of the show in,</v>

356
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:05.480
in different ways.
Actually,
Shannon,
um,
I know we tied about this earlier,

357
00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:10.481
but you had a really funny role and on the Hulu show rip a difficult people will

358
00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:14.810
pour one out for,
for difficult people that really,

359
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:18.650
they cast you as a comedian written for someone in a wheelchair.

360
00:22:18.651 --> 00:22:21.320
It was cashed for comedian.
Uh,
and then in this role,

361
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.240
buck is traditionally played by men.
And you're in these woman,
um,
originally,

362
00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:30.740
man.
Yeah,
there's little boy.
Oh boy.

363
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.790
<v 0>Right.
Why known Shannon for a couple years prior to this and I'm,
I,</v>

364
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:39.200
Mike did not know her.
So she was all always from the genesis of the,

365
00:22:39.201 --> 00:22:43.310
it was like we're going to use Shannon,
the veto.
But I think,
um,
yeah,
we,

366
00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:46.100
Mike wasn't sure,
but it's you can,

367
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.140
but as soon as he discovered how wonderful Shannon was,
um,
it was,

368
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.880
uh,
a match.

369
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.440
<v 3>I was allowed to be a hero.</v>

370
00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.970
Um,
so in this show you kind of bring this,

371
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.780
this robust free interpretation to the role,
um,
and your,

372
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:06.670
your cash kind of for your talent as an actor,

373
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:09.220
but you bring this really wonderful,
um,

374
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.310
almost some secondary character with you to the stage.
You know,

375
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.750
and we've brought up before Shannon high suspicion crepes scene where she's

376
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.260
giving Richard the finger and rolling away and it's just epic fade

377
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.820
really,
really,
really well done.
Your comedic timing,
they show I'm on point.

378
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.780
Um,
so how did you kind of bring that,

379
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:36.400
that unique choreography to the role and how did you work with the other actors

380
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:40.550
in the choreographers to kind of stage that?
Um,

381
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.000
that's a very interesting question because I don't think about it.
Uh,

382
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.180
<v 1>it,
I didn't really work with the choreographers at all.
It's kind of,
um,</v>

383
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.630
it's funny cause a lot of the reviews also touched on that though.

384
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:58.220
It's just kind of part of the,
the world of,
of kind of how I live in.

385
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:03.200
And I loved that they are kind of seeing that because a wheelchair is often kind

386
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:08.201
of put into this world where it's a hindrance or wheelchair bound is often a

387
00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:11.840
term that is used that we need staff music.
But it is,

388
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:14.810
and that it like you're tied to it and this horrible thing.

389
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:19.811
But like I love that people are noticing that it's so freeing and it's a part of

390
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:24.320
me.
It's,
I don't,
it's just kind of like I don't need,
it flows through me.

391
00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:28.160
Like people,
actors often talk about being in their bodies when they're acting.

392
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:32.210
And I,
I feel like for so many years when I was in acting classes,

393
00:24:32.211 --> 00:24:35.780
they wanted me to be like in just my body and I appreciate that.

394
00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:39.900
But I feel like my wheelchair is an extension of that.
And,
um,
I,

395
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.270
I really get the ability to kind of utilize that on the stage in,
in the show.

396
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:45.110
And,
um,

397
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.690
I think a lot of my comedy comes through like with that.
So,

398
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.250
uh,
yeah,
it's pretty cool that,

399
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.250
that I got that ability to show people that it's not a hindrance.

400
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:58.100
It's actually a freeing,
wonderful thing.

401
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.530
<v 0>The comment on how people respond to the reviews.
Is there reviews?</v>

402
00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:06.140
Visa been fantastic,
you know,
but again,

403
00:25:06.141 --> 00:25:11.090
I think people are amazed that I can dance,
you know?
Uh,
and I think,

404
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:15.140
and that's not,
I'm not,
uh,
I'm not sort of calling anybody out,

405
00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:18.560
but this sort of idea,
I think it's just,
you haven't seen it,
right.

406
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.080
There are plenty of amazing,
uh,
uh,

407
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.030
actors and dancers.
There's a dancer named Alice Shepherd is a wheelchair.

408
00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:29.450
Dancers were on the cover of dance magazine this month.
You know,
um,

409
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.050
you just haven't,
it's not in a sort of cultural zeitgeist,

410
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.670
like it hasn't been shared or displayed as much.
So people,
it's so new.

411
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:41.690
It's almost revelent revelent tour.
Right.
And again,
the,
the,

412
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.320
the sort of vocabulary,
the language about how into,
right.

413
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.860
I think if you just saw it more and more and more and more,
uh,

414
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.940
that would fade away.
And people would just say,
Shannon is a,
uh,

415
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.410
physical and verbal,
comedic,
you know,
uh,
actor,

416
00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.980
and she has a great genius in that sense.
And I,
uh,
you know,

417
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:04.100
I consider myself an a rigorous physical actor because

418
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:10.010
all,
I mean,
I throw myself around all the time,
you know,
uh,
um,

419
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.590
but people seem so amazed that I,
and it's just a,

420
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.840
it's just a common conception about disability.

421
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.870
So amazing that you can get to the store or like,
you know,

422
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.410
get to your job or have a life or whatnot.
And,
uh,

423
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.310
if the theater is just sort of a reflection of our lives,
then oh my God,

424
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:26.570
look what these people can do on stage.

425
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:30.920
I think that's why the having the narratives,
right,
that are more,
more nuanced,

426
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.970
uh,
um,
more,
um,
more thought out again,

427
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:38.960
where the disabled people themselves have agency and can inhabit a roles that

428
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:41.810
are closer to themselves actually helped to move that needle forward.

429
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.530
And it starts a discussion.
I mean,

430
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:46.800
we're having a discussion right now about this,
right?
And this is,

431
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.140
this discussion itself is pretty unprecedented.
Like,

432
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:50.550
I never imagined I would be at Google,

433
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.670
like talking about a play that game to life with these incredible people,

434
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:56.740
you know?
Uh,
so I just think that's,
but again,
it's,

435
00:26:56.741 --> 00:27:00.780
it's about proximity and it's just about visibility and,
and again,

436
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:04.110
why I think my e right.
And,
and,
and,
and,

437
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.280
and work within the African American community,

438
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:10.920
within the theater community,
any marginalized group.
Right.

439
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.830
They understood we have to tell our own stories,
right.

440
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.810
Or our own stories in partnership with others,

441
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:18.990
but the plays and the plays and the plays and the plays that the narrative is

442
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:22.560
what is what moves,
move the culture forward.
Um,
and then,

443
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.160
and then hopefully society forward to when it's working well together.

444
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:27.330
They're both moving like this.

445
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.670
<v 3>You mentioned the agency would use actually sometime like to talk to Tiffany</v>

446
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.210
about,
um,
women in,

447
00:27:34.211 --> 00:27:38.280
in Shakespearean plays are often side characters,

448
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.780
particularly in Richard the third,

449
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.830
they tend to fill a role of a crime morning victim.
Um,
micro,

450
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.400
the role is very differently.
He gave a lot of meat to your role in particular.

451
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:50.190
And,
and as the play goes,
you really,

452
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:53.670
your character changes kind of the tone and the direction of some of the show.

453
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.620
Um,
how did you,
you know,
without revealing anything,
um,

454
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.040
how did you kind of bring that agency and that ultimately that power to your

455
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:03.240
role as an,

456
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.950
<v 5>um,
again,</v>

457
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:09.540
I think this roots to being able to be in the room with a new play at the

458
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:14.070
inception or very near to and having,
um,

459
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.930
relationships with playwrights who are,
who are alive and,

460
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.960
and like writing for you in a way.

461
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.340
Shakespeare died so long ago and like,
he didn't write anything for me,

462
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.510
I feel,
you know,
um,
and um,

463
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.060
but it's getting to sit with Mike and saying like,
Hey,

464
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.580
I think she's smarter than that.
I think she's gotten more grip than we,
you know,

465
00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:41.970
like we were able to have those conversations and Mike is like kind of

466
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:46.500
playwright who was open to having that with all of us about all of the roles

467
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:51.060
about what we think is authentic to that character.
And,
um,

468
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:56.070
and we were getting rewrites and previews.
We got to a whole new scene.
We were,

469
00:28:56.071 --> 00:29:00.090
we'd already done three previews and got a new scene and put it up,
you know,
and,

470
00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:02.490
um,
and it is high.

471
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:07.490
I feel very blessed to be able to s to stand on the public stage and say

472
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:09.300
something like,

473
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.290
I am not a tossed off afterthought like in a Shakespeare play or all the women

474
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:18.090
are a bunch of objects and character foils and plot devices.
And,
and it's,

475
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.120
and I get to do that and I get to say that and look at women in the audience and

476
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:25.710
see it and see it reflected back to me.

477
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:31.070
And that I think is a really special moment and something that is under the

478
00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:35.550
whole piece,
this idea of agency.
And,
um,

479
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.850
and it's,
we,
something we had talked about too is,
you know,

480
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:43.851
Mike started writing this play four or five years ago before this big cultural

481
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:47.080
turn that we've had in,
in,

482
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:52.260
in the me too movement and all of that and how like even the,
and,

483
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.650
and Mike has a lot of pop culture references in his play plays that change,

484
00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:58.120
that keep changing with time.

485
00:29:58.121 --> 00:30:03.121
And that's another thing like saying that delivering that monologue now was

486
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:07.030
different than when I did it in a workshop two years ago.
You know,

487
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:10.480
and getting to,
um,
dig in,

488
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.750
in intuit in those layers has been,

489
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.160
is very powerful I think,
and feels good.

490
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.170
Like it's something that I think needs to be seen on stage.

491
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.513
Yeah.

492
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.680
<v 3>You mentioned you were still getting new change in line changes up through</v>

493
00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:33.090
previews.
Yeah.
Um,
and I know you and Miranda have actually both done and,

494
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:37.050
and Shannon who had both on TV,
both of you were on Gotham.
Um,

495
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.580
I don't know if there was any overlap there,

496
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.320
but how has that project from doing,
you know,
TV,

497
00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:47.250
episodic TV or kind of one off roll?
He compared the live theater.

498
00:30:47.251 --> 00:30:51.150
I know you've all,
she would done multi,
multi format work,

499
00:30:51.151 --> 00:30:53.490
but it kind of what he's about crossing,
like that's different.

500
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.700
I love theater.
I mean it's,
there's nothing like it.
Um,

501
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.810
TV is cool too.
Um,

502
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.270
it,
it's very cool.
I mean I'm,
I'm wanting to do more of it as well.
And I mean,

503
00:31:09.271 --> 00:31:12.210
you know,
everyone gets to see it.
You get more,
you know,

504
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.350
exposure or whatever that way as well.
But,
and I,
I mean,

505
00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:19.950
I love both mediums by theater,
just to be with people.

506
00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:24.951
It's about like community and like reaching people and it's making contact,

507
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.360
um,
that you can't do through a screen.

508
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:28.683
<v 5>MMM.</v>

509
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.250
<v 3>So I mean in the preparation is totally different.</v>

510
00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:35.970
I feel like when I get so nervous,
like if I have to be on a set,
it's like,

511
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.720
just know your lines and just say,
you know,
your two lines,

512
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.050
Mr President or you know,
whatever.
And um,
I,

513
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.870
it's actually very nerve wracking to me sometimes.
But,
um,
but with theater,

514
00:31:48.871 --> 00:31:52.470
I mean,
it's alive in the great thing.
It's like these two,
they're so good.

515
00:31:52.471 --> 00:31:55.170
He's so good.
Like just being spontaneous on the spot.

516
00:31:55.171 --> 00:31:58.770
Like he responds to the audience,
like someone sneezed and he was like,
bless you.

517
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.710
Like,
you know what I mean?
You that you can do and it's so amazing and I just,

518
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.000
I love it.
It makes me so excited when those things happen.

519
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.890
<v 5>Um,
yeah.
So that's how I feel about it.</v>

520
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.770
<v 3>Anybody else want to,
she was,
speaking of multi-format Shannon,</v>

521
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.170
when are we going to get more installations in your youtube series?
Actually,

522
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.320
why don't you tell everyone,

523
00:32:22.321 --> 00:32:25.470
I'll give you a little background on why you created that,
um,
and kind of what,

524
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:29.430
what you were doing with it and then tell me when we get more.
Um,

525
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:35.330
so I have a web series on youtube called stare at Shannon.

526
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.680
And I started it because I was bored and

527
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.880
<v 1>I was like,
hey,
we really funny if I went through,</v>

528
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:48.320
I drive through and my wheelchair and filmed it.
And then I friend was,

529
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:51.560
I was like,
call my friend.
I was like,
Hey,
do this.
And he was like,
sure.

530
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.840
And so he did.

531
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:57.590
And so we went through the drive through and dirty Jerry fell day.

532
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.400
And then I was like,
oh,
I should do more of this cause I'm bored a lot.

533
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.170
And um,
but in reality,
uh,
the reason I wanted you to do more,

534
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.650
because I have this phrase word,
I'm like,
well,
people are staring at me anyway.

535
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:13.760
I might as well be doing something cool.
And so,
um,
so yeah,

536
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:18.440
so I do all kinds of weird things like go to a grocery store and eat food and

537
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:23.090
see what I can get away with.
Um,
which is terrific.
I did for,

538
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.860
I was very sick.
Uh,
cause I ate everything.
I ate a cake.

539
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.830
I made no did you just opened it up at the end?
Yeah,

540
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:39.090
yeah,
yeah.
So I,
I,
but I just liked him openings up.

541
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:43.210
Uh,
the like the people at the store would help me like that.

542
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.560
I made a Sunday,
I poured a bowl of cereal.
I like,

543
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:49.980
it just made a sandwich.

544
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.430
I just went to town and like no one's had me.
They all help.

545
00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.600
I was like,
all right.
And so I just,
Oh God,

546
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.530
I hate a whole cake.
It was some ridiculous,

547
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.090
every time you take suggestions.
Yeah.

548
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.780
I was fun though.
You could watch that on youtube

549
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.700
and then think about how sick I was.
Um,
yeah.
So anyways,

550
00:34:18.701 --> 00:34:20.710
so that's,
that's my channel.

551
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:27.180
I'm really selling it.
You get more why?

552
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.020
I'm here a lot.
So,
uh,
I don't,
I'm not bored,

553
00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:34.770
but I'll be bored on do I 30,

554
00:34:34.771 --> 00:34:39.771
and then I will sometimes eat more food in a grocery store.

555
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.900
<v 0>I look forward to sending,
you said something earlier about comp,</v>

556
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:47.960
using comedy as the vehicle to like move things forward or writers started that

557
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:50.500
like sparked the conversation or it makes it easier to sort of,

558
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.490
to metabolize like,
yeah,
the issues around the issues,
you know,
I don't know.
Yeah.

559
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.930
<v 1>Well,
I mean this isn't building is not a fun thing to talk about.</v>

560
00:34:57.931 --> 00:35:02.400
What you definitely touched on earlier,
right.
It's like that's sad,
right?
But,

561
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.200
uh,
but comedy is not,
so sometimes it depends on how good you are.
Hi.

562
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.280
[inaudible] at the Improv shows that were very sad.

563
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.520
Oh yeah,
yeah.
An improv group.
Yeah.

564
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.140
I made a couple and it's,
it's up escape rooms putting,

565
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:27.110
so there's a live sad comedy going on.
Um,

566
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.330
but uh,
it does,
it is a very,
uh,

567
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.480
it's a very good way to kind of break down a barrier that is not fun to talk

568
00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:35.810
about.

569
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:40.810
And I kind allows you to talk about what you're doing versus the disability of

570
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:43.650
it.
And um,

571
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.220
I think that people are then seeing me as a comedian versus seeing my chair

572
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:54.840
first and then a comedian.
So I think I,
I um,
yeah,
I,

573
00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.790
I like company for that reason.

574
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.800
<v 3>Wonderful.
This point,
we're going to open it up to audience questions.</v>

575
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:03.900
We have a microphone in each aisle.

576
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:08.901
If you want to approach the microphone and we'll do Q and a a while people,

577
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:11.940
if they're going to ask questions while people are doing that,

578
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:14.940
I have a couple of fun kind of rapid fire questions.

579
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.730
It will burn through them pretty quick.

580
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.340
<v 0>Please.
One thing about questions though,
I'm the one thing that I say to anyone,</v>

581
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:24.010
a is ask whatever you want and then anything you were afraid to ask.
Don't be,

582
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.970
don't be afraid.

583
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:29.750
<v 3>Well we'll answer anything unless,
right Greg.</v>

584
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.940
Well go for it.
Go for it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,

585
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.290
who is most likely to try and get everyone to go out and party after a show or a

586
00:36:39.291 --> 00:36:42.200
practice?
Not me.
I'm on a train.

587
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:48.310
<v 1>Um,
I feel like Greg
brought up last night.</v>

588
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.530
<v 0>Well,
I don't know,
but,
so the eye,
it's Alex Bro,
uh,
is uh,</v>

589
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.280
plays Eddie in who couldn't be here today.
Um,

590
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.870
it's just the two of us and,
and uh,
you know what guys,
you know,

591
00:37:00.871 --> 00:37:04.350
we're doing our thing and the ladies are just like putting on music or hear him

592
00:37:04.351 --> 00:37:05.700
laughing and having a good time.

593
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:08.160
They have a case of Jose and they're dressing room.
Like,

594
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:11.580
I don't think they're drinking before the show,
but after the show,
for sure

595
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.590
<v 3>as deputy,
you can have one beverage for show.</v>

596
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.680
It's true.
Yeah,
I knew that.
Um,
okay.
Uh,

597
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.440
so what book are you reading right now?
Oh,
I'm a,

598
00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:28.830
I'm reading the alchemist and slowly reading it,
but yes,

599
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.850
I'm reading that right now.

600
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.500
<v 1>I'm almost done.
It's good.</v>

601
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.560
<v 3>Like to that training.
Uh,
Sasha,
I think we have question.</v>

602
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.090
<v 7>Great job you guys.
Now I really got to go see the show.</v>

603
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.250
<v 3>Yeah,
we,</v>

604
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.530
<v 7>uh,
so this question or like the B train anybody,</v>

605
00:37:45.531 --> 00:37:49.670
but you mentioned doing the adlibs and sort of being really present.

606
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.770
And I was curious in particular for Shannon,
like wheelchairs,

607
00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.820
they can break down sometimes and you get the equipment failure and stuff

608
00:37:58.821 --> 00:38:01.580
happens.
And I thought it was really cool.
And that scene,

609
00:38:01.581 --> 00:38:05.820
how you use it for really good comic effect.
Like the,
like Cory was saying,

610
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.560
going back and forth on.
But like what I like,

611
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.000
did you ever like your battery runs out in the middle of a scene or you're real,

612
00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:15.440
you got a flat tire or have you,
does that ever happen?

613
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:20.390
<v 1>I have solid rubber tires,
so I make sure that doesn't happen.
Um,</v>

614
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:25.580
well,
one thing that was crazy and the show is that we got,
yeah.
Uh,
like,
uh,

615
00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.770
a veneer put onto the stage.

616
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.160
And so my wheels were crazy squeaky and it was so terrible.

617
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.711
I definitely,

618
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:39.620
it was like the center of the show is what is our tennis shoes every day.

619
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.610
It was bad.
It was bad news bears.
Uh,
um,

620
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.330
but so that was a little stressful.
Um,

621
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.990
no batteries ever died.
Um,
I,

622
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.650
I had to get wheelchair repairs that my insurance won't pay for it.
Um,

623
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.840
that was a stressful time.
That has nothing to do with this show.

624
00:38:55.841 --> 00:39:00.020
I don't know why I brought that up.
It's fine now.
Um,

625
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.840
Oh God,
I hate it.
I hate talking sometime.
I'm an actor.

626
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.370
No,
I mean I think,
um,
uh,
my wheel kits caught on,

627
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.050
on stage a bunch of times and I just kind of like pushed through written,

628
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:18.280
pretend it didn't happen.
My answer to your question,
I'm so sorry.

629
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.023
I'm sure it will.

630
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.750
<v 7>Like,
do you ever feel like,
um,
it's like you have to educate other people.</v>

631
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.210
So like if something
like that,
so I'd like to,

632
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.600
if you fall out of your chair at,

633
00:39:34.601 --> 00:39:37.810
which does happen from time to time like that before you realize like you're

634
00:39:37.811 --> 00:39:38.530
okay,

635
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:42.160
but then everyone else is going to get freaked out and your main job is to like

636
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:44.880
reassure them that said,
okay,
this happens.
Oh Wow.

637
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.070
You ever had that kind of feeling about that particular thing happening or other

638
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:48.904
stuff like that?

639
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:52.350
<v 1>No.
Oh No.
Ah,
I wear a seatbelt.
Um,</v>

640
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.380
I haven't seen people fall off the chair.
I have never fallen out of my chair.

641
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.420
A knock on wood somewhere.
Um,
yeah.
Um,

642
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.010
no,
I mean I think Greg and I talking about this and punch,
it's like,
you know,
we,

643
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:11.720
we were in Hersel's in and we would allow anyone to ask us questions because you

644
00:40:11.721 --> 00:40:15.320
do often have to educate,
um,
because it's just not something people around.
And,

645
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:16.880
um,

646
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.800
we went out to lunch and I am Mernda and Sasha were talking about how they never

647
00:40:21.801 --> 00:40:24.620
really noticed how many stairs there are in the city.
Um,

648
00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.800
because it's just not something you realize like,
you know,

649
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:32.480
I realize it every day,
um,
when I'm in the pea elevators.
Um,

650
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:37.280
and so it's like,
you know,
it's just kind of that stuff that,
yes,

651
00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:40.370
I feel like there is an educational piece of it,

652
00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:41.720
but it's not something that like,

653
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.480
I'm never going to feel burdened by or anything like that.

654
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.080
I like having those conversations because it's,
um,
I don't know,

655
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.990
Greg can talk more about that,
but,
um,
I,
I'd rather you ask me then,

656
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.320
don't just assume.
Yeah,

657
00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.310
cause we all know that phrase.
I like to say ask Google,
why does it

658
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.550
<v 0>no,
but I think what you just mentioned is that I'm in,
I'm not a wheelchair user,</v>

659
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:07.151
but again,
I,

660
00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:10.390
I'm constantly negotiating that relationship of like anytime I meet someone new

661
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:13.720
and then we do this sort of strange social power to do it,
where it's like,

662
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.040
I know you see me in,

663
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:17.860
you're clocking something and it should we mention it and I have to put you at

664
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:18.521
ease and that you know,

665
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:22.030
that I'm an actual person and can talk and whatever and do all these things,

666
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:26.050
you know?
And I think that's,
that's just part of the experience,
you know?
And,
um,

667
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:30.670
but I'm actually fascinated by that,
that exchange.
Um,
and again,

668
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.160
that's why I think theater is a great vehicle,

669
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.370
this sort of exploration because you're,
we've,

670
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:39.560
we're always in relation to an audience as to say,
well,

671
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:43.100
people write and negotiating that theater is sort of an explosion of that,

672
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.880
of that idea where there's a frame and you can have control over sort of the

673
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:50.190
story that you're telling.
So that's,
I mean that's,
that's just a way to,

674
00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.570
for me to sort of Rasul,
uh,
that,
that,

675
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.700
that be stound.
Um,
and again,
it can,
I can,

676
00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.610
I can choose where I want to engage and disengage.

677
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:05.990
And I just happened to start a company where like the whole purpose is to be a

678
00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:09.410
platform for conversation.
So at this point in my life,

679
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:13.730
I may be talking more about it more than I like,
or you know,
should,

680
00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:18.290
but I think that's just the need is there,
you know,
and again,

681
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:22.400
what art does in what theater does in particular is creating community as

682
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:25.820
Miranda said,
and creates an opportunity to discuss.
Right?

683
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:27.950
And I think rather than say,
let's talk about disability,

684
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.950
we're talking about this particular play where disability and,

685
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.700
and several other issues are present,
you know,
so if it comes up,

686
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:38.300
we'll talk about it and if not,
we'll also just talk about the play,
you know.

687
00:42:38.301 --> 00:42:42.410
So I think that's,
I'm really interested in that,
that sort of overlap,

688
00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:44.060
that exchange and that synergy.

689
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:46.120
<v 2>Wonderful.</v>

690
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:51.010
<v 3>We have a question here,
Maddie.
Hi.
Uh,
thank you guys again,
so much for coming.</v>

691
00:42:51.011 --> 00:42:53.320
We're all so excited to have you here.
Um,

692
00:42:53.321 --> 00:42:55.840
so you've already answered this question a little bit,

693
00:42:55.841 --> 00:43:00.580
but I was really excited to ask.
Um,
but I wanted to talk again about,

694
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:05.740
uh,
using comedy as a storytelling device because the show seems so funny.

695
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.890
Um,
while also tackling really difficult issues.
Um,

696
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.270
I just wanted to ask if there were any challenges with that or if there was any

697
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:18.271
worry like that the audience may like misinterpret jokes or if you were ever

698
00:43:20.021 --> 00:43:24.460
worried about like,
um,
like trivializing anything.

699
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.800
Uh,
so that's my question.

700
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.090
<v 2>Hmm.
Hmm.</v>

701
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.670
<v 3>No,
you can just read it.</v>

702
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.630
<v 6>Yeah,
yea,
yeah.
I think anything,</v>

703
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.020
<v 0>you know,
just from myself and it was a compensated with Mike and Moritz,</v>

704
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:48.770
the director and everyone will be opened into the cast.
Like again,
like we're,

705
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.750
we're hitting on things like,
you know,

706
00:43:50.751 --> 00:43:54.860
there's some language that might be considered offensive in this show.
There's,

707
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.350
you know,
but everybody's fair game basically.

708
00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:00.560
And for the comedy to be successful,
you really have to lean into it.

709
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.540
You can't shy away from it.
You have to be as sort of mean or rude or,
or,
uh,

710
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.430
um,
insensitive,
uh,
uh,

711
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.960
through the character.
Right.
Uh,

712
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:17.150
cause it's a very respectful ensemble of wonderful people.

713
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.560
Um,
but I think in order for that comment a work,
yeah,
it has to be played,

714
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.530
you know,
seriously.
And for all it's worth.
So again,

715
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:26.940
when we had to have those discussions,
and I think the,

716
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:31.590
everyone on that stage and in the,
in the process is game to that.

717
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.590
If someone wasn't,
then they wouldn't be involved in this.
And I mean,
again,

718
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:41.400
that's,
that's intentional for,
again,
from my,
from my point of view,

719
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.740
to sort of really tackle that.
And again,
it's hopefully we're,

720
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.460
we aren't getting loud.
Like it's a funny,

721
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:50.130
funny play and Mike has done a fantastic job.
Um,

722
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.890
and what that does is bring is bring people in,
right.

723
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:55.110
And gets people on our side until the bridge

724
00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.240
<v 3>dramatically.
Then we can punch him in the guy.</v>

725
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:03.190
<v 0>But hopefully it gets people,
I mean,
again,
we had a,
um,
my aid a benefit night,</v>

726
00:45:03.191 --> 00:45:04.570
a Tuesday night.
And again,

727
00:45:04.571 --> 00:45:08.920
we had this wonderful talk back and this woman was really a articulated her

728
00:45:08.921 --> 00:45:10.450
whole sort of,
um,

729
00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.290
sort of emotional process throughout the play of like being able to laugh and

730
00:45:14.291 --> 00:45:15.610
then feeling conflicted and,

731
00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.670
but it got her thinking and it got her thinking in a new way,

732
00:45:18.671 --> 00:45:22.960
which regardless of the subject matter,
any great piece of art should,
should do.

733
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.160
That's the desired effect.

734
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.250
<v 3>Thank you.
Thanks.
Um,
so back to a couple of questions again,</v>

735
00:45:30.251 --> 00:45:32.800
feel free to approach the Mike if you have any.
Um,

736
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.620
what is your greatest extravagance?

737
00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.820
Like what is that thing that you're going to splurge on or treat yourself with?

738
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.093
<v 2>Huh.</v>

739
00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.280
<v 3>I'm going to Jamaica</v>

740
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.700
welldyne booked it and for the 30th so the day after we close,

741
00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:53.140
I am on a flight to Jamaica.
I'm taking myself on my birthday

742
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:57.790
<v 5>because when's your birthday?
July 17th.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.</v>

743
00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:02.300
<v 3>Right.
Except to gifts.
Yeah.</v>

744
00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:05.560
And so that's my extravagance right now and I'm just,
it's great.

745
00:46:05.561 --> 00:46:08.010
It's great to have a vacation planned.
Yeah.

746
00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:12.130
I've never really do that and I'm like,
it's something to look forward to.
So

747
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.480
<v 5>I recommend nobody was able to do that.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

748
00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.930
<v 3>Uh,
what is a word or phrase but you overuse.
Overused.</v>

749
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:23.843
<v 2>Okay.</v>

750
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:25.423
<v 5>Hi.
So many.</v>

751
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:30.170
I think I say indeed a lot indeed.

752
00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:33.950
<v 3>Like I say that like,
just like that.
Yeah.
I don't know if</v>

753
00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:38.140
you don't do that,
cause I've never heard you say

754
00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:41.590
maybe just in my head

755
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:48.970
or a word or phrase you think other people over you that kind of grinds know I

756
00:46:48.971 --> 00:46:53.290
overuse Yaasss God,
everything.

757
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:57.430
I feel supported when you say that to me.
Oh good.
Yeah.
That's why I say it.

758
00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.510
I mean I really,
it is a support.
It's affirmation is it?
It's like you go girl,

759
00:47:01.511 --> 00:47:05.230
it's everything.
So enough.
That's why,
and I use it for everything.
So yes.

760
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:11.230
So probably too much.
Um,

761
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.310
what you would the best gift you've ever gotten.
Yeah.

762
00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.320
<v 5>MMM hmm.</v>

763
00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.673
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

764
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.280
<v 3>I know you're,
you're giving yourself the gift of Jamaica.
Yeah,
that's it.</v>

765
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.280
Thank you.
You answered my question.
Answered her photo.

766
00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.100
<v 2>You're</v>

767
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:30.730
<v 5>about to have it.</v>

768
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.230
<v 6>I know.
I remember
I was sick again,</v>

769
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.320
cause that's oversee.
People always say that.
Uh,
no,

770
00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:42.770
no.
My wife

771
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:45.940
<v 8>setting up first.
She's due end of August,
so,
yeah.
That's pretty</v>

772
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:50.850
<v 5>fricking cool.
All right.
Yeah.
If you were a candy bar,</v>

773
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.380
what candy bar would you be?
Does it have to be candy bar?
No,
it can be any candy.

774
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:57.520
Okay.
Skittles.
Oh yeah.

775
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:04.100
I would be a dark chocolate bar with almonds and a little common joy.

776
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.950
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

777
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:10.620
<v 1>no,
no.
That's good.
Dark chocolate.
Dark chocolate.</v>

778
00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.510
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

779
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.640
<v 8>I'm not even a fan of this candy man,
but I would say a watch,
I'm gonna call it</v>

780
00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.710
<v 6>a lot of those.
Yeah.</v>

781
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.040
Also Carmelo's out out like

782
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.920
what's an electron?
Mcallen.
I don't know,
but

783
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:34.130
I feel like that sort of sums up me.
Right,
exactly.
People are like,
Huh?

784
00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:39.080
What is that
like?
Weird.
I like it.

785
00:48:39.081 --> 00:48:40.370
Do I like it?
I Dunno.

786
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.900
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.
What about you?
Seven.
Oh Gosh.
Uh,</v>

787
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.650
<v 1>well I,
I like so many problem I made.</v>

788
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:54.610
I'm just thinking about all the candy I want to eat right now.
Um,
I don't know.

789
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:59.110
I'd probably be like a nut outrageous or something like
out y'all,

790
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:03.370
you bring in a rag out of red wrapper razor yellow,
orange.

791
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:07.510
I don't remember.
I don't know.
Yes.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

792
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:13.010
But she also put me onto the smurfs.
Tommy's smurfs though.

793
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:17.070
Yes,
dude.
Just Fyi,

794
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:21.520
those come back because of the movies.
They're always in five below.

795
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.420
I just eat them.
Oh,
good.
Oh,
we have another question.

796
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:30.150
<v 8>So here's my rapid fire question.
Olivier or McKellen</v>

797
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.710
<v 6>whoa.</v>

798
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:37.970
<v 8>Third or just in general as Richard.
Oh Man.
No,</v>

799
00:49:37.971 --> 00:49:39.500
in all seriousness though.

800
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.880
<v 6>Oh,
okay.</v>

801
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.333
<v 8>So</v>

802
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:51.100
<v 5>yeah,</v>

803
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:56.100
<v 8>you're setting this thing in high school and having all of the characters are</v>

804
00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:59.140
most of the characters as teenagers.

805
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:04.410
How do you think that affected the way that you're telling this story

806
00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.430
also?

807
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:11.630
Do you think that that might overshadow the message that you're trying to send

808
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.920
to some people?

809
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.930
<v 5>That's a great question.
Yeah.</v>

810
00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:21.290
I think that what we've found and what's come up and talk backs is a lot of is

811
00:50:21.781 --> 00:50:26.781
this is the high school aspect about the show and I feel like we all had that

812
00:50:28.461 --> 00:50:33.461
experience of high school and we all harbor traumas that happened to us in high

813
00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:39.620
school and like,
and that I think,
um,
and I,

814
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.110
and I imagined being in the audience for the show,

815
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.490
it all just comes right back as soon as you see the set and the lockers and the

816
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:49.550
backpacks and you're like,
oh,
I remember that athlete boy.

817
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.730
And I remember that weird girl,
you know,
like I feel like it,

818
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.380
it actually puts those of us who've been through high school back on that

819
00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:01.490
playing field where the state where we remember what the stakes felt like and

820
00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:06.491
what it was like to be unpopular and to want to be powerful and trying to find a

821
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:07.760
way to do that.

822
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:13.690
Now actual high school kids I think who have seen the show sometimes I feel like

823
00:51:13.851 --> 00:51:18.851
it's too close to their reality in a way that it's like as adults I think we

824
00:51:19.821 --> 00:51:24.590
have the advantage of getting to look back at it backwards.
But for them,

825
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:28.350
you know,
it's very closer to the bone.
And um,

826
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:33.110
interesting too in that way where it feels potent and s and an storyline in

827
00:51:33.111 --> 00:51:37.430
particular is one that deals with um,
uh,

828
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.130
no spoiler alerts but just deals,

829
00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.880
deals with some serious issues for teenage girls,

830
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.320
<v 0>issues around sex and sexuality in a very real way.</v>

831
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.390
<v 5>And I,
and I had a conversation with a young,</v>

832
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:52.900
younger woman who in high school who saw the show and it,

833
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:57.170
it was serious for her.
I was like,
what,
what going,

834
00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.310
how did you prepare for that?
How did you know?
I was like,
ah yeah,

835
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:04.300
thanks for reminding me.
Like this is reality l out there.

836
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:08.080
So yeah,
that's a great question.

837
00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:08.981
<v 0>I mean I,</v>

838
00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:12.840
I think I would love to see this play perform where people who were closer to

839
00:52:12.841 --> 00:52:15.480
the age,
if not the actual age is,
I think there's room for that.

840
00:52:15.481 --> 00:52:19.470
But I think Mike and I had the playwright and I had a lot of conversations back

841
00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:23.180
and forth initially about who this plays for and what the type of audiences for

842
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.260
and again are the age range has been

843
00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:26.640
<v 5>okay.</v>

844
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.530
<v 0>Pretty broad.
But I think there's,</v>

845
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:31.170
this is what the version of this play is now for its,

846
00:52:31.171 --> 00:52:34.620
its premiere and it's based on who,
who started in and I was,

847
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:38.660
I mean it was far too old to play with,
you know,
when the show started.
Uh,

848
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:42.180
or was the first commission.
But again,
I think,
yeah,

849
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:46.800
I think we agreed because of Mike's language and people having an avail

850
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.970
availability and,
and skill to do that.
We decided to go older,

851
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:54.000
but there are plenty of talented young,

852
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.040
younger people who could certainly play it.

853
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:58.950
I think that'd be really interesting once the now what's great,

854
00:52:58.951 --> 00:53:03.300
the best play we'll be out in the world like it has been launched.

855
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:07.540
Right.
And so,
um,
and that would be up to Mike to decide,
um,

856
00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.660
whether if anyone approaches him high school or college from what not to do that

857
00:53:12.661 --> 00:53:14.520
he can,
he can give it its blessing or not

858
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:19.360
<v 8>when,
I'm sure high school would definitely be willing to do this.</v>

859
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.940
And I will also say,
uh,

860
00:53:21.941 --> 00:53:25.590
your story about the a squeaking wheels,

861
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.420
uh,

862
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.420
as a high schooler who did have to actually carry around disability equipment.

863
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:36.030
Yeah,
that would probably make it a little bit more realistic.

864
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.540
<v 3>Oh,
you liked the element of the,
of the house.</v>

865
00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.750
He was just very loud and you couldn't hear anything I was saying

866
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.940
<v 8>that would definitely help.
In my case it was Michelle impairment equipment.
Well,</v>

867
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.470
wasn't too in the way,
but it was definitely a hallmark of me.

868
00:53:56.790 --> 00:54:01.650
<v 3>Sure.
Yeah.
Very nice.
Thank you.
Draw that line,</v>

869
00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.490
that line between total reality and then kind of,
yeah,
sure.

870
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:09.810
For the dialogue.
We're not,
might still,
it was,
it was a little too loud.

871
00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:14.230
Um,
so we're actually at time.
Uh,

872
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.970
I just wanted to say thank you guys so much for taking the time.

873
00:54:17.971 --> 00:54:20.700
I know they have a show tonight.
I'm at the public theater.

874
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:25.500
I highly encourage you all get tickets to go watch the show live 29.

875
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:29.670
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just really,
really wonderful,
funny show.
Um,

876
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:31.440
so thank you guys.
Thanks.
Thank you.
