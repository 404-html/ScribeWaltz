1
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.630
Right.
Um,
I'd like to welcome Julia Turshen.

2
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:12.380
She's a longtime friend of mine and she's a writer and recipe developer.

3
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.490
In addition to her newly published solo effort,
small victories,

4
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.600
Julia has coauthored such bestselling cookbooks as speed a culinary road trip

5
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:21.560
with Mario Batali.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.300
It's all good with Gwyneth Paltrow as well as mastering mistakes in the kitchen

7
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:29.480
and the Kimchi chronicles Hotbread kitchen,
the fat radish,

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.060
radish kitchen diaries and buvette.

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.860
She also hosted the first two seasons of radio,
uh,
Radio Cherry bomb,

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.970
which is a podcast.
Um,

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.470
and Julia is famous for using simple techniques to demonstrate how small

12
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.110
victories in the kitchen can help you become a confident cook.

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.490
So we are very excited to have her here at Google to show us all how it's done.

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.490
With that,
I'll hand it over to Julia.
Thanks Karen.

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.690
<v 1>Um,
I think Karen left out.
She said we're old friends,</v>

16
00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:02.920
but Karen's my oldest friend,
we met in the third grade.
Um,

17
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.690
and we've been friends ever since.

18
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:07.420
So this is just great to be here and it's full circle.
Um,

19
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.020
and I'm just so happy to meet all of you.
So I have this new book,

20
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:13.600
small victories,
which I think you're all going to get a copy at the end.

21
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.090
It came out yesterday.
I'm super excited about it.

22
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:20.440
This is my first time talking about it,
um,
in front of anyone but a mirror.

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.870
This is awesome.
Um,

24
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:25.900
so I thought I'd tell you a little bit about the book and a little bit about the

25
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:29.350
recipe that I'll demonstrate and then we can eat some of the recipe.

26
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.680
And I would love to answer any questions you guys might have.

27
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.220
So my first question is how,
see if I worked at Google,

28
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.030
I don't think I would maybe ever cook cause you guys have such amazing food,

29
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:44.500
but how many of you cook at home?
Oh,
that's awesome.
Okay,
cool.
Okay,

30
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.140
so I'm talking to her home cooks.
That's great.
So small victories,

31
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.070
the title is the same as just the whole concept of the cookbook.

32
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.610
And it's basically approaching food,
sort of thinking about small victories,

33
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.160
which I think of as like tips or techniques that make cooking really

34
00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:01.650
approachable.
Um,
really let you be like an intuitive cook.
Um,

35
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.160
and just make it really fun.

36
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.370
And so every recipe in the book is introduced by like a small victory,

37
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:07.660
which is this tip or technique.

38
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.010
And then every recipe's followed by a bunch of spinoffs,

39
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.030
which are like variation.
So once you know the tip or technique,

40
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.520
you can make the thing,
but you can also make x,
Y,
and z.

41
00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:18.250
So it's sort of thinking about cooking and this very exponential way,

42
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.410
which I feel like is kind of,
to me,

43
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:23.590
there's some sort of synthesis with everything you guys do at Google.

44
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.100
And it's like this one thing,
but it can be so many other things.
Um,

45
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.730
so I was going to demonstrate the Turkey and ricotta and meatballs today,

46
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:34.510
which are,
um,
honestly I feel like choosing a favorite recipe from the book.

47
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:37.270
It's like asking someone to choose their favorite kid or something.
Like I just,

48
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:40.010
I can't,
but this might be it.
And,
um,

49
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.450
there are especially special to me because they were the first thing I made for

50
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:47.770
my wife,
grace.
And she had,
um,
told me about,
she had just recently,

51
00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:49.690
right before we met,
she had eaten these.
Um,

52
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.940
I think the reveal and ricotta me balls at a restaurant,

53
00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:54.760
she said they were so great and I was like,
oh my God.
Like I love this girl,

54
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:58.450
I want to impress her.
So I was like,
I'm going to try to make something.
And um,

55
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.480
so I,
the thing I ever brought to her apartment,
which became our,

56
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.760
our apartment was,
um,
my pot.

57
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.500
So that's what I brought over and I made her these meatballs.
And anyway,

58
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.250
we got married really soon after.
So I feel like I,
I don't promise,
you know,

59
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.150
lifelong love or marriage,
but it worked for me,
so I highly recommend it.
Um,

60
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.380
so we,
um,
yeah,
I mean whatever,
like I can't hurt.
Right.
Um,

61
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.130
so that sort of small victories in this recipe or a few one is that I,
um,

62
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.140
the meatballs are really simple and they don't take that many ingredients.

63
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.430
And I'm going to combine Turkey with ricotta because as my mother in law

64
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.930
recently said to me,
cause she made these,
um,
Turkey let's face it is always dry.

65
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.530
Um,
but it's,
you know,
it's a nice sort of leaner,
healthier option.

66
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.120
And I think adding ricotta too,

67
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:47.420
it makes them just not dry and really sort of succulent in this great way.

68
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.270
And in a way that sort of beef and pork can be that Turkey isn't always.
Um,

69
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.480
and it also happens to make the meatballs totally gluten free if that's

70
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:57.730
important to you or the people you were cooking for.
Cause you can,

71
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:00.580
by adding the ricotta you can skip the eggs and bread crumbs that are normally

72
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:03.300
in meatballs,
which was kind of Nice.
And um,

73
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.650
then I just pack them with a bunch of herbs we're going to make them.

74
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:09.430
And then the simplest tomato sauce and the other small victories that I baked

75
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.090
the meatballs instead of pan frying them.
Cause it's just so much easier.

76
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:13.990
It's a lot less mess.

77
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:17.560
You're not like cleaning up like a spattered stovetop and everything.
Um,

78
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.390
so those are some of the small victories.

79
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.100
And then in the book you'll see you can turn,

80
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.450
once you know how to make these meatballs,

81
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:25.060
you can take those techniques and make so many different kinds.

82
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.300
So actually my wife grace runs this amazing website design sponge.

83
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.620
And this week I'm doing all these posts on lunchbox meals.

84
00:04:30.621 --> 00:04:35.080
So yesterday we did like a Turkey Merguez meatball with like cumin and Heresa

85
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.020
and flavors like that.
So if you change the ingredients or you know,

86
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.200
change the sauce,
you can really have this whole other thing.
So it's,

87
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.940
it's just great.
So I'm going to start mixing them,

88
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.650
but then I was hoping maybe to get a couple of volunteers to help me roll them.

89
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.760
But first I'm gonna wash my hands,

90
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:52.570
but if there's anyone who might be interested in rolling them,
you can also,

91
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.280
there's sinks there.
You can use this one.
Um,
we've got some gloves if you'd like,

92
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.210
but um,
I'll just walk you through them because they're super easy.

93
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:03.600
I also love meatballs because you can,
um,

94
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.050
make a huge batch of them and keep them going for a while.

95
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.470
And all the recipes in the book,
I'm just going to throw that right there.

96
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.550
All the recipes in the book for the most part,
just serve for people.
Um,

97
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.750
but this one I purposely did a double batch because I always make extra so I

98
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.540
figured most people would want to because who doesn't want meatballs in the

99
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:26.470
fridge at any point?
So it starts with just ground Turkey.
I'm,

100
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.230
I definitely prefer dark meat for this.
Um,

101
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.340
just cause it's got a lot more fat and moisture and those things that just make

102
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.870
them taste really good.
And then we have um,
ricotta cheese,

103
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.660
which is just whole milk ricotta cheese.
I'm just going to add that.

104
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.980
And then it really helps if you have someone like Marianne who's going to chop

105
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.580
up everything for you.
There is,
it makes it super easy.
I highly recommend that.

106
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.140
Um,
and then we're going to do this is just chopped fresh parsley and um,

107
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.230
I love it cause it's,
you know,
gives them a lot of flavor but also color.
Um,

108
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.300
and they look nice and fresh.
This is chopped Bazell at all of it.
Yeah.
Okay.

109
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:06.500
It's all a portion.
Awesome.
I have to take you everywhere.
I'm so excited.

110
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.560
Um,
and then this is some grated Parmesan,

111
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:13.640
which I'm putting in them and we'll also put on them later because it just makes

112
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.190
everything better.
So why not put it in and on top?

113
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:21.191
Because life is short and it should be full of cheese and some chopped fresh

114
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:25.960
garlic,
same thing and um,

115
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.470
some salt.

116
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.560
So I just washed my hands for probably like the fifth time today.
And um,

117
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.080
I think hams were the best tool for this job.
So I just mix it with my hands.

118
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:40.370
But if you're kind of like,
I'm not so into touching like raw meat,

119
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:44.720
you can totally just do this with,
you know,
one big mixing spoon.
Um,

120
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.950
and that is literally it.
Like that's all you need to do to make this mixture.

121
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.540
And then we're just going to roll them into,

122
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.850
I like to do kind of like golf ball sized meatball.
Hi,
Jenny Posen.
How are you?

123
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.000
Um,
and um,
but you can make them really like small,
like little,
um,

124
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.300
like Pulpa teeny or you can make larger ones like a big softball size me.

125
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.270
Well if you want,
I guess that gets you into meat loaf territory,

126
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:12.680
but it's nothing wrong with that.
So as you can see,
they have a lot of,

127
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.220
you know,
there's sort of as green as they are pink.
And I just,

128
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:20.510
I love having that many fresh herbs and anyway,

129
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.140
so is anyone interested in rolling?
Yeah.
Oh,
awesome.
Amazing.
Okay.

130
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:27.560
This is going to go really fast.
So if you guys want to come up here,
um,

131
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.950
one thing that Maryann took out,
which I love,
is that ice cream scoop.
Um,

132
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.090
and that means you can get really evenly sized,
um,
meatballs,

133
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.840
which is awesome,
but you can also just kind of free form it.

134
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:43.700
They don't have to be like super perfect.

135
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:47.800
I'm a big fan of food that's like not totally perfect.
I really just,

136
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.590
I love homemade stuff just in general and in theory.
So anyway,

137
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:55.820
so if you guys want to help me out,
we can,
um,

138
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.340
can use this or just,
you know,
do it about that size.
Yeah.
Go for it.

139
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.280
And yeah,
go for it.
And um,
and we'll roll them out and put them here.
Yeah,

140
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.930
you can use that if you'd like.
Um,

141
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.630
and maybe while you guys are willing those out,

142
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:14.360
I'm going to walk you through the tomato sauce that after we bake the meatballs,

143
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.660
they're going to just simmer in the sauce.
You can also,
um,

144
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.410
like I've,
my really close friend Larry,
he has like,

145
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.810
I hope he doesn't mind me saying this,
he's got like bad,

146
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:25.130
like acid reflux kind of stuff.

147
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.930
Like a lot of people have that so you can skip the sauce,

148
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:29.360
you can just make the meatballs,
eat them on their own.
They're delicious.

149
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.540
There's a lot of flexibility.
I really feel like recipes,

150
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:36.380
like they tend to be sort of seen as and treated as kind of prescriptions.

151
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:40.310
Like you have to do this exact thing.
And I totally don't believe that.

152
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.460
I feel like you can make them anything.
It's your,
it's your kitchen,

153
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:46.150
it's your meal,
make it work for whatever your needs are.
Um,

154
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.440
but I love tomato sauce and I think they're delicious in it.

155
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.890
So we're gonna make this and it's honestly like,
just,

156
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.680
it'll take like 10 seconds and don't blink because you'll miss it.

157
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:58.470
Cause it's super simple.
So I'm just going to turn this on.

158
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.550
Did I do it right?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Okay,
great.

159
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.430
And then all it is is a little bit of olive oil

160
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.850
and then this is um,
perfectly sliced garlic cause I didn't slice it.

161
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.970
And once this gets a little bit hot,
I'm going to add this in the oil.

162
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.670
Kind of like,
I always think of it,
it kind of like Bloom's the garlic.

163
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:20.400
It starts to sizzle and it just gets all that great flavor.

164
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.650
If I'm going to let it get hot so it can do that.
And then we're going to add,

165
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:25.030
these are can hold tomatoes.
Um,

166
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.700
which I like to crush before just so you don't get like a huge tomato.
But um,

167
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.350
if you like really smooth sauce,

168
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:34.320
you could run them through a blender or use like an immersion blender or a food

169
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:37.770
mill,
you know,
whatever device you have.
Um,
but I kind of like,
again,

170
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.890
like the sort of imperfect perfect meatballs.

171
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.520
Like I like a little bit of texture in the sauce.

172
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:45.360
So I like to just crush them with a hand with my hands and put them in a big

173
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:45.991
bowl.
And that's,

174
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.500
I don't know if any of you have kids or are thinking about it or are on your way

175
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:53.130
like Erin,
but,
um,
it's a really great job for kids to do,

176
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.950
like to get in a big bowl of tomatoes and like crush them.
It feels like,

177
00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:58.860
oh my God,
I get to make a mess and,
but like it's for a good purpose.

178
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:02.010
So that's always great.
So this seems nice and hot.

179
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.940
This is way better than my stove at home.
Um,

180
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.220
so I just added that garlic and I think you guys can see,
I'm not sure,
but,

181
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.270
um,
I'll face it this way.
I only,
when I add garlic to oil in a pan,

182
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:20.271
I always kind of tilt the pot so that the garlic can kind of like fry in it.

183
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.940
Um,
and obviously if you had a ton of olive oil,
you wouldn't need to do that.

184
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.850
But this way you don't have to add like so much faff to what you're making.

185
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.720
So just kind of get it till it's like really nice and fragrant and this to me is

186
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:32.730
just the best smell in the world.

187
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.570
I don't think there's really much better than that.
Oh my God,
they did it.

188
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:37.404
That's amazing.
Okay,

189
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.700
so we're going to add the tomatoes and just maybe not where like your favorite

190
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:42.720
white shirt when you do this.

191
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.750
That's my only advice and those go in and I am just going to add a bit of salt

192
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.510
and tomatoes definitely love salt.
So don't be shy.

193
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.820
And basically this comes to a boil and once it does that I'm going to turn the

194
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:02.100
heat down a little bit.
And that is tomato sauce.

195
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.860
So tomato sauce is something a lot of people buy in a jar.

196
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:07.800
It usually is like filled with sugar and preservatives and all this stuff.

197
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.540
Fine if you like those things.
But if you don't,

198
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.870
it's really like to me this is the most delicious sauce and it's really that

199
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:15.600
easy and this is something that you can make a big batch of.

200
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:19.470
It freezes really well.
If you're into like DIY stuff,

201
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.610
you can migrate tomatoes right now at the farmer's market in New York,
peel them,

202
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.330
you know,
make your own sort of canned tomatoes.
Um,
but that's it.

203
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.830
And it's as simple as that.

204
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:31.110
So these are going to go in the oven and that's how they'll cook.

205
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.030
I love those who made the little one.
It's so cute.
It was great.
Um,

206
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.950
the only thing I'm going to do before I put them in the oven,

207
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:41.280
it's just drizzle them with a little bit more olive oil on top because basically

208
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:44.400
fat helps things.
Brown,
um,
also makes things delicious.

209
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.640
So I'm a little olive oil will help and there's,
um,

210
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.570
I forgot to mention there's olive oil rubbed on a piece of parchment on this
pan,

211
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:53.350
which again,
we'll just help them release.

212
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:57.520
Basically anything that makes your life easier in the kitchen is great by me.

213
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:59.170
So that's the purpose of that.

214
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:03.760
It also makes clean up easier cause we don't have like that burned like Turkey

215
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:08.140
stuff on the pan once it's done.
So a little drizzle

216
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.820
and then we're going to race these and then once they're cooked,

217
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:16.600
we'll pop them in the tomato sauce.

218
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.340
Okay.
Awesome.
So I'm going to stick them in here.
I think we're at four 25,

219
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:31.060
which is,
um,
I feel like a temperature.

220
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:34.770
I tend to do a lot of things at and um,

221
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.610
we're going to cook them for,
um,
I can't remember how long.
I think like 20,

222
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:44.230
25 minutes.
But you just sort of check them.

223
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.770
I'm going to check this to see what I told you because let's see if I'm right.

224
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.790
Oh Yeah,
about 25 minutes.
That's good.
And,

225
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.780
but I'll probably check them around 20 and since we have two trays in 10
minutes,

226
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:58.510
I'm just going to flip them just so they cook really nice and evenly.

227
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.640
And then we'll pop them in here.

228
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:04.270
And those are Turkey and Maconomy balls and they're one of my favorite things

229
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:07.840
and I hope you enjoy them.
And so that you don't have to wait for 20 minutes.

230
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.810
We have some already cooked and they're bubbling away right by Deborah.
Um,

231
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.210
and we also have some pasta because I just feel like there's nothing better than

232
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.630
meat balls on Spaghetti,
but these are also something that like,

233
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.720
I love like a big bowl of like something like,

234
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.860
like really garlic Lee Garlicky,
Broccoli rob next to a pile of meat balls.

235
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:29.380
It's like a little healthier.
It's a little lighter if you're,
you know,

236
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:31.540
trying to avoid things like carbs,
but if you're not,

237
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.890
then you can just eat this all to yourself,
which is what I would love to do.
Um,

238
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.230
and they're also really delicious on Polenta or rice.
Um,

239
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.240
anything that's going to help absorb that sauce is really like,

240
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:45.880
it's going to be your friend here and maybe like a piece of garlicky toast or

241
00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:49.570
something like that.
But I really feel like if you know how to make these,

242
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.560
you just like,

243
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.040
it means you have this really great like home cook thing in your fridge waiting

244
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:56.770
for you when you get home from work.
You guys all work like super hard.

245
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:59.860
You work at one of the busiest places and I feel like taking the time to make

246
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:01.990
something homemade,
just,
it's a really,

247
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:05.470
I think it's a sort of like empowering thing to do and it's like it's a nice

248
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:08.200
kind of self care moment or you know,
great for your family.

249
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.200
So those are the main boss.
So I would love,

250
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.900
maybe we could have people try them if that works out.
And um,

251
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.050
oh yeah.
And I would love to know if you have any questions about meatballs,

252
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.990
cookbooks,
um,
anything.
Yeah,
please.
Yeah.

253
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.950
When you made it before,
like you,
you kind of crushed it beforehand.

254
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.240
Did you add anything special to that?

255
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.330
Like any herbs or nothing exactly into the meatball.

256
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.470
Sometimes I like to like,
um,

257
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.820
that moment when you add the tomatoes to the hot sort of garlicky oil.

258
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:49.360
Sometimes I like to throw like one or two whole sprigs of fresh basil,

259
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:49.991
just the whole thing,

260
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:53.420
like you don't even take off and just let it cook as the sauce cooks and then I

261
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:57.470
pull it out at the end and it gives like a really nice flavor.
But you can,

262
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:00.410
I mean if you want other herbs like you could put like finely chop time or

263
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:00.860
rosemary,

264
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.730
any of those kinds of like woody herbs and this sauce also can go in a lot of

265
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:05.541
different directions.

266
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:09.020
Like if I'm making like those sort of north African meatballs I was talking

267
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:10.610
about like with the acumen and stuff.

268
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.120
Sometimes like I'll put a cinnamon stick in the oil and then add the tomatoes

269
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.300
and it like it's one ingredient but it makes it this whole different thing and

270
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:19.850
it just gives us this whole new level like layer of flavor.

271
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:21.590
So that's a really nice thing to do.

272
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:25.220
But this is kind of like the baseline and then you can go anywhere.

273
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.070
I have one more question.
Yeah,
please.
Yeah.
Yeah.

274
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.600
If you're not going to like kind of professionally canning jar.
Yeah,

275
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.150
don't need to do that.
Yeah.
How long would that stay?
Good.

276
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.540
I would say what state good for.
Definitely at least like a week in the fridge.

277
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.060
And if you don't want to do the canning and jarring and stuff,

278
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:46.090
I highly recommend just putting it like in a quart size Ziploc or you know,

279
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:50.330
whatever brand of plastic baggy like and um,
and then freeze it.

280
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.470
And when I do,

281
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:55.350
I do that with soups a lot and tomato sauce and I put it in the bag and then I

282
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.930
lay it flat in the freezer.

283
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.800
And then once it's frozen you can kind of stack them up and make like files.

284
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.160
So you can have your like super sauce filing cabinet in the freezer.

285
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:08.780
It takes up like a lot less space,
which is a premium in New York.
Um,
and it just,

286
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:10.100
it makes it really easy.
Also,

287
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:12.740
you can do it in a smaller size bag and then you can pull out,

288
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.650
like if you're just cooking for yourself or just one or two other people,

289
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:18.140
like you don't have to defrost like this huge thing just to get like a little

290
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:21.800
bit.
So yeah.
Yeah,
of course.
Thank you.

291
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.310
But those of us who don't cook,
um,
come over.

292
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.180
What do you recommend starting with?
What are some good recipes to be in?

293
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.150
That's a great question.
I think this is a really good recipe.

294
00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:39.050
It mostly just because they're delicious and they're like pretty easy to make

295
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:43.280
and you can make such a big batch.
As I was talking about,
um,
I think I may have,

296
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.090
I know it's on,
sorry.
There's also,
it really depends on what you like to eat.

297
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:51.730
I think if you,
um,
you know,
if you enjoy chicken,
there's a roast chicken,
um,

298
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.551
in small victories,

299
00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:55.010
which is kind of like there's a roast chicken in every cookbook.
I know.

300
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:58.370
But this one I really believe in so much cause it sort of teaches you all these

301
00:16:58.371 --> 00:17:01.070
great techniques that aren't techniques.
They're just easy at me.

302
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.250
Like I'm thinking about taking the chicken out so it's at room temperature

303
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:05.210
before it goes in the oven.

304
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.370
So you're not putting this ice cold thing in a hot oven.

305
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:09.470
And like likewise one of those cooking.

306
00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:13.010
So it's like doing a simple thing like that.
We'll make a big difference.
Um,

307
00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:17.270
it's got a really nice mix of like salt and Rosemary and lemon and garlic and

308
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.100
just all the things you want with a roast chicken.

309
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:20.480
So that's a really great place to start.

310
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:23.490
And I feel like roasting a chicken has kind of like pick,

311
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.280
if he can do that in the kitchen to get started,

312
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:28.940
it makes you feel like you can kind of do anything.
Um,
but if you're vegetarian,

313
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:30.920
obviously don't roast the chicken cause you,

314
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.820
that would probably make you really bummed out.
Um,
so yeah,

315
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.680
it really totally depends on what you want to eat.

316
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.860
But I would say those two are my favorite starting points.

317
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.090
Hey,
yeah,
space is a premium.
So my,
yes,

318
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.240
it's about just one 30th the size of it.

319
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.750
Do you have any small victories or strategies or,
for sure,

320
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.870
really tiny.
So I,
I'm so I now live in upstate New York.
Um,

321
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.780
we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and I now have a big kitchen.

322
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.130
But prior to that I lived in a series of studio apartments in New York and very

323
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:15.810
rarely had accounters.
You know,
space like this to me is a lot of space.

324
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:18.280
I didn't have that for a long time.
Um,

325
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.800
but I have worked on cookbooks and I've tested cookbooks in apartments with that

326
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:26.580
kind of counter.
So I've done a lot of cooking and really small spaces.
Um,

327
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.230
I think a few things.
One,

328
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.800
a folding table is an awesome thing and I have set up many in um,

329
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:34.590
you know,

330
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.430
whatever spaces near my kitchen when I'm doing a lot of cooking because I think

331
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:40.050
you don't really need much more space than this.

332
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.660
Like you can't chop much more than this at a time.

333
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.720
But my problem was always like,
oh,
I cut up,
you know,
these onions or whatever,

334
00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:48.600
I'm putting them in a bowl to use and then where do I put that bowl?

335
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.490
So like having that extra space somewhere,

336
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.830
the top of the fridge is a really nice spot for that.

337
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.330
But I think having a small space really forces you to be organized.
And to me,

338
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.750
cooking in New York was all about kind of shopping for just what I needed for

339
00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:03.750
that specific thing.
And not getting overwhelmed with,
you know,

340
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:08.620
so much on the counter or anything.
Um,
and I think the other thing is like,
I'm,

341
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.260
I mean,
I love a blender.
I love,
you know,
I love a gadget here or there,

342
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:15.090
but I really don't think they're all that necessary.

343
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:18.450
I honestly think if you have like a few good mixing goals and a pot and a good

344
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:20.850
knife,
like you can make anything and like,

345
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:25.020
I don't think you need that many gadgets or electronics like on the kitchen

346
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:27.210
counter.
So that would be my advice.

347
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:29.960
It's just to kind of pair down and you can make a lot.
So.

348
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.390
Any other questions when you tell us more about how you got into this field?

349
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:40.500
Sure.
Yeah.
Um,
so I have cooked since,
um,
like,

350
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:42.240
well before I can remember.
I can't,

351
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.370
I like truly can't remember a time when I wasn't cooking.

352
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:47.880
When I met Karen when we were eight,
I was already into food.
Um,

353
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.900
and I have just always loved it.
It's been my passion.
Um,
and the thing,

354
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:55.630
I've also really loved his writing and I always loved English classes.
Um,

355
00:19:55.631 --> 00:19:57.360
and my parents both worked in publishing,

356
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.800
so it always felt very familiar and comfortable to me to be near magazines and

357
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:06.510
books and sort of printed matter.
Um,
which is fascinating to be here at Google,

358
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.720
but I always loved combining my love of food with my love of writing.
Um,

359
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.110
and at whatever age when you start writing like book reports,
like Middle School,

360
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:18.780
that kind of like I like I wrote about like what huck Finn Eight,

361
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.260
like it was always about food.
I was always writing about food.
Um,

362
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.260
and then I went to college in New York on the upper west side.
I went to Barnard.

363
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.240
And being in New York,
as you all know,

364
00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:30.600
kind of gives you this sort of entry point to lots of things that you might not

365
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:33.090
have access to in other places.
So I started interning.

366
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:35.280
I was an internet food and wine magazine for a year.

367
00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:39.720
I worked for this great guy who produces food shows for um,
public television.

368
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:44.340
I just kind of got my foot in as many food doors as I could and then worked

369
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:46.990
really hard to stay on the other side of those doors.
Um,

370
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.680
and the guy who produced the produced all that public television shows,

371
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:53.310
he worked on that show,
Spain on the road again.
Um,

372
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.260
and you mentioned the first book I worked on was called Spain and culinary road

373
00:20:56.261 --> 00:20:58.870
trip,
which was the companion book to that show.
Um,

374
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.350
and so that was really my starting point and then it was kind of one thing led

375
00:21:02.351 --> 00:21:04.330
to another.
And My,

376
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.750
I feel like the best way I can describe my career is that I've never written a

377
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:12.100
resume.
It's all word of mouth,
it's all sort of personal relationships.

378
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.910
And to me that's kind of the spirit of food.
It's like about sharing,
you know,

379
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.200
just these great things with other people.
So that's,
that's been that.

380
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.363
It's a fun road.

381
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.780
<v 2>Oh,
hey.</v>

382
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.120
<v 1>So you mentioned meeting your wife through a meatball recipe.</v>

383
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.170
Any other fun date night recipes?
Shit work.
You excited?
Yeah,
I think,
um,

384
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.620
that's so funny.
Um,

385
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.120
so I'm trying to think like I think one really great thing to do is to cook

386
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:46.060
together.
If both you and the person you are,
you know,

387
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.110
having a romance with enjoy cooking,
um,

388
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.200
that can be really fun to just kind of have an activity and then you're like,

389
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:56.440
you're making something together that's really nice and it's nice to sit down

390
00:21:56.441 --> 00:22:01.150
and be like,
oh we both like invested this time and to doing that,
um,
you know,

391
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:04.540
you can both row out the meatballs like whatever works and,

392
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:08.590
but also if the person you're with doesn't enjoy cooking,

393
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:11.080
it really can be such a gift to cook for someone.

394
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.410
Or if you don't really like cooking you can just kind of like gently push a

395
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:17.050
cookbook during their way.
Um,
and you know,

396
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:18.700
make a suggestion of maybe they like cooking.

397
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:21.910
Cause I think cooking is just the best way to show someone you really care about

398
00:22:21.911 --> 00:22:25.810
them.
It's been my means of doing that my whole life.
And it can be simple.

399
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:28.560
It can be like a sandwich that someone takes,
you know,
to the office.
Like,

400
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.800
I really believe cooking doesn't have to be over the top to be just meaningful

401
00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:35.590
by any means.
Um,
so some good things to make it home.

402
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:38.080
There's a recipe in small victories for if you like fish.

403
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.680
It's a really easy recipe and it's basically you take a sheet pan,

404
00:22:41.681 --> 00:22:44.950
like the one we had the meatballs on and you put um,

405
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.110
either chopped tomatoes or cherry tomatoes,

406
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:50.950
a little garlic and oil roasted and make this kind of roasted tomato like base.

407
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.250
And then you put some,
like,
I use flounder in the book,

408
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:57.760
but any kind of flat thin fish that will cook sort of quickly.

409
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.980
And you put that on top of the roasted tomatoes.

410
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:02.770
You put like a little bit of olive oil and I put some olives because I loved

411
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:03.280
them,

412
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.120
but we'll leave them out and you just put that back in the oven and it takes

413
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:09.610
like 10 minutes and it's like this,
it's really like,

414
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:10.900
it's kind of like a really elegant dish,

415
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:14.620
but it's so easy and it's like you're not dealing with like searing fish in a

416
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.340
hot pan and it's gonna overcook and it's gonna make your apartment smell like a

417
00:23:18.341 --> 00:23:21.040
seafood restaurant for a week.
And,
um,

418
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.130
there's also another fish that's wrapped in parchment and has something called

419
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:27.640
Chermoula,
which was the sort of north African kind of,
sort of like a pesto.

420
00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:29.950
It's got like Cilantro and cumin and those kinds of flavors.

421
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.630
That's really nice because again,

422
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.100
you're not dealing with like smoky fish stuff in a small space.

423
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.600
Um,
and those two are like pretty quick to put together and kind of just like a

424
00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:42.420
little bit elevated.
Like,
I dunno,

425
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.620
making fish at home always feels like a little special to me.

426
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:48.060
So I like for a date kind of thing.
That would be great.
And,
um,

427
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.050
if you don't like fish,
I just,
I really always go back to the roast chicken.

428
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.913
I just think it's the best.

429
00:23:55.190 --> 00:24:00.030
<v 2>I'll ask one more,
uh,
cause like I suppose you don't always eat your own food.</v>

430
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.820
<v 1>Do you have any favorite restaurants in New York City?
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

431
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.660
my friend Mario Batali who I know is coming to do an event,

432
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:11.150
I think at some point.
Um,
he has a line that I love,

433
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:13.970
which is his favorite thing to eat is anything anyone else makes.

434
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.690
So I totally get that.
Um,
my,

435
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.030
now that I don't live in the city when I,

436
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:23.960
it's sort of helped me feel very clear about the places I do love to come to

437
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:27.680
because my time here is much more limited than it used to be.
And honestly,

438
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.520
the three restaurants I love more than anything or very close by.
Um,

439
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.930
their buvette via Carota and East Sodi and Buvette.
Um,

440
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.260
full disclosure,
I worked on the buvette books.
I'm totally biased.
Um,

441
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.970
but so happily,
uh,
biased and Jody Williams runs buvette.
She's amazing.

442
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:47.120
She's one of the funniest people in the world.
She's so talented.
It's a little,

443
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:51.260
if you haven't been there,
it's tiny.
It's nothing like Google.
It's this big.

444
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.490
Um,
and it's basically like stepping into like a little slice of Paris.

445
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:58.940
It's really special.
It's like a very sort of,
you feel transported,

446
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:01.550
which is I think one of the best things you can feel in a restaurant.

447
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.490
And you can go there anytime a day,
which was great.

448
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:06.950
So you can get like a little breakfast or just a coffee.

449
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:10.760
You can have a full meal if you want.
I just think it's really special.
And then,

450
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:15.020
um,
Jodi's partner in life and business runs is Sodi,

451
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:15.854
which I think,

452
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.370
I hate to tell a big group this because it's already hard to get into,

453
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:20.990
but I think it's the best restaurant in New York.

454
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:23.390
It's the most amazing Italian restaurant.
It's on Christopher Street.

455
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.390
And then together they run via Carota on Grove Street.

456
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.620
And I just think they put their heart into everything they do and they just kind

457
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:32.480
of embodied the spirit of hospitality.

458
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:35.690
They really make you feel taken care of and their food is just delicious.

459
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:39.950
So those are my three go tos and you can go to all of them in one night because

460
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:41.090
they were all right there.

461
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.960
<v 2>Any other questions?</v>

462
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.320
<v 1>What do you think of the meatballs?
Good.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Okay,
cool.</v>

463
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.240
That's great to hear.
That's great.

464
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.893
<v 2>Huh?</v>

465
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.370
<v 1>I have a good Google strike.
Is it okay if I tell that?</v>

466
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.830
Because I was thinking about coming here and ways,

467
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.440
cause I was talking about like loving print so much,

468
00:26:04.441 --> 00:26:07.950
but also like Google has really changed my life as a cookbook author.

469
00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:08.820
And I'm not just saying that.

470
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.140
And one of the ways I was thinking that has happened is um,

471
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.620
I'm really bad with time,
but I guess a couple of years ago is working on,

472
00:26:16.621 --> 00:26:19.800
and maybe it came out a year or two ago,
a book called,
um,

473
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.780
the hot bread kitchen cookbook and hot bread kitchen is this amazing

474
00:26:24.781 --> 00:26:27.990
organization.
It's like a workforce development program.
It's based in Harlem.

475
00:26:27.991 --> 00:26:31.380
They sell it,
the farmer's markets and um,
whole foods in New York,

476
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.960
all different places.
They supply some restaurants.
It's a wholesale bakery,

477
00:26:33.961 --> 00:26:38.160
but it's completely employed by sort of immigrant and low income women.

478
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.360
And they get on the job training.
They also get business,
um,
classes,

479
00:26:42.361 --> 00:26:45.090
English as second language classes,
all that kind of amazing staff.

480
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:48.690
And they're basically graduated from the program to go on to take management

481
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:53.420
positions and other bakeries and sort of,
you know,
cooking places in New York,
um,

482
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.500
or start their own businesses,
which is awesome.
And when I was,
oh,

483
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:00.330
the other great part about it is they,

484
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:04.080
everything they make is inspired by the women or recipes or contributed by them.

485
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:06.330
So they have the most sort of eclectic,
interesting,

486
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:10.600
amazing roster of things that they make like the best Jewish,
Hala and Bialys,

487
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.280
but they also make like incredible tortillas and Moroccan flatbreads.

488
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.340
Like they're amazing.
So when I was working on that book,

489
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.150
it was sort of me communicating with all these different women trying to get

490
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:24.420
their recipes written,
trying to get,
you know,
all these stories down.

491
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:26.910
And there was definitely at certain points,

492
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.900
a real language barrier and it's kind of amazing how much you can communicate

493
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:33.690
with food without actually talking.
So that was like an interesting,

494
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.550
but I like could not have done that book without Google translate and I am so

495
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:41.910
grateful for it.
And to me it was such an interesting moment of like,
wow,

496
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.190
this like this is making this so possible.

497
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:46.650
And it was so clear to me in that moment when I was on my way here today.

498
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:50.910
I was just like,
Dang,
that would be a good story to tell here.
So thank you.

499
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.940
Whoever works on translate.
Oh my God,
that's amazing.

500
00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.490
I feel like this is good if you run,

501
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.300
I mean like I've heard about carbo loading and stuff.
So

502
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.740
anyway,
any other questions?
Yes.
Thank you

503
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.870
<v 3>for coming by the way.
This is amazing.
Oh,
I'm so glad you like that.
Um,</v>

504
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:08.981
I was interested,

505
00:28:08.981 --> 00:28:13.840
you've obviously worked with a lot of a really famous chefs whose,
um,

506
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.870
who would be somebody that you haven't worked with yet that you'd be really

507
00:28:16.871 --> 00:28:18.370
interested in?
Oh,
I'm running with in the future.

508
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.230
<v 1>That's a great question.
Um,</v>

509
00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.190
I would think about this for a second.
There's a few,

510
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:29.080
there's a few that come to mind and they're both in the south.
Um,
and my wife,

511
00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:31.150
grace we were talking about is from Virginia.
So there's,

512
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.880
there's part of me that like,
it feels very drawn towards the south.

513
00:28:33.881 --> 00:28:37.860
Maybe it's from that.
Um,
but one does not need my help whatsoever.
Um,

514
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.830
and her name is Vivian Howard.
She a PBS show.
Um,
she has her own book.

515
00:28:41.831 --> 00:28:44.080
I think it's coming out in October.
It's amazing.
Um,

516
00:28:44.081 --> 00:28:48.220
I got to see a little sneak peek of it,
but I think her approach to food is just,

517
00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.040
it's so,
um,

518
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.430
from the heart and she's just such a talented chef on top of that sort of really

519
00:28:54.431 --> 00:28:55.990
deep emotional connection to food.

520
00:28:55.991 --> 00:29:00.010
So I guess maybe I wouldn't want to work with her cause I don't think she needs

521
00:29:00.011 --> 00:29:03.350
that.
But I guess I would just like to spend more time with her.
Um,

522
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.120
and the other is this great guy.
Um,
can,
I don't really know,

523
00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:11.720
but I had one conversation with him.
His name is Ed Mitchell and he is,
uh,

524
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.060
based in North Carolina.

525
00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:17.440
And I don't know if any of you read or watch the,
um,

526
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.760
I guess Netflix version maybe of Michael Pollan's cooked.
Um,

527
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.990
and he,

528
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.170
Michael spent a lot of time with Ed Mitchell and Ed Mitchell does whole heart,

529
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.850
whole hog barbecue,
which was hard to say,
um,
in North Carolina.

530
00:29:30.851 --> 00:29:34.960
And he learned from his father and his grandfather and it's passed down and he

531
00:29:34.961 --> 00:29:38.700
just,
I feel like he has so many amazing stories to tell.
Um,

532
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.870
and I think those stories are so,

533
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.010
and I think a cookbook is a great place to store those kinds of stories and a

534
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:47.320
way to just be able to interact with them too.

535
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:50.440
Because not only do you get to tell them,
like I got to tell you about like,
oh,

536
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:53.530
I met grace and I fell in love and I made her meatballs.
But also like,

537
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:54.610
here you can make meat balls to it.

538
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:58.270
So I feel like Ed has these really incredible stories that are just so much

539
00:29:58.271 --> 00:30:02.620
about his family,
but also kind of the history of America and it's,

540
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.440
they're important.
So I think,
I hope those get written down now.

541
00:30:07.441 --> 00:30:11.220
Of course.
Hey.

542
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.243
<v 2>Okay.</v>

543
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.960
<v 1>Do you have any foods that you hate working with?
Ah,
hate working with,</v>

544
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:26.910
but you know there are fan favorites.
Ah,
okay.
You have to work with them anymore.

545
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.670
Right.
Question.
Um,
I really like,

546
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.020
<v 2>okay.</v>

547
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.990
<v 1>I feel like I don't really dislike any food.
Um,</v>

548
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.740
and grace was poking fun at me yesterday cause I can't even remember what I was

549
00:30:38.741 --> 00:30:41.040
eating and I was like,
Oh God,
I love this as the best thing I ever had.

550
00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:42.560
And she was like,
you say that about everything.

551
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.240
Everything's the best thing you'll ever have.
So I really,

552
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:47.470
there's not much I don't like,

553
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:51.940
but I guess I feel like the thing I do try to avoid and try to avoid using in

554
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:56.320
recipes but also just eating is just like super processed food.

555
00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:59.290
Just things like I don't really understand.
Um,

556
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.480
and I definitely have a soft spot for like a cool ranch,

557
00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:02.920
Doritos or something like that.

558
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:06.340
But like I feel like those are the kinds of products I try not to use.

559
00:31:06.341 --> 00:31:08.830
And also it just comes from,

560
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.520
I feel very strongly about writing recipes that anyone can replicate no matter

561
00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:15.580
where they are.
And asking for a very particular brand of something.

562
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:18.880
And something I always try not to do unless I really have a reason for doing

563
00:31:18.881 --> 00:31:20.200
that.
And if I do,

564
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:24.130
I'll always give you like a substitution because just because you know it's hard

565
00:31:24.131 --> 00:31:27.520
in New York cause he can find anything.
But in a lot of places you can't.
So,

566
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.280
but I would say anything like super,
super processed.

567
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.703
<v 2>Okay.</v>

568
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.140
<v 1>Any other questions?</v>

569
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.590
<v 2>No.
Cool.</v>

570
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.360
<v 1>Well this was super fun and I hope you guys try to meat balls and maybe try some</v>

571
00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:46.230
variations.

572
00:31:46.231 --> 00:31:51.000
And I guess the only thing I forgot to mention is my sort of fantasy with small

573
00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:54.390
victories and offering all the variations and riffs on the recipes is,

574
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.120
I can't wait to see what people make.
But like,
you know,

575
00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.180
it's inspired by the rest of it,
but isn't the recipe like I just,

576
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.200
I feel like I put,
I tried to be as creative as I possibly could,

577
00:32:04.201 --> 00:32:08.100
but I think there's something about cookbooks and how people participate with

578
00:32:08.101 --> 00:32:10.950
them and try them on their own,
that makes it,
this kind of collaborative things.

579
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:14.550
So if you have any other ideas for meatball riffs that I love to know them.

580
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.950
Oh,

581
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:21.480
Hashtag hashtag small victories cookbook.

582
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.930
That's it.
Cool.
Thank you all so much.
