1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.620
Joining us today.
I don't think they need introduction,

2
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:11.950
but that powerhouse team behind state bird and the progress,
uh,

3
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:14.380
Stuart bureaus and Nicole Kaczynski,
welcome to go.

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.360
<v 0>Well,
um,
it's nice to be here for sure.</v>

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.560
How many of you have actually eaten that state bird?
Oh,
good.

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.630
Like a little less than half.
Perfect.
We're always looking for more

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.600
<v 2>customers.
Probably couldn't get arrested.</v>

9
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.420
Yeah,
well there's that too.
Um,

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.930
and it's a long drive from Sunnyvale.
Well worth it.

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.430
<v 0>Um,
well,
uh,
hopefully at the end of this demo that,</v>

12
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:52.230
you know,
you'll all be racing and coming up with a,

13
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.310
your own programs to hack into a reservation system and,
you know,

14
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.360
get yourself a

15
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.353
<v 2>excepted</v>

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.560
<v 0>this group.
You know,
I,
that's actually part of the history of state bird is,</v>

17
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.390
is that for some of you,

18
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:11.130
you probably already know this because like that stuff is important to you.

19
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.150
Um,

20
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.150
but we were in Australia when we were doing kind of a pop up in Australia and I

21
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:22.521
get a call at three in the morning from Palo Lucchesi who's the writer for the

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.910
San Francisco Chronicle.
And I'm like,
wow,
he's calling me.

23
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:28.470
It's three in the morning,
should I take it?

24
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:32.880
And I took it and he starts just grilling me about like,

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.630
do you know that you've been hacked?
And that people are,
you know,

26
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.440
making reservations.
And then it grew,
it just continued to grow.

27
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:45.330
So Paolo calls me and you know,
then the BBC calls us,

28
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.910
the New York Times calls us and I'm sorta like,
this isn't a big deal.

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.240
People like,
I don't see this as a big deal.
This is not a problem for us.

30
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.180
Like we're okay that people,
you know,
it was like,

31
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:01.380
it becomes a problem when people hack into the reservation system and then they

32
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:05.610
don't show up.
Because that's a problem to me is,
is that,
but,

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.090
but humans were coming in and,

34
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.590
and they were saying about robots and all this and I was like,

35
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:12.570
I don't know what you're talking about.

36
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.440
All I know is that we're packed every night.
And that's a great thing.

37
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.070
And it was sorta like,
what responsibility do I have in this?
And I was like,

38
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:21.690
I have zero responsibility.

39
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.040
<v 2>Stop being so popular.
Yeah,
exactly.
So,</v>

40
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.553
but I,

41
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.730
<v 0>it spawned off a whole new,
I call it the brave new world of,</v>

42
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.650
of running a restaurant where it's like,
okay,

43
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.420
I'd never thought about that issue.
I deal with like dishwashers,
calling in sick,

44
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.220
you know,

45
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.590
<v 2>food for,
you know,
um,</v>

46
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.750
<v 0>you know,
real restaurant issues,
you know,</v>

47
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:51.750
a sink that's runny or backs up or something.

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.610
I'm never about hacking into a reservation system seems totally out of my
league.

49
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.180
Um,
anyway,
uh,
we,
uh,
today we're going to,

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.200
we're going to demo something that I think is,
um,

51
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420
really turned into very much a signature dish at the restaurant and,

52
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.260
um,
mainly because it's so unusual,
um,
and,

53
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.340
and very delicious based on my personal experiences.

54
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.870
Um,
the,
the,

55
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.650
the idea of this is it's carrots and,
um,
we decided to,

56
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.060
to,
to make a carrot dish,
right?

57
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.930
I think every chef in the country is kind of challenged with making a,

58
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.940
a carrot dish.
Um,
something that becomes kind of like part of your,

59
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.950
your,
your roster of,
of kind of,
of dishes.

60
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.580
It's just like everybody's got kind of a great fried chicken dish or a great

61
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.910
steak dish.
He also is a chef,
have to have a great character.

62
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.490
She at least it feels that way.
So our great character,

63
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:59.491
she's is to do a kind of a carrot for way right where we make a Mochi out of

64
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:04.450
this.
And you've probably all had Mochi,
but you've never had a savory Mochi.
So,

65
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.980
um,
that's,

66
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:09.700
and it makes so much sense and I look at it is as Mochi,

67
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.760
our carrot Mochi is akin in a distant cousin to the potato Neil key in Italy.

68
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:20.560
So it's really like that.
It's that same idea.
Um,
the beauty of it is,

69
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:25.320
is that it we don't have to use,
we're not using flowers,

70
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:28.300
so there's no gluten in it,
but we are using,
uh,
uh,

71
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.020
starchy glutinous rice flour,
uh,
to bind it.
Um,

72
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.060
it's also got a huge margin for error where Naoki are so temperamental and

73
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:40.300
you've got to have the right starch content in your potato.

74
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.230
You've got to have the right balance.
Timing is such a critical,

75
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.230
these are virtually foolproof.
I mean,
you can,

76
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
you can cook your carrot puree the day before and make your Mochi the day up.

77
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:58.420
Right?
Um,
so there's not a lot of,
um,
there's a big margin for,
for air,

78
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.340
which is always nice.
I mean,
I think even in the home for home cooking,
um,

79
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.970
and it's really awesome with kids.

80
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.610
So if you have kids,
I,
we have a kid.
Um,

81
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.490
of course he doesn't eat anything,

82
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.150
but other people's kids seem to really love this stage when they come to the

83
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.890
restaurant.
As a matter of fact,
we tend to,

84
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.360
when we go on to visit friends or staying with them,
their kids will be like,

85
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.610
can we make Mochi?
You know,
I mean,

86
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.790
they'll ask this and then I'll teach them and we'll do a little like kind of

87
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:32.890
Improv cooking class.
Um,

88
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.130
so let's kind of get this started.

89
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:38.890
I've taken the liberty of getting my carrots cooked.

90
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:41.730
I'm just going to crank this up.
The idea is,

91
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:46.570
is that I just cooked carrots in boiling water and you know,

92
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:51.220
organic,
the sweetest carrots you can find.
Um,
just a little salt.

93
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:54.100
So I'm going to bring this up and they're really tender.

94
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.820
And how you gauge that is,
is do they fall apart in your hands?

95
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.930
And I don't always encourage people to put your hands in boiling water.

96
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:05.750
But that's what happens when you become a chef.

97
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.040
Come Immune to these ideas of boiling water.
Um,

98
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:15.041
so these are done now and I'm going to take them and just strain them out in a

99
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.244
calendar

100
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.020
and I want to intensify the carrot flavor.
So this is kind of the trick.

101
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:28.340
We could stop here and we could just kind of pure a these carrots or we could do

102
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.480
what I'm going to do next,

103
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.540
which is basically intensify the carrot flavor.

104
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.270
Like putting this back on the stove.

105
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.380
Let's make sure these induction burners or is it going?

106
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.570
I think it is.
I feel it.
Um,
Oh yes.

107
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.610
I'm going to add carrot juice to this.

108
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:55.220
So fresh carrot juice added to these carrots

109
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.770
and I'm going to kind of do it little by little.

110
00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:05.700
So I'm going to like reduce it in and I'm going to concentrate and basically

111
00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:09.930
sweeten up the flavor.
The idea is is to just get the most flavor,

112
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.570
the most carrot flavor into my Mochi.

113
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.900
Otherwise they will just look like orange balls.

114
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.820
But if I can get more in infused more flavor,
it's really helpful.

115
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.890
Okay.
While this is going,
I'm going to kind of roast the carrot.
So as I said,

116
00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:28.080
it's a carrot for way

117
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.450
and so in a pan with butter and don't be afraid to use butter.

118
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.360
Seriously.
You laugh bumpy.

119
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.030
This is why our restaurant is so good.

120
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.070
Um,
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to just throw my carrots right into here.

121
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.090
I mean not use all of these.
Try to find some different sizes

122
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.470
and I'm going to take a couple of garlic cloves and I like to keep them in the

123
00:08:05.471 --> 00:08:06.304
skin.

124
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.060
And what I'll do is as I just smash him can just kind of take a knife and I just

125
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:17.581
want to crack the skin and I want to get just a little flavor that comes out,

126
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.480
right?
And I like to use the skin.
There's nothing wrong with the skin.

127
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.050
Don't be afraid of the skin.
Um,

128
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:31.170
and I'm going to take some rosemary and I'm just gonna throw a couple of sprigs

129
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:34.810
of Rosemary in here.

130
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.980
<v 1>Okay.
A good crack of pepper,</v>

131
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.730
<v 0>of course.
Like to use a pepper mill.
Just kind of makes sense.</v>

132
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.520
And then,
oops,
pardon me,
the good pinch of salt.

133
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.890
And don't be afraid to use salts.
Hi there.

134
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.690
That's another secret to why our restaurants are so good now.

135
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.700
He can smell that.
Can you guys get that?

136
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.120
Okay,
so soon enough you'll get that.

137
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.060
And I'm going to turn the heat down cause I don't want to roast it too hot,

138
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.200
but I do want the butter to Brown and notice I didn't brown my butter first.

139
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:24.060
You don't need to.
You can actually brown it in the process of doing it and um,

140
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.310
I'm just going to assume that that's going to be good and keep that going.

141
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.790
Pardon my reach here and notice it.

142
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.810
Nicole just keeps adding more carrot juice to the pot and we keep reducing it

143
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.300
and we're going to make our,
our goal here is this to make like a,

144
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.340
a real tight concentrated kind of blob of a mass.
Okay.
Um,

145
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.880
blob is a culinary term for anything that sort of moves in,

146
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.770
Blah Buehler motion.

147
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

148
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.940
<v 0>Okay.
So these take a while to cook.</v>

149
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.360
You could roast them in the oven or you can just do the whole thing on the stove

150
00:10:04.361 --> 00:10:08.590
top and you see where it gets foamy and buttery there and you see all that.

151
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.220
That's the magic that's happening to the carrots and the,

152
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.500
that's the browning of it and snow.

153
00:10:14.501 --> 00:10:18.670
I just want to manage it and kind of keep it going.
Okay,
cool.

154
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.290
Feeling

155
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.630
<v 2>free to ask questions as we're going to,</v>

156
00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:25.660
I'm sort of not like save your questions to the end.
Yeah.

157
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.710
It inspires you immediately.
Just like a jolted out.

158
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.040
The only a dorky thing is I have to repeat them for the people who watch it on

159
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:34.780
the live stream later.
So,
yes,
Andre.

160
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.560
<v 1>Oh,</v>

161
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.810
<v 2>do you use a pressure cooker method to caramelize?</v>

162
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.380
<v 0>Uh,
no.
Uh,
to answer your question,</v>

163
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.440
but that doesn't sound like a bad idea for the carrot puree to just or,

164
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.123
<v 1>yeah.</v>

165
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.380
<v 2>How interested the brown butter.</v>

166
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.443
<v 1>Oh,</v>

167
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.190
<v 0>yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I don't know.
Um,
I,
I haven't,</v>

168
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.750
no,
but not that.
I wouldn't think that's a great idea.

169
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.180
Do you use a pressure cooker quite a lot for other things?
That's right,
yeah.

170
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.150
Yeah.
We,
yeah,
we do use pressure cookers for,
um,

171
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.430
kind of extractions more or less.
Right.
Also,
I'll throw a whole fish into it,

172
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.600
like whole card and I'll make a fish stock in a pressure cooker.

173
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.110
And it's totally wild and crazy,

174
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:33.550
but it really extracts all the gelatin is out of it.

175
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.190
I'll do a French onion soup and a fresher cooker where we caramelize our onions

176
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.760
and then we'll put the onions into a pressure cooker with onion stock and then

177
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:47.340
we'll turn it on and we'll let it go.
And sometimes I'll even put,

178
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.350
I put green air in the pressure cooker with the Iranians and then,
you know,

179
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.630
so it was pretty cool.
I mean,
it's some neat things.

180
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.720
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that what I like about it is,
is that you,

181
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.320
you don't lose any liquid.
You retain everything.

182
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:09.250
So everything that goes in is everything that's coming out too.
Right.
Um,

183
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.570
but however,
in this case,

184
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:14.110
we want to encourage the reduction because we're concentrating.

185
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.060
The sugar is in the sweet flavors in it.
But good question.
Cool.

186
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.120
Those books are just way too big.
You made it to,
yeah,

187
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.350
they're impressive.

188
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.750
<v 2>It's a lifelong journey through modernist cuisine.</v>

189
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.630
They came out with modern and speaking and I have tacked on many years to my

190
00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:33.620
life to get through that one.

191
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.010
<v 0>All right.
So,
um,</v>

192
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.890
we're almost there on this making a totally great blob.

193
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.753
Um,

194
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.450
and as it just gets tightened up there,

195
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.560
you can really smell the concentration of carrots and you're just getting such a

196
00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:56.394
nice,

197
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.183
<v 3>okay.</v>

198
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.320
<v 0>Such a nice flavor there.
Um,</v>

199
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.730
other mochies that we've done as well,

200
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.760
I think color plays an important role.
So I've done,

201
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.650
we did a caramelized onion and Rosemary Mochi that tasted great,

202
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:16.230
but it didn't look so beautiful.
Um,

203
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.680
but there's other things that we've done that we have grad great success.

204
00:13:19.681 --> 00:13:21.810
So like a pumpkin or a squash Mochi,

205
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.040
winter squash where you roast and you get that bright,
vivid color.

206
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.930
And then when you mix in the flour,
the Mochi flour,
it,

207
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.440
it works the same way.
And when you cook them,

208
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.800
they look just like the same color of a pumpkin.

209
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.040
So this recipe is totally transferrable to other things,

210
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:47.050
as,
as many things as you want to kind of try.
Um,

211
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.100
I would totally encourage you to make the carrot version first.

212
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:54.540
Um,

213
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.540
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take this and he can see how it's really

214
00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:01.000
tight.

215
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.360
<v 2>It's lobular if you will clog</v>

216
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.440
<v 0>with texture and I'm going to,
let's start with that guy.</v>

217
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.570
I think I'm done with it.

218
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.710
I'm just going to puree it.
I want to get it.

219
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.180
I like the texture of carrot in there.

220
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:29.160
So it's not imperative that it's very smooth.
Um,
but it's,

221
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:30.780
it's okay if it's very smooth.

222
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.300
I kinda think like the texture of rice,

223
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.560
maybe the coarseness of broken rice is a good way to think about it.

224
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.960
Okay,
cool.

225
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.550
And now what I'm going to do,

226
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.590
the most important steps here is

227
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.260
I am going to weigh it out.
And so

228
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.173
<v 3>yeah,</v>

229
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.600
<v 0>basically do,
and you could make,</v>

230
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.920
I mean there is a recipe and it tells you how much to use,
of course,

231
00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:12.720
cause that's what recipe books do.
But basically we like to work in ratios,
right?

232
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.340
And so I've got this nice carrot puree and I'm getting

233
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.900
500 and I know I brought a pound of Mochi flour.

234
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.470
So I start with one to one ratio.

235
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.100
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

236
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.780
<v 0>I usually ended up adding a little bit more.
So there's 454 grams.</v>

237
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.810
I'll just go 400 to give myself a little,
and again,
this can totally,

238
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.220
it's,
it's whatever you want to make.
I mean,

239
00:15:48.221 --> 00:15:52.540
we make the US in 2,500 gram batches is kind of the idea.

240
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.500
Um,

241
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.500
and then what I'll do is I've got about 400 grams right here and I'll add,

242
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.750
<v 3>okay,</v>

243
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.540
<v 0>another 400 grams or so of Mochi flour</v>

244
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.000
and that'll be my starting point.

245
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.610
Perfect.
And being that I'm adding a lot of

246
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.130
flour,
just a nice pinch of salt into there.

247
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.053
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

248
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.480
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
boy,
2,500.</v>

249
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:42.230
So that's about five pounds of Mochi,
right?
Well,

250
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:44.180
we're making two pounds of Mochi.

251
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.390
It would last us about a night's worth of service,
right?

252
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.340
This is one of our most popular dishes for sure.
Outside of the Quayle of course.

253
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.830
But people just love this dish.

254
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.240
It's a hard one for us to take off now because it's so unusual and it's kind of

255
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:03.800
like,
it's just a slam dunk every day.
People eat it and nobody's like,

256
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.330
oh Whoa,
that's a weird texture.
They're eating it and going,
wow,

257
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.480
I never thought carrots could actually taste so good and this is really unusual.

258
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:15.770
And that sort of,
it's,
it's that thing that's like,
it's,

259
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.420
it's familiar,
but it's different.

260
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.160
And that's one of the kind of the philosophies of state bird is,

261
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:27.500
is that we try to work within the familiar,

262
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.670
but we want to do something that's just a little different.
Right?
You know,

263
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:34.460
we do a fried quail in lieu of doing fried chicken,

264
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.440
but the idea was inspired from fried chicken.
Of course.
Right?

265
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:42.170
We make Mochi instead of neocon.
Right?

266
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.910
We do ice cream sandwiches that aren't ice cream ice cream sandwiches that

267
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:51.150
aren't ice cream.
Um,
but they are at,
they're not,
but they are,

268
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:55.200
but they're not.
That's an argument that we continue to have.
Um,

269
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.600
we do,
we do things like we do traditional,

270
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.160
this is one of my favorite dishes and it's in the book is we do an a macho

271
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:09.030
Chiana.
Do you guys know how much Chiana anyone?
You're nodding your head.

272
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:11.130
I'm going to put you on the spot.
What is it?

273
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.730
You got it?
Yeah,
so it's a Roman dish.

274
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:20.910
It's a Roman pasta dish that's made with Guan Sharlay,

275
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:24.300
which is cured pork Gel.
Right?

276
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.110
And so it's got a lot of pepper to it and it's like Penn Chedda but it's using

277
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:30.120
this portion of the,
of the pork.

278
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:35.450
It is magic and it's one of my all time favorite dishes ever to be made in the

279
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:39.660
world.
And it's really kind of a nice tomato sauce.

280
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.330
You start off rendering out your Guan.
Charlie,

281
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.470
you had your tomato sauce and you had Rigatoni and you had lots of pepper,

282
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.880
Pecorino and black pepper.
And that's the dish.
Well,

283
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:52.830
we do something completely,

284
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.690
we riff off of that and we take one Sharlay we render it out and we had a little

285
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:01.230
garlic and some chilies.
We had little Chantrelle to it.

286
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.490
We had fresh tomato sauce from fresh heirloom tomatoes.

287
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.720
So this is something we only do in the summer.
And then we use Tofu,

288
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:12.420
skin Uba as our noodles for this.

289
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.400
So we totally spent it on its ear because I think any anyone's Italian

290
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:18.234
grandmother would

291
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.980
beat me to a pulp with a wooden spoon in the kitchen if I knew that there was

292
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:30.240
using,
you know,
I mean,
first if I was using fresh tomatoes in,

293
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.780
in Guangxi,
in Macho Ciana,
you know,

294
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.530
and something beyond just Rigatoni,
but the fact that it's Tofu,
food,
skin,

295
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.150
but it's magic.
And when you eat the dish it tastes like,
and a much a geode.

296
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:46.260
But it's,
it's familiar but different.

297
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.270
And so that is what we do.

298
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.720
So what I'm looking for here in my dough,

299
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.370
it's just something about this consistency.
It's a little tight.

300
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.920
It's also a little tacky to it,
but it can hold its shape,
not unlike Plato.

301
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.040
Right?
Um,
but there is a nice tackiness to it.

302
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.750
And so for this we would do is we'd make balls.

303
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.210
And so I'm going to have Nicole make some

304
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.100
little mochi balls there.
Well,

305
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.650
I'm going to really put myself to the test because I generally always have a pot

306
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:25.260
of water going.
Can I do my little tester?

307
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:30.270
But I'm so confident today cause I don't need to do a test here living

308
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.104
dangerously.

309
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.370
That's something in the kitchen is it's like if we make a sausage or a doe or

310
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.800
anything of that store,
we always make a test here.

311
00:20:38.801 --> 00:20:43.510
We just want to make sure that the seasonings right,
that the textures right.

312
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.640
And so if any adjustments need to be made,

313
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.820
it's not after you've 150 balls and you have to put them back in and re three,

314
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.660
make it.
Um,
so while that's going,

315
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:59.980
I'm going to turn the heat back on on this.
Okay.

316
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.060
And you see our carrots are just kind of moving away and they're gorgeous,
right?

317
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.540
Not quite there yet.
So we'll just let them kind of finish.

318
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:09.580
I'm going to turn that heat up.

319
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.960
The next step in our process here.
Ooh,
you know what?

320
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:15.190
I used

321
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.030
my bowl here.
Um,

322
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.070
let's see if I can do this.

323
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.340
<v 2>I'm certain we have another bowl for you.
Are you sure?</v>

324
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.340
It's literally right here.
Thank you Sharon.

325
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.710
<v 0>Okay,
so the next step is going to be to make,
we've got three,</v>

326
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.800
this is the third component is going to be our vinegarette.

327
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.900
And so because we want,
we've got roasted carrots,
we've got pickled carrots,

328
00:21:47.901 --> 00:21:51.020
which I'll go into in just a minute.
And then we've got the carrot Mochi.

329
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.230
We want to reintroduce another fresh component into it.

330
00:21:54.231 --> 00:21:59.231
So this is just fresh carrot juice that becomes the basis of our carrot

331
00:22:00.741 --> 00:22:05.030
vinegarette into that.
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to add fresh lime.

332
00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.053
Okay.

333
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.660
I like to kind of massage my lime up a little bit and I'm just going to squeeze

334
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:19.100
lime juice into this am going purely by taste here.

335
00:22:19.101 --> 00:22:23.570
You guys feel pretty confident that I've got that part nailed

336
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:31.070
and you know I'm just going to juice you know a character.
So,
all right,

337
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.290
I'm sorry.
A line.
The next,

338
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:38.150
the microplane comes in handy and this is going to blow your minds.

339
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.690
So I think that micro planes are about the biggest,

340
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.890
the best tool ever to be created in the kitchen.

341
00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.020
And I'll show you why

342
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.910
because it can replace everything you own.
All right.

343
00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:01.070
So I use a microplane to grate ginger

344
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.190
and I feel that what I get out of it is,
is I get a great disbursement

345
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:13.730
of ginger flavor,
right?
And you can see it underneath there and it just,

346
00:23:13.731 --> 00:23:18.590
it really takes it down to such a ground mass.

347
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.280
It works great.
I use a microplane to great garlic.

348
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.030
We'll take a clove of garlic and I don't use a lot.

349
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.110
Little garlic goes a long way,
so you always have more.

350
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.150
This is the mind blowing part.
I use a microplane to great fresh chilies.

351
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.493
And so

352
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:43.260
it comes with a nice sounds to you're actually grading something and you never

353
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.760
how spicy or chilies are.

354
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:50.933
<v 3>Cool.</v>

355
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:57.100
<v 0>So I'll add a little bit of ground chili into it.
Um,</v>

356
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.440
I think the Chile thing really blows my mind.

357
00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:05.390
I loved you've never seen that before.
Yeah.
See I'm stealing that.

358
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:10.430
What we're gonna do is financial,
a,
the fresh black pepper pinch of salt to this.

359
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.880
And then we're going to kind of make an oil slick of extra virgin olive oil.

360
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.190
Stir this whole thing around

361
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.440
and now we've got this like super vibrant carrot vinegarette.

362
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.390
We taste everything.
I think it needs more acid.

363
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.630
The garlic is amazing.
The ginger comes through.

364
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:41.000
I'm getting a little heat.
I think I kind of want a little more heat in there.
Um,

365
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.440
but this is how we do it,
right?
You know,
you constantly

366
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.190
or tasting for what you want.
I'm going to put a little more ginger in there.

367
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.270
Ginger and carrot is just one of the magical combinations.

368
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.010
So you probably know already

369
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.430
a little more to insure a little more Jalapeno.

370
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.820
What I love about the Jalapeno
by doing this is that you,

371
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.110
you really don't get the seeds.
Let's go fresh spoon.

372
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.293
There it is.

373
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.620
So what I'm looking for there is I want

374
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.870
to taste the carrot juice,
but I want to taste all of the other ingredients,

375
00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:33.730
the garlic,
the ginger,
the Jalapeno.

376
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.180
I want to have a nice little kind of slick of olive oil that can adds the fat to

377
00:25:39.851 --> 00:25:42.330
it.
I also want to just make sure that the line,

378
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.140
the acid and salt is really balanced.
Stripe,
not one should overpower the other.

379
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.410
And that's how we do that.
Cool.
So these carrots are just,

380
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.850
they're doing really well.
And I'm running out of stove space here,

381
00:25:55.450 --> 00:26:00.210
but
we're going to just take it really quick.
So the,

382
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:05.050
the last part of this dish,
now we've got our carrot juice vin.

383
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.581
This is,

384
00:26:06.581 --> 00:26:11.290
we're going to make the Duka and Duke is just kind of a,

385
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.900
it's a cumin based,
um,

386
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.770
kind of spice blend that we can use in the mortar and pestle.

387
00:26:17.771 --> 00:26:21.580
And we do a pistachio Duka.
We want that nuttiness from the pistachios.

388
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.800
So here I'm gonna let these guys do is turn it up really well.

389
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.720
This is so good.

390
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.470
I love carrots when they're just slow cooked in butter like this.

391
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.130
You see what's happening and we just like magic over time.
It's just happening.

392
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.510
I don't know,
can we?
No.
Okay.

393
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.550
Wow.

394
00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:51.290
<v 4>You'd have to hold over that cutting board.
Oh.
Oh.
The camera's not there.</v>

395
00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.760
Well it's right there.
It's that one that's right over where your,
yeah,

396
00:26:55.761 --> 00:26:56.594
right there

397
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:05.340
<v 0>is how I see it.
Okay.
Can you guys see that?
Yeah.
That's gorgeous.
Wonderful.</v>

398
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.240
Well now that we've got that part out of the way,

399
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.170
<v 2>ABN just well aware.</v>

400
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.520
<v 1>Cool.
All right.</v>

401
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.830
<v 0>I'm going to pull that off and they're going to just continue to simmer there.</v>

402
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.360
Meanwhile,
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to have everything here.
Whole Queue,

403
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.920
coriander,
seeds,
cumin,

404
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.160
when to add sesame to this mix have already pre toasted my pistachios.

405
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.690
I've got Chili flakes and I've got sea salt.

406
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.670
I do not want to toast my chili flakes.

407
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.800
If I did all of you out there would start sneezing,
have eye irritation,

408
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.150
but I'll work over a nice high high heat and bring this up.

409
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:58.260
And as soon as I can kind of see little wisps of smoke is where I know it's done

410
00:27:58.261 --> 00:28:00.810
and I'm going to place it right into the mortar and pestle.

411
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.460
<v 2>What other dishes do you find you like cannot take off your menu?</v>

412
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.910
<v 4>Oh,
well,
aside from the,
the bird of course pork belly.</v>

413
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.240
Yeah.
That pork belly.
Pork bellies,
citrus there.
Saltzman.
Yup.

414
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:24.170
Yup.
Um,
so we will have it for dessert
next time.

415
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.110
Next time.
Uh,
the garlic bread with burrata.
Ooh,

416
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.990
that one was transcriptions.
Did it take it off right there.

417
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.240
<v 0>Um,
we've got that dialed out.</v>

418
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:40.250
We sell about 70 of those a night and we serve about 200 people a night.

419
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.160
So can you do it?

420
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.820
<v 2>Good.
That's the one that comes by to late in the meal and you're like,
what?</v>

421
00:28:45.821 --> 00:28:47.800
I ate so much and I have to hit it.

422
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.680
<v 0>Um,</v>

423
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.680
so the broader that we use is from kind of one of the original burrata makers in

424
00:28:56.021 --> 00:29:01.000
the U S and they're down in La Joya is the name.
Yeah.

425
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.180
Yeah.
I asked him once,
I was like,
so what's your process?
And he was like,

426
00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.470
seriously,
that's the one thing I make and I'm going to give you my secrets.

427
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.540
<v 2>Hey,
you've got a question here.</v>

428
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.343
<v 0>Conditions.</v>

429
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.960
<v 2>Oh,
what are some dishes you wish you could that you do?
You constrain yourself.</v>

430
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.020
<v 4>Sky's the limit.
No,
not at all.
Um,
that's why we have a second restaurant.</v>

431
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.420
Yeah,
there you go.

432
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.660
<v 0>There aren't really any dishes that we wish we could because Steve Bird is based</v>

433
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:35.220
around it and it's built around kind of Cook what you are and the freedom of

434
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:36.650
cocaine.
Um,

435
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.830
the one thing that I always say about our food there is it has to be,

436
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:46.270
so I wouldn't put it like a steak on a plate and serve it,
right?
It's shareable.

437
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:49.460
But you know,
there's,
you know,
we've got to keep,

438
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.490
we keep people moving,
right?
We keep the,
the,
the,
that evening,

439
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.070
the dinner service moving and you know,

440
00:29:57.071 --> 00:30:01.600
we want to make sure that it is as user friendly as possible.
All of the,

441
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.970
all of our food.
And we think about that,
right?

442
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.900
How can I get more food on your table is what I think about.

443
00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:12.760
And you think about how can I get more food in my stomach?
Right?
So,
you know,

444
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:17.410
we're,
we're,
it's a team effort.
Okay.
Um,
and it's symbiotic.

445
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.500
Okay.
So do you see these little wisps of smoke and you're going to,

446
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.910
you can see that as I'm,

447
00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.370
<v 4>there you go.
Hey,
you got it.</v>

448
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.850
<v 0>Okay.
And what I'm doing is the same,
just bringing those flavors out.</v>

449
00:30:32.851 --> 00:30:35.850
Now some of you can smell that.
Just wait,

450
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.220
let's put that back on

451
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:45.330
when it had some sea salts to this.
Nice Pinch.

452
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.270
I'm going to add my chili flakes because I do kind of want to,

453
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.120
I want them to have a little intensive.

454
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.940
I'm going to add some pistachios to this mix.
Okay.

455
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.793
Now

456
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.490
<v 4>I hope this works.</v>

457
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.180
We'll you guys share a little bit about the inspiration for the restaurant and

458
00:31:05.181 --> 00:31:09.620
the first place.
It's the so unique.
It's a long story.

459
00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:14.630
It's a beautiful story.
It's a book,
but short,
Short version.
Sure.

460
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.690
Yeah.
We never intended to open state bird.
So we had written a business plan.

461
00:31:20.691 --> 00:31:25.691
We had raised money for what is now the progress and had found a space we're

462
00:31:25.821 --> 00:31:30.200
ready to go and the space fell through.
So we were like,
well shit.

463
00:31:30.201 --> 00:31:33.020
Now we really,
and we found out also we were having a baby,

464
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:37.380
so like we needed to get a job quickly.
Um,

465
00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.660
so we had been focusing on one neighborhood in San Francisco and we told our

466
00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:43.400
broker like,
just look everywhere.

467
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:46.220
Look in all the places we never wanted to look before.

468
00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:48.890
And a week after our son was born,
she was like,
well,

469
00:31:48.891 --> 00:31:53.120
I have this place on Fillmore,
which I know you don't like,
but thank you.

470
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:53.931
Should go look at it.

471
00:31:53.931 --> 00:31:57.280
So Stewart across from the panda express that's right across from the panic

472
00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.670
express in the Safeway parking lot.
Um,
in addition

473
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:08.250
a sewer rode his bike down there and walked in to this dark purple grease traps,

474
00:32:11.571 --> 00:32:16.100
smelly,
not very beautiful tiny space.

475
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:18.560
The whole building was vacant 10,000 square feet.

476
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.530
And then the landlord took him into this space that's now the progress with the

477
00:32:21.531 --> 00:32:26.531
huge arching ceilings from the old movie theater that was built in 1911 and we

478
00:32:26.601 --> 00:32:29.750
were like,
this is where we want to be.
You can be anywhere in the city.

479
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.970
You don't see anything outside those windows,
but you have skylights and just,

480
00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.650
it was the restaurant.
We want it,
but it would cost a lot and a lot of time.

481
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:41.240
And because it had never been a restaurant,
so,

482
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:45.150
<v 0>and we needed to make money as we needed.
We needed,</v>

483
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.960
we had a kid now and we were running out of,
out of time.

484
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:55.210
<v 4>So we went back that night and said to each other,
what if we take both spaces?</v>

485
00:32:55.211 --> 00:32:58.480
And the landlord was thinking the same thing at that same time.

486
00:32:58.481 --> 00:32:59.890
So we signed two leases at once,

487
00:32:59.891 --> 00:33:02.620
but then had to come up with a new business plan and in a whole new concept.

488
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:07.950
So in a few weeks we sort of visualize state bird thinking that it would be just

489
00:33:08.531 --> 00:33:12.040
a really fast thing to open and then we can move on to the dream restaurant and

490
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:15.340
then things unraveled differently.
Funny how that works

491
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.040
<v 0>in cs.
So state bird and we literally winged it.</v>

492
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:27.080
<v 4>That's my kind of chip.
Yeah.
Why American Zen?</v>

493
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.340
Which ps is the best idea ever.

494
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.740
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
In the early days we used to get that,
like people would say,
God,</v>

495
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:34.820
why did I think of this?

496
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:39.340
<v 4>Nobody has really ripped it off,
which is the trade.
It's,</v>

497
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.260
<v 0>it's,
there's been a little bit of,
you know,
some people who've adapted certain,</v>

498
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.200
um,
certain ways.
Right.

499
00:33:47.201 --> 00:33:50.960
And I think that that's kind of more the interesting idea.
Um,

500
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.250
rather than ripping it off,
it's actually a lot harder than people think.

501
00:33:54.251 --> 00:33:58.510
And those who have tried to rip it off,
like have had a very tough go of it.

502
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.490
And that's okay.
I mean,
I think that,
you know,
it's,

503
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:06.320
it's okay to have multiple of restaurants,
but,
um,

504
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:11.370
it's also really nice and reassuring what we do works because we've really made

505
00:34:11.651 --> 00:34:12.670
it work.
Um,

506
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:18.490
and that the idea of it came about is during the time that we were looking to

507
00:34:18.491 --> 00:34:23.140
open a restaurant,
we did a lot of private kind of catering gigs,
right.

508
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:26.980
And,
um,
they were really by word of mouth.

509
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.510
We were caterers out of our little 900 square foot apartment in San Francisco.

510
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.860
And um,

511
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.900
it w w we started to get a lot of requests for people who wanted to have an

512
00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:39.250
informal dinner party,

513
00:34:39.251 --> 00:34:43.300
but still like really creative food and lots of fun and nobody wants to sit
down.

514
00:34:43.301 --> 00:34:46.870
So just like a cocktail party,
right.
And Kitchens,
you know,

515
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.920
nice home kitchens that had a,
a nice little island.
Um,

516
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.070
and it would be kind of a walk around event.
Right?

517
00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:56.050
And so rather than just doing an order of party,

518
00:34:56.051 --> 00:35:01.051
these became like 1112 to 15 item hors d'oeuvre parties.

519
00:35:02.381 --> 00:35:05.620
Right.
So almost like a core stout dinner.
And one of the events,

520
00:35:05.621 --> 00:35:10.621
we even hired a friend who was a Somali a at Gary Danko and he went around and

521
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.740
he just speaks to splashing people with wine all night and talking about the

522
00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:17.710
wine and the food.
And it was super cool and we just,

523
00:35:17.711 --> 00:35:22.660
we had a great time doing this and we were able to take a little more risks

524
00:35:22.661 --> 00:35:26.680
cause you know,
12,
you know when you're serving three or four dishes,

525
00:35:26.681 --> 00:35:30.310
everybody wants kind of like the safe items,
right?

526
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.630
The things that are going to be popular,

527
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.710
like garlic bread with burrata or crab cakes or you know,

528
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:40.740
but I this particular that really we sort of took it to the next level was we

529
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:45.330
were serving lamb Tang on toast and doing things that were like,
well,

530
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.780
we built that relationship through the other safer items and people would come

531
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.780
back and it's,
I'd say,
well,
it's,
it's pickled lab.
And you know,

532
00:35:54.781 --> 00:35:57.630
some people I would tell them it was tongue and others I would say it was just

533
00:35:57.631 --> 00:36:00.540
land.
And um,
but it looked good.

534
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:04.380
It looked beautiful on the plate and we eat first with our eyes.

535
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:09.570
And I was able to talk people into eating food and the buy in was small,

536
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:14.230
right?
One bite.
So,
you know,
you've got to think about real estate.
And um,

537
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.960
so we applied that same idea and it really matched the idea is chefs at the time

538
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:23.190
that we wanted to kind of create a restaurant where we could cook what we want

539
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.940
and have lots of freedom and flexibility and not necessarily have a specific

540
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:34.770
regional calling,
right?
We're not a northern Italian restaurant.

541
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.580
We're not a Chinese restaurant,
we're not a,
we're,
we,
we've never,

542
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:39.740
we've always been challenged.

543
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.160
I think a lot of American chefs are challenged thoroughly by how to define

544
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:46.410
themselves as chefs.
Right?
Like,
well,

545
00:36:46.411 --> 00:36:49.590
what is it when people ask me like what is it,
the food you,
you cook,

546
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.720
it's really tough,
you know?
Well I do as this American dim sum.

547
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:57.660
It's like California cuisine and you don't really,

548
00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.280
you look at our menu and you look at the demographics of the bay area and it's,

549
00:37:01.281 --> 00:37:04.220
you know,
a lot of Asian influence and a lot of,
you know,

550
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:09.350
Mexican influence and kind of like some thorough like American ingenuity it with

551
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:12.780
some European.
So it's a little bit of everything.

552
00:37:12.781 --> 00:37:17.220
And what I like to actually call that cuisine is this evolved California
cuisine,

553
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:17.970
right?

554
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:22.890
Where we're in a state of evolution and evolving what California cuisine really

555
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:26.850
is to the people who live here and of course were born and raised in this area.

556
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.910
So we,
we have a pretty good understanding of it.

557
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.460
But to answer your question,

558
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.790
we were doing this kind of thing and it just sort of,

559
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.110
we looked at the kitchen that was in the front of the restaurant and I kind of

560
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:44.460
thought about like ducks hanging in the window and I was like,
wow,
you got cooks,

561
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:47.430
right.
They're like preparing the food and you enter in,

562
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:51.310
the first thing you're doing is you're entering through the kitchen.
Um,
it,

563
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.720
it feels that way because the kitchen's right there and the dining rooms in the

564
00:37:54.721 --> 00:37:57.420
back and um,
it all kind of just,

565
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.250
it just made sense and we just put the pieces together and that's it.
Yeah.

566
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:06.720
Yeah.
It's uh,
and,
and,
and it,
uh,
you know,
it's,

567
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.440
it's really turned out to be not just like people would say,
oh,
great concept.

568
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:12.960
And I was like,
what are you talking about man?
This is my restaurant.

569
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:15.300
This is not a concept,
you know,
this is our,

570
00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:20.301
like our heart and soul and our passion and our love for cooking and teaching

571
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.190
and interacting with people.

572
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:28.220
The people who are coming in to have an experience that was different than other

573
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:35.830
restaurants.
We looked at it,
that we're,
we're all one world in the right.

574
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.530
We get to talk to the guests and the guests get to talk.

575
00:38:39.531 --> 00:38:42.130
And when you know that feeling you get when you're sitting at a counter and

576
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:46.670
you're watching the Sushi chefs preparing and you're talking and you know,
you,

577
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.010
you create this rapport.

578
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.940
And so it was really imperative to have that for us.

579
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.280
We wanted to know the people we were cooking for two,

580
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.080
we want to have that relationship.
We want to not have it be like dining room,

581
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:01.540
kitchen separation.
Right?

582
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:04.840
And we talk about that all the time in front of the house,
back of house.
Well,

583
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:09.350
it applies to diners as well.
So anyway,
that's kind of,

584
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:14.640
and it really gave us the ability to do whatever we wanted in the kitchen.

585
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:20.320
Um,
as long as it tastes good,
looks good.
It works.

586
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.850
So that's it.
All right.
I say,
let's put this dish together.

587
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.230
So our carrots are nice and soft and you can see that just in their shape.

588
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:34.180
And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to throw some butter into the pan and at the

589
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:35.510
same time let's drop.

590
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.210
Do you want to drop about 10 of those into the simmering water that's been

591
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.830
salted?
You guys saw me do that.

592
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.800
<v 1>Cool.</v>

593
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.690
<v 0>I'm going to take a couple of these carrots.</v>

594
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.930
We can leave them whole but I'm going to cut them up just a little bit.

595
00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:01.230
<v 1>Oh yeah,
these are perfect.</v>

596
00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.450
<v 0>And then I'm going to take some pickled carrots and the pickled carrots are just</v>

597
00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:16.110
a baby carrot when we pick all the recipes included,

598
00:40:16.111 --> 00:40:17.580
but it's a vinegar pickle.

599
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:19.850
<v 1>Okay,</v>

600
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:23.360
<v 0>so this is not a fermented pickle.
And what we'd like to do is shave.</v>

601
00:40:23.361 --> 00:40:25.970
I'm really thin you can use a knife for that

602
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.520
or a mandolin,
but if you've got the knife skills,

603
00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:34.940
apply it in a sharp knife.
And that's what I say.

604
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.840
And so the idea of having a pickle in addition like this really makes a lot of

605
00:40:38.841 --> 00:40:42.500
sense.
It adds a nice texture contrast.

606
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:47.501
It also adds a nice refreshing as civic balance to it for a couple of different

607
00:40:48.861 --> 00:40:49.700
colors.
Here

608
00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.830
we do sweeten the vinegar.

609
00:40:54.831 --> 00:40:59.831
So we use for this one is rice vinegar and we salt and a little sugar and some

610
00:41:00.681 --> 00:41:02.360
spices as well into it.

611
00:41:02.361 --> 00:41:06.230
And we pick them whole and then every day we'll cut them,
you know,

612
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.360
we'll take them out of a big pickle croc and um,

613
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:13.330
we'll cut them just as I'm doing it right now.
So you get this other,
yeah.

614
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:17.840
I think part of it is,
is showcasing carrots in different forms,
right?
Whole form,

615
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.850
juiced form,
you know,

616
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:24.290
prepared form and then kind of rounds pickled where we cut in round.

617
00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:26.270
So you get a real good environment,

618
00:41:26.271 --> 00:41:30.560
kind of an environmental scape of the carrots.
Right.
If that makes sense.

619
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:31.723
Um,

620
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.460
because we didn't want that lacto fermented flavor to it.

621
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.480
So we do a ton of lacto fermenting at the restaurant,

622
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:45.320
whether it's sauerkrauts or Kim cheese or,
um,
you know,
we'll,

623
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:49.640
we'll do a deal carrot,
right.
Um,
dill pickles and we do that,

624
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:53.330
but it does this one,
we wanted it to be sweeter and we want to just,

625
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:57.510
we wanted the vinegar flavor,
which of course is its own scent of,

626
00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.640
of taking it.
Yeah.
Um,
we wanted a brightness to it,
um,

627
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:06.440
without quite the salt.
Does that make sense?
Cool.

628
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:12.200
So these guys are done when they float and if you can see what you can,

629
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:19.040
can we get one of those moving orbs?
Cause they're not floating.
Yeah.
Yeah.

630
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.940
Um,

631
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.940
so just like a Naoki or any kind of dumpling is this that we would take it and

632
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.103
um,

633
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.473
<v 3>okay.</v>

634
00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.970
<v 0>Boy,
boy,
boy,
girl.
Um,</v>

635
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.750
and what I've done here is I'm browning my butter this time.

636
00:42:37.751 --> 00:42:40.630
I want my butter Brown when I add my dumplings to it.

637
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:43.970
So the idea of browning butter is,

638
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:48.460
is that he pulls out a nuttiness how do the butter,
right.

639
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.770
Um,
how,

640
00:42:50.771 --> 00:42:55.030
you know it's brown is when it stops crackling,
right?

641
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.440
So all the milk solids of cooked and tightened up and cooked out,

642
00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.290
and then you'll start to see like little particles,

643
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:06.220
which is those browning and that's how you get the brown butter.
Um,

644
00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.330
and I have a done a nice low temp so I can hold this for a minute here.

645
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.250
Other questions while I wait for the Nokia Flute Mochi to flow.

646
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.303
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

647
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.140
<v 0>Why did you keep the PR?
That's a good question.</v>

648
00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:27.460
He know it acts as like a little shield in the garlic.
Doesn't Brown too fast,

649
00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:30.760
right?
It's Brown.
It's Brown in a nice way.

650
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.710
But way that I actually love eating garlic right there.
Um,
but it,
it,
it,

651
00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.380
it acts as like a little shield,
a barrier.

652
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.360
So if you had the raw garlic into the pan,

653
00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.520
you're still getting the same qualities of it.

654
00:43:42.521 --> 00:43:45.940
But when I'm slow cooking or long cooking,
um,
I want,

655
00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:50.230
I want that garlic to not get bitter and,
and I want it to caramelize slowly.

656
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:54.700
So that little barrier is really important.
Cool.

657
00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:00.040
Anyone else?
Nope.
You can do this step and then show them.

658
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.840
Oh yes.
Later.
Right.
So great,
great,
great.

659
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.840
This is another part of that great margin for,

660
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.030
for um,

661
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:15.570
error and also from an entertaining perspective and something that the team here

662
00:44:15.641 --> 00:44:17.630
at Google has done is,

663
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:21.880
is that you take them to this and you can actually cook them,
boil them,

664
00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.460
and then refresh them under cold water,

665
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.880
rub them in a little oil and put them in the fridge for later.

666
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.060
And then when you're ready to go,
you can take them right out of the fridge,

667
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:36.230
put them into your pen with brown butter and just kind of slowly Cookham and

668
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.570
reheat.
Um,
so that's another great thing is,

669
00:44:38.571 --> 00:44:43.080
is that you can do a lot of this ahead.
And so now that these guys are floating,

670
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.890
you can see they just kind of come up like any jump playing.

671
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.590
I like to think these are like our carrot and Matsu balls,
right?

672
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:55.770
Um,
I'll just take a slotted spoon and I'm just going to place him right in.

673
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.603
And like

674
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.460
the carrots,
I love all that brown butter.

675
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.330
<v 1>Okay.
So when I add a little salt,</v>

676
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:14.620
good crack of pepper to it.

677
00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.550
<v 0>And what I'm trying to do is,
is I want a brown these off of it</v>

678
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.393
<v 1>a little bit.</v>

679
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:31.920
They look so good.
We'll go on high.
Yeah.

680
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:38.220
<v 0>You serving for Superbowl Sunday?
That's a good question.
You know,</v>

681
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.020
every year is like the kitchens they team up and they should,

682
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.120
they should go opposites I guess.

683
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.380
But they do team Alpha and we got to between state bird and the progress and

684
00:45:49.381 --> 00:45:52.920
they do a huge Superbowl Sunday spread.
It's kind of insane.

685
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:56.730
But for family meal but for family meal,
yeah we do like we don't,
you know,
yeah.

686
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.380
Our menu's won't change.

687
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.780
They have fun make like chicken wings and yeah,

688
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.390
we'll start seeing like Thursday and Friday I'll start seeing the wings come in,

689
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.230
you know,
and um,
we're pretty pretty lean,
you know,

690
00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.890
like really want them to cook well and do fun things too.

691
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:16.980
And so they do have kind of an an an insane spread,

692
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.850
like all the holidays and all the special specialty cooking days,

693
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.710
like the kitchens go insane and um,

694
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.520
they're kind of the best days to be working.

695
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:31.470
I think people come in on their days off actually just to come in and eat.
Yeah.

696
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.520
So we do like,
we do the classics,
wings,
Blue Cheese,
um,

697
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.520
lots of chip and dip.
Um,
okay.

698
00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:42.810
So I'm reintroducing the carrots back into this and I've really brown that.
Yeah.

699
00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.280
Nicely.
And then,
let's see here.

700
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.790
Can you use an unslotted spoon?
And it really,

701
00:46:49.791 --> 00:46:51.740
I'm just looking for like a little color.

702
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.560
The more color you get on these and you can see like look at their,

703
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.640
their buoyancy there.
You know,
they really hold up nicely.

704
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.720
Can you see that okay.
Back to the camera.
Okay.

705
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.850
So you can see this like buoyancy.
Really bouncy.
Yeah,
they're there.
Yeah,

706
00:47:07.851 --> 00:47:11.900
we got a good bounciness to him.
Okay.
And right about this point,

707
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.680
I'm going to spoon a few of these right into it.
Yeah.

708
00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.573
<v 1>Cool.</v>

709
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.780
Some of my carrots.

710
00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:31.750
<v 0>What kind of butter do you use?
Just a very plain unsalted butter,
you know?
Um,</v>

711
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.170
and that's,
that's it.
We work with a local dairy,

712
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:40.570
so Petaluma out of Petaluma.
And um,

713
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.650
but that's our,
that's our goal with butter.
It's just,
just plain unsalted butter.

714
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.290
You can always add salt.
Um,
it's just kind of the cleanest version.

715
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:54.960
Right.
And then I'm going to put a little bit of this butter right over the top.

716
00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.580
Don't be afraid of butter.
We talked about that already.

717
00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.380
<v 2>Air is thick with butter.
Scent in the room,
right smell.
Yeah.
It smells real.
Yes.</v>

718
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.920
Okay.
So I'm gonna

719
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.870
<v 0>take some gorgeous herbs.
Um,</v>

720
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:15.130
so things that are very complimentary to character is mint.
Dill.

721
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.600
Um,
we have a little bit of wood soil.
You may see this around.

722
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.880
Um,
uh,
it's in season and it's wild.
Um,

723
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.320
let's see here.
First,
I'm going to take a little bit of this [inaudible].

724
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.250
I'm going to give a nice dusting it.

725
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.480
Then I'm going to add some of my pickled carrots all over.

726
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.890
Of course we want to show off the colors,
so there is kind of a a better,

727
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.473
<v 1>yeah.</v>

728
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.970
<v 0>So I sorta smother it and pickled carrots.</v>

729
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:49.010
And then I'm going to add some of my herbs switches.
That meant a little,

730
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.240
uh,
there's red veined sorrel deal as I said.

731
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.600
And then I'm going to finish the dish up.

732
00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.970
Can I'm going to spoon over

733
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:05.560
the carrot juice vinegarette

734
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:10.610
and I kind of want enough with the vinegarette that it's like a sauce in the

735
00:49:10.611 --> 00:49:13.100
bottom,
so where I can see it

736
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:20.570
and that's about it.
It's gorgeous.
There you go.

737
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.033
<v 1>Cool.</v>

738
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.760
<v 2>Yeah,
it looks good,
right?
Yeah.
At some guys in the frame to hold back,</v>

739
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.550
it looks and smells amazing.

740
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:39.510
I know that our team is working on some delicious tastes for you all.

741
00:49:39.511 --> 00:49:41.040
Are there more questions while we wait?

742
00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.373
<v 0>Yeah.
Wow.</v>

743
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.850
<v 2>Ooh.
What's coming in?
What's future projects do you have inside scoop,</v>

744
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.990
inside scoop.
We were actually talking about that on the drive here.
Yeah.

745
00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.420
It's a good time to meet in the car.
Yeah.
There's no distraction.

746
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:56.670
<v 0>We,
we,
um,</v>

747
00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.710
it's an interesting question and it's not easy to answer because I don't totally

748
00:50:01.711 --> 00:50:04.710
have the answer and my mind doesn't really,

749
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:09.120
it's relentless and sort of the ideas that I want to do,

750
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.590
but I'm also like really about trying to build the most solid company that we

751
00:50:13.591 --> 00:50:14.370
can,

752
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:19.320
that's got incredible culture and state bird started as 14 employees,

753
00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:23.280
including Nicole and I.
And um,
you know,

754
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:27.120
we now with the progress,
uh,
with,
uh,

755
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.950
we're up to about just under a hundred employees.
Um,

756
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:35.800
both restaurants have about 50 employees each.
And,
um,
you know,
that's,

757
00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.560
that's,
that's,
uh,
in a restaurant world it's a lot of,
a lot of,
um,

758
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.530
a lot to see and oversee.

759
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.640
And state bird is now six years old and progress is three.

760
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:51.110
And we're about ready for,
just start thinking about that next project.

761
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:55.580
I've been pushing back and we've had lots of really wonderful offers.
Things,

762
00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.800
you know,
take state bird to New York,
take it to Vegas,
La,
Tokyo.

763
00:51:00.801 --> 00:51:03.290
And I'm like,
it sounds awesome.

764
00:51:03.291 --> 00:51:07.070
And it's kind of like the dream when people start coming to you with real ideas

765
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:08.750
and real dreams,
you're like,
yeah,

766
00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:13.430
I've been dreaming of this moment my entire career.
And then you're like,
whoa,

767
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:18.140
back up.
You know,
that's,
it's actually like,
it's not as easy as that.

768
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.450
Um,
so,

769
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.960
and we have a lot of complexity built into our restaurants.
You know,

770
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.090
we have a farm that is biodynamic.
Um,

771
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.330
we grow all these little greens and a lot of the carrots and things that you see

772
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:35.690
in this dish.
Um,
and that's been an amazing project.

773
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:38.090
So we've been able to kind of,
rather than grow up,

774
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.360
we've been able to kind of add and kind of grow wide and create a lot of really

775
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:49.061
interesting pieces that add value to what we do every day.

776
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:55.690
And that has been probably the biggest source of inspiration to continue to add.

777
00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.790
And create this kind of mega ship of this culinary building.

778
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:05.000
Um,
cause we're all under one roof.
Um,

779
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.260
within that project we do a lot of,
we have a whole fermentation,

780
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.940
um,
program.
I suppose.
We do a lot of Charcuterie,

781
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.990
we do whole animal butchery.
Um,

782
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.600
these things get done in our commissary kitchen,

783
00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:24.290
which is just above state bird and the progress.

784
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:29.650
And we can take a whole pig and certain pieces go to state bird certain go to

785
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:34.580
the progress.
So we've got this really amazing kind of cat's cradle.
Yeah.

786
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:35.650
You know,
have a,

787
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:39.680
a matrix inside our own building where things are used.

788
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.500
This is one that we just launched with the cookbook is state bird seed and it's

789
00:52:44.501 --> 00:52:46.760
a partnership with some very,
uh,

790
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:51.440
intelligent food scientists and restaurant,
uh,
people,

791
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:56.330
food people who all were all born out of a really high quality restaurants.

792
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.760
Places like the lawn tree,
the French laundry,

793
00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:03.500
Momofuku a single thread up in Yawn Healdsburg.

794
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:04.723
Um,

795
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.900
so this is their first project under the render brand where it's a chef to shelf

796
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:15.380
kind of thing.
And so we're really focused on,
on this.

797
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:18.200
We're actually hoping that to see it here at [inaudible].

798
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:23.170
<v 2>Yes,
exactly.
Get it into the mks putting a lot of pressure.</v>

799
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.160
It's,
it's,
uh,
press.

800
00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:30.450
<v 4>It's really delicious and it's something we make and there's recipes for it in</v>

801
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.710
the,
and the cook by now online,
a good eggs you can order through good eggs,

802
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:37.800
Molly stone's rainbow and by right,
both in the city you have it.

803
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:42.160
So there's three flavors.
We only have two up here,
but yeah,
it's really,

804
00:53:42.161 --> 00:53:45.050
I'm going to start working on it as soon as I get back.
So that's,
that's,

805
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.740
I guess that's it right now.
The other idea is there,
I got to keep them,

806
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.730
you know,
people start talking and,
you know,
it's really,

807
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:57.420
I got to keep it under wraps until I,
you know,
Kinda,
you know,

808
00:53:57.421 --> 00:54:01.690
until a press fail.
Yeah.
You know,
um,

809
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:02.820
yes.

810
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.870
Have you received blowback about like the not authentic desmosome some cultural

811
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:08.340
appropriation perspective?

812
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.060
I think like any restaurant in any sort of public entity,
you know,

813
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:15.270
you're gonna get,
you're gonna get believers and nonbelievers.

814
00:54:15.271 --> 00:54:19.920
And I think we've had a good,
a good mix of that for sure.
Um,

815
00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:20.600
you know,

816
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.560
me and the probably the first 18 months there was a lot more skepticism and

817
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.830
people didn't quite understand why we were doing it and what we were doing.

818
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:33.831
But once the ball was rolling and we were more publicly in the press and kind of

819
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:38.460
people understood what the goal and the intention was,

820
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.320
we haven't really had anything.
Yeah.
I

821
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:45.220
<v 0>any issues.
And I ironically,
you know,</v>

822
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:48.760
we never actually called ourselves a dim sum restaurant.
Um,

823
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:53.720
in the early days we've,
we,
we more kind of akin to top us and,
you know,

824
00:54:53.721 --> 00:54:57.170
small plates and the idea of,
of kind of doing

825
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:03.440
like,
realizing that we're not dim sum.
I mean,
first we're serving dinner,

826
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:08.060
right?
I mean that completely,
you know,
challenges.
The whole notion of Jim's son,

827
00:55:08.061 --> 00:55:12.350
which is a daytime activity and it's food that's prepared for,
you know,

828
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:17.180
tea service and whatnot.
Um,
but we actually have never called ourselves.

829
00:55:17.181 --> 00:55:17.690
It's,
it's,

830
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:21.150
it's gotten to that point where other people have and we just go with it now

831
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:25.850
cause it's like why fight it?
Right.
That was about a year into it.
Um,

832
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.680
uh,
you know,
I think that,
um,
you know,

833
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:33.890
when we looked at the idea of dim sum,

834
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.240
dim sum was one function of small plates.

835
00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.220
And if you look at Japanese Izakaya,
right?
Spanish top US,

836
00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:48.230
right?
Um,
Korean like Bond Sean,
all the Bond Sean that's on plates.

837
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.510
Um,
you look at,
um,
Mez,
you look at,
uh,
uh,

838
00:55:53.511 --> 00:55:58.511
in Italy there's kind of this afternoon wine and snack kind of a,

839
00:55:58.791 --> 00:56:03.170
I can't remember the name right now.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank,
that's it.

840
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:07.040
And um,
thank you.
Schaub you know,
we looked at that and we're like,

841
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.580
we're kind of a culmination of all these,
the French hors d'oeuvres party,
right?

842
00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.230
Just passing hors d'oeuvres,
canopies.
We're,

843
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:15.560
we're a little bit of all of those things.

844
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:20.770
And we looked at kind of the Chinese dim sum model is just purely an efficiency

845
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:26.770
model of being able deliver food quickly on carts and trays.

846
00:56:27.341 --> 00:56:30.340
We use a lot of trays,
actually more trays and carts,

847
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.810
but we've over the overtime have incorporated more of our carts.
And we've read,

848
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:39.130
redone our carts now and uh,
we do smaller carts that can do,

849
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:41.680
I can have oysters out and I can have,
you know,

850
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:45.010
a big clay pot at pork ribs or,
or chip and dip.

851
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:48.730
So there's a little bit of tableside activity as well.
But we,

852
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:53.350
we really look at it,
you know,
I mean the French have the same type of cart,

853
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:57.310
right?
It's called the gueridon and that's where your cheeses,
you know,

854
00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:02.530
rolled up to your table cheese or bananas foster,
right?
Like some of the,

855
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:07.540
the table side preparations or Caesar Salad done.
Tableside so you know,

856
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:12.700
we looked at all of these ideas and kind of took what we thought were the best

857
00:57:12.701 --> 00:57:17.620
parts and turned it to the dining room and said how can we serve as the people

858
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:18.880
best,
right?

859
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:23.230
We know that top us don't work in this country.

860
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.800
It takes an entire country and a culture of people that are raised from the we

861
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:32.140
age,
right?

862
00:57:32.141 --> 00:57:37.141
Three to five years old going and having a little glass of wine and moving from

863
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:42.550
topless place to topless place.
Cause they all have their little specialties.

864
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:46.660
And the foods in the window there and you just kind of grab and eat right.

865
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:52.060
But when top us was kind of brought to the u s it was like the coolest thing

866
00:57:52.061 --> 00:57:56.860
ever until nobody realized that there was a what,
what's the,

867
00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.500
what's the,
how do you deliver food?

868
00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:03.430
How do you know it's enough food for the table?
How do you know?
Um,

869
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:04.751
you know,

870
00:58:04.751 --> 00:58:08.050
a lot of chefs are taking an entree and basically putting it through like the

871
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:13.051
shrinker machine and charging two thirds of what the entree costs with giving

872
00:58:13.211 --> 00:58:16.930
you half as much.
Right.
There was a lot of problems with it and there was no,

873
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:19.420
there was no way of uh,

874
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.130
I guess how do you break it down to the lowest common denominator so that

875
00:58:24.131 --> 00:58:26.980
everybody can understand what they're doing.

876
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:32.280
And so we took that top us and put it on wheels and basically here are,

877
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.610
you're interested,
cool.
Six Bucks,
done,
move on to the next,

878
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.210
you're seeing,
you can see the portion size you can,

879
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.790
I can sell a lot of weird food if I want to write.

880
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.880
I can sell things that are like,
people are like,
I've never even,

881
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:47.320
I don't even know what you're talking about.

882
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.670
Like you're speaking a different language but they see it and it's beautiful.

883
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:56.950
Right.
And like they can vision,
they'll take it.

884
00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.390
We eat first with our eyes.

885
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:03.310
So we basically took the functionality of all of that and took a type of cuisine

886
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:06.430
that everybody loves to eat.
Small plates.
Right.

887
00:59:06.431 --> 00:59:08.650
I mean I hear it all the time.

888
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:13.651
Like I prefer to eat lots of little dishes versus like an entree.

889
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:16.570
I mean that is like you're all shaking your head,

890
00:59:16.571 --> 00:59:18.850
you're all agreeing with me shaking in,

891
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.570
in agree I'll here cause you like to that,
right?
Yeah.

892
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:27.010
Bob Korean food is amazing because they bring out and kind of slaughter you with

893
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.301
Kim.

894
00:59:27.301 --> 00:59:32.110
She's and tow Foos and cucumbers and sesame oil and Mung Bean sprouts and you're

895
00:59:32.111 --> 00:59:34.870
getting all your little things and you're tasting and you know,

896
00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.520
it's like you like all the diversity of flavors.
Well,

897
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:39.970
we just took that same idea and apply it a little,

898
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.540
you know what I'd like to call it little American ingenuity to it to make it

899
00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:45.880
work for the American diner.
Right.

900
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.780
Because toppest doesn't work and it doesn't make sense.
I,

901
00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.780
I'm confused too.
I ended up,
is that enough food?

902
00:59:52.781 --> 00:59:55.600
And you got to ask your waiter and you know,
you've got to have this dialogue.

903
00:59:55.601 --> 00:59:55.991
We're kind of,

904
00:59:55.991 --> 00:59:59.740
you just want to do it yourself and figure it out right where you're in control.

905
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:01.010
<v 2>So fantastic.</v>

906
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.030
We are about to run out of time for our amazing live stream audience.

907
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:06.900
I know we have one more question here in the audience,

908
01:00:06.901 --> 01:00:09.290
which we can take as soon as the camera's wrapped,

909
01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:13.730
but I want to thank you officially for our full audience online and here.

910
01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:17.900
Thank you so much for joining us today.
I hope you'll come back and see us again.

911
01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.120
Yeah.
