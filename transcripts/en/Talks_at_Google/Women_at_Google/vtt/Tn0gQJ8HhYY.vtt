1
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.770
Thank you for taking up your lunch hour.
Death.
So I wanted to start with,
um,

2
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.610
how many people in the audience,
a vegetarian?
A couple,

3
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.240
if anyone in the audience,
he's a Vegan.
Oh yeah,

4
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.210
yeah,
I did that as well.
I found it really tough anyway.
Um,
okay,
great.

5
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.730
And who if,
um,

6
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.700
thinks they ought to be Vegan or vegetarian,

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.730
but you can't resist when they have something nice on in the restaurant or you

8
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:42.710
know,
you know,
a keys if you go to your granny to Sunday roast.
Um,

9
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.920
so you sort of slightly British about it and they want,
yeah.

10
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.580
So that was me.
I,
um,
I was working as,
um,

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.270
an environment correspondent on the Daily Telegraph newspaper.

12
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:58.890
So as interviewing climate change scientists all the time and writing about

13
00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.491
climate change.

14
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:04.491
And I knew that emissions from livestock makeup more than all the transport and

15
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.450
the world put together.

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.850
And I knew that one of the easiest things I could do with to give up eating

17
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.180
meat.
Um,
I also knew all the other threats.

18
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:19.980
I didn't have any of you have seen Cowspiracy but you know,
um,
obviously,
uh,

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.870
growing and animal takes more water.
Uh,
you might clear forests,

20
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.120
there's all the fossil fuels in growing the feed for the animal.
Um,
and you know,

21
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:34.260
at the far end of the scale,
you can talk about it driving species extinctions,

22
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.140
ocean dead zones.
And again,
I thought,
well,
you know,

23
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:40.830
either think I could do with a go vegetarian,

24
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.950
but I'm a farmer's daughter and I'd go home and I try and be vegetarian and my

25
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:52.290
granny or my dad would say,
well,
this is Bennison from the hill.
You know,

26
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.820
these animals are cute eating all the trees.
What's wrong with eating this?
Or,

27
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:00.970
you know,
it's 40 range,
um,
capital.
You can see them out in the field bad.

28
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:04.860
They don't look miserable to me.
So I thought,
okay,
um,

29
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.490
I'm going to do something quite extreme.
I'm going to only eat animals.
Um,

30
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.960
I kill myself.
So these are the,
um,
are getting a little ahead of myself here,

31
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.790
but all the other benefits of agriculture,
I thought to my,
um,

32
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.750
obviously I could see from my own family,
uh,
farming families who've,

33
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.100
um,
make their money out of raising meat,
but they also sustain the countryside.

34
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:29.810
When you think about dry stone walls and what you see when you go on holidays to

35
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.400
the countryside,
carbon storage,
you know,

36
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:37.330
past delays are actually just as good at throwing carbon as rain forests,
um,

37
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.270
waste.
Um,
if animals are being killed,
why not eat them?

38
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.590
So I decided to be an ethical carnival,

39
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.840
which is to me,
to only animals.

40
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.980
I killed myself because then I thought I can truly justify it.

41
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.460
So I started quite slowly because honestly it was a bit of a scary idea and I

42
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:03.790
went oyster shucking.
Um,
and I knew that how many of you eat oysters?

43
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.160
Um,
but,
uh,

44
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.200
they grow all around the British coast and they're actually quite a sustainable

45
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.070
meat to eat because when oysters feed,

46
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.120
they're filtering the water and a lot of the oysters around the British case or

47
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:22.210
an invasive species.
So we want to get rid of them anyway.

48
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.690
So that was quite an easy start.
In fact,

49
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.940
I guess quite a few of you been to California and,
uh,

50
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.720
there's people out who called themselves Austra vegans.

51
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.070
So they only eat mussels and oysters because they think that,

52
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.250
uh,
they don't feel pain because,
you know,

53
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.690
they don't have the nerve endings for it.
And,
uh,
by farming them,

54
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.310
you're actually improving the environment.

55
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.140
So it's the one meet the valley only in California.
Um,

56
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.880
and then there was fishing as well.

57
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.930
And fishing was where I really started to think about my connection to the

58
00:03:55.931 --> 00:04:00.480
environment because,
you know,
you have to stand on a riverbank or a guard,

59
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:04.840
see for a long time and it really forces you to think about what's happening in

60
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.660
the environment around you.
You know,
you have to choose a fly,

61
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:12.170
you have to be very quiet.
Uh,
you have to understand what the,

62
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.830
what the fish are feeding out on and that time of year.

63
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.720
So it's a w it started me thinking,
you know,
about my connection as a,

64
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.660
as a sort of hunter gatherer.
Um,

65
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.720
but of course I also had to be realistic because that's not how most of us get

66
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.530
our fish.
We get it from the seas.
And,
um,

67
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.750
there's a wonderful book called the end of the line,
which I read and um,

68
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.920
and I went out on a fishing boat and it's quite a brutal,
um,

69
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.700
industry fishing,
you know,
the animals usually die in the hold and,
um,

70
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.270
and it's also got to having a real impact on the environment.

71
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.480
I'm sure many of you know the statistics from drudging.
Um,

72
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.980
so I tried to think about is are they sustainable ways to eat fish.

73
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.890
And one of the biggest things I found having gone to fish markets as we only

74
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.290
five species,
which is ridiculous,

75
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.990
and lots of those species are actually under threat.
I wouldn't,

76
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.060
I mean card of our own coast,

77
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.860
I've still not a healthy population because we so overfish them.
So why not try,

78
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.480
um,
I'm sure Ben knows will be different species but curly and different species.

79
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:18.010
So that was an ethical way I felt around fishing.
Another,
um,

80
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.030
option if farmed fish,
which obviously takes the pressure off wild fish.

81
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:26.500
So I went to a salmon farm and salmon farming as cat.
A really,

82
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.260
um,
the caused a lot of damage in the past.
Um,

83
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.430
fee life live on the salmon and that passes to the wild population and their

84
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:40.000
said wild fish from,
um,
um,

85
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.180
other places around the world.
Mophie anchovies from places like Peru.

86
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.510
And that has an impact on ocean ecosystems that it is something I think is

87
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:53.200
improving.
And when I went to visit those places,
um,

88
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.040
I genuinely found people and the,

89
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.610
and the West highlands of Scotland who said that it was,
uh,

90
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.480
providing employment in really remote areas,

91
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.840
but they could do so much to improve how it's done and a close circulation.

92
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.650
So,
um,
the,
this,

93
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.300
the sewage from the fish isn't going into the oceans and I'd urge you to look up

94
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:16.710
front before the,
um,
um,
with,

95
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.550
with wild fish marine stewardship council.

96
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.780
But then now there's an aquaculture stewardship council.

97
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:27.380
So hopefully if we put pressure on the organizations,

98
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:30.920
we can get sustainable farm fish as well.
But it's not straightforward.

99
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.690
Nothing is.
So that was all quite easy,
but I had to move on to,

100
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.290
um,
uh,
other animals to eat.

101
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.920
And the first thing I shot with a rabbit,
and that was quite

102
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.950
upsetting because you have to take responsibility.
Um,
it,

103
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.080
but I never really got over that,

104
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:53.270
but that was a lot of the motivation in writing the book.

105
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:57.890
And then when you eat animals,
an animal dies.
And taking that on,

106
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.240
uh,
really upset me.

107
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:04.241
I cried the gamekeeper I was with cried and that's really where the book begins.

108
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.900
Um,
but in the Fed,
the big question is why did I carry on doing it?

109
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.640
But I looked at the people like the gamekeeper I was with who go out and she

110
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:18.420
animals to eat themselves and they had a much greater understanding of many,
uh,

111
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.950
of the countryside and many conservationists I knew and I wanted to learn from

112
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:23.630
them and I wanted to continue the journey.

113
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.840
So I did and I got a little bit better at it.
So I learned,
learnt,

114
00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:29.510
shoot with a rifle,
um,

115
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.160
and to do it as cleanly and quickly as I possibly could.
Um,

116
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.080
a squirrel,
which is a good example of where,
um,
they're,

117
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.440
they're being controlled anyway to help the red squirrel population comeback.

118
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.880
So I fed my girlfriend squirrel satay and they enjoyed it very much.

119
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.370
Um,
and shotguns shooting if the other,
um,
uh,
type of shooting.

120
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:56.960
It's different from using a rifle,
very challenging.
Um,
I did shoot a pheasant,

121
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.090
um,
obviously in Britain that has different implications because,
um,

122
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.330
it's very mixed up with land ownership and class people only traditionally do it

123
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:11.810
who,
um,
have the money and live in the countryside.
And um,

124
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.350
it kind of exposed me.
But I wanted to go into that cause I think it's,
um,

125
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.180
I think it's really interesting and two thirds of our farmland is managed for

126
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:24.230
game birds in this country.
So what effect is that having on the countryside?

127
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.790
And my argument is there a good and bad shoot?

128
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:31.560
So let's talk about it openly rather than saying they're all bad.
Um,

129
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.280
and I like to eat forever,
I'm afraid,
but the best way Tepe hasn't roadkill.

130
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.390
So,
um,
and there's lots of,

131
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.930
of them on the road at certain time of year.

132
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.960
So I also learn how identifier to identify roadkill safely,

133
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.870
which is,
people often ask me about the legal implications and you have to take

134
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:53.960
responsibility for yourselves people,
but you can do it.

135
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560
And the ultimate thing I killed with this stack with my father and that was

136
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.120
quite an emotional journey because my dad's hunted all his life and it's

137
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:10.710
something I'd,
my brother's done but I'd never done.
And um,

138
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.310
I had sort of come to a realization of why I was doing it because I had to

139
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:18.660
question was I doing this to impress my dad?
But by the time I got to that stage,

140
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.830
um,
I was doing it for myself because only you can take responsibility.

141
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:27.190
You have to be control of yourself and what you're doing.
And um,
and,

142
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.950
and that was an amazing experience.

143
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:33.951
It really taught me a lot and gave me great respect for the animal.

144
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.980
And it took me quite a long time to eat it with all my friends and family.

145
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:42.720
I tend to share all the meat I ate.
Um,
but all this is,

146
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:47.721
I'm very nice talking about going out and hunting and fishing and something

147
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:51.960
that,
uh,
requires a lot of time and energy.
Um,

148
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.870
you could argue it's something you need to be quite privileged,

149
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:55.740
but I mean you can do it.

150
00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:57.780
Anyone can do it if you put the time and energy into it.

151
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.120
But most of us are eating meat.
That's obviously farms.

152
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.270
And I wanted it to look at that as well cause that's where most of the

153
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:04.950
environmental impact is of course.

154
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.610
And in Britain reach 1 billion farm animals a year.

155
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.570
So I wanted to find out how they're raised chickens with a good start because in

156
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:17.440
this country,
that's what we're eating the most of,
uh,
competitive.
Uh,

157
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.290
the 50s where you might have it once a week.

158
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.370
When are eating chicken three times a week?
Um,

159
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.710
2.2 million chickens a day.
Um,

160
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.440
but have you ever seen any chickens in the countryside?

161
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.960
Where are these chicken's been raised?
So I went to a chicken farm and saw them,

162
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.570
uh,
indoors.
They usually raised,
uh,
uh,

163
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.030
tens of thousands in a barn and,
uh,

164
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.070
they are gassed when they're slaughtered.
And the Ma,

165
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.590
the big realization with chickens is,
you know,

166
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.570
they're being raised on such a scale.
Uh,
they,

167
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.970
it's too dense.
You know,
the animals,
the animals can't move around easily.

168
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.900
They've been so bred to have big breasts that they collapse on their legs.
Um,

169
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.550
but there were very small things you can do.

170
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:05.980
I looked at RSPC assured checkins and they're still indoors,

171
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.810
but at least they have daylight and readings roam around.
So,
um,

172
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.310
there are things that you can do quite easily.
That's me in a,
um,

173
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.350
in a chicken farm.
Um,
uh,
I also looked at pigs,
I went to Denmark,

174
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:22.620
which is where we get most of our port from in this country.
And again,

175
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:24.870
it was very intensive and I found pigs more difficult,

176
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:29.400
cause I would argue that chickens indoors can be quite happy.
But pigs,

177
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.400
when you see pigs out doors,
they just love to root in the ground.

178
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:34.500
And I like feel that,

179
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:38.520
and that's from my pork to come from that and it.
But in Denmark,

180
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:41.230
they do it on a massive scale and they have,
um,

181
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.630
a slaughterhouse with glass walls where you can see it happening.
Um,
which was,

182
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.070
uh,
quite interesting.
I wouldn't,

183
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.410
I would argue that it doesn't tell you the whole story,

184
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:53.590
but if I'm quite an interesting insight into how other cultures are more about

185
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:57.580
where their meat comes from.
Um,
and I went into avatars of course,

186
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:00.550
because that was a big question I was trying to ask,
you know,

187
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.670
like where does our meat come from?
And again,

188
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:05.920
I found it very upsetting initially,

189
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.160
but I wanted to continue to try and understand because the people who were doing

190
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.200
it,
I felt deserve my respect.
I think if you're going to eat meat,

191
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:17.980
you should respect that people will do it on your behalf or not meet,

192
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:19.650
need to tool.
Um,

193
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.230
and I also went and visited a lot of farmers and these people weren't earning a

194
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:30.160
lot of money and raising really good meat,
you know,
beautiful.

195
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.690
This is,
um,
a man called rarely puzey and he's,
he's,
um,

196
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.820
raising sheep on national trust land and it's on a Sussex.

197
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.380
It's Downlands.
Downlands.

198
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.650
And there are flowers and birds that survive in that farmland as it's managed.

199
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.050
And the consequence of that is the sheep.
So why not eat them and you know,

200
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.840
um,
uh,
keep that cycle going.
So,
I mean,

201
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.080
that was the other reason I continued to do it because I respected those farmers

202
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:02.470
and wanted to understand,
uh,
their business,
not dismiss them.

203
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.510
And I did some home slaughter as well,
which was pretty intense.

204
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.500
And I learned about butchery.
Um,
I was following everything all the way through.

205
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.210
Um,
so,
um,
again,
having,
having said all that,
you know,

206
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:18.190
people firth question as well,
that's all very well,

207
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:22.540
but how do I judge where my meat comes from and that our labels you can look out

208
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:23.350
for?

209
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:28.180
I always quite cautious because labels can change and I think you can't rely on,

210
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:31.630
there's probably something that Google talk about a lot is you can't rely on a

211
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:34.750
corporation to make your decisions for you.
It's about your education,

212
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:38.620
which is what I'm trying to do through my book is to give you all the

213
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:41.200
information so you can make the best decisions.

214
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.400
But there's definitely a few that,
uh,

215
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.840
I've already mentioned MFE fish rfpc assured,

216
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:50.470
which is just a little bit more expensive,
but,
um,

217
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:53.440
ensures better welfare and of course organic.

218
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.510
And there's a new one called pasture fed,

219
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.750
which means they've been kept out doors and only fed on pasture,

220
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:03.550
which is a new one and it's pretty good.
Um,
or just the last,

221
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.460
or don't be evil.
I was thinking of the Google,
um,

222
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.110
tagline because I kind of think if you are concerned about the environment,

223
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:15.160
like eating less meat is just one of the easiest things you can do.

224
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:20.161
And a lot of the charities have written reports on that and I think they keep it

225
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:24.040
quite quiet because they don't want to theme like they're lecturing people.
Um,

226
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.720
but it is a fact.

227
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.860
It really helps reduce your carbon footprint and also it's good for your health.

228
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.680
You know,
too much red meat is bad for you.
So,
um,

229
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.580
and this is what I,
um,
I actually ate much less meat than the average person.

230
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:41.320
They people think,
uh,
you know,

231
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.520
the ethical kind of warmer food eating those meet that actually compared to most

232
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:49.210
people.
I am a lot less me doing it myself.

233
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.940
Um,
and um,
I tried out all the alternatives including insects.
Oh,

234
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.430
possum around in a minute.
Um,
but there are other,
um,

235
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.220
in vitro meets whether growing meat from stem cells,

236
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.380
which freaks me out past me.
Um,
it's a bit weird,
but,
um,

237
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.770
lots of,
um,
vegans a welcome it and,
and,

238
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.940
and say they would eat burgers from meat grown in a test tube and plant protein,

239
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:20.690
which is something that's huge in silicon valley.
Lots of,
uh,
well Google,

240
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:25.040
I know we're looking into,
but also,
uh,
I think someone from Twitter,

241
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.223
um,

242
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.040
impossible foods beyond meat and they're all trying to find plant based

243
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:35.900
alternatives,
which I think,
um,
is,
is likely to be the future.

244
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.213
So,
uh,

245
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.230
I do think that we will be eating less meat in the future.

246
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:46.160
And I just think the ethical carnival,
if about the philosophical side of it,

247
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:47.780
that people don't often consider,
you know,

248
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:51.710
that eating animals obviously has an impact.

249
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:54.560
The animals are raised and killed on our behalf.

250
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:58.190
So I hope it gives people a better understanding of that side of it.
And,
uh,

251
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:02.060
I'll pass around some insects and we'll do some questions.
Thank you.

252
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.820
<v 1>Thank you very much.
Um,
so I've got a few questions initially.
Um,</v>

253
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.130
there's more awareness now around how animals are kept,
as you touched on yeah.

254
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.210
And the environmental impact of eating meat.
So as a result,

255
00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:18.100
people are turning to a Vegan Diet,

256
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.460
what do you think the implications would be of the whole population?

257
00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:22.350
Won't be good.
Um,

258
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.660
do you think it's a sustainable way of life for humans and for the investment?

259
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.810
<v 2>Well,
there have been studies done.
I looked into,
into that and,</v>

260
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.630
uh,
there was one done a,
um,

261
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.070
it was published in an actual proceedings of science,
um,

262
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.070
last year and it found that it would reduce if everyone went vegan.

263
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:46.430
It would reduce carbon emissions by half compared to compared to 2005 by 2050.

264
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.280
Um,
but,
but I personally don't think that's realistic and,
um,

265
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.350
it's certainly not in the short term anyway.

266
00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:00.000
And there's been other studies that found that,
um,
if just a third,
uh,

267
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.160
if if people ate less meat,

268
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.990
then it would have a similar impact over time.
And if you think about it,

269
00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:09.270
if you have,
if you asked everyone to go Vegan,

270
00:17:09.271 --> 00:17:11.880
I think you'd have quite small percentage of the population,

271
00:17:11.881 --> 00:17:15.240
but if you ask people to eat less meat,
I think you're talking,
uh,

272
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.910
did the majority of the population in the future and that can have a much bigger

273
00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:24.460
impact.
And you,
and I do think you'd lose a lot.
Um,

274
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.550
because a lot of our agriculture is based on a animal inputs,
you know,

275
00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:34.200
think about pigs,
they give the waste,
we feed them waste.
Um,

276
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.610
and we have lots of cultural associations with the meat,
meat,
Michelle,

277
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:38.690
you wouldn't necessarily want to name.

278
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.070
So I think less meat is a better one than just everyone going to be even,

279
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:46.400
<v 1>yeah.
The Sunday roast for example.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,</v>

280
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.730
of all the meat substitutes available,
and those in the,

281
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.420
again that you touched on,
which ones do you think will be the most popular?
Um,

282
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.020
and the ones most adopted by the population and then the most sustainable as

283
00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:58.690
well.

284
00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:03.270
<v 2>Um,
I think plant proteins because,
um,
a lot of,
um,</v>

285
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.270
uh,
our lifestyles now we demoed a lot of processed meat,

286
00:18:07.271 --> 00:18:10.930
but I think what people are really uncomfortable with cheap meat and that's

287
00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:14.860
processed meat.
And I think that that,
um,

288
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.510
alternatives like,
uh,
impossible beyond meat,

289
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.930
chicken strips and things like that are really growing.
And I think that will,

290
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.490
that's the thing that will really take off in the future because the technology

291
00:18:27.491 --> 00:18:31.160
is improving to make it taste better.
Um,

292
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.490
and in terms of sustainability,
people often are,

293
00:18:33.491 --> 00:18:37.510
do you know well that still soy protein and stuff like that.
So,
um,

294
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.590
but those companies,

295
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.350
I think the people who are buying those things are demanding that it comes from

296
00:18:42.351 --> 00:18:45.880
a sustainable source and it's still more sustainable than feeding the soil to,

297
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.380
to animals.
So I think that we'll see a great growth in that area.

298
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.670
What do you see people eating,

299
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.350
<v 1>putting in five years time?</v>

300
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.750
What do you think the challenges are going to be around?

301
00:18:55.751 --> 00:18:57.700
We educating the public so they change their

302
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.420
<v 2>happy eating less than better meat because,
uh,</v>

303
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.610
I'm not the only one talking about it like Jamie Oliver.

304
00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:06.940
He within still like really powerful celebrity chefs.

305
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.010
But I think the big challenge is time because people don't,
I can talk about,
hey,

306
00:19:12.011 --> 00:19:16.330
why don't you go to a butcher and try new cuts of meat or try awful.

307
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.560
But that's a lot of work for people with busy lives.

308
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:25.450
So I think it's about putting the time and possibly the money towards those

309
00:19:25.451 --> 00:19:26.320
better cuts of meat.

310
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:31.070
And that is important because the farmers that I talked about in my talk or

311
00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:32.770
allowing on people to carry on buying meat,

312
00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:36.230
red meat and that's reducing as well as processed meat.
Um,

313
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.990
and I don't think we should,
uh,
sometimes if statistic people eating less meat,

314
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.510
it's because they're just eating less from butches and stuff.

315
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.200
And I think it'd be,
uh,
if people are gonna eat meat,

316
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.660
that kind of stuff they should get is from farmers birch.

317
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.030
And the other challenge is gender variance.

318
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.270
We can see from the audience here,
uh,
women are quite interested in it.
And then,

319
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.080
oh and I were talking about in the book,
I sort of dismiss that and say,
Hey,

320
00:20:02.081 --> 00:20:05.890
you know,
it doesn't mean you're less macho.
And I thought about it and I thought,

321
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.993
um,

322
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.290
if you go to a barbecue in London and a guy comes along with Veggie Burgers,

323
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.580
no one would raise an eyebrow.

324
00:20:12.581 --> 00:20:15.870
But a lot of pieces in Britain they would be pasted.

325
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:21.400
So I think that that needs questioning cause that's a little bit ridiculous

326
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.400
because there's a lot of guys love me and it makes them feel good but it doesn't

327
00:20:24.401 --> 00:20:26.380
make them more match it.
That's ridiculous.

328
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.820
So we probably need to challenge that.
And the other thing in five years time,

329
00:20:30.821 --> 00:20:32.260
I think we maybe feel a little bit of a,

330
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.290
just sort of thinking about how things go.

331
00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:37.080
You generally go in cycles and you know,

332
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.970
clean eating and veganism is so popular now,

333
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.670
but I feel like it will maybe settle down to,
um,

334
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:49.110
into incorporating some of those habits into how we eat rather than saying

335
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.810
people should go vegan and eat clean.

336
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.030
Because I don't think that works for a lot of people.

337
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:59.020
But I think a lot of messages from that movement will come into everyday eating

338
00:20:59.021 --> 00:20:59.800
more.

339
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.210
So it'd be easier to eat less meat and still have a good time.

340
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.690
<v 3>Great.
Thank you so much.
Not at all.
Anyone have any other questions?</v>

341
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.300
Okay,
cool.
Of course.

342
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.490
[inaudible] thank you for coming to,

343
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.570
what was the weirdest thing you ate?
So your standards a weird

344
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.590
<v 2>oh yeah.
Okay.
That's,
I mean,
loads of really weird things.</v>

345
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.790
Say the squirrel was quite weird,
me and sex.
But um,
when I caught,

346
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:37.390
I caught a fresh card and I eat their egg sacks,

347
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.780
which is row and it was amazing.

348
00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:42.870
It was the best thing I've eaten cause it's like having ass.

349
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.700
But that is quite weird to have fresh called ro.

350
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.340
And I ate the stag heart,
uh,

351
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.280
in esteem and I,
which was really delicious and the liver and the kidneys,

352
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:55.270
which was so nice.

353
00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.540
<v 3>Yeah.
And that was,
um,
yeah,
that was something you mentioned this,
that,
yeah.</v>

354
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.820
You said you went with,
your dad actually killed this tag.
You,
you're done me,

355
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.210
of course.
To be creepy.
How did you kill this time?

356
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.620
<v 2>Cool.
Okay.
Yeah.
But we,
the book for the full,</v>

357
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.100
yeah.
Yeah.
The [inaudible],
um,
with a,
with a powerful rifle.

358
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.980
<v 3>Where in London do you think is a place where we can find the,</v>

359
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.090
like the fish that are outside of those five species,
because I actually,

360
00:22:27.091 --> 00:22:31.290
I'm not the kit,
but in believes in market with a five

361
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.830
<v 2>in the morning.
But if you go down spending skate,</v>

362
00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.390
you will see tens of species of fish and you'll just be that I had no idea this

363
00:22:42.391 --> 00:22:44.480
existed.
And it's,
it doesn't,

364
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:49.290
it doesn't smell of fish either cause it all fresh and uh,
well not too bad.

365
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.370
It less than you think it would be.
And there's just,
it's mind blowing.
Like,

366
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.450
you know,
you didn't know what a haddock or cod looks like.
Well,

367
00:22:57.451 --> 00:23:00.630
I didn't until I went to a fish market.
And then you see,
hey,

368
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:04.650
can ling and monkfish and like on that picture,

369
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.940
the ugliest,
ugliest,
strangers fish.
So it's quite,
um,
it's quite amazing,

370
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.280
quite joyful to see the,
to feed the variety.
And,

371
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.210
and then there are restaurants which do,
um,
which do you cook those fish,

372
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:22.730
which was,
I can't,
I can't think of one.
Sorry.
I don't live in London.

373
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.690
<v 3>Do you know,
learn this.
Yeah.
And last but not least,</v>

374
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.790
if one is too hard,
you could give me three.

375
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.880
What are your three or your favorite food in the world?

376
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.050
<v 2>The ospreys,</v>

377
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.440
<v 3>but it'd be,
you won't meet
Raspberries,</v>

378
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.070
raspberries.
There's some in the entrance

379
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.910
<v 2>by the way.
My nephews,
nieces always ask me that question.</v>

380
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.260
Any other questions?
Hi.

381
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.980
I'm just curious.
Like how are you continuing with it now?

382
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:06.000
<v 0>Preston?
And I said at the end of the book,
um,
I'm stopping it now.</v>

383
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:10.080
Um,
and largely because I want people to be able to pick up the book in 10 years'

384
00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:13.320
time and it still be genuine,
you know?
Um,

385
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.700
so I wanted to do something that was sustainable for me.
So,
um,

386
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.870
I eat less.

387
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.260
I definitely last meet and when I started the whole project because I questioned

388
00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:24.140
it a lot more.
Um,

389
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.970
but now actually the further I go,
that does recede.

390
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.230
And you do think about it less,

391
00:24:31.231 --> 00:24:34.710
which is interesting itself because that's how I think you have to be honest.

392
00:24:34.711 --> 00:24:36.180
That's how humans think,
you know,

393
00:24:36.181 --> 00:24:40.290
you can watch a video and be really concerned about something and then six

394
00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:43.200
months later when you're eating a burger,
you don't really think about it.

395
00:24:43.201 --> 00:24:47.910
And I'm do that as well.
So it's receding,
but I eat less meat.

396
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.060
And,
um,
I,
um,
I um,
um,

397
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.720
continuing to learn about a shooting and fishing and doing it myself because I

398
00:24:57.421 --> 00:24:58.950
never wanted to do it as a one off.

399
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.120
I wanted to learn those skills and that takes longer than 18 months.

400
00:25:03.121 --> 00:25:04.320
So I'm still doing that,

401
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.420
but not a huge amount because it takes a lot of money and time.
And,
um,

402
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.940
and I'm also trying to explore,
you know,

403
00:25:11.941 --> 00:25:16.941
things like different fish species and different cuts of meat because I'm quite

404
00:25:18.571 --> 00:25:22.620
greedy and I really enjoy that.
So,
yeah,
so I'm what I call,

405
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:26.110
I'm trying to be an ethical carnival.
What form?
Ethical carnival.
Yeah.

406
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.730
<v 2>I was just wondering what your farming commonly thought of the book and they</v>

407
00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:35.770
read it and he loved it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

408
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.580
Habits or are they still really interesting people?
Um,

409
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.240
sometimes it makes me kind of cringe when people are like,
don't worry to weeds.

410
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.730
It's not like processed chicken or something.

411
00:25:45.731 --> 00:25:48.790
And it kind of makes me cringe because I

412
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.070
find it difficult to tell other people what to eat even though the book is about

413
00:25:54.071 --> 00:25:57.790
what you eat.
I'm just telling my story because otherwise you feel great,

414
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.940
you feel a bit didactic and finger wagging.
Um,

415
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.460
but really positive.

416
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.980
I thought they might feel like I was attacking them because a lot of them raised

417
00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:12.610
meat.
Um,
but they were actually really open minded and welcomed it because most,

418
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.130
a lot of me in Britain is really high quality

419
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.040
<v 0>and it would help farmers to talk about,
uh,
the quality and why,</v>

420
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.550
why it should be appreciated and paid more.
Because in this country,

421
00:26:23.551 --> 00:26:26.880
we struggle to,
um,
uh,
uh,

422
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.790
compete with processed meat from abroad anyway.
So,
yeah,
they loved it.

423
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:31.980
It's very nice.

424
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:37.803
Yeah.

425
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.760
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
lots of people ask,
hey,
you know,
do you want to,</v>

426
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.010
did you eat a bachelor fox or something

427
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.730
<v 0>weird like that,
you know?
And I was like,
no,
why would I do that?
You know,
or,</v>

428
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.550
you know,
I didn't do,
the scleral was unusual,

429
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:54.570
but I didn't know quite tasty and it was accessible,

430
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:58.860
but I wasn't going to push exhaust takeover where it needs for the sake of it.

431
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.470
And I,
and I really not interested in that and I'm not,

432
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.690
I'm not really interested in,
um,

433
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.400
like if I traveled to other countries where there are meet switch and our

434
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:12.120
country,
we'd find where like dove or who was,
I don't,
I really don't.

435
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.830
I feel like I understand cultural taboos and I feel them and that's fine.

436
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.240
I don't need to cost them.
So,
yeah,
I know.
Interesting thing that much.

437
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.180
<v 3>Um,
firstly think when the news came out,
you were coming to see us.</v>

438
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.140
I was so excited.
I said a couple of years,

439
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.620
but this really resonates for me because I went vegetarian two years ago and

440
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:33.660
this was sort of the principle that I wanted to take as well,

441
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:36.660
which is I believe that obviously,
you know,
people just eat meat,

442
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.640
they just get it in itself,
in packet.

443
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.950
They don't even tie it back to an animal dying.

444
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.370
So I wanted to actually follow that,
which is I will only eat meat,

445
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.740
I'll kill myself.
But I love animals so much.

446
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:49.540
I will cry at a cartoon land dying that legacy.

447
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.720
I haven't eaten meat because simply can't kill.
How,

448
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.200
how do you see the most effective way of getting the message across to the

449
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:01.800
masses?
Have you successfully transferred,
you know,

450
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.700
or changed any of your friends mindsets without maybe overstepping the

451
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:10.701
boundaries of scaring the hell out of them and made them watch sort of videos

452
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:13.620
and I have lost some friends over that and I realized that's the wrong way of

453
00:28:13.621 --> 00:28:17.590
doing it.
So yeah.
How would you think is the most effective way to spread?

454
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:22.980
<v 0>Interesting.
The reaction to this book?
A lot of,
I thought I'd get a lot of,
um,</v>

455
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.590
uh,
pushback back from vegans.
People would be upset by it,

456
00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:30.180
but Ashley have been not that much and I've actually had sometimes more

457
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:32.910
aggressive from people who really love me and do not want to know and want me to

458
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.640
shut up.
Um,
so,
um,

459
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.210
it's surprising who you can annoy.
Um,
uh,

460
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.530
I think it has to be really gradual.

461
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:47.730
I mean if you can sort of talk about nudge theory and make it positive.

462
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.740
So if you see salespeople,
you can't eat stuff,
then they shut down.
And um,

463
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.530
and I think the,
and if you say you have to be vegetarian or Vegan,

464
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:59.010
then I think they just shut down.
But I think if you tell them like,
oh my God,

465
00:28:59.011 --> 00:29:04.011
if you tried this amazing new food that happens to be a plant protein,

466
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.960
or have you ever tried awful or have you tried meeting a butcher?

467
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:14.070
So I think through a series of positive messages rather than,

468
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.540
um,
set active,
but so much what you said was interesting,

469
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:21.630
cause I say I,
a lot of people say you should only animals.

470
00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:22.830
If you've killed them yourself,

471
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.880
but I would argue lots of people that would be too much like you,

472
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:30.480
and that's unrealistic and ridiculous.
Anyway.
Um,

473
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.010
and I felt like,
I'm not sure I necessarily wanted to do that,

474
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.460
but I just felt my role as a writer and I had an opportunity to explore a

475
00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:41.710
subject so people didn't have to

476
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.420
<v 3>have any more questions.
Wonderful.</v>

477
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:54.421
Thank you all so much for coming.
