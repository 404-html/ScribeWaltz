I understand it's a great production.

10
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.040
Uh,
her memoir of her time as a prisoner of conscience in Russia.

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.710
Riot days was published three days ago,

12
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.420
and as I told Matia am roughly halfway through reading it,
uh,
myself,
uh,

13
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.020
with her fellow,
a pussy riot member,
uh,
Nadia,

uh,
she founded Zona [inaudible],

15
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.640
an organization which defends prisoner's rights.

16

She's a recipient of the Lennonono grant for peace as well as the Hannah Aaron

17

to prize for political thought.
So,
uh,
I've mentioned the books will be for sale,

18
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.320
uh,
after,
uh,
after we're done.
Uh,
and,
uh,
and I think a bit about the format.

19
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.140
So let's get right into some questions.
Are you ready?

20
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.290
<v 2>Thinks about me even though.</v>

21
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.950
<v 0>Okay.
Well,
uh,
if,
if any question is,
is,
uh,</v>

22
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.480
out of bounds or uncomfortable for you,
that's perfectly all right.
But let's get,

23
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.100
let's get right to it.
Um,
I,

24
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:42.810
I want it to get to the events that are the focus of riot days.
Uh,

25
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.750
but before we do,

26
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.320
could you just tell us a bit about your life in Russia prior to the founding of

27
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.700
Pussy riot?
You know,
where were you born and raised?
Um,

28
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.230
what was your life like growing up?
Um,

29
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.680
maybe a bit about your education and how you formed your social and political

30
00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:57.514
consciousness.

31
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.420
<v 2>I was born in Moscow,
um,</v>

32
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.910
in 1998,

33
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.190
which is a amazing time in Russia is troika time.

34
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.880
So it's kind of the end of a Soviet Union and,

35
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.350
uh,
rising up Russia.
Um,

36
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.870
so when my boss per time from years,
et Cetera,

37
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.140
but this last year of USSR.
Excellent.

38
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.070
Um,
my mother,

39
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:33.040
she's a program is mmm.
Like Prague dumbest.

40
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.400
And my father,
he's,
um,
um,

41
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.960
Matthew mathematics professor.
Uh,

42
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.000
and uh,
well I was,
um,

43
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.850
I was growing up with my mother,
so I met my,

44
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.920
my father like when I was Jen ager.
And,
uh,

45
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.140
um,
there were no,

46
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:01.840
almost no talking politics in our family,

47
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
but some called why was a kind of a problematic child?

48
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:11.860
So I,
I changed the m five schools.

49
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.300
Um,

50
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.600
all of them I left by myself because I hated the system of education.

51
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.180
So coated education,
uh,

52
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.130
because it's totally Soviet Union system in which they want you to follow the

53
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.680
rules,
but not asking questions.

54
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.400
And I love questions.
So,
um,

55
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.510
that's how I think it's all started.
And,
um,

56
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.110
before pussy riot I was,
uh,
well it's,
it's a big,

57
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.120
big circle of,
uh,
of uh,
30 different people.
For example,
I started,

58
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:51.954
oh my,

59
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.170
let's say activism from a ecology when I knew that some government officials

60
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:02.600
close to former presidents,

61
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.720
so off and Medvedev wants to cut the forest.
I really love,

62
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.060
I start a campaign,
like a small campaign.

63
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.090
We were like five people meeting on the subway and collecting signatures.

64
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:22.611
But after one year that was more than 10,000 people around Russia and we won.

65
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.650
But in the end of the story,
I was quite,

66
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.130
well,
I understood that a,

67
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:36.480
it's a Tokyo rose situation when,
uh,

68
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.500
you need to do everyday activism for like making the results of one signature of

69
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:51.750
one fucking government official.
And,
um,

70
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.600
I started you to know to,

71
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.020
to how to say it.

72
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.003
<v 1>Hm.</v>

73
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.300
<v 2>Do you about the different forms of protest.</v>

74
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.440
And I started to read about political art.
I started to,
uh,

75
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.820
needs different people and that's how I think

76
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.890
we should I started.
So yeah.

77
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.490
<v 0>So there was a significant transition in Russian society at the start of the new</v>

78
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.140
millennium when uh,

79
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.120
between Boris Yeltsin and [inaudible] Yep.
I was president of,
of Russia.

80
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.430
And uh,
in,
in your book you write about this,
um,

81
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.740
you note that at the time Putin said we need stability.

82
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.450
Uh,
and then you go on to say,
uh,
you,

83
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.900
you go on to say stability was what he called himself.
Yeah.

84
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.370
Could you expand on that a bit?
What is this notion of stability,
um,
in your mind?

85
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.630
<v 2>Well,
yes,
this is one of the,
of his favorite words,
the ability,</v>

86
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.140
but it's not a,
it's a hippocratic shit.
It's not about stability.

87
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.500
It's about being a president until he will die and stealing money from Russian

88
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.460
people and spending them in their circles.

89
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.920
So it's not about to be lit.
You,
um,
actually,
uh,

90
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.010
we went to the Christ Cathedral of Christ the savior because,

91
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.800
uh,
in the beginning of the third term,

92
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.860
which is start to use George for approving his endless presidency,

93
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.390
uh,
saying that he's kind of a

94
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.300
kind of sent by God to be a president of Russia and fighter Curio who is the

95
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:49.741
head of Orthodox Church and very influential person in Russian society start to

96
00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:55.401
approve this saying that true Christians should not go to the demonstrations.

97
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.020
Um,
and so on.

98
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.130
<v 1>MMM.</v>

99
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.790
<v 2>Well,
so would you say to,
to do so,</v>

100
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.480
<v 0>so,
so pussy riot was formed,
uh,</v>

101
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.190
you formed it with several other women.

102
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.740
<v 0>And not only women,
not only women,
but also men.
Yeah.
Yes.
Why not?</v>

104
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.240
Very well.
And,
and as it came together,
you begin to,

105
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.720
uh,
organize what you call it,
actions.
Could you talk about a typical action you,

106
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:34.260
you write for example,
in the book about,
uh,
an action that global mes de,

107
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.230
which is a large stone platform,
uh,

108
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.680
near Red Square and outside the Kremlin walls.
Yeah.
What was,

109
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.390
what was a typical action like?

110
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.133
<v 1>MMM.</v>

111
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.930
<v 2>Action isn't as a form of political art when you're doing action.</v>

112
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.430
So before the Christ the savior,
we went to the Red Square,

113
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.020
which is the heart of,

114
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.570
I think called political field of Russia.

115
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.270
And

116
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.750
we came there with a song,
Putin pissed here's himself,

117
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.010
his pants.
Actually I think yes,
this correct translation.

118
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.840
Um,
and,
uh,

119
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.980
that's I think how the officials knew that we exist.

120
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.620
<v 1>MMM.</v>

121
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:39.150
<v 2>How,
how are you want to describe?
So the action,
uh,</v>

122
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.570
usually should be prepared.

123
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.560
So it's a bit different from the,
for example,

124
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:50.000
classico political rally.
So you're doing,

125
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.030
you should,
you should be prepared because you,

126
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.840
you will not have a second chance to it.
I mean,
you will have,

127
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.040
but in a different place.

128
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.440
And different place means different contexts and different statements.

129
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.990
So,
uh,

130
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.800
we went to the Red Square because we felt that we need to,

131
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.910
we need to protest there because that was a time,
uh,

132
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.660
of January of 2012 when

133
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.250
before the elections,
almost all the Russia was protesting.

134
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.420
I think it's a little bit similar of what's going on now in the United States

135
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.230
because somehow,
um,

136
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.650
Trump became a match for a people,

137
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.430
for the people,
uh,

138
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.940
to stand up and to,

139
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.020
to say the,
just spread the word.

140
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.430
<v 0>So that brings us a bit forward in the story to the pump,
the pump prayer.</v>

141
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.750
So this was the action that led to your arrest and detention and trial and

142
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.150
ultimately your imprisonment.
Um,

143
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.040
it took place in a large Russian Orthodox church in central Moscow Cathedral of

144
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.510
Christ the savior.
So I want to interject that I visited this place in 1989,

145
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.910
uh,
during the Soviet period are in today's guide.
Took us to this site.

146
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.190
Um,
it was a swimming pool,
a large outdoor swimming pool at the time.

147
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.560
Um,
it's still a cathedral had existed from the 19th century on that site,

148
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.640
uh,
but was torn down in 1931 in another religious purge.

149
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.970
And then since the fall of the Soviet Union,
uh,

150
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.040
Cathedral has been rebuilt on the site.
But you notice that you,

151
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:44.220
you note in your book that the Cathedral is not actually owned by the Russian

152
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.500
Orthodox Church.
No.
Nor is it always used in ways that,
um,

153
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.230
might associated with the church.

154
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.830
Could you say a bit more about how pussy riot selected this,
this site?
Um,

155
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.260
for the pump prayer action?

156
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.450
<v 2>Yeah,
it's notes.
Oh,
well,
it's not just the church.</v>

157
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.930
It's a huge complex,
um,

158
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.290
like upward chores,
let's say in lower charge.

159
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.890
And in the upper chores share arbitrage is a symbol of this collaboration

160
00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:17.081
between Putin and butter because butter usually doing his speeches there and,

161
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:25.090
but in the Lord Church and both of them do not,
uh,

162
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.840
officially by law,
uh,
belonged to Russian Orthodox Church organization.

163
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.353
Um,

164
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.840
and there are a lot of kind of facilities there,

165
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:40.290
like laundry shop,
often serving years carwash,
uh,

166
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.060
and holes like rental halls,

167
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.990
rental rules for purchase.
Um,

168
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.920
which where you can not only have a party but rant

169
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.540
some Japanese techniques for music and invite some musical band there.

170
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.850
Um,
and generator of like heavy smoke.
He's just more,

171
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.860
uh,
these balloons and so on.
And

172
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.980
so,
um,
all this,
uh,

173
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.510
like list of what you can do there,
you can find in the official website.

174
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.780
And usually if you prepare something,
uh,
you,
uh,

175
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.560
start to read about this place since and so on.

176
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:32.250
So we went to the official website and,
uh,

177
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.030
we work with quite surprise.
Um,

178
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.420
and uh,
well,

179
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.180
um,
we just,
I mean we didn't ask any permission to,

180
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.690
to make a song there,
but yeah.

181
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.900
And the song was protests.
Um,

182
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.050
I think,
uh,

183
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:08.890
this is a,

184
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.100
let's say it's a big drama of our country because during the whole,

185
00:13:15.201 --> 00:13:18.800
so it period Christianne she was banned in Russia,
in,

186
00:13:18.801 --> 00:13:23.801
in Soviet Union and thousands of people were killed,

187
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.000
tortured,

188
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.710
sent to the endless prison terms just for being Christians,

189
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.800
just for praying,
for celebrating Christmas.

190
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.210
And now we have

191
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.100
it's situation when,

192
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.840
I mean Christianity is used by check is by the same organization which were

193
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.240
repressing them for almost a century.

194
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.760
And,
uh,
this is a very sad,
so,

195
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.750
and,
uh,
I think the difference,
uh,
of,

196
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.700
uh,
political art,
uh,
between,
for example,

197
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:14.110
political activism is not providing,
um,

198
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.420
only one right decision.

199
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.690
It's about asking questions which are not been asked before and which are

200
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:31.960
uncomfortable for government,
for example,
or for any authorities.

201
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.540
So,
and that's what we did.

202
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:40.210
We didn't say that we know,
uh,
how,

203
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.200
for example,
the church should exist in the right way.

204
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.060
We just said that we think that it's wrong.
How,

205
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.220
how it is
in the days after

206
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.220
<v 0>the punk prayer or you went into hiding in Moscow for a number of days and then</v>

207
00:14:57.621 --> 00:14:58.454
you were arrested

208
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.600
<v 2>yeah.
And almost the road more.
Yeah.
Yes,</v>

209
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.530
because we changed floods.
Okay.
Good conspiracy floods every day,

210
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.840
changed phones,
uh,
Change Sim cards and so on.

211
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.950
Um,
so yeah,
it's one of my favorite part.

212
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.800
<v 0>So your,
your first stop in your detention was in Moscow.
Uh,</v>

213
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.810
as I understand it,
where you spent some months awaiting,
no,
no,
no,
no,

214
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:30.644
it's not.
So,
okay.

215
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.030
<v 2>One day rescue is they put you too [inaudible].</v>

216
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.440
It's like the oldest prison,
all the jail in Moscow,

217
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.070
like from the side of video and so on from Warner here.

218
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.480
So they put you there and they are used,

219
00:15:46.481 --> 00:15:48.410
spends five,

220
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:53.420
six days and after they put you to the jail where investigation gourds and

221
00:15:56.081 --> 00:16:00.160
sentence.
So it's about eight months you're spending in the

222
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.500
women's jail,
which is the only one in Moscow.

223
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.690
<v 0>And you described,
you described the trough guy as a place,
for example,</v>

224
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.660
it was so cold and the building was so porous that um,
the,

225
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.090
the prisoners used,
um,
uh,
do from,

226
00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:22.020
from their bread ration sanatorium at its most go jail,

227
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.640
Moscow jail to stuff into cracks in the wall too,

228
00:16:25.641 --> 00:16:30.480
to try to insulate their selves.
So during this time,

229
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.400
uh,
when you were in detention awaiting trial,

230
00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:37.290
what kind of access did you have to legal counsel to a lawyer and,

231
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.240
and also,
um,
to your family and uh,
others on the outside,

232
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:50.290
<v 2>I had an access to a lawyer.
Uh,
but well worth it.</v>

233
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.690
I think it's a bit different.
So your,

234
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.480
you have visits with lawyer and in the room,

235
00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:02.040
in another building where from,
from where you,
your cell is.

236
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.630
And of course it's so old listened and so on.

237
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.460
Um,
so they can use any of your

238
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:18.030
talks anywhere,
not only in investigation protocols,

239
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.980
they can use it,
uh,
uh,
in governmental media for example,

240
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.520
because,
uh,
all the meters,
you know,
in Russia,

241
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.830
all the big media billows to friends of fortune.
So they provide a,

242
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.830
everything was they accept from the administration of the president.

243
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.110
Um,
so,

244
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.170
and about family to have a visit with your family,
uh,

245
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:49.190
you should have assigned paper from your investigator and I want just to get a,

246
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:54.240
he somehow lost about 10 papers,
um,

247
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.590
where I asked her this visit.
So,
uh,

248
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:01.700
no visits during the investigation.
Um,

249
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.500
after the trial I had one visitors,

250
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.660
but it's kind of hard to see your,
I mean,

251
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.660
to see your son between this gloss and so on.

252
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.370
<v 0>What was,
except for that visit,</v>

253
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.730
what was the total amount of time you were separated from your son?

254
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.890
<v 2>Well,
I've been very in prison for two years,</v>

255
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.460
but when they sent me after the sentence to the penal colony,

256
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.010
which is 3000 kilometers from Moscow,
uh,

257
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.150
I had to,
um,
once at three months visits,
uh,
with my family.

258
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:43.080
So they came,
uh,
does he know calling you to visit me?

259
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.660
Um,
so

260
00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.890
<v 0>you were charged with,</v>

261
00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.980
in English it translates to hooliganism motivated by religious hatred.

262
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.710
Yup.

263
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.920
Do you recall your reaction when you were told that was the charge against you?

264
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.360
<v 2>I Dunno.
Yeah,
it was quite a surprise because,
um,</v>

265
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.940
uh,

266
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.910
the law in Russia exist in the way that if you have just like hooliganism,

267
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:14.230
it's not,
um,
a criminal crime.
So you,

268
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.260
you can get up to 15 days in jail.

269
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.140
But if they find this motivation of hatred,

270
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:30.120
it's up to seven years.
Um,

271
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.790
well,
this kind of hatred can be different.

272
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.500
It can be political hatred,
social hatred,
and religious one,

273
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.560
which they somehow found,
uh,

274
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.370
in us in our song.
And,
um,

275
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.260
that was,
um,
how,

276
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.470
this is a special part of the trial,
uh,

277
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.590
of approving that we really hated,
um,

278
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:05.550
the choice.
They said Christia issue,
which was fucking absurd.

279
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.190
<v 0>The prosecutors analyze the lyrics of the songs in your performance,</v>

280
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.810
<v 2>especially experts,
especial experts analyzed our song.</v>

281
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.440
And following that,
um,

282
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.550
the phrase holy shit means hatred to,

283
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.250
um,
whole Christianity.
You

284
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.770
if you're saying you're holy shit,
it means that you hate

285
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:40.040
all Christian below rings and charge itself.

286
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.860
Yes.
I mean,
it's a fishery.

287
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.530
The trial

288
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.890
<v 0>as often European,
holy shit.</v>

289
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.430
It means like you more and more height the charge.

290
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.273
I understand

291
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.070
at the conclusion of the trial and there are people who really believe that,

292
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:04.760
that,
I mean

293
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.040
they believed that the testimony of these experts,
uh,

294
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.380
so the,
um,
at the conclusion of your trial,
um,

295
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.520
you were sentenced to two years in prison and you were transported to a prison

296
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:23.200
camp and Pam [inaudible] very sneaky.
It's actually,

297
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.010
<v 2>it's a small CG in fem region.
And Boris Yeltsin,</v>

298
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.900
who was before him,
he was growing up at the city.
Oh yeah.

299
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.170
She was studied there and he was,
Whoa,

300
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.780
totally not.
The president

301
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.640
<v 0>is,
you know,
what a small world,
um,
can you,</v>

302
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.700
can you tell us a bit about the prison camp?
Um,
what was,

303
00:21:44.701 --> 00:21:46.290
what was the environment like for you?

304
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.270
<v 2>In Russia?
We have service system of,
uh,</v>

305
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.240
of Soviets,
prison system or the [inaudible] system.

306
00:21:56.241 --> 00:21:59.870
So we don't have prisons.
We have a

307
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.790
penal colonies,
let's say,
or labor camps.

308
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.920
So it's come a,
it's like a strange village.

309
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.850
Um,
was barracks,
uh,

310
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.620
buildings,
uh,
for example,

311
00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:23.621
two floors building in one floor exist one unit in one unit.

312
00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.920
It's 100 people.
So all of them are living together,

313
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.000
sleeping together in one in one bedroom and having,
for example,

314
00:22:32.001 --> 00:22:35.810
three toilets or everybody's here and it's no hot water,

315
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.190
no medicine,
which is the main problem

316
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.750
and eats necessarily the work.

317
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.980
So all the prisoners work in the fabric,

318
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:56.480
which is another part of the zone or the,
you know,
calling you.

319
00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:02.210
And this is the most cynical thing that's a,
the workers is a sewing,

320
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.740
a police uniform and the uniform for Russian army.

321
00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.340
Yeah.
It's uh,
I mean,
and it's

322
00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:18.500
almost not paid for that.
So it's like two free dollars per month as a salary.

323
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:24.250
And usually people who have no support from the outside should somehow decide

324
00:23:27.081 --> 00:23:30.710
what they will buy cigarettes or I don't know those past,

325
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.080
uh,
well when,
uh,

326
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:37.890
when I came there,
uh,

327
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.290
the transportation is another kind of story.

328
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.580
Um,
I was quite,
because,

329
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.080
well,
all this women start to to tell me,

330
00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:54.980
you what is going on.
But

331
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:02.390
they didn't do anything against it.
And I asked,

332
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:03.224
why,

333
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.380
why you just say that you will not go to work?

334
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.140
And some of these people were working for administration as a,
let's say spice.

335
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:20.630
Um,
and if you're saying something like that,

336
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.660
it means that you kind of preparing of disorganization of a regimen.

337
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.970
And they put me to solitary confinement for two months and two months.

338
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:35.921
So five,
five,

339
00:24:35.921 --> 00:24:40.921
my almost five months in total and start to make different kinds of pressure to

340
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:45.350
me.
So,
uh,
we,

341
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:49.030
together with my lawyer and my friends,
uh,

342
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.870
decided to go to the court against them.
And after two months we would,

343
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.910
and uh,

344
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.570
that was the first court against the prison guards in the spinel Columbians.

345
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.920
Everybody were quite

346
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.700
surprised when you're released from solitary confinement?
No,
no,
no.

347
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.710
I won a court against,
um,

348
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.930
against prison guards against there.
Um,
for example,

349
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.640
if they find,
uh,

350
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.080
it's okay.

351
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:26.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:31.130
<v 2>For example,
they want to punish you inside prison.
So how they can do it.</v>

353
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.163
Um,

354
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:39.700
they are finding that you somehow violated the regime and the rules of prison,

355
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.440
the official law
after this,
uh,

356
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:49.540
finding they writing your paper and this paper means that,

357
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.950
uh,
your kind of disciplinary punished,

358
00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:00.500
uh,
they can,
I mean,
it's a whole porch.
The door,

359
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.640
like official one.

360
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.360
It's like a small court against a small court inside the prison.

361
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:13.510
So they wrote a number of these papers against me.

362
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.560
Uh,

363
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:21.550
and I went to the court to appeal and when I won eight,

364
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.360
uh,
people from prison guards who fired because they broke a law.

365
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.530
It's their is um,
and um,

366
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.770
and they start to kind of,

367
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:35.980
<v 1>yeah.</v>

368
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.970
<v 2>Improve conditions.
So they start to recover barracks,</v>

369
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.250
put up salaries.
Uh,

370
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.850
yeah.
This,
this things

371
00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.400
<v 0>you were released from your sentence a bit early.
Um,</v>

372
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:58.510
what do you think motivated the government to declare an amnesty that impacted

373
00:26:58.671 --> 00:27:01.100
your case at the end of 2013?

374
00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.700
<v 2>Uh,
it was,
um,
and months before Olympic Games.</v>

375
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.560
So as you know though,
why didn't the game,

376
00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.160
so the media and

377
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:18.630
in Sochi and Sochi,
yes,
came to Russia and Sancho.

378
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.400
Um,
what'd you learn?

379
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:25.401
She is to decide to make a good faces for the west and released us and the

380
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:32.070
[inaudible] Kaur who was also political prisoner who spent 10 years in penal

381
00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.460
calling you who used to be a Russian,
let's see,

382
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.880
oligarch in nine chairs.
Uh,

383
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.950
so they released three of us,
um,

384
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:50.430
and some other political prisoners from Arctic Sunrise case.

385
00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.130
I don't know.
Do you do know is it's,

386
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.020
it was actually no for Russian ecologists and Green Peas.
They,

387
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.020
um,
it's another story.
Anyway,

388
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.220
so they've used the number of political prisoners saying that,
uh,
uh,

389
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:14.590
hi guys.
We don't have political prisoners in Russia.
We were okay.
Uh,

390
00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.430
so,
but we,

391
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:23.590
we went to the Sochi after a month,

392
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.300
I think amongst once a week.

393
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:31.650
And that was another story because we made an action there and it was

394
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.360
totally another Russian that we remembered.

395
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.450
<v 0>You were,
you were assaulted in Sochi at least once.</v>

396
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.630
<v 2>Yeah,
of course.
Alex,
because Alex with,
whoops,</v>

397
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.780
nothing.
Listen,
may I open up to some questions from my colleagues?

398
00:28:54.781 --> 00:28:59.220
Yeah.
Let me pass around a microphone.
Hi Masha.

399
00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.000
Uh,

400
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
so what are your main learnings from your life and what is currently your main

401
00:29:05.731 --> 00:29:10.460
learnings?
Is that,
yeah.

402
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.850
Yeah.
So what,

403
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:15.870
what is the main message you want to bring to this country?

404
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.920
I think every learning,

405
00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:26.220
I don't have to book her just to show the one example of how it is possible to

406
00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:28.880
make a choice and the act.

407
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.040
But I believe that he's three off any country.

408
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:40.150
It doesn't let the Russia United States Great Britain made by people,

409
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.320
not by political leaders,
but by all of us.

410
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:49.410
And each of us has a own story and all the stories is actually a history of the

411
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:53.530
country.
So

412
00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.000
it's okay.
It's um,
I know it's,

413
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.700
it doesn't sound like a statement or a message,
but I think,
uh,

414
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.380
this is what I want to say.

415
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.480
Next question from auction.

416
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.330
<v 4>Um,
I'm curious,
uh,</v>

417
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:19.930
in the sort of spectrum of different kinds of political action from more to less

418
00:30:21.051 --> 00:30:23.780
radical for our true marching.

419
00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:28.781
Also different things people can do in under a regime that's oppressive,

420
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.650
which are the most effective to actually bring about change in your opinion?

421
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.890
<v 2>Any honest thing?
Actually,</v>

422
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:51.170
I mean we have one effective manager,
uh,

423
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.510
whose name was styling and that was quite effective,

424
00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:00.330
but
I think brought us,

425
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.620
do not work like that.
It's um,

426
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:10.460
it's about what's in your heart.
And um,

427
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.650
for example,
I,
I never,

428
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.460
I wasn't that nervous Dodd you,
uh,

429
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.240
or any Arctic set poetry.

430
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.950
So I never thought that,
uh,
if we'll have him with me,

431
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.240
never.
But,
um,

432
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.030
things happening sometimes.

433
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.140
So it's so most important.

434
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:45.220
Do not,
do not lose yourself and do not,
uh,

435
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:50.640
afraid to speak out.

436
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.920
It doesn't matter where is going on.
Maybe it's a,

437
00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:01.210
it's a situation in the class where all older students are silent and you just

438
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:06.030
stand up and say something.
Do you teach you that you are not injury?
This is,

439
00:32:06.031 --> 00:32:07.050
don't use the same.

440
00:32:07.051 --> 00:32:11.880
Then going to the cause she drove for me it's the same level.

441
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:13.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

442
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.120
<v 2>Uh,
two questions.
Um,</v>

443
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:20.560
what brings you joy and what are your future artistic plans?

444
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

445
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:25.983
<v 2>Whoa.</v>

446
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.980
I like her.
I liked the action.

447
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.060
I like when I am doing something at the,

448
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.600
it works and I like to swim.

449
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.173
It's different things.

450
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.380
Um,
as a future blends,

451
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.193
blends,

452
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.720
I'm usually like doing what I feel.

453
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.300
<v 0>So you've been a citizen activist and a prisoner,</v>

454
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:12.910
prisoner of conscience in what most neutral observers would certainly call an

455
00:33:12.911 --> 00:33:15.670
authoritarian regime.
Um,

456
00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:19.780
what advice would you offer to people in other countries around the world who

457
00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:24.400
might be concerned about creeping authoritarianism in their own societies?

458
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.273
<v 2>Advice.</v>

459
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.960
I mean,
when we started,
we were inspired by,
uh,

460
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:44.860
movements for from us and Lord from ride goals,
uh,

461
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.780
from the Kikuyu Cubans.
So it's,
you guys who give us advice is,
so

462
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.920
I think

463
00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.480
you have an amazing culture on if we're speaking about freedom,

464
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.640
is it,
I mean United States was great.
It is a country of freedom.

465
00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:10.760
So what advice I can give you,
this is very strange question.

466
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.250
Sorry.
Thank you.

467
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.550
So would that will come to a close,

468
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.330
I'll tell y'all supposed to him as I was crazy,
but

469
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:29.180
<v 1>[inaudible] it was</v>

470
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.860
<v 2>learning Russian in school.
I was,
yes,
it's popular.
No,
no.</v>

471
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.930
But why did you decide to launch version?
Well,
it was the Cold War.

472
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.670
It seemed like a valuable skill.
