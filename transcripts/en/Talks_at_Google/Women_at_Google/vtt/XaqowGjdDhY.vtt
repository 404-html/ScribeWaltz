1
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.100
Um,
okay.
So thanks everyone for coming.
My name is Vira,
uh,
myself and Vern,

2
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:15.400
head up toxic Google for the Toronto office.
This is our second installment.
Um,

3
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.140
we're sticking on this charity train.
I love it very much.
Um,
so we have doctors,

4
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:23.730
Samantha Nutt from or child here with us today.
Adam Green,

5
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.900
as you all know who's from the agency team is the,
um,
creative lead.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
He will be hosting.
And uh,
welcome.
Thank you for coming.

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.990
If you do have any questions,

8
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.870
please walk up to the mix as there are people on the live stream and we are

9
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.280
recording this.
Thank you.

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.220
<v 1>Awesome.
Thanks [inaudible] and welcome.
Thank you.
Excellent.</v>

11
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:44.090
Thanks for coming into Google.
Um,

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.350
so for those who aren't familiar with your work,

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.420
if you could tell us a little bit about what is war child,
um,
and,

14
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:52.960
and the work that you guys do around the world.

15
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.820
<v 2>So we're told is an international nongovernmental organization and charity and</v>

16
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:01.150
we work with children and their families on the front lines of most of the

17
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:04.120
world's most,
uh,
significant and intense conflicts.

18
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.180
So essentially what we are is we're a protection agency.

19
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.360
So we go into environments to work with those kids and their families to make

20
00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.610
sure that they are safe,

21
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:16.870
that their needs are being met and that they have opportunities to rebuild their

22
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:19.470
lives and rebuild their communities over the long term.

23
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.180
The ways in which we do that,
we kind of what we focused on,

24
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.370
we have three pillars.
So one is education,

25
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.930
making sure that kids in war are allowed to uh,
maintain their education,

26
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:33.460
catch up on their education and grow to be thriving members of their community.

27
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.010
The second part of what we do,
it sounds a little bit technical,

28
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:37.090
but it's justice work.

29
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.090
And so we make sure that especially in environments where girls and young boys

30
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.270
can be,
um,
you know,

31
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.790
sexually assaulted whether whites are routinely being violated.
A,

32
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.660
we work to actually promote an uphold the rule of law by training lawyers and

33
00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:53.840
paralegals,
uh,

34
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.370
defending the rights of those children actively within those communities,

35
00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:00.370
but also through the legal infrastructure if one exists.

36
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.830
And then the third part of what we do,
we call opportunity,

37
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:07.240
which is really about making sure that families are economically self reliant.

38
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:11.640
And have the opportunity to provide for themselves to try to break that cycle of

39
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:16.630
aid dependency that plagues so many humanitarian catastrophes around the world.

40
00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:20.350
But just making sure that those families have resources at their own disposal

41
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.590
disposal to be able to make the right kinds of decisions that will be suitable

42
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:24.670
for them and for their children.

43
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.520
<v 1>Just fantastic work.
Thank you.
Um,
so you,</v>

44
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.330
you work in some of the most miserable and dangerous places in the world.

45
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:33.690
Places where,
uh,

46
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.300
there is effective we active work going on and most of what we hear is how do

47
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:42.500
they get emergency aid and have sutures enough water and a plasma in there.

48
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.370
How do you guys get in books and lawyers and,

49
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.810
and actually work with people on building longer,
better lives?

50
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.280
<v 2>Oh,
I think Adam,
you've hit on a really good point,</v>

51
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:55.830
which is that when we think about crises in other parts of the world and

52
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.380
especially war,
unfortunately our memories are pretty short,
right?

53
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:03.370
And so we think about the emergency phase.
So food,
water,
shelter,
blankets,

54
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:07.340
vaccination programs,
the things that you need to give to keep people alive.
Um,

55
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.490
but people also need reasons to live.

56
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.510
And when wars drag on as they so frequently do,

57
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.760
if you look at the word Syria now,
it's in its sixth year.

58
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.510
The war in Sudan has been apart from a few moments where it hasn't been as

59
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.660
intense,
has been going on for many decades now.
Uh,

60
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.130
other parts of the Middle East.

61
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.130
If you look at eastern Congo where it's nearly 20 years,

62
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.300
Somalia where it's multiple decades,
uh,

63
00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:34.301
as those wars drag on those gaps in those needs become that much more enormous.

64
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.920
And unfortunately,

65
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:40.921
our capacity to remain involved and demonstrate compassion tends to dwindle as

66
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.800
those conflicts drag on.
Um,
and,

67
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.710
and unfortunately that's when the needs become even greater because you've got

68
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:51.190
kids that have been out of school for five,
six,
10 years.

69
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.890
You've got families that have completely drained,
uh,

70
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.830
all of their financial resources that have lost their land,

71
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:01.300
lost their livelihoods are you have a,
a legal infrastructure,

72
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.920
a protective environment that has essentially been destroyed where there may not

73
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:09.280
be any police,
there may not be a functioning judicial infrastructure.

74
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.480
So if your rights are being violated,
if you're being raped and abused,

75
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:17.450
you have no recourse.
And so that's what war child focuses on.
And,

76
00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:21.010
and in order to do that,
you have to mobilize those local communities.

77
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.040
You have to make sure that they have the skills and the capacity to be able to

78
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.260
do the work that they have,
the resources.

79
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.480
And fundamentally you have to make sure that they,

80
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.220
that you have a longterm vision.

81
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.490
War is a long term problem.

82
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.370
And by continuing to only plug those gaps,
uh,
we,

83
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:40.900
we aren't,
I think fundamentally addressing the,

84
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.500
the reasons why some of these communities tend to be locked in that cycle of

85
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:47.920
violence and poverty and frankly despair in the first place.

86
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.660
<v 1>So you mentioned the war in the Congo.
Um,</v>

87
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.860
we had the good fortune of having Malala usef size parents here,
uh,

88
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:58.320
the other week.
And he mentioned that,
um,

89
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.550
the children that are sitting in camps today getting no education,
uh,

90
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.940
they are the isis of tomorrow.
They are the wars of tomorrow.
Uh,

91
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.030
they're the terrorists.
If tomorrow the DRC came through one of the worst,

92
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.410
worst in modern history,
uh,

93
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.470
there are an estimated seven and a half million kids there who are getting no
uh,

94
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.830
no education.
Um,
is that really the demographic time bomb that,

95
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.380
that uh,
the Malala was dad was,
was fearing.

96
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.710
<v 2>Certainly it is,</v>

97
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:31.711
it is true that kids who have almost nothing in environments where there is a

98
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:37.000
tremendous amount of violence where there's recruitment that's going on by

99
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.700
various armed groups,
militia groups.
Uh,
in the case in the Congo,
it's,
it's an,

100
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.790
an inordinate number of people that are a recruiting and abducting young people

101
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.540
to fight,
uh,
in that conflict,
in a climate of,

102
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.070
of absolute impunity.
So certainly young people who are unemployed,

103
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:58.100
who are not in school,
who have witnessed horrific abuses,

104
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.620
who had been the victims of horrific abuses themselves,

105
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.040
they are certainly more vulnerable to that level of recruitment to that kind of,

106
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.430
um,

107
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.170
ideological pole that many of those armed groups we'll offer them.
I mean,

108
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.220
we know,
we're told,

109
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.290
knows even from the work that we've done all around the world,

110
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.750
that when we have done skills training with young people,

111
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.860
when we have worked with teachers and other educators to make sure that they had

112
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:26.030
access to education could go back to school at an appropriate grade level.

113
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.160
Because if you're 17,

114
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.020
you've been fighting with the militia group in eastern Congo and you're

115
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:31.010
functionally illiterate,

116
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.250
you don't want to go back to being in grade one with a bunch of six year olds.

117
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.670
I mean,
that's humiliating for you.
So that becomes a huge barrier.
So yes,

118
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:39.380
education is critically important.

119
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.960
It's not the only thing though economic development,

120
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.870
it becomes critically important.
Um,

121
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.660
and making sure that their psychological needs are being addressed.
And,

122
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.810
and that overarching framework of,
of,
uh,

123
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.660
of a lack of accountability is one of the biggest challenges too.

124
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.950
<v 1>Yeah.
You're making your book a pretty strong case that in the Venn diagram of</v>

125
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:59.900
humanity where cheap,

126
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.880
small arms and idle young men intersect is a recipe for war.

127
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:08.980
So educating,
uh,
bring education in hopefully pulls the,
uh,

128
00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:11.510
the idle young men,
uh,
out of that equation.

129
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:14.890
But how far can you get when AK 47?

130
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:18.980
This costs $10 in a lot of these places,
education is a huge part.

131
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.930
What about arms control?
Okay.

132
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.170
<v 2>Uh,
arms control is absolutely critical and I think that there is,
uh,</v>

133
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.830
it's especially important right now that we talk about this issue.
You know,

134
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:32.070
when you look at the,
the rise of Isis in the Middle East,

135
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:37.071
if you look at even the devastating attacks that have taken place in the United

136
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.820
States,
um,
even in Orlando,
Florida,
the,
the,
uh,

137
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.480
easy availability of automatic and semiautomatic weapons,
uh,

138
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.910
small arms more generally,
um,

139
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
creates both opportunity and means for those who seek to destroy and harm,

140
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.040
uh,
to be able to do so.
And the proliferation of small arms,

141
00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.500
especially in unstable environments is,

142
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.520
I think one of the single greatest threats to public health and global peace and

143
00:08:05.521 --> 00:08:07.350
security in existence in the world.
Today,

144
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.700
we have seen a dramatic increase in the sale of those arms,
uh,

145
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.120
in the manufacturing of those weapons since September 11th,
uh,

146
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:18.570
over the past more,
you know,
now more than 15 years.
Um,

147
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.070
and so if you have a lawless environment where there is very little employment,

148
00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:28.050
where you've got half the population roughly that is,
uh,
under the age of 30,

149
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.140
and in some cases under the age of 18,
you know,

150
00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:35.910
you are going to have a situation where people will take up arms to resolve

151
00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:40.080
grievances,
uh,
to earn an income and uh,
and,
and,

152
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.920
and enter express their will and their particular ideology.
So,

153
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.430
so the arms,
uh,
in and of themselves,
I mean,

154
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.870
it's that adding that into the equation,

155
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.910
um,
is one of the hardest issues to address in a war zone.

156
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.720
You have to,
disarmament is absolutely critical to peace and prosperity.

157
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.250
<v 1>And a lot of the talk about,</v>

158
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.060
about our Roman revolves around the locations where the arms are,

159
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.090
but most of those guns are not coming from sub Saharan Africa or the Middle

160
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.800
East.
They're manufactured within a couple of hundred kilometers of where we're

161
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:14.820
sitting right now.

162
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:19.770
The United States is the largest arms exporter in the world and very recently

163
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:22.800
with the lab deal in Saudi Arabia,
Canada.
Hey,

164
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.220
had the dubious distinction of being declared the number two arms dealer.

165
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.603
Yeah.
Um,

166
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.940
so does that talk need to have a here usually when we talk about arms control

167
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:36.000
and proliferation,
it's a,
on the nuclear scale,
like our,

168
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:40.050
our is tend to be obsessed with state versus state conflict.
Uh,

169
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:44.670
we're spending $1 trillion on the next fighter jet programme,

170
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:48.360
the f 35,
that's the entire aid budget of the world,

171
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:53.100
roughly the NGO budget.
Uh,
when,
at what point does arms control,

172
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.990
need to start talking about like 20 caliber things that did sit in a,
in a,

173
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:00.060
in someone's purse in Texas,

174
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.270
but then can be used to end dozens of lives in somewhere like Sierra Leone.

175
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.860
<v 2>Well,
thank you.
Bastards are multiple pieces to that.
To that question.
Um,</v>

176
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.220
which is a,
I think a very,
very important one.
Uh,
you know,
on the issue of,
uh,

177
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.990
small arms being available and accessible,
you know,
the problem with small arms,

178
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:21.030
many of them look at the coalition,
the cough rifle,

179
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.450
they are virtually in distractible.
They are the preferred weapon.
Yeah.

180
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.220
<v 1>I need to be buried in sand.</v>

181
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:27.990
<v 2>So if you make it here,</v>

182
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.890
you make it to the United States or it's made in Russia or in China or wherever

183
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:35.630
else,
once it gets into an international market,
that is rarely it's last stop.

184
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.120
And some of the ones that I have seen,
uh,

185
00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:41.510
and frankly some of the ones that have been pointed at me over the years,
uh,

186
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:45.200
by young men have been weapons that were made even in the fifties and sixties.

187
00:10:45.201 --> 00:10:48.780
They are,
they're very easy for kids to load and reload in to be trained to you.

188
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:53.390
So,
so any weapon like that,
that enters the marketplace,
um,

189
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.630
it is a permanent problem and it's not a temporary problem.
So that's,

190
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.860
that's one piece of it in terms of,
uh,
who contributes to that.

191
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.640
If you look at all weapons sales,
so we,
that includes everything.

192
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.930
Roughly 80% of all weapons that are sold in the world,
um,

193
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.640
are manufactured by the United States,
has roughly half,

194
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:18.620
but then usually it's England,
Germany,
France,
Russia,
China.

195
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.770
So roughly 80% of them come from none other than the five permanent members,

196
00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:25.670
United Nations Security Council,
plus Germany.
Uh,
unfortunately,

197
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:29.640
now Canada is inching into that,
that equation.
Um,

198
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.090
and I think it's something that we have to consider very,
very,

199
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.030
very carefully because it does,
I think,

200
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.590
undermine our international reputation.
And we as Canadians can sometimes,

201
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.450
you know,
we think that we're the world's peacekeepers.
Um,

202
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.040
and then we have this reputation around the world of human rights says,
yeah,

203
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:51.860
and we're,
and we're not that anymore.
Um,
and,
and,
uh,
you know,
if we,

204
00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:55.900
if we want to have kind of prominence on the world stage and that credibility

205
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.000
and that reputation,
uh,
then I personally think that we have to,

206
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.580
to really question whether or not our,

207
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:08.050
our arms exports are consistent with that value of promoting a,

208
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.690
or those values of promoting peace and security and human rights.

209
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.050
Because you can go to any war zone around the world and know that that is not

210
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:14.660
the case.

211
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.040
<v 1>So until we can do that is do you feel like you like you guys at war channel to</v>

212
00:12:19.041 --> 00:12:22.100
kind of bailing the titanic with a bucket,
um,

213
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.510
as you try to educate people out of this,
but,

214
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.420
but almost unlimited free weapons are coming in the other side?

215
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.490
<v 2>I think I would look at that metaphor slightly differently.</v>

216
00:12:34.491 --> 00:12:38.330
I feel like sometimes you're on the deck of the titanic and you can see the

217
00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:41.110
iceberg.
You know,
you see kids in,

218
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:44.640
in Syrian refugees living in camps,
uh,

219
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.170
who are becoming increasingly despondent because they don't have the
opportunity.

220
00:12:48.171 --> 00:12:53.171
You see a southern Sudanese families who are selling their children into two

221
00:12:54.321 --> 00:12:57.290
arms groups because they've run out of resources and because they're

222
00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:00.440
increasingly desperate.
So you feel like you're on the deck of the titanic,

223
00:13:00.441 --> 00:13:04.820
you can see the iceberg and you're going to have a name,
see iceberg the iceberg.

224
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.430
Right.
And,
and,
um,
and yet it's not enough to change course.
And,

225
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.670
and that's the part that's incredibly frustrating for me.
Um,

226
00:13:13.671 --> 00:13:17.900
and I think for us as an organization,
because you,
uh,

227
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.650
you can,
you can feel it on the ground when it's happening.

228
00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:23.330
You can feel that shift,
that,

229
00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:28.331
that moment when people transition from being hopeful too,

230
00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:32.750
that sense of hopelessness,
that sense that the world has forgotten them,

231
00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:36.620
that nobody cares about what's happening to them.
Um,
that when,
that,

232
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.100
when that anger and that resentment begin to build a,

233
00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:42.850
when they feel increasingly desperate and,

234
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.900
and it's no surprise then that almost a year within that moment,

235
00:13:47.901 --> 00:13:50.780
you start to see people putting their toddlers on,

236
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.240
into rubber dinghies and trying to,
uh,

237
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:58.310
make it across the Mediterranean Sea to get them to safety.
Um,

238
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.310
<v 1>yeah.
When that's the best,
that's not for your family,
you know,
things are,</v>

239
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:06.150
are unspeakably horrible.
That's right.
That's the problem.
So your,

240
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:11.210
your book is full of unbelievably harrowing stories,

241
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.940
uh,
things that you've gone through.

242
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.690
One of the things that struck me was the number of whip smart,

243
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.820
incredibly brave,
uh,

244
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.370
educated women from around the world that you've worked with,

245
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.290
who've met with horrible,
untimely ends.
Um,

246
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.520
you make a really good case for the education of,

247
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.410
of women and girls around the world.
As a father of two little girls,

248
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:34.940
I don't even think it's,
it's up for debate.
Um,

249
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.080
but how risky is it as we educate them or we are we sending more people to the

250
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:43.580
slaughter if we're not educating people on the other side,
uh,

251
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.520
educating the angry young men with a $10 automatic rifles,
uh,

252
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.230
as to what society should,

253
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.640
could and should look like if everyone was equal.

254
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.980
<v 2>Both.
You don't have to do one at the exclusion of others.</v>

255
00:14:56.981 --> 00:15:01.210
So educating girls doesn't mean that that comes at the expense of educating
boys.

256
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.230
And,
and we found that more.
Todd's found that with our work all around the world,

257
00:15:05.231 --> 00:15:07.000
if you're not investing in,

258
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.420
I will be called community based sensitization going into those communities,

259
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.480
talking about the value of girls' education,
demonstrating the importance of,

260
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.440
of women's economic empowerment,

261
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.880
proving that to those communities by having those women return.
Um,

262
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.130
and they do become very productive members and,

263
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.270
and slowly you see people's minds and attitudes change.

264
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.920
And you can't go in there with this,

265
00:15:29.921 --> 00:15:34.720
with this giant sort of imperialistic agenda and your finger wagging and saying,

266
00:15:34.721 --> 00:15:37.540
it's gotta be this way.
And that's wrong because if you do that,

267
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.070
you're going to be shut out and shut down.

268
00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:41.330
And you may in fact put many of those young girls,

269
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.440
women that you want to be helping at risk by virtue of,

270
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.850
of behaving in that fashion.

271
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.070
<v 1>There's been some of that Madonna had,
uh,
uh,</v>

272
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.440
there has been speculation effort that did end it in,

273
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.890
in flames and Oprah and,
and a few others.
Um,

274
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.823
you're pretty,

275
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.520
you offers some pretty withering criticism in your book of people who just come

276
00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:04.060
in with an outside agenda into a local area,
uh,
and say like,

277
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.910
this is how it should be.
How do you guys operate differently in war child?

278
00:16:06.911 --> 00:16:08.060
How do you make sure you're not doing that?

279
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.610
<v 2>Well for us,
our 98% of our staff are local,
so,</v>

280
00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:13.170
and we have several hundred staff around the world.

281
00:16:13.171 --> 00:16:16.890
So these are folks who come from war zones who are working for us within those

282
00:16:16.891 --> 00:16:21.810
countries to build our programs,
to identify the needs,
to evaluate them,

283
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.100
to make sure that we're asking the right questions and that we have that level

284
00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:26.690
of,

285
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.110
of community legitimacy and acceptance before we even start a weird less,

286
00:16:31.111 --> 00:16:34.770
I said we're not an emergency organization,
so we don't go in there and say,
well,

287
00:16:34.771 --> 00:16:37.320
we're in the business of blankets,
so here's your blanket.
Um,

288
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.780
that's not what we do.
We go in,
we will have a one two year process of,

289
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.640
of information gathering,
of collaboration,

290
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.550
of conversation with local community groups,

291
00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:50.520
grassroots civil society organizations,
UN agencies,

292
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.620
other organizations on the ground to say,
okay,

293
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.250
what contribution can we make here?
What are the needs?

294
00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:57.540
What needs are not being met?

295
00:16:57.541 --> 00:17:00.990
What is the overall risk to children in that community by not meeting those

296
00:17:00.991 --> 00:17:02.850
needs?
And how can we help you?

297
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.870
And I think that that fundamentally is the question.
If you go in and say,

298
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.260
this is how we're going to help you,
that's how aid goes wrong.

299
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.310
If you go in and say,
um,
tell me about what's going on here.

300
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.500
How can we help you and you and you build it.

301
00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:20.700
And you were critical in that process and ask yourself the hard questions.

302
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.620
It doesn't mean you'll always get it right,

303
00:17:22.621 --> 00:17:24.270
but it means you're more likely to get it right

304
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.520
<v 1>to come with more,
more question marks,
less exclamation points.</v>

305
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.320
<v 2>Absolutely.
And you see that in a lot of crises.
You see a lot of grandstanding.</v>

306
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.310
Um,
and for me over the years,
you know,
I've been doing this work for 20 years,

307
00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:37.320
it's,
it's kind of been the bane of my existence.

308
00:17:37.321 --> 00:17:40.920
People who have no experience in Iraq and then they've been there for two days

309
00:17:40.921 --> 00:17:43.140
and they stand up and they say,
children are starving here.

310
00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:45.810
And you look at them and you go,
where the hell have you been?
Yes.

311
00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:49.620
They have been starving here for the last 10 years.
Actually,
thanks to sanctions.

312
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:54.090
But uh,
yeah,
welcome.
Yeah,
this baseball game for awhile.
That's right.

313
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.350
<v 1>Um,
you,
you also offer some,
some pretty uh,
heavy criticism of,</v>

314
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.700
of well meaning do gooders how can we in in the privilege to West help folks

315
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.360
that did actually is productive.
You,

316
00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:14.850
you're pretty critical of things like voluntourism um,
of,

317
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.310
of Ping Pong ball funding where you find a government that funds the UN that the

318
00:18:18.311 --> 00:18:18.581
infants,

319
00:18:18.581 --> 00:18:22.630
their local region that then funds in Ngo and by the time someone in need

320
00:18:22.631 --> 00:18:26.410
actually gets the money,
it's like small pennies on the dollar.

321
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.050
What can we do that's actually effective from this end?

322
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.150
<v 2>Well,
there,
there are a number of things.</v>

323
00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:35.200
I mean the more directly you can contribute to an organization that is working

324
00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:37.210
on the ground with those grassroots partners,

325
00:18:37.211 --> 00:18:39.250
that means that your money is going to go much further.

326
00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:42.820
So every time if you're Canadian organization that then has their national arm

327
00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:46.270
and then it gets kind of divided and divided and divided and then it will end up

328
00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:49.300
at the field level,
uh,
the impact of your dollar is diluted.

329
00:18:49.301 --> 00:18:51.990
So that's something to be very mindful of is to always make sure that,

330
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.120
ask organizations what is their programming model?

331
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:59.050
Are they a directly implementing agency?
Because that's uh,
that's very,
very,

332
00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.110
very critical.
The second piece of it is,
you know,

333
00:19:02.111 --> 00:19:05.530
so much of our aid money is wasted because of one thing.

334
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:10.000
And that one thing is inconsistency.
Because we see a crisis in the news.

335
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.350
We might write a check once or go online and donate and then here we are five,

336
00:19:14.351 --> 00:19:15.730
six,
seven years later going,
well,

337
00:19:15.731 --> 00:19:17.890
why don't things get any better in places like Haiti?

338
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.780
I mean these kinds of challenges,

339
00:19:19.781 --> 00:19:22.990
you're really talking about structural deficits and like anything else,

340
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.680
it takes time.
And so we know here,
if you're talking about education,

341
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.790
it's not enough to send a kid to school for a week or month or even a year.

342
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:32.350
It is a long term investment.

343
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.800
So you are far better off as a donor giving a,

344
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.000
and this is always when my director of development has a heart attack,
but um,

345
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.160
he's been,
now he's going don't say this,

346
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.840
but you are far better off giving a smaller amount of money on a regular basis.

347
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.530
Then you are writing a check once and then and then forgetting about it.

348
00:19:50.531 --> 00:19:54.940
It allows organizations to properly plan to implement in areas that the world

349
00:19:54.941 --> 00:19:57.340
has often forgotten and is showing less interest in.

350
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.910
It allows you to direct the those resources to the highest need environments and

351
00:20:02.981 --> 00:20:07.540
not be so subjected to the whims and mercies of the media cycle,

352
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:09.940
for example.
So that's one way to do it.
You know,

353
00:20:09.941 --> 00:20:13.600
don't give things like a hard goods,
clothes and books and all that stuff.

354
00:20:13.601 --> 00:20:15.340
It won't get there in time to be useful.

355
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.010
It's too expensive to ship and distributed cash flies a lot.

356
00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:21.640
Chief ash is a lot better,
you know,
it's a much better way of doing it.

357
00:20:21.641 --> 00:20:22.091
And in fact,

358
00:20:22.091 --> 00:20:26.290
many organizations now are looking at cash vouchers for refugees because then

359
00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:29.890
they can make their own decisions around,
uh,
what their family needs.

360
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:32.710
And we have this very paternalistic approach.
It's like,
no,

361
00:20:32.711 --> 00:20:34.900
you're going to have 10 bags of rice and six blankets.

362
00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.850
And a lot of those refugee families are saying,
they're saying,

363
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.590
actually I don't eat rice and I got enough blankets,
but yeah,

364
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.690
that's how we do it.
Right?
And,
and so now we're changing that attitude and,

365
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:46.870
and making it a little bit more,
um,
uh,
certainly more,

366
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.150
but also recognizing the value of cash contributions and,
and labor.
Um,

367
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.960
you know,
gifts in kind like labor are extremely valuable,

368
00:20:55.961 --> 00:21:00.240
especially to organizations that might have headquarters locally.
You know,

369
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.790
people have various skills that they can bring to our organization.

370
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:06.460
But that volunteer work is most helpful to us here.

371
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.870
Unless you are a seasoned expert who understands development,

372
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:15.040
understands the context,
understands the risks involved.
Frankly,

373
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:16.810
when you're going overseas and doing this kind of work,

374
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:19.780
you might be taking those opportunities away from local community groups,

375
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:23.500
which is something to be mindful of.
A lot of it is busy work,
philanthropy,

376
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.080
do you really need to go and we paid that classroom?

377
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:29.800
Or is there somebody else that with the money you save on your ticket could be

378
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:34.390
hired.
It's a local pay that to,
to paint that classroom.
Right?
Um,

379
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.950
and then the second piece of it is it's a,

380
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:38.110
it's a huge security risk for most agencies.

381
00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:41.470
So sometimes the better way for you to contribute,
in fact,
every way,

382
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.830
often the better way to contribute is,
is to be a donor and to help,
uh,

383
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.840
here if you can.

384
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.610
<v 1>Excellent.
Um,
so I want to bring it back to Google for a second.</v>

385
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.830
We have this mantra.
Don't be evil.

386
00:21:52.831 --> 00:21:55.490
We all like to think of ourselves as really good people.
Uh,

387
00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.650
but pretty much all of us have a tiny slice of unspeakable evil sitting in our

388
00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:03.780
pocket right now.
The minerals that go into these,

389
00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:07.450
particularly Colt and mine in the DRC is,
uh,

390
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.540
an engine of human misery.
Why do you think the industry collective,
we can't,

391
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.700
can't get on top of that.
We did it with diamonds.
Uh,
why not other minerals?

392
00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.640
<v 2>It's a lot more complicated than diamonds.
Um,</v>

393
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.600
and I'm not offering that up as an excuse but more of a,
of an explanation.

394
00:22:26.601 --> 00:22:28.920
I mean,
you can take a diamond and look at it,
uh,

395
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.340
under a microscope and know exactly where it came from.

396
00:22:31.341 --> 00:22:36.341
And so conflict tracing in that sort of environment became a somewhat easier

397
00:22:36.771 --> 00:22:38.970
within with Colton.
I mean quilting,
uh,

398
00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:43.490
it's estimated that the Congo contains between 60 to 80% of the world's coal tan

399
00:22:43.491 --> 00:22:46.660
deposits.
It is readily smuggled across Congos border is,

400
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.180
it ends up in international markets.
Um,
it,

401
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:54.020
it generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues and a often used

402
00:22:54.021 --> 00:22:55.300
towards arms sales,
uh,

403
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.820
for various Congolese back military groups and militia groups operating in that

404
00:22:58.821 --> 00:23:01.670
unstable part of the world.
But by the time it gets to your cell phone,

405
00:23:01.671 --> 00:23:06.410
you have no idea whether it's Congolese,
cold,
Tan or any other kind of cool 10,

406
00:23:06.411 --> 00:23:10.640
chances are just based on probability.
It is Congolese,
Cool Tan.
Um,
I think,

407
00:23:10.641 --> 00:23:11.690
you know,
to be honest,

408
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.720
this is an issue that the industry itself needs to actively get behind and start

409
00:23:16.971 --> 00:23:21.170
to look at what solutions are,
are viable,
uh,

410
00:23:21.171 --> 00:23:25.970
and make the most sense at a straight out ban.
Uh,
unfortunately,
you know,

411
00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:28.520
it follows the law of unintended consequences.

412
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.000
And under the Dodd frank legislation in the United States,
um,

413
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.860
they required more sort of more accountability and companies not to use conflict

414
00:23:36.861 --> 00:23:38.600
minerals.
Um,
what result,

415
00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:41.810
what happened was a lot of American firms close their minds that put a lot of

416
00:23:41.811 --> 00:23:45.860
our teams will miners out of work.
Um,
and what happens when have no employment?

417
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:49.130
You join a militia group because they are the only employer.
So again,

418
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:53.000
the law is an unintended consequences.
What we really need is,

419
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:57.590
is sectoral reform.
We need to look at how you fix the climate of impunity.

420
00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:01.290
At the same time,
you have to come at it from a number of different,
uh,

421
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.680
perspectives.
It can be done,

422
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.850
but none of that will ever happen unless one other thing happens.

423
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.880
And that's that the industry itself has to be prepared to confront this in an,

424
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:17.840
in an honest and transparent way.
The tech industry or the mining industry,

425
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.220
the entire industry,
tech and mining,
because the two really go hand in hand,

426
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.103
right?

427
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.840
<v 1>We're at a big tech company and within 10 block radius of this office is the</v>

428
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:31.350
highest concentration of Mining Hump Company headquarters in the world.

429
00:24:31.351 --> 00:24:35.010
So we might be in this office somewhat uniquely placed to tackle this issue.

430
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.710
<v 2>You are uniquely placed to tackle this issue.
And,
and,</v>

431
00:24:37.711 --> 00:24:42.670
and every time any effort has been brought about to introduce legislation,
um,

432
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.870
around this,
that would force frankly mining companies to be more accountable and

433
00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:50.620
transparent.
It's been met by very heavy lobbying,
uh,

434
00:24:50.621 --> 00:24:52.840
expensive lobbying on the part of those mining industries.

435
00:24:52.841 --> 00:24:57.580
And it has been shut down and I will see,
see 300 guns very narrowly though.

436
00:24:57.581 --> 00:25:00.970
It was only like 10 votes.
And then,
and then Paul dewar.
Yeah,

437
00:25:00.971 --> 00:25:02.770
I was trying to introduce legislation as well,

438
00:25:02.771 --> 00:25:06.460
who is the NDP foreign affairs critic who lost his seat recently in the
election.

439
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:11.080
But,
um,
he also had,
uh,
taken steps around this issue.
And again,

440
00:25:11.081 --> 00:25:14.770
I don't want to,
you know,
it's not the,
the answers are not simple.
Um,

441
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.420
it does need a development approach.
It needs a governance approach.

442
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.480
Uh,
it needs a diplomatic approach.
Um,

443
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:27.430
but all of that can happen as long as there is acknowledgement from the industry

444
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:31.360
and a willingness to lead change and a,
and if you could,

445
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.450
if we can even start there and begin to have those conversations,

446
00:25:34.451 --> 00:25:36.550
recognize that we have a real problem.

447
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.490
And that's exactly what happened with conflict diamonds for a while.

448
00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:41.530
The industry was like,
there isn't a problem.
There isn't a problem.

449
00:25:41.531 --> 00:25:45.460
And they ran from it and they lobbied against it.
And then finally they said,

450
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:48.730
we do have a problem.
The Kimberley Process is imperfect.
Uh,

451
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.280
the fact that Zimbabwean diamonds were not considered conflict.

452
00:25:51.281 --> 00:25:55.390
Diamonds is a huge gaping hole right in that process,

453
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.830
but it's a step in the right direction.
And even if it's imperfect to start,

454
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.770
at least,
at least we're making that effort.
Yeah.
Do something,

455
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.010
something is better than something is usually better than nothing usually.

456
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.090
Usually.
That's fine.

457
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.820
<v 1>Um,
so I want to get,</v>

458
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.940
I want to change gears a little link and go to you personally.

459
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:16.440
You're a physician,
an author,
as an assistant professor at the u of t,

460
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.920
uh,
a mother,
a board member,

461
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.780
and the founder and executive director of World Child Canada.
I,

462
00:26:23.781 --> 00:26:27.960
and you're also in the midst of setting up,
workout us.
When exactly do you sleep

463
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:35.460
<v 2>between three and five in the morning?
No.
Uh,
sleep is overrated.
Is it not?</v>

464
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.520
No,
it's not.
It is a glorious,
glorious part of life.

465
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:40.960
You should try it more off.

466
00:26:40.961 --> 00:26:45.830
No one is claiming I'm doing all of those things by the way.
Um,

467
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.280
you know what I mean?
It's,
it's one of those things and,

468
00:26:49.281 --> 00:26:53.250
and this is going to sound so trite and I apologize in advance,
but,
um,

469
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.050
when you do what you love,

470
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.040
there really is no distinction between your on time and your off time.
Right?

471
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:03.450
So when I'm reading,
I'm reading about foreign policy and global issues.

472
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:06.030
When I'm have it sitting around the dinner table,

473
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:09.480
we're discussing and debating these issues and,
and you know,

474
00:27:09.481 --> 00:27:14.481
and I have a limitless passion for the work that war child does around the

475
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:19.450
world.
And so,
um,
not championing that,
uh,

476
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.360
it feels like,
you know,

477
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.730
like I'm just being disconnected from myself in many ways.
So,
so it's about,

478
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.780
uh,
for me,
I don't,
I'm not tired by what I do.
I'm energized by it.

479
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:35.610
I get more tired when I'm,
when I'm not doing it.
When I feel that,
um,

480
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.260
you know,
I,
I,
I haven't done enough and,
uh,
that's when I feel most frustrated.

481
00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.640
<v 3>It's like the ultimate substitute for coffee for you.</v>

482
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:47.280
<v 2>It is.
Yes.
It does.
Well,
or coffee or,
or,
uh,
yeah,
no,
it's,
it's,</v>

483
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:50.950
it's just,
um,
I was gonna say wine there,
but,

484
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.730
but I still liked my wife.
Um,
the,
that's right.

485
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.100
That's right.
No,
it's,
it's,
I'm,
I'm,

486
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.020
I'm lucky I get to do and I'm passionate about and we can't all say that in
life.

487
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.280
<v 3>That's fantastic.
Uh,
do,
do you guys have any questions in the audience?</v>

488
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.550
I want to be cognizant and not just hog the mic the whole time.
Uh,
you know,

489
00:28:14.551 --> 00:28:16.560
Margo,
just go up to that,
the Mike if you can't,
if you're on.

490
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.260
Um,
you talked a little bit earlier about,
um,

491
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.730
Canadians perception as being peacekeepers.
Uh,
when the reality is,

492
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:30.540
is that we are a big part in a growing part of the distribution of weapons.

493
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.460
I'm curious if you've had a chance to sit down with our relatively new

494
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.900
government,
um,
Prime Minister Trudeau or anybody in his,

495
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.960
in his circle and what their view is on where we are today and trying to correct

496
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.530
some of these issues that we might be contributing towards.

497
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.160
<v 2>That's an excellent question.
And,
uh,</v>

498
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.230
I have had some of those conversations and they are certainly ongoing.
Um,

499
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:58.900
and I am,
uh,

500
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.090
testified at the Standing Committee on foreign affairs over the last couple of

501
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.710
years and a few of these related issues.

502
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.790
I think one of the most significant things so that Canada can do and should be

503
00:29:07.791 --> 00:29:10.790
doing is signing the arms trade treaty.
Um,

504
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.880
the arms trade treaty was initially a Canadian led effort to try to bring about

505
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.420
international binding legislation concerning the sale,
the manufacturing,

506
00:29:20.421 --> 00:29:25.150
the stockpiling and the transfer of small and light weapons in the world.
And,
uh,

507
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.440
about two years ago now,
in fact,

508
00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:32.000
it finally passed to the United Nations and more than 115 countries have signed

509
00:29:32.001 --> 00:29:35.960
onto it.
Uh,
unfortunately along with Russia and China,

510
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:41.150
Canada has not yet signed the arms trade treaty and because we missed the first,

511
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.510
now we have to pass a whole series of pieces of legislation before we're even

512
00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:50.350
eligible to sign it.
Um,
and there is a,
and I'm going to be very,

513
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:51.870
very clear on this.
Uh,

514
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:57.030
one point there is no way that if we had signed the arms trade treaty,

515
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:02.281
we would have been able to approve that $15 billion arms deal to Saudi Arabia or

516
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:05.740
to Thailand subsequently.
So,
um,
now

517
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.860
the current government has committed to signing the arms trade treaty,

518
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:16.000
but there has been no official deadline,
uh,

519
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.200
prescribed in relation to that.
Um,
and because it,

520
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.040
it is contingent upon these other pieces of legislation falling into place,
uh,

521
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.810
I don't know how long that's going to take or if he's even going to be during

522
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.100
this particular parliamentary cycle.
I,
I hope that it is.
It is,

523
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.730
it is absolutely the right thing to do.
Um,
and,
uh,
and,

524
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.620
and as we talk about reengaging with the world,
um,

525
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.660
and we vitalizing are,
are multilateralist traditions as a country,

526
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.770
we,

527
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:52.770
we certainly need to understand that our absence from the arms trade treaty and

528
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.280
the reputation in many instances of our mining sector and some of the violations

529
00:30:57.281 --> 00:31:01.420
of human rights and,
and a and labor violations and in relation to that,

530
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:07.050
that has really thrown some of our credibility into question.

531
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.660
And,
and so if we really want to get there,

532
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:14.800
if you want to still be seen as that strong,
vibrant,
uh,

533
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.630
ethical force in the world,

534
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.300
then we do have to get some of these other pieces in order.

535
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.210
So hopefully they'll see that as one in the same,

536
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.750
<v 1>we have a lot of good intentions as a nation.</v>

537
00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.550
We need to start actually acting on them.

538
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.320
<v 2>Yeah.
We've made some strides though.
Yeah.</v>

539
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.050
<v 1>Monica,
could you ask just cause there are people on on VC.
Yeah.</v>

540
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:39.570
<v 2>And what was the reasoning for missing eat for missing the first opportunity to,</v>

541
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.210
it was under the last government,
the Harper government.
So we,
and we,

542
00:31:44.211 --> 00:31:47.750
they did not sign the arms trade treaty when they had that opportunity.

543
00:31:47.751 --> 00:31:50.850
And in fact,
uh,
the domestic gun lobby and Canada,

544
00:31:50.851 --> 00:31:54.500
I did a pretty good job even though it has nothing to do with domestic gun

545
00:31:54.501 --> 00:31:59.450
ownership and they did a pretty good job of making people feel that it was,
um,

546
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:00.860
you know,
an effort.

547
00:32:00.861 --> 00:32:04.610
The NRA did the same in the United States and efforts to control,
uh,

548
00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.260
domestic arms sales and use.
Thank you.

549
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.660
It's like anything else with the arms industry,
there's a lot more um,

550
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.020
propaganda and irrational thinking out there on this subject.

551
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.080
Then there is fact,
I'm and honest appraisal

552
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.110
<v 1>and you have a very small number of interests both numerically and monetarily</v>

553
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:30.250
who seem to hold the entire agenda hostage.
And the u s the huge debate going on.

554
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.100
I think they may actually still be debating in Congress.

555
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:36.190
They had a filibuster all,
all night.
Um,

556
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.890
the majority of Americans support efforts like this,

557
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.050
the majority of Canadian support efforts like this,

558
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:46.040
but a tiny group of vested interests can block that legislation.

559
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.700
How important do you think political activism is on the part of individuals

560
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:53.570
writing to our members of parliament?
Writing to our senators,
writing to our,
our,

561
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:54.770
um,
Congress people.

562
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.810
<v 2>I think it's absolutely critical.
Uh,
uh,</v>

563
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.890
politicians are swayed by public opinion and

564
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.320
<v 1>strongly worded letters</v>

565
00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.620
<v 2>and navy and when it isn't concerned about reelection.</v>

566
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:11.621
So if you have enough people who are mounting an opposition to a particular

567
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:15.500
policy,
a particular point of view,
politicians are going to listen to that.

568
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:18.260
Part of the reason why the arms trade treaty didn't get signed is that there

569
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:22.860
simply wasn't enough public interest or concern or outcry,
um,

570
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.280
that we hadn't signed it yet.
And,
and that's a great shape.

571
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:28.100
And I think the same applies to the United States when you have the majority of

572
00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:31.100
Americans who are at least,
uh,
uh,

573
00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:36.101
committed to introducing certain aspects of gun control legislation around

574
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.910
particularly semiautomatic weapon weapons,
like the Ar 15,
um,

575
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.940
people who are on a terrorist watch list.
And they were talking about people,

576
00:33:43.941 --> 00:33:47.950
people who have a,
a very clear mental health history,
um,

577
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.610
that would be deemed to be high risk.
I mean,
that is,
that is a public

578
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.190
<v 1>safe on the terrorist.
No flight.</v>

579
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.630
<v 2>People on the terrorist,
no Phyliss can mean that is a public safety issue.</v>

580
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.540
And um,
and they,

581
00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:02.960
they are right to be shaming and embarrassing those legislators who cannot get

582
00:34:02.961 --> 00:34:06.380
behind what the majority of Americans want.

583
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.900
<v 1>Yeah.
And even here in Canada,
we had a,
uh,</v>

584
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:12.940
a member of parliament who was making the case Vr ar 15 is a perfectly safe

585
00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:17.200
device,
uh,
when handled properly.
So it was heroin.
So it was plutonium.

586
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.090
We only do you have that either.
Um,
and,

587
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.210
and also made the case that it's a great deer hunting weapon.

588
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:25.480
I've never seen anybody go hunting with him with an ar 15

589
00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:27.730
<v 2>and that's a great point.
And I would add to that too,
you know,</v>

590
00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:29.770
people will often say,
well,
if people want to kill each other,

591
00:34:29.771 --> 00:34:33.810
they're going to find a way.
Um,
and they will cite different,
different,
uh,

592
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.530
wars around the world in which,
you know,

593
00:34:35.531 --> 00:34:38.650
machetes were using other things too to a slaughter,

594
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.210
a hundreds of thousands of people.

595
00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:42.490
But the truth is that in almost every instance,

596
00:34:42.491 --> 00:34:46.870
it's having access to those small weapons that in fact also facilitated that,

597
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.010
that particular slaughter.

598
00:34:48.011 --> 00:34:52.450
Because usually it's people with arms that are able to then move the populations

599
00:34:52.451 --> 00:34:55.720
or control or prevent anybody who is trying to stop that from happening.

600
00:34:55.721 --> 00:34:57.450
So the two often go hand in hand

601
00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.760
<v 1>and the case we're making it easier isn't a good idea,
right?
No,
no.
Yeah.</v>

602
00:35:00.761 --> 00:35:01.780
They might find a way,

603
00:35:01.781 --> 00:35:06.550
but there's not a lot of kids who get killed by stray strangling.
Well,

604
00:35:06.551 --> 00:35:07.800
that's not,
that's not a thing.

605
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.490
<v 2>That's right.
And,
and you,
you know,
you have a much better chance of,
uh,</v>

606
00:35:12.491 --> 00:35:17.410
of being able to stop that person.
The more,
the more automatic that weapon is,

607
00:35:17.411 --> 00:35:20.260
the more violent that weapon is,
the greater the destruction.

608
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:25.520
<v 0>Excellent.
Any other audience questions or Dory questions?
Yeah.
Um,</v>

609
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:29.900
so here at Google we have employee resource groups of which the largest is a

610
00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:31.430
women at Google.
Uh,

611
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:35.780
there's a pretty strong chapter in our office led by Margot here.
Um,
and Nancy,

612
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:37.600
he's sitting right next to her.
Um,

613
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.220
so the first time that I saw you speak was at the WXN summit in November.

614
00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.720
You were the keynote at the awards gala that night,

615
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.750
and we were all just like in love with you after that.

616
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:52.410
We thought you had a lot of great perspective on life in general.

617
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:56.040
And what I loved about the way that you spoke was that it was not,
you know,

618
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.350
I'm speaking to the girls.
This is like among us girls,

619
00:35:58.351 --> 00:36:02.190
like you just had a great perspective in life in general.
Um,
that being said,

620
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:05.940
I think you had a lot to say about what it's like being in your role and going

621
00:36:05.941 --> 00:36:07.590
through your life,
being you,
being a woman,

622
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.450
and having some of the barriers that you did.

623
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:11.850
So I'd love if you could kind of talk about that for this group.

624
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.390
<v 2>Well thank you.
It's nice to see you again.
Look,
there's,</v>

625
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.090
there's no question that would be a woman.

626
00:36:18.091 --> 00:36:21.450
And doing this kind of work comes with its own set of challenges.

627
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.230
And I were in environments around the world where there's a tremendous amount
of,

628
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.130
of sexual violence,
a huge amount of harassment.
I mean,

629
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:33.960
I've personally experienced a great deal of that myself.
Um,
and,
and,

630
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.920
and risk and then trying to juggle everything I never used.

631
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:41.430
The word balance balance for me is always such a cliche because I,

632
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.600
without exaggeration,

633
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:46.500
wake up every day and deal with what's on fire and if I can put out those fires

634
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.510
that has a banner day for me.

635
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.760
So balance I think is something that is sort of a mythology.

636
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:54.710
It's where you find,

637
00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.570
you find balance where you find leprechauns and Rainbow Colored Unicorns,

638
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.640
I'm fabulous.
But uh,
you know,
so that it does come with,

639
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:05.640
with certain risks.
And,
and for me,

640
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.860
the only way that I've discovered too to contend with that is just to stare them

641
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:15.690
down,
you know,
to,
to get back up and to get back in there and,
uh,

642
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.600
and to persevere,
to defy.
And,

643
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:21.950
and I've been doing that my in my entire life,
you know,
and,

644
00:37:21.951 --> 00:37:24.770
and you get that from the time as a girl,
from the time that you're,
you know,

645
00:37:24.771 --> 00:37:27.630
you're this big,
right?
Girls can't play in the park.
Girls can't do this.

646
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:28.464
Girls can't do that.

647
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.840
What girls can do those things and girls are doing those things and we're going

648
00:37:31.841 --> 00:37:35.340
to show you that we can do the better.
Um,
and,
uh,
and,

649
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.510
and that's the message that I try to convey to young women all the time,

650
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:42.750
which is to,
um,
speak up,
to speak out,

651
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.370
to be undaunted two,
don't look for,
uh,

652
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.560
don't seek permissions in my,
in my opinion,

653
00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:53.670
permissions are only sought by those who lack imagination.
Um,
and,

654
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.670
and don't be afraid to,
to,
to screw up.

655
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.420
And don't worry so much about whether people like you,
you know,

656
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:04.530
I'm sure there's an entire fleet of people out there who can't stand me.

657
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:08.760
And,
uh,
I know there is because the fact I hear from the one Twitter quite often,

658
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.600
especially some of those Nra folks,
they love me.
Um,
and,

659
00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:19.440
and I think that,
you know,
we,
we don't hear enough.

660
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.410
I really women's voices.
Um,
and,

661
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.660
and we don't role model enough and we don't mentor that enough,
I think.
And,
uh,

662
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.780
and so for all of you here is women who are in the tech industry.

663
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:35.560
I think it's really incumbent on you to,
um,
to be out there and to,

664
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:39.540
to be talking about your experiences and to be getting other young women,
uh,

665
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.310
involved and to be defined those stereotypes.

666
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.870
Because when I first started in this work,
uh,

667
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.040
there were hardly any women going in and out of war zones.

668
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.780
There were hardly any of them,
you know,
was more,

669
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:53.170
was always seen as traditionally a male domain.

670
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:57.130
And now I'm astonished every time I walk into the office and we have so many

671
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:59.140
more women in our office than we do men.

672
00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:04.720
And they were definitely the visible minority in our office.
And,
uh,
and that's,

673
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.240
that's great.
You know,
that is great,

674
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.900
especially when you're talking about working with civilians in war zones that

675
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:15.510
usually the ones who are most impacted,
um,

676
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.210
by war are civilians,
primarily women and children.

677
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:22.210
So having women on the front lines of those conversations,

678
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.550
trying to do something about it is,

679
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.630
is critical to our success and to eventually eradicating the problem.

680
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.780
<v 1>Um,
you're in your book,</v>

681
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:38.520
in the intro you mentioned that you don't think that war is a,

682
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:42.990
uh,
part of the human condition and that there is hope after reading it and

683
00:39:42.991 --> 00:39:47.280
listening to your Ted Talk.
I'm just struck by how complicated these issues are.

684
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.630
What keeps you hopeful?

685
00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.500
<v 2>A couple of things.
Um,
but,
but I would say I don't fear that complexity.</v>

686
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.970
I think that part of it is,
um,

687
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.610
there aren't always easy fixes and easy answers and,

688
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.150
and we mislead people when we pretend that that isn't true

689
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.750
<v 1>despite what campaign promises</v>

690
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.680
<v 2>hi one campaign promises are out there.
Right.
Um,</v>

691
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.340
and I think that for all of us as,
as we move forward,

692
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:19.660
it is important to be more sophisticated around what works and what doesn't work

693
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:23.590
and,
and that it is complicated and it's time for us to embrace that complexity.

694
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:26.290
So that I would say sort of partly that.
But for me,

695
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:30.170
ultimately what I find most helpful is that we are,
um,

696
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:34.150
every day at war child in our office,
uh,
we have,

697
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.210
we are surrounded by people who are a testament to what can be done with a

698
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:47.170
compassion and some ingenuity,
some ingenuity and,

699
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.590
and concern and a sense of strong global citizenship.
You know,

700
00:40:50.591 --> 00:40:54.120
we hear from people who are in our programs,
uh,

701
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.350
where it really has changed their lives.

702
00:40:56.351 --> 00:41:01.270
We hear from staff who run those programs,
who helped build those programs,
uh,

703
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:05.170
just how important our work is to their community and how,

704
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:09.390
how respected they feel and how engaged they feel.
Um,

705
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.910
and,
and that ours is a true partnership.
You know,

706
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.580
that we're not coming in and telling them what to do,

707
00:41:15.581 --> 00:41:19.480
but we're asking them what they want to do,
um,
and,
and that,

708
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.580
that they feel valued in that process.

709
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:26.020
And so whenever I find myself extremely frustrated,
which,
which is often,

710
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.760
and it's never about the things that you would expect,

711
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:29.770
I mean we're dealing with security situations all the time,

712
00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:30.700
which are very frustrating,

713
00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:34.910
but it's often seeing a fantastic program like the one we have in eastern Congo

714
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.560
that survives on,

715
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:41.120
on fuse because it's so hard to mobilize public interest for that war.

716
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:45.470
Now that it's almost 20 years old,
uh,
despite how devastating it has been.

717
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:49.220
That's the stuff that keeps me up at night.
Um,
but,

718
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:54.140
but I get up and I pushed through that sense of cynicism and,
and frustration.

719
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.890
Um,
because people depend on us and it seems very,

720
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:01.430
it always has seemed very self indulgent to me to say,
Oh,

721
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:04.160
this work is exhausting and I want to do it anymore.
I mean,

722
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.750
we've got people around the world that,
that gets shot at on their way to work,

723
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.570
whose children can't go more than two blocks because there'll be raped.
Um,

724
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.880
in South Sudan where all of our,
our,

725
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:19.830
our staff and program partners had to flee to the refugee camps.
Um,

726
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.230
and within two days of them arriving at the refugee camps,
they say,

727
00:42:22.231 --> 00:42:24.380
we're going to keep going.
And we went,
well,
hang on a second.

728
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:26.090
We're still trying to figure out where the stuff is.

729
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:28.520
The whole office has been burned and torched.
And later they're like,
no,
no,

730
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:31.220
we're here now.
We're going to go.
Um,
and,

731
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:36.250
and that is extraordinary and it's breathtaking when you experience it and,

732
00:42:37.671 --> 00:42:39.910
um,
and it,
and it,
you know,

733
00:42:39.911 --> 00:42:44.360
it makes me really hopeful and,
uh,

734
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.010
and that's why I get up every day.

735
00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:50.620
<v 1>That's fantastic.
Um,
Vera,
how are we doing for time?</v>

736
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.283
<v 5>MMM.</v>

737
00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.360
<v 1>Okay.
Excellent.
So in that case,
um,</v>

738
00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.060
I'm going to leave it on that.
Uh,
everyone here.
Um,

739
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.700
I encourage you to take a Samantha's a request.
Seriously.

740
00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:09.820
We have a I'd donation matching program at Google.

741
00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.370
You can set it up so that part of your,

742
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.050
every single paycheck goes to an organization like war child to help in conflict

743
00:43:17.051 --> 00:43:19.990
zones that people may have forgotten about,
that they're no longer,

744
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.720
no longer in the headlines.
Right?
Right.
Though,

745
00:43:22.721 --> 00:43:25.810
strongly worded letters to your members of parliament,
um,

746
00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.670
try to make that difference.
Uh,
and we have some books I think at the back,

747
00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:33.310
um,
uh damn nations.
Fantastic.

748
00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:37.420
A fantastic read and definitely check out the Ted talk as well on ted.com.

749
00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.310
Thanks everyone.
Thank you.
Yeah.
