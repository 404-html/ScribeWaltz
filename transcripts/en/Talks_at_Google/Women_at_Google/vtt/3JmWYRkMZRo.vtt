1
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.823
Yeah.

2
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.720
Mama was drunk most of the year.

3
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.453
<v 1>God,</v>

4
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.180
<v 0>no,
it ain't right.</v>

5
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.910
And then

6
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.270
let them money.

7
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.643
Wayne

8
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.513
<v 1>goes</v>

9
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.783
by,

10
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.390
<v 0>okay,
have your medicine,</v>

11
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.240
can't get no child.
Kid.

12
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.923
<v 1>Ah,</v>

13
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.803
<v 0>Wayne</v>

14
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.420
<v 1>goes on and
on and on.</v>

15
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

16
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.340
<v 0>How are we an do you know?</v>

17
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.253
<v 3>Mm.</v>

18
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.130
<v 2>So,
so,
so the imagery and that is,
is,
is sort of a walkthrough,
um,</v>

19
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.250
to an extent the,
the,
the parts of the world that,
that I was in,
um,

20
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.530
in the putting together of this book.
Um,
and that those parts of the world,

21
00:03:57.531 --> 00:04:01.310
we're also historical as well as geographical.
Um,
the last book I wrote,

22
00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:04.610
all the president's bankers was very much,
um,
historical.

23
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:08.900
It went through the last century and a bit of the relationship of presidents in

24
00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:12.410
both parties and the bankers and just sort of what the actual personal

25
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:17.000
relationships were and how they were interacting before various types of world

26
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:20.990
events,
wars policies and so forth.
And this was kind of that.

27
00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:25.200
But from just the 10 years since the financial crisis of 2008,
um,

28
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.640
and in rather going back to the history of one country,

29
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:33.350
I sort of expanded it to what's happening globally since the financial crisis.

30
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.570
Um,
and to get to the punchline first,

31
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.770
because I also want you to feel like you can interrupt me and ask questions.

32
00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:43.070
I know I'm here to speak to you.
Um,
but you're,
you know,

33
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:45.140
sort of a very informed group.

34
00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:50.141
And so I think that if I say something that's either troubling or confusing or

35
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:52.410
you want me to expand or whatever it might be just,
you know,

36
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.220
shout out cause I think that that will be a good thing.
Um,
but anyways,
so I,

37
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:59.390
I divide my book into the regions of,

38
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:04.391
of the world that were either involved in or affected or impacted by the

39
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:08.630
financial crisis and then sort of how they've acted differently since then.

40
00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:12.750
And I talk about collusion.
It's not about Russia,
it's not about politics.
Um,

41
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.870
well everything is ultimately about money in politics.

42
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:16.160
But that's not the point of the book.

43
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.880
The point of the book is to look at what the main central banks in the world

44
00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:23.660
have done in a sort of unprecedented way since the financial crisis,

45
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:28.010
to artificially kind of stimulate the financial system,
the banks,

46
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:32.230
and subsequently the markets.
Um,
in a way that's been very,
um,

47
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.250
historically epic in terms of size,

48
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:39.251
but also in terms of just their unlimited capabilities in terms of the amounts

49
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:42.450
that they've created in terms of not being able to know auditing.
No,

50
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.390
no sort of information going in and out as to where that money actually goes.
Um,

51
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.270
and so what I did was I didn't have a chapter on the Federal Reserve,

52
00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:52.190
which I'll talk about in a bit more in a second,

53
00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:54.510
which is kind of the central character.
Um,

54
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.920
if we look at central banks is just sort of characters the world and the

55
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:01.760
individuals that run them as just the characters that are part of those scenes.

56
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.270
Um,

57
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.620
I took 2008 is the beginning of each chapter in each region and I always started

58
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:10.400
there and then looked at how that region was impacted.
So I go to Mexico,

59
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.670
to Brazil,
to China,
to Japan and throughout Europe.

60
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:16.070
And each time I sort of go back to the beginning and say,
okay,

61
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:19.490
well this is the perspective of what happened between the Federal Reserve,

62
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.040
the United States in this area.
Um,
and this is how the fallout,
um,

63
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.860
occurred or this is how they expanded but not really.
Um,

64
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.940
and my general theme is that having had an unprecedented amount of money being

65
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:32.300
thrown into the system,

66
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:36.830
sort of fabricated or manufacturer or are conjured by the central banks has

67
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.710
really distorted,
um,
the idea of value.
It's,

68
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.670
it's even distorted the idea of where I'll companies who actually,
um,
you know,

69
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.810
sort of show their profits and losses based on actual cash,
um,

70
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.910
actual revenues and so forth that aren't artificially stimulated by money coming

71
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:54.780
in from an outside source are,

72
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:59.600
are sort of operating in a world in which they're also ones that are.

73
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.850
And so in terms of just the graph of that,

74
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:06.320
I wasn't again going to do slides cause I tend to,
um,
I can just write on this.

75
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.341
Um,
so the,

76
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:11.780
so the way that looks and if anyone wants me to just mention what a central bank

77
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.780
is,
well,
making sure of these,
right.
Um,

78
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.410
does everybody know what a central bank is?
Okay.
So,
so,

79
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:23.240
so basically the central bank and the Fed in particular here,
um,
was designed,

80
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.100
um,
usually designed to provide emergency capital in the event that the financial

81
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:30.050
system can produce it for itself.

82
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.810
It's going to create a bigger crisis for the rest of the economy.

83
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.580
There needs to be,
um,
a particular reaction to say a war or like,
you know,

84
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:41.420
interplanetary aliens coming or something like that.
And that the,
the,

85
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.950
the reality is that they have clauses in their mandates that are emergency

86
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:49.400
clauses to be able to do this.
So it's all quite legal.
Um,

87
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:53.390
and I'm not advocating that the collusion of central banks is something that's

88
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.280
illegal.
I do get asked that question,

89
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.200
but it is something that's to an extent deceitful,
um,

90
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.750
because by having a large supply of artificial money that has no limitation in

91
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:07.410
terms of when and how it can be fabricated as it has been the last 10 years,
it,

92
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.490
that distortion thing,
um,
does create a level of deceit.

93
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:13.520
So one of the things that happened since the financial crisis,

94
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.410
I'm bad at drawing but I'm just going to,

95
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.510
this is 2008 and this is now and um,

96
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.770
I have this on my Twitter,
uh,
this,
this particular graph,

97
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:27.620
but I thought it was cool because it was three lines.
Um,

98
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.160
one was the Federal Reserve and how much money when it dumped it into the
system.

99
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.050
Um,
one is the Central Bank of Japan and one is the European Central Bank because

100
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:38.390
the idea of this collusion is that the major countries,

101
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:43.280
central banks have also adopted a cheap money policy and a quantitative easing

102
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:46.040
or buying securities policy,
buying bonds,

103
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:49.970
buying ETFs are buying stocks if you're in Japan by corporate bonds,

104
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:52.650
if you're in Europe where they've been able to fabricate money and,

105
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.550
and decide where effectively they want to invest it,

106
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:59.820
but they'd go through a financial system and that has an impact on the market.

107
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.340
So the Fed kind of started this 2008 and,
and,
and sort of,

108
00:09:04.341 --> 00:09:07.820
they did some sort of a taper in terms of this,

109
00:09:07.821 --> 00:09:12.821
this line represents the amount of money they conjured since the 2008 period to

110
00:09:13.451 --> 00:09:16.480
buy.
Um,
in the case of the United States treasury bonds,

111
00:09:16.481 --> 00:09:20.810
government bonds and mortgage bonds from,
from the paging system.
Um,

112
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.190
and so this is kind of 2015

113
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.770
and though they haven't,
this isn't really,
only has a tiny line down.
Um,
no,

114
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.070
they haven't continued here.
Um,
they did,

115
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.500
they have a pretty high value,

116
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.560
four and a half trillion dollars of what I consider to be subsidies for the

117
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:44.430
banking system in the market because they're really coming out of the sort of

118
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:48.210
the electronic,
um,
uh,
activities of the Fed.

119
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.650
So this is the Fed line.
Colors don't mean anything by the way.

120
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.610
I'm just randomly picking colors.
Um,

121
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.300
then the European central bank kind of came in and did something similar except

122
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:07.950
that they were kind of here and then they kind of did that.

123
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.080
Right.
So this is the European Central Bank.
Um,

124
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.400
this is kind of 2012 where my,

125
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.870
my bad geometrics is such that they kind of accelerated their process of being

126
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.020
involved in quantitative easing,
um,

127
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.470
by a lot when there was a credit crisis in Europe.

128
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:30.600
So the minute there wasn't enough money in Europe,

129
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.640
they thought they had recovered.
They really hadn't.

130
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.750
They were still adopting the policy are colluding with the Fed to produce money

131
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:39.630
in the system.
They,
uh,
they kind of accelerated.

132
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.460
And in this period of time where the,
the Fed sort of stopped putting as much in,

133
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.590
they've accelerated even further.

134
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:51.591
So now they're around that five and a half trillion.

135
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.630
And then the Bank of Japan,

136
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:58.170
which was the bank that actually created quantitative easing to begin with,

137
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:02.220
they came up in 2001 of this idea that if they produced money into the system,

138
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.670
because they're banks were basically,
uh,

139
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.220
undergoing a collapse in the beginning of the two thousands that they would have

140
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:11.280
a way to,
to help them.
And they did produce money.

141
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.460
They did engage in quantitative easing because it's really,
really tiny.

142
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.940
So I talk about in my Japan chapter how Ben Bernanki,

143
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:21.190
who was the chair of the Fed when all this kind of started,
um,

144
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.200
goes in front of Congress and talks about how what we're doing is not what the

145
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:28.800
Japanese are doing.
It's really different.
Um,
we're doing it for other purposes,

146
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:32.410
but the reality is that the mechanisms are the same.
They're producing,
um,

147
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.600
money in order to increase the money supply in order to then decide where it

148
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.780
goes into the banking system,
into corporations who then borrow it,

149
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.950
which then goes into the stock market or other,
other financial assets.
So,

150
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:45.930
so the Bank of Japan was kind of also,

151
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.510
I'm here and then in about 2013 they did that.

152
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.340
So

153
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.030
<v 4>really right,
they did that.</v>

154
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.020
<v 2>So there are around it like 5 trillion right now.</v>

155
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.953
<v 4>MMM.</v>

156
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.870
<v 2>And basically the reason they sort of had an acceleration in about 2013,</v>

157
00:12:06.871 --> 00:12:11.871
2014 is because from an economic perspective,

158
00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:16.830
having watched all of this happen,
um,
the prime minister of the,
the,

159
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:18.000
the head of Japan,

160
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.090
Shinzo lobby decided that we should be doing the same thing or being,

161
00:12:21.091 --> 00:12:22.560
doing more so that in Japan.

162
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.160
And so the head of the central bank now in Japan,

163
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.850
Kuroda,
this is Mario Draghi

164
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.350
currently this now at the Fed,
you know,

165
00:12:33.351 --> 00:12:36.680
through different periods is Jerome Powell.
But there's been three different,
uh,

166
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.400
fed heads,
two different Japanese heads and,

167
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.680
and two different European heads over this time period.
Um,

168
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:47.090
they've all kind of engaged in the same process.
And as a result,
there was about,

169
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.253
<v 4>mmm,</v>

170
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.710
<v 2>well this is 15 trillion.
But when you,</v>

171
00:12:51.711 --> 00:12:54.830
when you aggregate all of these numbers and you aggregate all of this graph,

172
00:12:54.831 --> 00:12:58.070
the level of money that's continuing to be crop conjured and dumped into the

173
00:12:58.071 --> 00:13:02.900
system is going up.
So when you hear in the news that the Fed is tapering,

174
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.501
that they're,

175
00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:08.330
that they're doing this and that somehow as a reflection of their experiments

176
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:12.410
and quantitative easing and cheap money succeeding,
you have to understand,

177
00:13:12.411 --> 00:13:17.150
and this is the,
the collusive efforts involved,
that collectively the world is,

178
00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:20.150
is increasing their amount of quantitative easing.

179
00:13:20.151 --> 00:13:22.610
It's just happening in different countries for different reasons.

180
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.370
And in the European Central Bank realm,

181
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.600
it's being dumped into corporates.
For the most part,
in Japan,

182
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:32.030
it's a combination of government bonds and stocks.

183
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.750
And in the U S it's kind of stopped.

184
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.160
It was a combination of government bonds and mortgage bonds.

185
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:41.360
So it was always going into the place that needed the most help.
But,

186
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:46.320
but the say corporations in the,
in,
in Europe that needed that help,
um,

187
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.310
we're receiving it basically without giving very much in return.

188
00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:51.680
The European Central Bank would decide,
well,

189
00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:54.950
we're going to give money to this particular company in Germany versus these

190
00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:57.080
particular companies in Greece.
And that was a,

191
00:13:57.081 --> 00:14:00.110
that was in a lot of ways a political decision,

192
00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:02.450
but the monetary elements of that,
um,

193
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.680
enabled certain countries and certain companies and certain stocks to go higher

194
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.310
simply because there was an outside artificial source,
um,
to,

195
00:14:10.311 --> 00:14:11.360
to push things higher.

196
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.410
And so when I started going around the world and sort of examining what,

197
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.340
what the real actors were doing throughout this period,

198
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:22.520
this is just kind of the summary and the summary again,
looks like this,

199
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.823
<v 4>uh,</v>

200
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.900
<v 2>right from like a half a trillion.</v>

201
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.833
<v 4>MMM.</v>

202
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.250
<v 2>There's a picture that starts to be developed and that's that the,</v>

203
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:39.050
the ones that had the ability to produce money,

204
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.750
did their markets have risen more substantially?

205
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.410
There has been more sort of speculation outside of those markets because once

206
00:14:45.411 --> 00:14:48.590
they go up,
where else do you go?
Capital flows out.
It goes to Mexico scope.

207
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.890
And so forth.
But in those of countries,

208
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.430
there's less than an ability and they didn't choose necessarily to get involved

209
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:56.540
in quantitative easing.

210
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.130
So there was an entire sort of political ramification that doesn't really get

211
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.310
discussed behind just the value of money and the amount of quantitative easing

212
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:07.970
that these major central banks are doing that actually has changed kind of the

213
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:09.380
shape of the world.
Um,

214
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:14.240
so the first country I go to in collusion is actually Mexico.

215
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.730
Um,
and,
and the reason I did that,

216
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:21.020
so I spent a lot of time working with companies in Mexico and stuff.
Um,

217
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.130
but that basically the Mexican government and the individuals who were really

218
00:15:25.131 --> 00:15:29.360
involved in the period from the 2008 to 2018 that were running the central bank

219
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.150
in Mexico had real strong opinions about what the Fed was doing.

220
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.270
And a lot of countries had strong opinions about the Fed was doing it because to

221
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:38.000
an extent,
it's just not fair.
It's not really capitalism,

222
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:41.240
it's not really free markets.
It's kind of like,
you know,

223
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:45.710
a subsidy for the financial system that then has major ramifications of creating

224
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:49.760
an artificial system.
And that can go terribly wrong very quickly.
Um,

225
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.080
if it gets taken away,

226
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:54.080
which is why it's not being taken away and there's ramifications to that.

227
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.460
So what Mexico decided in 2008 and their economy is actually doing fine.

228
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.680
Um,
the crisis happens north of the border in the beginning.
They say,
well,

229
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:05.000
it doesn't really affect us.

230
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.180
It's a financial crisis is contained in the bank's feds taking care of it.

231
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:09.770
But then it starts to become apparent very,

232
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:11.690
very quickly that that's not the case.

233
00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:14.090
That if there's a recession in the states or if there's a depression in the

234
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:17.990
states or the financing closes up and there's no credit going throughout the

235
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:22.090
system,
it impacts everyone.
So the head of the Central Bank of Mexico,

236
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:25.580
a guy named [inaudible],
he went to Washington,

237
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.950
is part of the establishment needs,

238
00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:31.951
sort of floated in the sort of economic ideas of the Fed governors and so forth.

239
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:36.270
It goes up to Washington and he says to Ben Bernanki,
look,
we've,

240
00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:38.810
we've seen this movie,
we know how it ends.
It doesn't end well.

241
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.650
We have the Tequila crisis.
In 94,
we restructured our banking system.

242
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.860
Smaller banks got eaten up,
people got thrown out of jobs,
companies close.

243
00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:48.650
It took us a really long time to recover.

244
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.630
And more than just the economic problems of recovery are people lost confidence

245
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:56.390
in the system.
And they are that that manifested in,

246
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.260
in lots of crowds in the streets.
But the point was,
um,

247
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:04.070
if you simply create money to simply help the financial system to help the

248
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:08.030
banks,
it's,
it's not really stable capital.

249
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:12.050
It's not really ultimately going to work.
Um,
there will be bubbles,

250
00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:16.100
there will be problems.
And Ben Bernanki says thanks.

251
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.730
Doesn't cover or tease in his memoirs at all.
Um,

252
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.540
even though this meeting was covered by the Wall Street Journal was public and

253
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:27.560
he basically goes about and sort of manufacturing this,
this,
uh,

254
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.060
emergency quantitative easing mount,
and then has the whole world join it.

255
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.830
Why does a whole world join in?

256
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.300
Or why did the major countries join into any quantitative easing movement?
Um,

257
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.450
because if you have capital in the u s and money's made very cheap,

258
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:44.061
so it's,

259
00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:47.660
it's more liquid to the financial system so they can so sort out the stuff they

260
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:49.070
did.
Um,

261
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.710
and rates are higher elsewhere in particular in the main countries in which

262
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:55.950
there's with which there's trade or with which the banks have relationships,

263
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.150
then the money's going to leave.

264
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.420
And so the only way to sort of keep the dollar strong enough and keep the money

265
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:02.250
in the u s is to have the export,

266
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:06.870
the same method to the countries that have the largest relationships.

267
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.740
So something like Mexico has to also deal with its own economy.

268
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.070
So if it reduces rates by too much,

269
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.600
that will cause inflation in the economy because it's,

270
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.540
it has a more direct impact on actual people in,

271
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:25.270
on actual prices because it's a smaller economy to begin with.
Um,

272
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.300
and it's reliant on other economies for its trade,
buy,
buy more so,
so,

273
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.890
or tears didn't want to reduce rates like the Fed was doing very quickly and

274
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:39.480
they couldn't produce money electronically to buy securities in Mexico.

275
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.020
They didn't have the same capacity.
Um,
and so they didn't,
so he didn't,

276
00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:45.570
he went about criticizing the u s as a result,

277
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:49.560
he sort of lost his job or he didn't get reappointed to be the head of the

278
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:53.110
Central Bank of Mexico and the subsequent appointee.
I'm Amanda,

279
00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:55.170
I'm Augustine Carstons who,
um,

280
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.290
also sort of was in the same group as the people running the Fed treasury

281
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:03.390
department and so forth came in and he at first said,
okay,

282
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:05.850
I'll do what the Fed's going to do a reduce rates.

283
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.350
I'll keep it sort of stable between the border of Mexico and the U s I'll follow

284
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:10.741
along.

285
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:14.670
He used to go public about the fact that this evening was going to help the real

286
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:18.030
economy ultimately will trickle out of the banking system and out of the markets

287
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.330
and it'll help sort of real growth and longterm growth in wages and everything

288
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:24.240
else.
Um,
and that's what he said originally.
That's Kinda how he,

289
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.030
he got that job and have that Jeff for a while in this period.
But,

290
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:32.031
but the reality was they didn't do that and he started feeling the political

291
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:38.670
pressure in Mexico of the fact that Mexico wasn't really getting any of this

292
00:19:38.671 --> 00:19:41.610
money into their economy and it was very,
very obvious.
Um,

293
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.540
and so he started criticizing the Fed and everything else and he ultimately

294
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.810
resigned before the end of his term last year.

295
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.380
And he's now the head of the Bank of international settlements,

296
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.580
which is the Central Bank of central banks that does reporting and all of these

297
00:19:56.581 --> 00:20:01.470
activities and always used to support the Fed,
the IMF,
the World Bank,

298
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.300
the ECB when it came into being as doing the right thing by their economies,

299
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:07.980
by employment versus inflation,

300
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:10.350
which is one of their mandates by helping their system.

301
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:15.950
And it was created basically as a sort of unified u s Europe kind of entity to

302
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:17.970
begin with.

303
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.050
It's starting to have real critiques and the fact that it is now run by someone

304
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:26.610
who bought then kind of sold the policy of the United States and is now at the

305
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:30.360
head of that institution really shows a shift in general in the world in terms

306
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:32.580
of how it looks at what the end game of this could be,

307
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.660
how risky it could be for the rest of the world.
Um,

308
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.120
and it's just simply questioning how long this can go on.
Um,

309
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:40.800
so that's been one shift and other shift.

310
00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:45.020
It's a longer story I won't get into it is in Brazil because that has,
it's,

311
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.960
it's so many of its own sort of pieces of corruption and scandals and government

312
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:51.160
overthrows and so forth.

313
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.960
But one of the people who's currently running for the presidency of Brazil,

314
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.590
um,
as a man named Rick Murray Alyth,

315
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.030
I pronounced it because for some reason my Portuguese is very bad.
I was,

316
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:07.150
I was corrected last night actually in Berkeley about my pronunciation of his

317
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:11.320
name,
but he was someone who was head of the Central Bank of Brazil when this all

318
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:14.950
started,
when,
when the crisis all started happening,
um,
and he,

319
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:19.720
and the president of Brazil at the time,
a Lula who is now in jail,
was,

320
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:23.560
um,
at first saying,
Brazil's not going to be impacted by the crisis,

321
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:26.560
same way Mexico said it wasn't going to be until they were very shortly

322
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:30.880
thereafter.
Um,
and he wanted to do with the u s want was doing,

323
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.810
um,

324
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:36.640
the party in power who became empower the Workers Party,
uh,

325
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:38.590
headed by a woman named Dilma.
Rousseff said,
no,

326
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:41.740
we want to maintain help for Brazil.
Um,
he says,

327
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:43.570
we want to do with the u s that he'd lose it.
He doesn't get,

328
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.000
he doesn't get appointed to be the central bank.

329
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.830
Later he goes back into the private sector,

330
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:52.480
he winds up being the minister of Finance,
um,
when her government was overthrown.

331
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:56.490
And so he's basically gone from being a central banker,
uh,

332
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.220
to private sector to being a minister of finance.

333
00:22:00.221 --> 00:22:04.250
And now he's running for president in the meantime,
Brazil,
uh,

334
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.230
during that period,

335
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:10.000
and this is just where politics meets monetary policy has basically reduced its

336
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:14.140
rates from,
this is a completely separate graph.
This doesn't count on that graph.

337
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:18.440
They reduce their rates from 14 and a half percent to six and a half percent.
Um,

338
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.350
in a very short period of time.

339
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:23.410
Mexico has raised its rates from three and a half percent

340
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.390
to seven and a half percent in the last few years as well.

341
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:30.730
So they've gone independent of the Fed,

342
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:34.140
they've gone sort of dependent on the Fed.
Um,
and,
and,

343
00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:37.360
and that really manifests into political relationships if you're an investor.

344
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.080
It actually also manifests into figuring out why this has happened because it's

345
00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:45.700
very unique that actually Mexico as higher,
uh,
rates then,
then Brazil.

346
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.330
Um,
so,
so,
so there was a lot of shakeout as well,
photo,

347
00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:53.200
a monetary policy perspective where government bonds are trading,

348
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:55.020
where stocks are trading and,

349
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.810
and who shifting in the sort of power relationships of,
of central banks.

350
00:22:58.811 --> 00:23:02.920
And also the government is now central banks is supposed to be independent of

351
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:05.950
governments.
That's how they are mandated.

352
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:10.951
So supposedly the Federal Reserve is independent of whatever the u s government

353
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:15.460
wants to do.
The Bank of Japan is,
is independent.
Um,
and there's a lot of,

354
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.410
I went through a lot of documentation.

355
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:20.560
I have this team of researchers around the world who new languages that I didn't

356
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:23.350
know.
And so we're,
we're,
we're looking at real sort of,
um,

357
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.630
media and publications at the time,

358
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:28.720
real documents and research information that was coming from the central banks

359
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:32.410
themselves.
Um,
and,
and,
and,
and it was interesting to me was a lot of,
um,

360
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.310
both criticism of what was happening on the outside and trying to figure out if

361
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:39.880
they should adopt it on the inside.
Um,
which is part of where,
um,

362
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.870
where there's a lot of tension and still tension in the world.
Um,

363
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.410
but China,
which is the middle of the book,

364
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:54.730
is a place that has grown in its super powerness from an economic perspective

365
00:23:55.251 --> 00:23:57.470
and also its relationships with other countries.

366
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.110
And one of the reasons it doesn't get talked about,
um,

367
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.050
is that it shows to criticize very vocally,

368
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.850
um,
the monetary policy,
the United States,
um,
because of this,

369
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:14.750
this whole creation of money policy.
Now it has created money as well,

370
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.490
but it chooses to do it outside of sort of the main g seven groups.
Um,

371
00:24:18.491 --> 00:24:21.380
and it does it for different purposes and you'd probably know this here.

372
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.090
I mean it does it for building infrastructure,

373
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:27.380
for prepaying for technology and R and D and individuals and also for trade

374
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:31.670
alliances with other countries in that region with Mexico,

375
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:35.930
with Brazil,
in order to establish itself as,
as a sort of more,
um,

376
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.280
both from a trade perspective and a monetary perspective.
Um,
superpower.

377
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.580
The reason that all started to happen in 2008 2009 is because it had essentially

378
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.010
the central bank in China that at the People's Bank of China,
um,

379
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.100
got very public with his criticism of the Fed.
Ultimately the Chinese currency,

380
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:59.840
the Ren was accepted into the IMF special drawing rights basket,

381
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:03.290
which is the sort of representation of the main currencies that had always been

382
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:04.730
the dollar and the euro,

383
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.750
which had before that been the German mark and the French franc,
um,

384
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.400
and the Japanese yen and the British pound.
And in,
in,
in this period of time,

385
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.200
the Chinese currency,

386
00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:19.580
the renting became part of this basket because even the IMF that had been

387
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:24.581
established to really work on the reserve currencies of the dollar and the euro

388
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:25.630
mainly,
um,

389
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.850
was beginning to criticize whether all this money being dumped in the system

390
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:32.240
when it is retracted or when rates rise or when something goes wrong with all

391
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:34.430
the debt that's been created on the back of it,
um,

392
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.550
causes problems throughout the developing world.

393
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.900
Root causes problems within the U S so they've been very critical of late as

394
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:45.440
well.
Um,
but China has been able to utilize that,
um,

395
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.060
in order to really become and create more trade agreements and more currency

396
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:52.640
arrangements,
um,
and also develop their,

397
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.670
their alliances in their own companies within China.

398
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:58.820
That's what they've been doing with that money.
We really haven't been,

399
00:25:58.821 --> 00:26:02.600
we've been,
I'm just,
just as a sort of super power,
this money,

400
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:06.320
it's predominantly gone into financial speculation into the markets that hasn't

401
00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:09.880
been dedicated to,
um,
instead of building a railway or,

402
00:26:09.881 --> 00:26:12.090
or building a canal or,
or,

403
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.530
or anything like that or lending to other countries in order for them to be able

404
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:18.710
to do that because they're partners and that strengthens them.
Therefore,

405
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.780
the trade relationship,
we,

406
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.690
we've really gone sort of off the rails relative to that.

407
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:26.910
That's not to say China doesn't have problems,
it's just to say that,
um,

408
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.820
in this period of time,

409
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.180
money's been created here and in Europe and in Japan for an and to a lesser

410
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:38.090
extent,
um,
in the UK for different reason.

411
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.800
And that reason has been more of a financial reason and not so much as a long

412
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.560
term economic stability,
a reason as it has an Asia.

413
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.660
I talked a little bit about Europe and,
um,

414
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.920
I was sort of the last chapter of the book,
but one of the man of,

415
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.080
one of the things that's come out of the CBS policy,
um,

416
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.800
aside from the fact that there was criticism from certain countries like Germany

417
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:02.040
against the CB,
because they're like,
our country is fine.
We have savers,

418
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:04.860
we're developing,
we don't need this whole easing thing.

419
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:07.980
We don't want to be concerned about bubbles bursting.
Um,

420
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.310
is that the sort of southern part of Europe,
Greece,
Italy,
Spain,

421
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:13.540
and so forth happened how the benefits,
um,

422
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.570
of the same amount of money being put in.

423
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:20.571
So when there's a lot of money that's put in in one part of the market and it's

424
00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:24.230
not sort of divided or,
or,
or,

425
00:27:24.231 --> 00:27:27.180
or even selected or chosen to be putting other parts of the market,

426
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:29.910
it creates inequalities and volatility and instability.

427
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.480
So what we've seen in the last few months in,
and even our stock market is,

428
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.780
is the sort of beginning of

429
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.260
more volatility coming into the market,

430
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:44.520
more sort of default and delinquencies coming into some of the corporate bonds

431
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:45.820
that were,
um,

432
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.040
issue because money was so cheap and therefore repaying the debt was so low.
Um,

433
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.370
but the debt payments we'll get higher.
Um,

434
00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:56.640
and also money coming out of the stock market to make debt payments and then

435
00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:59.980
separately buy backs,
which,
which keep the level of the market up.

436
00:27:59.981 --> 00:28:03.300
So you have these two sort of competing forces of capital,
um,

437
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:08.030
that are creating more volatility.
Now you have cheap money still available.
Um,

438
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.510
you have a lot of buy back,
some,

439
00:28:09.511 --> 00:28:12.780
some from companies that have cash and some from companies that have received

440
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:14.610
cash.
Um,
but nonetheless,

441
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:18.900
and then you also have cracks in the system from both the rumors that are in the

442
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:23.280
market as to whether or not this can stop anytime any of these central bank

443
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:27.060
leaders talk about the possibility of it stopping the markets tend to get
really,

444
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:30.390
really upset.
And then the next meeting there's like,
oh,
we didn't really mean it.

445
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:33.920
There isn't really inflation.
There's a really growth,
we're going to stop.
Um,

446
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.040
which is what he does a lot.
I mean,
they all do it,
but,
um,
it,

447
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.840
it's interesting because even even the Japanese,
um,

448
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.770
last week had a meeting the Bank of Japan and they came out and they said,
well,

449
00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:46.840
we're going to probably have to keep doing this like forever.
Um,

450
00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:51.120
they use the term unlimited.
Uh,
Mario Draghi said the same thing.
Um,

451
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.150
the week and a half ago when the European Central Bank came out and said,
yes,

452
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:55.920
we're keeping rates at negative.
Um,

453
00:28:55.921 --> 00:28:58.790
and we're also going to continue our quantitative easing programs.

454
00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:01.560
So these lines up the Fed is kind of,
yes,

455
00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.480
<v 5>it's a big question.
That limit,</v>

456
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.320
is there really an alternative to printing all this money?

457
00:29:06.321 --> 00:29:09.170
Because if you look at the rate of debt creation over the past 30,

458
00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:10.640
almost 40 years,
you know,

459
00:29:10.641 --> 00:29:14.600
debt growth has exceeded GDP growth almost that entire time through our

460
00:29:14.601 --> 00:29:17.780
projections that somebody,
public pensions will be insolvent.

461
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.210
That there's no like,
mathematical way to make that possible.

462
00:29:20.211 --> 00:29:24.590
So is is unlimited money printing just the easiest way to kind of like softly

463
00:29:24.591 --> 00:29:28.070
default on that rather than causing some catastrophic collapse?
Yeah,

464
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.430
<v 2>well we're all pushing in the,
or having to worry about a solution to it.
I mean,</v>

465
00:29:31.431 --> 00:29:35.240
yes,
that has increased over the last 30,
40 years relative to GDP,
but it's,

466
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.780
it's accelerated by a lot.
It's increased because it's,

467
00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:42.760
it's had this sort of plaster over.
So if the system which kind of started this,

468
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.700
this,
um,
in,
in 2008 was on the brink of,
of what it said to be collapsed,

469
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:50.560
there are different ways that that could have been addressed.

470
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:55.561
One way would have been to let one or two extra banks collapsed and that really

471
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:58.930
sounded harsh at the time.
Um,
but you know,

472
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:01.720
throughout Wall Street banks have collapsed.
I mean,
it's,

473
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:05.080
it's not like that that hadn't happened and the problem was there was so much

474
00:30:05.081 --> 00:30:09.340
attention focused on whether that was going to create a massive depression going

475
00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:12.850
forward that there was no conversation or very limited conversation in

476
00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:17.830
Washington as to doing something else.
Um,
I'm sure very Matthew that the reality,

477
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:20.590
I'll just go back for like one little explanation of,

478
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:25.480
of how I saw that was at the time of the 2008 financial crisis.

479
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.110
Um,
there was,
there was,
um,

480
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.030
which was predicated on a mortgage bonds and all the derivatives associated with

481
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:35.530
them and all the credit and insurance that was traded between banks and all
that.

482
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:36.580
Um,

483
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.720
there was only like a half a trillion dollars worth of upset subprime mortgages

484
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.490
in the market at the time and half a trillion,
right?
Um,

485
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.660
there was $14 trillion worth of toxic assets of acids that we're reliant on

486
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:53.500
those sub prime mortgages paying their interest and if they didn't get paid,

487
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:56.560
would start to deteriorate in value.

488
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.510
Banks lent to investors around the world,

489
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.070
including pension funds and clear helped pension funds,
including,
you know,

490
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:11.020
municipalities,
corporations,
other financial entities,
uh,

491
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.980
10 times that.

492
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.980
So $140 trillion effectively was on offer going after a half a trillion dollars

493
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.950
of subprime related assets.

494
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.460
So that problem is what causes an acceleration of the production of artificial

495
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.740
capital.
Um,

496
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:35.850
in order to solve what was really a major financial crisis it was,

497
00:31:36.821 --> 00:31:39.820
but what could have been done as you could have just paid off a half a trillion

498
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:42.120
dollars worth of subprime mortgages and,

499
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.430
and forget whether that's an ideology of you're paying people who didn't deserve

500
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:49.360
it or bags.
And it doesn't matter that the economics of it would have been far,

501
00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:51.700
far cheaper.
Instead,

502
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:57.120
the decision was made to plaster over that and to start this creation of 0%

503
00:31:57.551 --> 00:32:00.550
money so that banks would have the liquidity to start to re whoever was still

504
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:04.340
left standing to repay each other so that companies could repay off,

505
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.090
send the money they had borrowed that were still left standing,
um,

506
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.130
that were involved in this.
And as a result,
um,

507
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:16.620
it has created an extra level of capital in the system that makes,

508
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.820
um,
debt accelerate and also makes stock levels go up artificially.

509
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.190
Um,
so that the next time there's a crisis,

510
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:26.750
you're falling from a much higher height.

511
00:32:26.751 --> 00:32:29.140
So absolutely they want that not to happen,

512
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:34.300
which is why every single time a fed chair says there's growth,

513
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:36.730
there's inflation.
This is like you can train this.

514
00:32:36.731 --> 00:32:40.010
I mean if you're just even looking at this from an investment perspective,
um,

515
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.840
it's going to be followed by some major hiccup in the market and then some other

516
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:49.250
central bank or maybe the same one or someone in their country saying,
well,
no,

517
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:50.084
we didn't mean it.

518
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.840
And that's exactly what the European Central Bank was talking about growth a

519
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:57.140
minute ago.
So was the,
the Bank of England,
they were going to be raising rates.

520
00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:00.770
All these rumors in the market,
it put the pound up into,
you know,
Brexit's fine.

521
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.450
It's all,
it's all going to be worked out.

522
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.600
The central banks is going to raise rates.
It's a sign of strength.

523
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:08.210
It's going to help our currency into negotiations with Europe.

524
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:10.640
There's all these sort of discussions and,
and,

525
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:14.330
and the media narratives and politics going on back and forth.

526
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.900
Reality is they don't have the growth in the central bank head last week said,

527
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:21.560
by the way,
or things aren't so great.
Um,
they did not,
well,

528
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.680
they can raise rates on Thursday.
They're not going to,
I think,
um,

529
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.830
because actually the numbers don't bear them out.
And also it,
it hurt the market.

530
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.210
And so yes,
you are right.
Long answer to your question,

531
00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:38.870
but the reality is they want to keep this going.
They found a method to do it.

532
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:42.920
And that just means that when things crack the crack from a much higher height

533
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.580
than they would have or even did,
um,
during 2008,

534
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:53.210
<v 5>so now we have four point 5 trillion in the market as money supply extra.</v>

535
00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.010
Exactly.
It wasn't me.

536
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.330
How come inflation hasn't happened because all this money or in the bags,

537
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.860
<v 2>it's such a good question.
And,</v>

538
00:33:58.861 --> 00:34:03.510
and different people ask that in different settings for different reasons.

539
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.560
And it,

540
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.920
I think that inflation has not risen on the sort of average generic way that

541
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.410
inflation is considered and calculated because this money has inflated markets.

542
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.750
It,
this is inflation,
the,
the level of,
well,

543
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.190
a third graph would,
well this and,
and sort of the stock market.

544
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.130
<v 4>Yeah.
Um,
so it's kind of dipped a little bit,</v>

545
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:34.070
but it's sort of like that.
And you'd have QE one,

546
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:40.170
QE two,
QE three,
you know,
Europe,

547
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.920
Japan,
and so forth.

548
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:47.510
<v 2>Um,
that,
that ultimately this 15,000,000,000,020 1 trillion if you had,</v>

549
00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:49.040
and all the other banks that are involved

550
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.700
<v 4>and the market level</v>

551
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.270
<v 2>pretty much the same.
So there has been a tremendous amount of inflation.</v>

552
00:34:55.271 --> 00:34:56.110
There's been inflation.

553
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.530
The money supply that has gone into inflation of financial assets gone into

554
00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.880
lining new debt.

555
00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:04.900
It's gone onto inflating the value of stock because it's been a artificial

556
00:35:04.901 --> 00:35:09.250
source of money that's been used not just for stock buybacks cause that's kind

557
00:35:09.251 --> 00:35:10.740
of a one to one relationship.
But,

558
00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:14.240
but all along the way it's been there as a sort of security blanket,
um,

559
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.190
for banks to be able to leverage more companies are leveraging more.

560
00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:20.850
Right now actually they're on average,
um,

561
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.910
companies in the s and P or leveraged more than they were before the financial

562
00:35:24.911 --> 00:35:26.530
crisis.
So there was inflation,

563
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:31.060
but it's not inflation of real prices where it had been for a while,

564
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.340
for example in Mexico where they were reducing rates,

565
00:35:33.341 --> 00:35:38.341
it was inflating real prices because the relationship of central bank and that

566
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:43.260
monetary policy was more closely connected to the real economy and the fact that

567
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:47.660
we don't have inflation in,
in these countries because we don't,
um,

568
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:53.130
officially,
but we have inflation in financial assets is a fine of how,

569
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:56.490
just sort of off the rails this,
this,
this has gone.

570
00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:02.330
<v 5>And my second question quickly,
um,
but also we used to have the goal centered,</v>

571
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.670
which would basically be something we could peg,
right?

572
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.390
The actual value of a dollar to today we don't have that.

573
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.690
We also have petrodollars what's you're representing kind of an acid or a

574
00:36:11.691 --> 00:36:12.860
resource that can be traded.

575
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.540
Is that also why the dollar is still strong and we haven't lost the value of the

576
00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:20.480
dollar in the market or is that completely unrelated to,

577
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:24.570
<v 2>it's not entirely annoyed that the concept of the gold standard,
um,</v>

578
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:28.950
was something or has it been something not returning to it exactly as it was pre

579
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:33.530
71 but,
but,
but returning to some sort of component of goals,

580
00:36:33.531 --> 00:36:38.380
say in the special drawing rights basket.
So you have your five currencies and,

581
00:36:38.381 --> 00:36:40.170
and you have gold and they're sort of an average,

582
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:41.880
so you have something that's a real asset or,

583
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.660
or some sort of manner bringing back a version of the gold standard gets

584
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:49.710
discussed.
But for example,
when the Chinese,
a Chinese central bank was,

585
00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:54.711
was criticizing the Fed policy of just sort of inflating a sort of currency but,

586
00:36:56.161 --> 00:37:00.300
but not having anything real behind it to back it.
Um,
Ben Bernanke,

587
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:04.640
he actually went on the defensive and,
um,
I have this in,
in,

588
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.620
in different parts of the book throughout the years and started talking about

589
00:37:07.621 --> 00:37:09.390
how we,
we don't want to gold standard.

590
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.210
Like it wasn't even brought up as a topic when he started defending it.

591
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:15.150
And one of the reasons are just throwing it away as,
as,
as a potential.

592
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.480
And one of the reasons for that is you can't create gold.
Um,

593
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.720
this is not to say that,
that we should be on a full gold standard or that it's,

594
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:26.230
it's,
it's actually a practical development.
But having gold as a portion of,

595
00:37:26.231 --> 00:37:30.500
of a currency basket makes some sense because it's,
it's just an anchor.
Um,
it's,

596
00:37:30.501 --> 00:37:33.750
it's just something that's,
it's actually physically there and it's physically,

597
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.470
um,
it doesn't retain the same kind of value.
The more there's other currencies,

598
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:39.660
and this is more speculation in the market that it might've,

599
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:43.810
if everything was going off of real trade and real hard acid,
um,
but,

600
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.000
but it had that had an anchor level to it.
And,

601
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.710
and the fact that it isn't a part of the main system,

602
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:52.620
but it is something that gets bought up by some of the countries,

603
00:37:52.621 --> 00:37:55.740
the emerging countries that are trying to trade with each other their own

604
00:37:55.741 --> 00:38:00.741
currencies as well as to try to have more of a portion of gold reserves in the

605
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:05.730
potential that they create some sort of standard amongst themselves or something

606
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:10.260
outside of the dollar,
outside of the euro.
Um,
it's certainly something that

607
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.180
has kind of been reinitiated in,
in this whole process,

608
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:19.560
like where that goes and how long it takes to get there.
Um,
I don't know.

609
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:20.610
I mean there's,
there's people out there,

610
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:23.700
so the dollars going into flight tomorrow and I'm gold's going to go sky high.

611
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:23.911
I mean,

612
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:28.911
I think there's a trend to gold being considered as something that should

613
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.440
anchor,
um,
this,
but,
and,

614
00:38:32.441 --> 00:38:37.090
and other countries using their currencies and trading with each other like

615
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:39.520
China and Russia,
like Europe and Japan.

616
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:42.130
There's a lot of trade agreements that have been developed and,
and I,

617
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.810
I have a lot of them in,
in,
in collusion,

618
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:47.050
but that had been developed in these years amongst countries,
um,

619
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:51.220
to try and offset some of the potential risk of really this policy,
not,

620
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.970
not simply the dollar geopolitically,
but really the policy of,

621
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:59.230
of sort of bolstering a system that's not really restructured and that has the

622
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:04.000
potential to bring down,
uh,
an economy or a multiple economies.

623
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.833
Again,

624
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.670
I'm one alternative that that comes up in questions is crypto currencies.

625
00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:14.660
Um,
and for,
for similar reasons.
And,

626
00:39:14.661 --> 00:39:18.220
and what's interesting is that though there's a lot of volatility in bitcoin and

627
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:22.560
other currencies,
um,
and,
and,
and there's a lot of risk in being involved in,

628
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.110
there's diff speculating in them,
which has its own risk attached,

629
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:29.660
but there's actually,
if you're going to use them on a regular basis,
um,

630
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.760
that kind of volatility could,
you know,

631
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.870
ruin anyone's business on any given day or pop it up.

632
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:37.900
And that's not the kind of volatility in the real economy the most people can,

633
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.260
um,
can or should handle.
Um,

634
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:45.630
but the idea of having alternative any alternatives to this system,
um,

635
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.050
is very much an accelerated concept because of,
of,

636
00:39:49.051 --> 00:39:52.930
of how it's been handled because nothing has really been reformed or fixed.

637
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:54.870
It's just been plastered over by,

638
00:39:54.871 --> 00:39:59.170
by sort of this artificial a part of the system.
So,

639
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:00.490
<v 0>okay.</v>

640
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.570
<v 2>The head of the IMF,
Christine La Garde,
who again IMF,</v>

641
00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:07.360
the International Monetary Fund,
very much a part of the system,

642
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:11.470
very much involved in the whole dollar European currency system from when it was

643
00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:13.120
created in the wake of World War II.

644
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:17.410
And it was created to basically subsidize countries that were allies of the U S

645
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:18.640
and Europe.
And this is kind of part of the point.

646
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.270
She currently has been on multiple

647
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.880
public arenas talking about alternative currencies and how cryptocurrencies is

648
00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:31.990
something that is happening and it's expanding and they need to be aware of it.

649
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:32.650
Um,

650
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:36.820
there are full swat teams of the Federal Reserve now that are doing that sort of

651
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:41.170
under the radar.
And there's also,
you know,

652
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:44.530
you can get jobs at the European Central Bank right now that are listed to be

653
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:48.340
involved in developing,
um,
you know,
technology related to,

654
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.900
to cryptocurrency analysis and so forth right now.
So,
um,
they're,

655
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.520
they're definitely all involved from a different perspective,

656
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:58.610
but the idea that it sort of,
um,
yeah,

657
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.070
who actually ultimately gets the sort of regulation of it versus the use of it.

658
00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.590
Um,
I think it's still up for grabs because

659
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:07.670
<v 0>yeah,</v>

660
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:12.670
<v 2>if you had cryptos created by the same central banks that are creating this</v>

661
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:17.360
currency,
um,
then you don't necessarily gain

662
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.010
sort of autonomy from the system by doing that.
But if,

663
00:41:22.011 --> 00:41:25.070
but if there are cryptos that are regulated by a portion of this so that they're

664
00:41:25.071 --> 00:41:29.160
not as sort of volatile for end users and they actually might have,
um,

665
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:34.010
might spread that much more quickly.
Followup question to that.

666
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.600
<v 6>I've kind of just as a Dabbler in cryptocurrency,
you know,
people always ask,</v>

667
00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:42.260
well,
what does it based on?
And the answer is,
well,
not,
not much,

668
00:41:42.261 --> 00:41:44.990
but it does have a fixed supply.
Think it was just the original Bitcoin,

669
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:48.080
like 21 million coins.
Well,
gold is a fixed supply.

670
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.920
So when I look at those,
I think I'm,

671
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.760
one of the arguments is uh,
well sure,
you know,
bitcoin is volatile,

672
00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:58.430
but if nobody's on the gold standard,
it doesn't matter either.

673
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:03.590
It's kind of an odd,
magical thing to me of how people decide to buy into,
um,

674
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:08.360
agreeing to,
uh,
stick with a fixed supply of anything.
When it comes to,

675
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:13.580
I guess I would say a game this big,
what would be the,
the motive?

676
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:17.900
Would it just be looking for something stable and,
and what would,

677
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.810
what would bring would bring this air balloon back down,
I guess?

678
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:25.190
<v 2>Well,
I think the idea,
um,
and it's slightly different.
I mean that's,</v>

679
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.220
the language for Crypto is similar to the language for four goals and that's,

680
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:34.240
that's not an accident.
And the idea of having a fixed supply as,

681
00:42:34.241 --> 00:42:39.080
as part of what sort of pegs it to some form of anchor,
right,

682
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:41.780
is it is not an accident either.
With respect to gold,

683
00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:44.900
it doesn't mean that you can't have speculation and golden and tell if you were

684
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:48.050
had a gold standard or a similar thing to go,
Sandy,
you can still speculation.

685
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.850
You could still have stockpiles of gold,

686
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.030
you can still sort of squeeze the market,
et Cetera.
But,

687
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.510
but the idea of anything outside of the system is that it is fixed and it,

688
00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:02.600
it does have a limitation in this process has been particularly unlimited.

689
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.100
I mean,
it,
it,
it's still going up.
Um,

690
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.050
and so even though the Fed can say,

691
00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:12.170
talk about tapering or stopping to buy at this particular moment,

692
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:15.350
or creating money and creating dollars to basically continue this process,

693
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.800
the reality is if things go south,
there's,

694
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:22.870
there's no limitation on let's just create another few trillion.

695
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.370
There was no limitation on,
on literally any of the process.

696
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.800
And so talking about assets,

697
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:32.550
hard assets or crypto currencies as a way to,
um,
yeah,

698
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.021
just,

699
00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:38.021
just infuse a limitation to the system should in theory be able to reduce the

700
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:42.810
volatility of the system.
Now,
on any given day,
there's,
you know,

701
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:45.410
the market's moving for different reasons.
You know,
geopolitics,

702
00:43:45.411 --> 00:43:47.690
wars trading or trade wars,
whatever.
But,

703
00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:50.450
but in terms of the overall backdrop of the system,

704
00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:53.060
if you have something that's real,
that's,

705
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:55.670
that's there as a peg or even a proportional,

706
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:59.180
a proportion of all the currency activity in the world,

707
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:04.040
the idea is that it should reduce the risk.
It's like any portfolio,
portfolio,

708
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.270
finance,
it's like if you have more,
the idea is if you're diversified you,

709
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:12.050
you reduced the risk.
Now in practice you'd have to watch what's going on.
Um,

710
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:16.460
but if you have a standard of some sort outside of the system that's limited,

711
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.950
that should reduce the volatility ultimately of the system.

712
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:26.870
And it should act as a sort of counterbalance to the unlimitedness of what these

713
00:44:26.871 --> 00:44:27.704
people are doing.

714
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:31.200
Because not only are they not limited in terms of how much money or currency can

715
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:35.130
be creative and they're not limited in terms of what they have to show in terms

716
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:40.131
of where it went or what happens if it goes away or what happens if anything

717
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:43.440
gets really negative.
There's no real auditing going on.
There's,

718
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:46.650
there's no real checks and balances to,
to any of this.

719
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.340
Whereas an outside hard asset could be a check and balance.

720
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:52.260
<v 5>The Chinese</v>

721
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.440
currency is that the,
was the IMF uses,

722
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.280
what does,

723
00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:04.770
does that have that same kind of effect of sort of stabilize the volatility and

724
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:06.180
what effect does that have for China?

725
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:09.060
Like is it a good thing for them or is it like problematic if a bunch of their

726
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:11.760
currency gets created to deal with some financial crisis?

727
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.320
<v 2>Right.
It is a good question.</v>

728
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:18.321
It hasn't had yet the kind of effect in terms of the percentage of trade that is

729
00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:25.251
done in Chinese currency at this particular moment relative to the percentage

730
00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:27.210
they have of the basket is still low.

731
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.200
So they basically came into this basket between the UK pound,

732
00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:33.240
the Japanese yen and then sort of the year on the dollar.

733
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:36.030
So they kind of came in between third and fourth place.

734
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.750
So Japan and China kind of have a,
you know,
sort of,
you know,
the,
the,

735
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.140
the mix and mash of what place there.
And in terms of third and fourth,

736
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:45.600
but they kind of came in pretty high.
Um,

737
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.180
but the actual trade that goes on internationally,
um,

738
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:54.230
and the Chinese run still remains pretty low just because it takes time to catch

739
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:57.120
up.
So they came in high because of the size of their economy.

740
00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.440
But in terms of the actual tray that's going on,
there's still,
um,

741
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.520
that number is still small but going up.

742
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:07.140
And the reason for that is they are very active in creating trade partnerships

743
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:11.760
and currency relationships,
um,
that involve the red.
And in fact,

744
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:14.840
the u s banks have opened just in the last few months.

745
00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:19.560
I'm the major banks like JP Morgan Chase and stuff has opened clearing banks or

746
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:23.790
banks that can actually take Chinese currency for the purpose of getting

747
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:28.260
involved in the Chinese market.
So I think that's going to grow.
Um,

748
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.360
I don't the second part of your question again.

749
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.370
<v 5>Yeah.
What,
what right.</v>

750
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.220
Just asking.
So

751
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.220
<v 2>it gives them a political seat at the table too.
I,</v>

752
00:46:41.221 --> 00:46:45.360
one of the reasons that they a and geopolitical,
uh,
state at the table,

753
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:47.850
one of the reasons they want it to match,
um,

754
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:53.040
their status in the sort of ladder of,
of,
of the world and,

755
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:56.320
and sort of the entities that run things,
um,
from a,

756
00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.150
from a monetary standpoint is because it helps their economic superpower status.

757
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:04.250
It helps their relationships with other countries in the region in,
um,

758
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.660
throughout the world.
Um,

759
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:09.360
and so that's one of the reasons it's beneficial to them.
It's sort of like,
look,

760
00:47:09.361 --> 00:47:09.771
if this is,

761
00:47:09.771 --> 00:47:14.640
if this is the basket that's representing the world and we're actually bigger

762
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:17.700
than several of these economies,
then why shouldn't we be in it?

763
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:20.090
Because once we were in it,
then we can utilize that to,

764
00:47:20.091 --> 00:47:22.230
to develop our sort of presence elsewhere.

765
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.500
And what they've done with some of the money that they've been fabricating as

766
00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:29.470
well,
um,
is they've used it specifically for that purpose of having like better

767
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:32.260
relationships and alliances with countries saying like,
you know,
you,

768
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:35.680
you give us your workers and we'll build this bridge and we'll finance it.
Um,

769
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.920
and so a lot of the money that they've created is actually gone outside of
China,

770
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:42.790
but for development projects and,
and that's their way.

771
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.980
That's their strategy of developing a long term,
um,

772
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:50.740
economic presence and a super power presence by having,
you know,

773
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:54.760
like when I like the beginning video,
they,
I'm in,
I'm in Colombo,
Sri Lanka.
Um,

774
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.930
in the,
in the,
in the first scene of that video,
um,
and,

775
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:01.890
and in the middle of Colombo,
there's,
there's a huge tower and it's,

776
00:48:01.891 --> 00:48:03.760
it's reminiscent of the Shanghai Tower,

777
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:07.930
which is like the second tallest building in the world.
And,

778
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.740
and I looked,
it was like a mini version and you know,
and even when you,

779
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:13.450
when you would go,
right,
even when you're studying this,
you're not,

780
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:16.660
you're not following every like real estate development in the world.

781
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:19.210
And so I'm in the middle of Columbia and I'm like,
oh,
that looks,

782
00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:21.340
that looks a lot like the Shanghai Tower.
That's kind of cool.

783
00:48:21.341 --> 00:48:24.020
And of course it turns out that was a Chinese funded it.
Um,

784
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.380
they had their engineers come over and do it.

785
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:30.470
It was a joint effort also with people in Sri Lanka.
But the basically,
um,

786
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:35.170
that's how the presence develops.
It's like the boots on the ground,

787
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.130
the military,
it's like,
it's like,
you know,
structures on the ground.

788
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.290
<v 7>So I guess I'm still trying to wrap my head around run all of this.
Right.
And,</v>

789
00:48:45.291 --> 00:48:48.970
and still trying to better understand that the check and balance.
So,
so,

790
00:48:48.971 --> 00:48:50.870
so my understand is when we're looking at this,
right?

791
00:48:50.871 --> 00:48:55.871
Like the reason why we haven't seen any crash or fall is because all of the

792
00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.220
players are recognizing each other's currencies,
right?
Like they're,

793
00:48:59.221 --> 00:49:02.960
they're recognizing that they're printing,
they're playing along.
And is,

794
00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.660
is this crash out,
you know,

795
00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.510
could possibly happen is does that happen when someone says,
no,
we don't,

796
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.140
you know,
recognize that the money that you've been printing or the money,

797
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.720
you know,
but you've been trading back and forth is,
is not admissible anymore.

798
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:19.310
We're not going to take in,
is that when you know,

799
00:49:19.311 --> 00:49:22.730
everything crashes because otherwise it's just based on the strength of an

800
00:49:22.731 --> 00:49:23.620
economy.
Yeah.
Right,
right.

801
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.540
<v 2>And what stops and that,</v>

802
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.860
that's kind of the odd thing that's been happening over the last 10 years.

803
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:31.770
All of this started out as an emergency policy 10 years ago.
Um,
and,

804
00:49:31.771 --> 00:49:35.050
and obviously the fact that it still exists as an indication that whatever

805
00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:38.320
caused that emergency hasn't really been fixed.
And if you pulled the plug,
yes,

806
00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:40.570
it'll be a problem.
So whether you pull the plug on,

807
00:49:40.571 --> 00:49:43.340
I'm working with someone else's car and see which of these banks can't really do

808
00:49:43.341 --> 00:49:45.130
when they own nature,
they trade in each other's cards.

809
00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:46.530
So they own each other's car and see they,

810
00:49:46.531 --> 00:49:48.640
they hold bonds in each other's currency.
Um,

811
00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:52.330
particularly the holding of the dollar because we have the most amount of debt

812
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:56.740
relative to the rest of,
of,
of their,
their nations.
And,

813
00:49:56.741 --> 00:50:00.400
and so the problem is,
um,
if,
if you,
if they stop that,

814
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:04.390
that's one way the system could collapse if they stopped because they don't

815
00:50:04.391 --> 00:50:06.400
trust each other.
It's because this happens again.

816
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:09.370
It's because you all of a sudden have a bunch of banks going under or,

817
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.400
or having a real
crisis of some sort that's,
you know,

818
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:18.240
related to a derivative.
It's related to a derivatives that have,

819
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.750
are now partly created from corporate bonds that used to be mortgage bonds.

820
00:50:22.751 --> 00:50:24.400
And those corporate bonds start to default.

821
00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:27.500
So those derivative start to go under,
the whole chain starts to happen again.

822
00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:28.970
And they're like,
well,
wait a minute,

823
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:31.790
we really need to accelerate our sort of move away from these currencies are

824
00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:34.730
from each other.
That is a car.
That is how these crises happen.

825
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.920
It's not like this definitive statement like Europe cancer.

826
00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:39.230
We're never going to use a dollar like that.
Just,
it's just not going to happen.

827
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:44.540
But what they can do is they can develop sort of relationships outside a little

828
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.570
dollar so that if something like this happens again and the chances are it will

829
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:49.770
start in the United States again to,
um,

830
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:53.090
because we have went a lot of money to a lot of countries.

831
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:56.490
We've done all the complex structures,
we have sort of more at risk,
um,

832
00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:00.140
and when more codependent in general related related to the world and other

833
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:03.680
countries are,
um,
then then you could have that,
that false start to happen.

834
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:06.680
So it's not like a decision,
um,
we're not going to trust your currency.

835
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:10.820
It's more like we're not going to trust the way you deal with your system and

836
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:15.380
what,
what happened in,
in the developing countries,
um,

837
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.400
in the wake of the financial crisis is there,
there's,
um,

838
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.810
and I talk about this in the book,
there's a lot more meetings.

839
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.870
There's a lot more conferences amongst themselves.

840
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.290
There's a lot more growth and trade agreements outside of the u s and like not

841
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:29.900
necessarily using Japan.
And then there's ones where Japan's using Europe.

842
00:51:29.901 --> 00:51:31.730
There's just a lot of realignments going on.

843
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:35.330
And that's a way to say not so much we won't use it at all or we won't use your

844
00:51:35.331 --> 00:51:36.164
currency.

845
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:41.290
But we are cognizant that like this is still on kind of shaky ground.

846
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.750
And so the next time there is a financial crisis,

847
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.280
hopefully we have a little bit more protection.
All sorts of alternatives,

848
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.760
which may or may not.
How I,
it depends what happens.
It depends how big that is.

849
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:52.911
I mean,

850
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:56.900
no one really expected the market to be cut by like 45% in 2008 from where it

851
00:51:56.901 --> 00:51:59.830
was the year before.
I mean,
it wasn't an expectation.
Um,

852
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.550
and even now when I say this stuff like the,

853
00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:04.400
the market is going to potentially crash.
You know,

854
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:08.300
we're up with these like heady heights.
Most people don't feel the same way,

855
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.090
but it could still happen.

856
00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.130
<v 7>Maybe it's like a novice question,
but then couldn't,</v>

857
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:19.060
couldn't everyone just hit the reset button and then below each other back up

858
00:52:19.061 --> 00:52:19.630
again?
Okay.

859
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.930
<v 2>Well,
one of the solutions or</v>

860
00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:28.850
possible paths that I talk about in,
in the last chapter,
um,

861
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.950
is this sort of idea of cancelling out each others debt,
um,

862
00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:37.060
and doing it in such a way that,
that,
that the countries that are most,

863
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:41.210
that would be most burdened by a collapse that are most burdened by a collapse

864
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:44.420
that they did not cause in 2008,
um,

865
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.420
could be in a more stable situation.

866
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.480
What's happened with all of this is that the countries that were sort of most of

867
00:52:49.481 --> 00:52:49.630
the,

868
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:54.630
at the center of the last financial crisis and have the ability to do more harm

869
00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.920
financially are the ones that got the most subsidies.
And so that just created,

870
00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.660
you know,
sort of more inherent risk.
And again,

871
00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:03.430
I could go on for you and this can go on for a long time,

872
00:53:03.431 --> 00:53:06.850
but it created more on heroin.
So,
so that's one of the things that,

873
00:53:06.851 --> 00:53:07.720
that that could also,

874
00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:14.080
<v 7>so the word collusion to me anyway,
has kind of a negative connotation.
Would you,</v>

875
00:53:14.081 --> 00:53:18.010
is it fair to characterize this collusion in your view as something sinister or

876
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.780
do these people responsible for these systems think they're acting sort of in a

877
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.010
very honorable way,
saving

878
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.370
<v 2>the economy or whatever?
Well,
it's weird because,
I mean I,
I think,</v>

879
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.820
I think most of them believes that that what they're doing is,
is

880
00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.020
<v 0>okay</v>

881
00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.330
<v 2>ultimately going to help the economy.</v>

882
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.500
Even though the evidence is that it hasn't,

883
00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:44.890
the evidence is that wage growth hasn't really increased.

884
00:53:44.891 --> 00:53:47.320
Dot growth has increased.
So certain bonuses have increased.
But,

885
00:53:47.321 --> 00:53:51.250
but the evidence is that the economies that supposedly were fixed,

886
00:53:51.251 --> 00:53:54.270
our are really sputtering and the economy is a,

887
00:53:54.271 --> 00:53:58.380
didn't receive so much quantitative easing or other doing better or they're,

888
00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:01.670
they're still sort of caught up in what might be the impact of a,

889
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:05.530
of what happens here.
So it's,
it's,
um,
it's,

890
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:10.750
it's hard to say.
Um,
but,
um,

891
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.160
I,
I think what ultimately will will happen though is,

892
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.980
is that at some point these people,
they shift.

893
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.890
Like some of them move out in some new people come in.
Um,

894
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:25.180
Mario Draghi at some point has to leave and,
um,

895
00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:29.080
probably or possibly,
but probably the,
um,

896
00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:32.530
whoever takes his place will come say from Germany or from a country that

897
00:54:32.531 --> 00:54:36.290
actually is against this policy and actually would prefer that,

898
00:54:36.291 --> 00:54:39.250
that less artificial money is in the system.
Um,

899
00:54:39.251 --> 00:54:40.480
and they have political reasons for that.

900
00:54:40.481 --> 00:54:43.050
The economy is doing better than some of the other condoms in Europe.
So this,

901
00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:44.920
this goes to this head,
all the ramifications.

902
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.860
And so a shifting in the actual individuals,
um,

903
00:54:47.861 --> 00:54:51.410
at the top of these institutions could create a shift in the policy.
Um,

904
00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:55.420
but also there's a way to unwind this or at least to start turn wine that

905
00:54:55.421 --> 00:55:00.421
actually is using this kind of off the rails solution.

906
00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:05.460
And in a good way,
like for example,
the Fed could take,
um,

907
00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.660
a trillion or a 2 trillion or whatever,

908
00:55:07.661 --> 00:55:11.230
they're four and a half trillion worth of money they created and assets they

909
00:55:11.231 --> 00:55:13.590
received in return for doing that,
um,

910
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:16.900
and create an infrastructure bank or create a development bank or do something

911
00:55:16.901 --> 00:55:19.910
that's actually,
um,
really financing the,

912
00:55:19.911 --> 00:55:23.830
the real economy and also sort of moving forward.
Um,
when I was in China,

913
00:55:23.831 --> 00:55:28.120
I took the high speed rail from,
from Beijing to Shanghai.

914
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:33.060
Um,
and it's,
it's this,
I don't know if anyone has,
I mean it's,
it's just,
uh,

915
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:37.040
I mean,
when you talk hive,
it's really fast.
Like you cannot see the countryside.

916
00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:41.430
Like it is just yours and it's,
and it's quiet and it's,
I mean,
it's,

917
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.620
it's excellent technology.
I mean,
obviously it costs what it costs,
but I mean,

918
00:55:44.621 --> 00:55:48.050
that's the kind of development that's the kind of infrastructure building.
Um,

919
00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:52.280
you know,
developing the technology in conjunction with a sort of real,
um,

920
00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:57.100
real,
uh,
parts of the economy that,
that real people actually work on it.

921
00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:59.110
That's fine.
That's more forward stabilizing.

922
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:02.350
So you could actually take a lot of the money that's been created and rather

923
00:56:02.351 --> 00:56:06.100
than have it go into debt and have it go into stock,
actually haven't diverted.

924
00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.730
Um,
nobody's going to be happy about that.
It might cause a correction,

925
00:56:09.731 --> 00:56:13.810
but ultimately it's a question of long term versus short term.
Thank you so much.

926
00:56:13.811 --> 00:56:14.644
Yeah,
no,
thank you.
Thank you.

927
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:19.910
