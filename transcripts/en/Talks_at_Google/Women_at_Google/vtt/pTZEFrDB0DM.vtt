WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.260
Once upon a time in 1998 I vowed decline 48 mountains.

2
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.790
And what I'd like to do for the next 40 minutes or so is share a little of my

3
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.090
journey with you.
I'll make some remarks,

4
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.810
read three short passages from my book,

5
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.900
offer some thoughts about mental training,

6
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.950
and leave us with time for question and discussion.

7
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.070
You game all right.
Now,

8
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.550
if you had known me back in 1998,

9
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.420
you might've thought this vow was questionable.

10
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.960
I had a bum knee.

11
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.090
I have scoliosis that is severe enough that one doctor,

12
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.680
when I was in my team said,
don't ever pick up anything heavier than a tissue.

13
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.930
I was no longer in my twenties or my thirties I was 48

14
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.910
and my record with sports was not promising.

15
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.830
I had tried and loved three of them and had to give each of them up when my body

16
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:20.590
failed me twice and during ending with surgery.
Um,

17
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.330
and lastly though,
I hate to admit it,

18
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.730
I'm afraid of heights.
Nonetheless.

19
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.060
This is what I decided to climb mount to try pyramid in the white mountains of

20
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:38.660
New Hampshire.
All three peaks of it.

21
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.410
It was going to be a serious challenge for me.

22
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.700
It was two and a half times as long as I'd ever hiked back in the day on much

23
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:50.510
easier trails.

24
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.190
It was one of the taller ones in the whites.

25
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.060
It was cold that day in early October when we decided to go for it and it was

26
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.000
going to take pretty much all day.

27
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.810
Book time doesn't even include things like lunch or bio breaks or picture taking

28
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:17.741
or view enjoying or pretty much anything along with me on this venture.

29
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.730
I invited Kate,
my next door neighbor and my best friend.

30
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.520
We did pretty much everything together.

31
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.650
She was my daughter's Auntie Kate.
She was my dog's onto Kate.

32
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.860
I also invited Sarah,
my best friend from college.

33
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.960
Now Sarah and I were the same age,
but Kate was six years older,

34
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:46.961
so she was 54 when we started and it's kind of fitting that I introduce your

35
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:52.850
early on to a couple of friends because among the themes in my book,

36
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.180
friendship is certainly one now.

37
00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:01.150
One thing that I did not appreciate before I went on the Mount,

38
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.900
tried pyramid hike.
Was this the elevation gain?
I was kind of like,

39
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.620
now I've come to think of it like this picture for yourselves.

40
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:15.000
A two story house with an attic.
All right,

41
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.460
put another one just like it next door.
Pick up the second one.

42
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:23.110
Put it on top of the first one and keep going.

43
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.460
You need to add up 100 houses to reach 3000 feet of elevation gain and we'd be

44
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.710
doing that on rocky Rudy ankle busting,

45
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.840
need turning trails

46
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.000
and I'm here to tell you it was hard.

47
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.760
We were on the Scour Ridge trail,

48
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:50.761
the three of us climbing up on our hands and knees over boulders.

49
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.670
I did not expect that at all and I was starting to get really worried.

50
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.340
I was getting anxious that I,

51
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.530
I wouldn't be able to make it to the top and I wouldn't be able to finish this

52
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.540
event.
That was so important to me.

53
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.680
I'd like to read you a couple of paragraphs so that you get a glimpse of why was

54
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.300
finishing was so important.

55
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.780
After months of preparing for this hike,

56
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.320
I still didn't know if I was strong enough,
tough enough,

57
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.880
brave enough as it had during the night,
worry,

58
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.650
eroded my confidence.

59
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.870
Would I finish other possible problems,
storms,

60
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.090
running moose bears.

61
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.390
I didn't have the experience to be troubled by.

62
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.610
It was me that worried me.

63
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.580
We continued leveraging and hoisting,

64
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.450
maintaining the lineup that would continue for much of the day.

65
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.830
Sarah and the lead me in the middle and Kate slowly and with no apparent angst

66
00:04:56.141 --> 00:05:00.190
about it.
Bringing up the rear Kate's face was sweaty,

67
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.450
but determined.

68
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.920
I thought she really is stronger than I am.

69
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.680
Not as fast,
but stronger at some core level.

70
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.560
She seemed unfazed by this trail.

71
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.960
Sarah was fast and Kate was sure,
but what was I?

72
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.770
I no longer defined myself as a partner in a national organization or president

73
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:31.201
of my own consulting firm and I could hardly call myself a writer.

74
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.700
I needed to be a hiker,
a good one.

75
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.870
But I relied on a blend of fear and willpower with neither Sarah's agility nor

76
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:45.520
Kate's character.

77
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.580
So now you understand that I was in the middle of a late mid career change from

78
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:55.540
the world of business to following my bliss.

79
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.080
Something I'd always wanted to do since childhood to write a novel and it was

80
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.010
not going well.

81
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.940
So there I am on the trail,

82
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.570
anxious,
worried,
concerned.

83
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.060
I was never going to finish when something happened.

84
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.420
Kate,
uh,
who was behind me,
called up in,

85
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:24.650
motioned me to come over to see something which I did.

86
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.420
And when I went back down,
this is what I found.

87
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.180
Kayden zipped the small pouch,

88
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:37.100
belted at her navel and pulled out a camera moving to her side.

89
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.070
I lean down to where she crouched on the trail.

90
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.520
She pointed out a whole row of icicles hanging from a boulder to our right.

91
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.870
They glistened what?

92
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.970
Lee Silver against a backdrop of Emerald Moss.

93
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.800
Wow.
I whispered.
As Kate moved in for a closeup,

94
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.080
I pulled off a glove and reached out to slide my finger down.

95
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:07.010
One of the six inch sparkling daggers,
cold,

96
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.290
slick,
solid.
I yearn to break one off and lick it,

97
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.900
but they were too beautiful to ruin.

98
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.090
I remembered my mother coming into my child who had room in the early morning,

99
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.180
dark to murmur.
It's a snow day,

100
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.340
the exhilaration,

101
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.730
the sense of freedom a day in the white glare of snow making lopsided snowballs

102
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.020
and forts plucking icicles from tree branches until I grew chilled than the

103
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.260
warmth inside the house that fogged my glasses.

104
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.650
My mother pressing her warm cheek to my cold one saying this was her favorite

105
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.090
moment of winter,

106
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.530
offering her a bit of icicle that's still clung to my mitten,

107
00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.370
that taste gritty with bits of bark and the strange bloody Tang of dirt.

108
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.720
Perhaps Kate was remembering too,
aren't they amazing?

109
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.270
I looked at her and she looked at me and it settled into my brain that we were

110
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:18.010
here on the spine of one enormous mountain justice.

111
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.430
We'd planned justice we trained for,
and it was cold and cloudy,

112
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:27.431
but we were warm and we were climbing and we'd probably hiked five miles already

113
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:31.970
as long as I'd ever hiked in my wife.
We grinned,

114
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.520
big Wolf grins at each other,

115
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.510
so the height didn't get any easier.

116
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.080
But I've had a glimpse of the wonder of the natural world and I have to say it

117
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:48.560
gave me a whole lot more enthusiasm for this hike.

118
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.920
Then things got tougher.

119
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.880
You see on the left here?
Yes.
Left.

120
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.420
Um,
Sarah on the,
uh,
uh,

121
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.330
Scour Ridge trail,

122
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.990
so I did mean boulders that we had to hike up.

123
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.770
And then the other photograph takes place seven miles later and three peaks

124
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.890
later at the start of the south slide,

125
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.370
which basically drops off the edge of the photograph off the edge of the

126
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.730
mountain,
like a plumb line for about a thousand feet,

127
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.090
a plumb line filled with scree.

128
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.650
How was I coping with my fear of heights?

129
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.630
You'll just have to read the book to find out.
Well,

130
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:40.950
we did finish,

131
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.370
only took us 10 hours and it took a week for my leg muscles to unclench but it

132
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.740
didn't matter at all because I was elated.

133
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.250
I couldn't believe that I'd actually done it.

134
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.760
Sarah disappeared back into her busy life,

135
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:05.030
but Kate felt the rapture and on our early morning training walks we felt so

136
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.780
proud of ourselves so strong.

137
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.050
We strutted through the neighborhood wanting to pick up cars and save babies.

138
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.400
Now something else happened.
Um,
that mountain,

139
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.120
we met a guy who told us about the 4,000 footers and that we were standing on

140
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:28.134
one.

141
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.420
He said we too could join the 4,000 foot heard club after,

142
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.920
only after we had hyped all 48 of them.

143
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.630
And when we did,
what did we get?
You're looking at it,

144
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.640
we've got this patch.

145
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.420
Well I thought this was a ridiculous possibly demented idea who would do such a

146
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:57.360
crazy thing,
but it stuck with me.

147
00:10:57.361 --> 00:11:00.630
And over the course of the next days and weeks.
I thought,
well,

148
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.530
I bet the folks who joined that 40,000 foot or club or goal oriented people,

149
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.390
well shoot,
I'm a goal oriented person,
I can do this thing.

150
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.740
The next year I went out and begged three more peaks to with Kate and wanna a

151
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:24.171
surprise venture on my own with nobody but my little Bijon freezy juniper who

152
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:28.830
despite her appearance was an awesome hiking dog.

153
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.760
So Kate and I felt pretty pleased with ourselves until one evening I was in the

154
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:38.130
kitchen preparing dinner and my daughter Casey,

155
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:42.900
who was nine was doing homework at the kitchen table and she said,
mom,

156
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.430
I did the math.

157
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.510
It's going to take you 21 and a half years to finish the 48 and you'll be 70 and

158
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:57.580
a years old and Auntie Kate will be 76 and a half.

159
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.720
Caden.
I had not done the math.

160
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.600
This was clearly not right.
We couldn't allow it to be like this,

161
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:12.601
so we took the intensive eight week long winter hiking course that the AMC puts

162
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:19.750
on so that we could now hike all year long.

163
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.520
We were ready to rock and route my friends Phage,

164
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:25.354
however,

165
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.810
had other ideas in the very early days of the optimistic new millennium,

166
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.500
Kate underwent surgery and they found ovarian cancer.

167
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.300
Three months later I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.

168
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.210
We both went into treatment like Kate.
I had surgeries,

169
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.040
rounds of chemotherapy,

170
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.310
and then I began a five year course of Tamoxifen and everything gave me lasting

171
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.070
side effects.
I still have side effects today as a matter of fact,

172
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.080
and then as you learn in the prologue of my book,

173
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.590
in the spring of 2002 ovarian cancer killed my best friend.

174
00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.920
I was bereft.

175
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.000
I had no idea how to fill the void.

176
00:13:29.001 --> 00:13:31.400
This woman left in my life.

177
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.450
I wasn't much up for continuing my quest,

178
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.460
but before she died,
Kate made be promised that I would continue.

179
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.140
She said,
it will keep you strong the way you've kept me.

180
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.550
She also persuaded me that I needed to get another hiking buddy and I didn't

181
00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:52.694
want to,

182
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.940
but I did because I had more reasons now to hike than ever before.

183
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.480
The mountains were a place where I could go to heal from the trauma of my own

184
00:14:04.641 --> 00:14:07.760
breast cancer and in the wild,

185
00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:12.761
it was spacious enough to absorb some of the grief I felt over losing Kate.

186
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.250
I had made her another promise that I would take some of her ashes to the top of

187
00:14:22.251 --> 00:14:23.570
a 4,000 footer.

188
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.550
I chose Mountain Monroe because it was in the presidentials,

189
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.230
which are the highest of the 4,000 footers and the grandest and the most

190
00:14:33.231 --> 00:14:34.064
difficult.

191
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.690
I wasn't strong enough yet to do Mount Washington,

192
00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:42.390
which you see in the background of this picture with it's uh,

193
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.440
towers and observatory and Mount Monroe next door to it.

194
00:14:47.841 --> 00:14:52.841
This fellow standing on the trail leading up to the summit of Mount when rose.

195
00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:57.920
So the summit kind of protrudes out towards us from this picture,

196
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.520
but it was plenty high enough to to push me to and past my limits.

197
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.420
Sarah came with me.

198
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:14.690
I was not strong enough emotionally or physically to go on my own and together

199
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.770
we set cape free in the raw wild winds above oaks golf

200
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.920
to continue my quest.

201
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:31.250
I next chose Mount Mussa Locky and I picked it because it was one of the easier

202
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:35.940
ones,
at least it was easier than what I had been doing.

203
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:41.210
It was seven and a half miles long round trip with 2,450 feet of elevation gain

204
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.300
or think 81 houses substantial but still easier.

205
00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:55.010
It was a pivotal climb for me because I went with someone new Ginny,

206
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.040
Ginny and I had known each other from our kids' school for years and we were

207
00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:05.340
friends and now we were even training buddies,

208
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.870
but we had never hiked together.
She'd never been to the whites.

209
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:15.000
She'd certainly never been to a 4,000 footer and Kate had just died.

210
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.920
I thought you might enjoy this image of Mount Moose Alaki from 1912 as you can

211
00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:27.861
see on the summit is a little thing that was known as the tip top house,

212
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.610
a small hotel,

213
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.260
and that carriage road was for horse drawn buggies.

214
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.280
To take visitors and guests up to the summit.

215
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:43.490
That's the exact same trail that Jenny and I used to ascend to the summit.

216
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:49.670
And while it's nowhere near as broad and pristine is that now it's delightful

217
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.283
footing,

218
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.580
lots of pine needles and nice soft dirt was wonderful.

219
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.710
Great Way to get up there.

220
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.060
And we got along so well.

221
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.470
She also loved wild flowers and learning about them.

222
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.300
And even though I tried so hard not to,

223
00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:15.630
she expected me to compare her to Kate.

224
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.930
She even asked me questions about Kate and our hiking experiences and she held

225
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:26.331
me when I cried better yet she wanted to do another 4,000 footer with me.

226
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:33.470
Even though our trail coming down was quite direct from the top where the tip

227
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:39.321
top house is pretty much straight down and it was quite stony and difficult on

228
00:17:39.661 --> 00:17:44.661
the knees and feet and it really kicked my energy a bunch.

229
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.530
I have to say,

230
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:52.590
let's take just a quick through some 4,000 footers so you get to see some other

231
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:57.420
ones.
Many of them start in the woods like this one.
Um,

232
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.070
that's me back in the day.

233
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:04.730
And this trail falling waters goes up to the somewhat famous Franconian Ridge

234
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:11.520
trail and two mounts,
Lincoln and Lafayette,

235
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.260
and it has a lovely gradual ascent for the first mile.

236
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.590
And then it gets wicked diabolically steep and hard,

237
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.050
hence its nickname falling bodies trail.

238
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.090
The presidentials are the grandest,
as I've said,

239
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.010
and this is a geological feature that I love.
It's called the great golf.

240
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.360
I can just stare at it forever.

241
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.873
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

242
00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.660
<v 1>On the way up to Mount Moriah,
that's me again,</v>

243
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:49.490
trying out yet another knee brace.
Um,
there were some interesting moments.

244
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.690
Fear of heights.
Oh yes,
my goodness.

245
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:55.690
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

246
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.880
<v 1>Here's a friend Clara,</v>

247
00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:03.150
a wonderful person whom I got to know strictly through hiking out on the summit

248
00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:06.550
of Mount Flown.
And last,

249
00:19:06.551 --> 00:19:11.551
you think that all of the 4,000 footers are just piles of rock or rubble.

250
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.800
Here's some that are lushly green.

251
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.100
And what I love about bond and bond cliff,

252
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.300
and there's another one called West Bond,

253
00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.430
is that when you're there,

254
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:29.170
you cannot see a single sign of human civilization.

255
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.640
It's wonderful.

256
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.130
Just this wilderness to absorb and appreciate

257
00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:43.050
the wild cats are a series of five peaks that live across the road from Mount

258
00:19:43.571 --> 00:19:44.404
Washington.

259
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.610
And here you see first Sarah followed by Jenny,

260
00:19:48.611 --> 00:19:52.000
followed by rosemary and other friend who hiked with me.

261
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:58.740
Now as an any endurance sport,
um,

262
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.780
the mental game is paramount,
right?

263
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.490
Even when our bodies can be totally fit and trained and ready.

264
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.970
Our minds can do us.
And,

265
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.550
and this is true on any marathon endeavour sports,

266
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.050
but other things like um,
uh,

267
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:23.130
renovation project for your house or a month long campaign to get a promotion or

268
00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:28.990
a multi year design project,
whatever it is,

269
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.260
we have to both stay trained on that.

270
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.300
What sometimes feels like in the far distance,
the goal we want to attain,

271
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.610
but also we have to keep moving forward and keep ourselves on track.

272
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.500
One of the ways that I found that me do this was finding role models now on the

273
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:53.730
trails I mostly saw meant.

274
00:20:53.731 --> 00:20:58.731
So I was keen to find a woman role model to teach and inspire me.

275
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.500
And the woman that I came up with was a climber called Annie Smith.

276
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.180
Peck said,
anybody heard of her and he Smith Peck.

277
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.680
She was amazing.
Here's an image of Annie Smith Pack,

278
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:16.960
uh,

279
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.960
on the cover of a book that was a biography written about her in 2017 and that's

280
00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:28.321
what she wore to summit the Matterhorn in 1895 and she scandalize the world,

281
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.550
not because she summited as a woman that had already been done in 1871 but

282
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:38.140
because she wore pants.

283
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.760
She was a wonderful role model for me because she didn't even start hiking until

284
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:48.460
her mid thirties which was considered pretty old.

285
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.860
She hiked,

286
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.890
she practiced for 10 years before going on to summit the matter horn at age 45

287
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.460
and then she became the first person,

288
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.440
woman or man to climb the highest peak in the Americas.

289
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.940
Mount Waswe got on in Peru about 22,000 feet high.

290
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.710
I tell you,
every time I read anything about Annie Smith Peck,

291
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.730
I just wanted to run right out and tackle another 4,000 footer.

292
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.420
And isn't that what we want our role models to do for us to inspire us,

293
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:26.590
to encourage us to keep us going.

294
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.220
I also found it important to,
uh,

295
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.500
write down the progress that I was making because this was a multiyear effort

296
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:38.674
for me.

297
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:44.010
And so each day I write down what I do for physical training,

298
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.090
mental training,
and what I do professionally.
So nowadays,

299
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:50.290
working on my book,

300
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.110
I find that when I go to review it at the end of a week,

301
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.740
I'm always astounded how much I've forgotten that I did earlier on in the week.

302
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.960
And it's very helpful to be able to look back and see that,
yes,

303
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.040
I have achieved things.
Yes,
I'm making progress.

304
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.960
I am moving forward toward that longterm goal.

305
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.820
Another way that I did that was with this birthday gift from my husband Larry,

306
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.210
who mounted it on a poster board and hung it on my wall.

307
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.600
He strategically placed 48 blue pins on it.

308
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.590
And so every time I came back from a climb,

309
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.830
I would swap out the blue pin for redwood with a number on it that corresponded

310
00:23:44.111 --> 00:23:48.170
to the number of 4,000 footer.
It was for me.

311
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.450
I could see at a glance all that I had accomplished and I could also see at a

312
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:58.010
glance exactly what I had left to go and it was very helpful in terms of

313
00:23:58.011 --> 00:23:59.810
choosing my next hike,

314
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.170
another mental training tip.
Celebrate.

315
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.620
Here you see Clara and I doing what became a tradition on all my hikes,

316
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.490
the peak dance

317
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.280
it was designed to be to make us look as ridiculous,

318
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.440
as goofy as humanly possible.

319
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.540
We sang this absurd little ditty that I made up and why did we do it?

320
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.990
Well,
every time we did it,
we laughed.

321
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.640
And his studies have shown laughter's good medicine.
But in addition,

322
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.320
when you celebrate,
your body releases dopamine,

323
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.220
one of the happy chemicals in the body like Serotonin,

324
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.460
dopamine is,

325
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:50.550
is awesome because not only does it help you set your goals in the first place,

326
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.400
but when you achieve them,
it gives you this big rush of pleasure.

327
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.200
So why not celebrate as often as you can?

328
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.680
Now I'd like to talk about something that is incredibly important to me and

329
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.270
became,
so in my book,

330
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.140
finding a home for myself in nature became a chief part of every climb.

331
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.950
When I hiked,
I made sure no matter with whom I was,

332
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.220
that I had time to hike alone so that I could tune into the natural world around

333
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:36.551
me and make that connection to nature that we were made to do.

334
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:41.360
Um,
it was such a gift.

335
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.050
No matter how hard the climb had been for me,

336
00:25:45.051 --> 00:25:47.120
they were pretty much all hard.

337
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.700
No matter how injured or bruised I was when I got back,

338
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:58.880
I always felt that I had come back brimming with energy.

339
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:03.881
It was as if there was this internal reservoir that had gone dry and I filled it

340
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:09.330
up on the mountains with an exhibit exists,

341
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.340
[inaudible] and exuberance and just a zest for living

342
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:22.030
is Rachel Carson once wrote,
you remember Rachel Carson,

343
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.230
the author,
uh,
in 1962 of the silent spring.

344
00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:31.200
She was one of our early conservationists and environmentalists.
Um,

345
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.393
she said,

346
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
those who contemplate the beauty of the earth develop reserves of strength that

347
00:26:41.531 --> 00:26:44.700
endure as long as life lasts.

348
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.080
I'd like to read you a passage from my book that gives you a glimpse of how I

349
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:57.960
felt on the top of my six 4,000 footer.
The one you see here,

350
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:02.250
the larger one on the left,
Mt.
Osceola.
Um,

351
00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:05.490
the rite is east peak,
also a 4,000 footer.

352
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.810
When I hiked Mount Osceola,

353
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:13.560
it was my first 4,000 footer after cancer.

354
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.830
It had been a year since the end of treatment,

355
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.980
two years since my last climb and I was still quite weak,

356
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:29.150
but it was a glorious fall day up in Waterville valley,

357
00:27:29.401 --> 00:27:34.401
New Hampshire where we had an apartment and I persuaded my family to go with me.

358
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.200
The temperature was gorgeous,

359
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:42.201
the sun was shining and it was just a day to try it.

360
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.540
Um,
it was 6.4 miles round trip,

361
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.080
little over 2000 feet.
So think 70 houses.
I thought,
yeah,

362
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:56.850
I bet I can do 70 houses.
So as soon as we started off Casey,

363
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.540
now 11 years old and juniper just tore off,

364
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.490
and once they were out of sight,
I begged Larry to slow down.

365
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.910
He was already carrying all my gear.

366
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.580
I couldn't even manage my water bottle.

367
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.160
And then after the first mile,
I was stumbling and shambling along.

368
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.400
Larry was boosting me up over rocks and sometimes he went ahead and lean down

369
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:26.340
and pulled me up,
allege his,

370
00:28:26.341 --> 00:28:28.470
we got closer to the top.

371
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.680
I was literally grabbing a leg with both hands to pull it forward.

372
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.090
But I was so grateful to be back in the mountains again,

373
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.360
not just because of my quest and the and the 4,000 foot club,

374
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.240
but because I was back in the wild where I felt I belonged,

375
00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:54.270
where I felt like I was one with everything.

376
00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.200
Casey and Juniper summited first than Larry hauled me over the top.

377
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.510
I stood there breathing and shaking after I waved them on,

378
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.800
they wandered off to explore the broad ledges and taking the view.

379
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.470
Once my leg steadied,

380
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.450
I crossed the summit to the nearest edge expecting to see a pretty view of

381
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:22.320
skinny Waterville valley just from a different orientation.

382
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.090
I was wrong,
delightfully wrong.

383
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.500
Gazing eastward.
I marveled at Mount Tribe pyramid,

384
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.660
the brute size of it,

385
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.610
words rolled through my weary brain,
majestic,

386
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.980
powerful,
humbling.

387
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.880
I turned slowly to soak up the landscape,

388
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.320
allowing myself to believe that those sometimes nearly carried by Larry.

389
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.090
I had actually summited Osceola post cancer.

390
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.910
I turned to the northeastern view before me.

391
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.080
Spread wave after wave of mountain,
I counted.

392
00:30:05.081 --> 00:30:10.030
No fewer than seven ranges.
Each surging behind another.

393
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.660
They stretched to the rise in Emerald blue and as they marched farther away

394
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:20.950
shadowy,
so Rulien shapes that touched the deeper blue of sky.

395
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.440
I felt caught up in the motion of those rocky waves I could take off into those

396
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:31.441
mountains up and down and over until I knew each and every peak I could let go

397
00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:35.620
of my complicated city life and live in the mountains,

398
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.820
exploring them all day long and sleeping in them at night.

399
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:45.810
The vast astonishing beauty caused along with the joy and a lake.

400
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.880
The mountains called for grand jury and I was only one person and at that a

401
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:54.640
lesser version of who I was before.

402
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.780
If only I were a more tolerant,
better person,

403
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:04.590
I longed for everyone to experience this breaking open of the spirit that wasn't

404
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.440
once nourishing and illuminating and sweetly painful.

405
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:14.790
Here a world existed in which all things small and large,

406
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:21.150
mobile and rooted oxygen giving an oxygen absorbing had a place in a balanced

407
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.420
sacred whole.

408
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

409
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.000
<v 1>I was on such a mountain high.
I didn't even know I was high.</v>

410
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.630
I felt certain that if everyone could spend time in the mountains,

411
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:37.030
it would change the fabric of our society.

412
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.080
I was ready to hug all the strangers on Osceola,

413
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.630
invoke their promise to safeguard this place and take the lessons garnered here.

414
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:50.890
Back home to share.
We could organize mom.

415
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.600
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

416
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.460
<v 1>The sound of Casey's voice startled me deep in my mountain reverie.</v>

417
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.100
I'd forgotten she existed.

418
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.673
<v 2>Okay.</v>

419
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:08.450
<v 1>I hiked 43 of the 48 mountains in my fifties after cancer,</v>

420
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.670
finishing up in 2008 at the age of 58

421
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.980
doing the 4,000 footers inspired me to write a book.

422
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.840
And though it's not a novel,

423
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:26.820
I do feel that it helped me accomplish my dream of having a published book.

424
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.400
I finished my quest a different and I hope a better person,

425
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:35.140
certainly a more uh,

426
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.680
humble and grateful one one who better understood how little control she had

427
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:47.261
over life and who understood she needed to redefine success so that it met my

428
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:52.040
needs and fulfilled me.

429
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.360
And also one who took every opportunity to put herself in the embrace of nature.

430
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.930
Now I'm still getting out and hiking and in a few weeks I'll turn 68 I'm taking

431
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.940
my hiking experienced to other parts of the world for my 61st birthday,

432
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.750
Larry and I went to New Zealand.

433
00:33:15.751 --> 00:33:19.100
Do you see him there on the Kepler track?

434
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.160
One of the great walks in New Zealand.

435
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.290
We did this in late spring and we were totally shocked as was everyone else

436
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:29.840
around us to be faced with.

437
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:34.841
The danger of avalanches back in the u s Ginny and I signed up for Sierra Club

438
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:39.830
trip in the northern cascades of Washington.

439
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:44.900
The trip was called wild flowers and wander lust and it was gorgeous.

440
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:48.500
Here you see hikes pass up around uh,

441
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.480
10,000 feet

442
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.370
in the summer of 2017.

443
00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.640
Larry and I enjoyed a trip to Poland and here we are hiking the um,

444
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.980
highest of the Carpathian mountain range,

445
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:08.540
the high tat truss.

446
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.600
I leave you an end,
my story with three wishes.

447
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.600
May you continue to do your utmost to preserve and protect our planet and its

448
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:28.220
health.
Our only home before it's too late.

449
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.090
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

450
00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:34.630
<v 1>May you continue spending time outdoors,</v>

451
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.000
maybe even more than you already do,

452
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:43.080
whether that's noticing nature in the form of trees on the sidewalk or some

453
00:34:44.111 --> 00:34:48.010
little wheat that's grown up through cracks in the pavement.
I mean,

454
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.600
what a lesson in endurance and perseverance that is,

455
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:57.820
or better yet,
if you can get out into the wild,

456
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.450
I mean,
we were made to connect with nature,

457
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:06.990
and I hope you've come to understand some of the benefits I derived by spending

458
00:35:07.721 --> 00:35:11.830
as much time as I did and do out in nature.

459
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.310
And lastly,
may you succeed on your own quest,

460
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.760
whatever kind of mountains those involve,

461
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.120
I believe what Eleanor Roosevelt said,

462
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:31.170
the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

463
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.470
So keep dreaming.
Thanks for listening.
