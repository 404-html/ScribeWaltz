Thank you.
Um,

19
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.680
why don't we start by taking us back to Rwanda in 1994 and providing the context

20
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.080
and setting for this powerful and inspiring story.

21
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.210
<v 1>Um,
uh,
well,</v>

22
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.670
uh,
back in 1994,
I was,
uh,
I was four years old,

23
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.160
so some baby and I'd lived with my grandparents.
Um,

24
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.280
I remember the first day of the genocide on a pro seventh.

25
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.300
It was actually because the genocide started April 6th,
the night of [inaudible].

26
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.670
So I,

27
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.800
I lived in eastern province of Rwanda and the genocide had already started in

28
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.380
the city,

29
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.700
in the capital city of Rwanda and displayed throughout the country that in the

30
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:26.220
morning in eastern province.
Then that's where,

31
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.080
that's when the genocide began,
where it was and my grandparent's house.

32
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.540
And as a,
as a child,
I remember five in the morning,
my,
uh,

33
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.990
my aunt Agnes,
she woke up,
she woke us all up.

34
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.000
And uh,
as she,
as,
as I walked in the living room,

35
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.310
all,
all my cousins were sitting in the,
on the flow and my aunt,

36
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.293
um,

37
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.100
with feeling as though we're going to church see was my favorite activity.

38
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.680
Um,
I mean my childhood to get out of the house and go to church.

39
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.430
So it was really exciting and I am the,

40
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.450
and I screamed out loud to her that I wanted to dress my beautiful too,

41
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.770
to where my beautiful dress,
uh,

42
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.850
the group migrant that gave me the Christmas before that year.

43
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.430
And,
uh,
she,
she,
she shouldn't be too to not be loud.

44
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.350
If I need anything I should,
we spur from then on.
So it was a little bit scared,

45
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.900
but still wanting my dress and a,
and a,

46
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.330
my little dress was a white little dress with the three butterflies and I loved

47
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.980
it so much.
So it was my opportunity to wear it.
And she was,

48
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.490
she ran in the room and he brought it,

49
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.540
brought it back and just me out and give me a jar of milk because she was given,

50
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.540
we were more than almost 12 children in the house because before the genocide,

51
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.800
um,
the Hutu government used to kill or put in jail.

52
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.920
The tutes is who are young and seem to find back.

53
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.400
So in the preparation of the genocide so they can succeed.

54
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.360
That was one of the things they did,
um,
apart from,

55
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.800
aside from buying machetes.
And the uniforms and all of that was also,

56
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.800
yeah,
those part of it.
So my parents fled Rwanda before the genocides.

57
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.490
That's why I was in my grandparent's house.
But when,
uh,

58
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.870
when we're about to leave,

59
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.850
she give everyone if we're child a little something to eat or drink because she

60
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:29.320
didn't know where that journey will end.
And so it's,

61
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.740
so she gave me the milk.
Um,
but when we left the house,

62
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.160
the streets was,
was full of people.

63
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.600
People are being fleeing all night from Kigali and do,

64
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:41.990
hadn't been walking.
It's,

65
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.570
it's a 30 minute drive from Kigali to eastern province where it,

66
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:51.220
where it was.
But people had been working so they had a lot of things with them.

67
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.810
We're caring,
um,
mattresses and food and children.

68
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.790
It was just a lot,
a lot of people.
And um,

69
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.800
we joined them but I'm always,
um,

70
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.860
I didn't write in the book but I always had this feeling of a little shame

71
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.770
because it was somehow excited for me.

72
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.010
It was really exciting that moment and I always felt it.

73
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.590
And it never even told anyone cause like,

74
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.450
cause after the genocide or cause the how and the when I was growing up was how

75
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.400
did I feel that excitement's but as a child,
I don't know.

76
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.620
So as we were walking towards a catheter in,

77
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:37.480
in the,
in the city of,
in the small city of the view,
that village,
um,

78
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.760
there was a lot of,
we solos and songs,
uh,

79
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.800
the Hutus were singing songs of hate in the name of God.

80
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.050
And a,
and the,
we start started blowing around if we're in the heel is,
and,

81
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.750
and I don't know what happened that moment because I lost everyone.
Yes.

82
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.820
So you probably remember in the book and,
uh,

83
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.860
and I found myself in a home of puppet traders.
So they were,
my grandparents is,

84
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.770
uh,
neighbors.
I played with their children.
And,
uh,

85
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
I didn't really quite remember most of everything because we just stayed in me.

86
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.720
But I didn't,
we didn't know because after the genocide,

87
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.020
when we're United with my parents and my mom had to bring me back there.

88
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:23.460
So that I will not,
um,

89
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.340
end up like my father because my father had trauma and all of that and she

90
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:31.880
figured that will have the same thing as she wanted to know what happened to me

91
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:36.350
cause it was in this hot,
this home of perpetrators and nobody,

92
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.840
the new me and my family wasn't there.
So it was the only one,
uh,

93
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.950
lined up with so many other Tutsis and it was the little one there.

94
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.690
And they started killing everyone.

95
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.390
And as they got to me,
I,
um,

96
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.860
I asked for milk if I can drink my milk and,

97
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.730
and um,
I don't know where I got the thirst to ask for milk,

98
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.290
but the milk saved me.

99
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.770
It did because when I asked for milk was almost a confirmation to the puppy

100
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.150
traders that I am a Tutsi child and my parents are in the RPF.

101
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.640
They knew me,
they knew who I was.
So the resistance,
the resistance,

102
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:23.840
where in Uganda,
that's both my parents were there.
And of course those puppets,

103
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.270
where's is my neighbors?
So they knew who I was.
They knew my parents,

104
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:30.950
they knew the whole or ground.
But asking for milk,
it was,
um,

105
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.670
I will say this for maybe,
um,

106
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.870
I don't know if I'm right,
but in Rwanda,
before I came here,

107
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:43.260
they used to say a big was there for Jewish people.
They were,
there it goes.

108
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.140
So it was almost,

109
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.520
you were in the front of Nazis and you are a child and you're asking for a
Bagel.

110
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.440
So it's a confirmation that you are a Jew.
So,
um,

111
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.390
when I asked for me,
like culturally,
Tutsis owned cows,

112
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.120
so the know culture,
children of tutors drink milk in the morning and for dinner,

113
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:09.960
for lunch,
everything.
So asking them for milk,
they paused and mimic me.

114
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.760
And because,
um,
and started saying,
Oh,
you want to be a child of Tutsi,

115
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.260
if you did not ask for milk,

116
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.150
you won't be a cockroach or snack because they didn't really see us as humans.

117
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.300
So we're a snake or a cockroach on it.

118
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:28.120
In that moment when they were mimicking me and really aloud,
uh,

119
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.030
someone hurt them inside the house.
And it was,
that was that,

120
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.910
it was an ugly men who walked out and he saw me in the lion.

121
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.080
Um,
most,
most everyone was already killed.
Um,
and,
um,

122
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.630
we're very breathing and he,
um,

123
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.450
and he asked them why one day working.

124
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.890
So the way the propaganda's were on the,

125
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.510
the told the young Hutus CIFO killer is that it's work going out there and to

126
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:03.840
kill Tutsis,
it's a job.
It's a work.
You have to wake up and go work.

127
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.580
So when he walked outside Rita,
he was frustrated that they're not working,

128
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.080
they're just talking.
And he was Hutu as well.

129
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.390
She was who to me with the Grandpas,
those kids.
Yeah.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

130
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.980
and when he saw me in the line,
I don't know why he got PD,
but he,
uh,

131
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:25.070
he told them that they should be ashamed of killing an innocent child if w when

132
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.860
their wives are caring,
do children are different from me.
So he rushed in and,

133
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.830
and Steve to me,
um,
and,
and,
uh,

134
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.490
he put me in between his pair of his legs and then they finished everyone there

135
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.810
and he throw me under the bed.
So under a wooden bed in the house.

136
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.950
Um,
so that was the first day of the genocide.

137
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:54.000
And of course there were 90,
90 more days to go.
Yes.
Um,
and I,

138
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:57.510
I was a child,
so I didn't remember most of those days,

139
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.520
but my mom,
when my mom took me back there,
I had to,

140
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.410
I was almost seven or eight cause I had nightmares when I was growing up and I

141
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:12.411
wouldn't dream of dead people dying or people killing each other and that they

142
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.620
will be,
I would think in my dreams.
They are my family,
the people that I know.

143
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.680
So I couldn't really Shamil ally's my dreams and the reality like will take me a

144
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:26.870
time to go back to sleep when my mom would bring me every one of my brothers and

145
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.240
oh,
babysitters,
everyone.
So she will confirm to me that,
uh,

146
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.660
it was just a dream,
but when she helped me and take me back there,
um,

147
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.240
they started going away because they knew what really happened to me because I

148
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.540
could then pieces of,
uh,
of,
of that.

149
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.350
<v 0>Yes.
So there were,
um,</v>

150
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.800
I believe the stat is,
yeah,

151
00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:53.240
an estimated 1 million Rwandans were killed during the genocide.

152
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.220
20% of the population,

153
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.580
70% of the Tutsi population was killed.

154
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.420
Give us your sense of some of the,

155
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:11.140
the drivers of that level of hatred and what underpinned that type of activity

156
00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:20.900
that,
that drove that level of,
of hatred and genocide in,
in the country.

157
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.760
You mentioned colonialism,
the power of colonialism in there.
Okay.
Was

158
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.580
<v 1>going,
I'll let you go again.
Sure.
I know because,
uh,</v>

159
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.060
the more I grow older and learn more about like how,

160
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.450
cause I couldn't understand how it didn't might people kill each other.

161
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.030
We weren't,
we,
we spoke the same language.

162
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.950
We're all black when this tiny little country and how in the world,

163
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.280
how did we end up killing each other at dinner?

164
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.950
We understanding of course I would just learn how my father,

165
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.530
his entire family was wiped out and learning any,

166
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.560
you wouldn't learn anything from my dad except the pain that he's feeling

167
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.600
because he was already traumatized it.
Same with my mom.

168
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:04.020
So it was really a confusion.
And growing up in,

169
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.730
in Rwanda having that history,

170
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.270
I couldn't quite a really understand the reason behind it.

171
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.320
So I think when I was 18,

172
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400
I got the chance to go to the ruin a genocide museum and learn the history and

173
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:20.140
background of the genocide for the first time.

174
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.490
And that's the first time that I was able to have compassion even towards

175
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.440
children,

176
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.100
out of perpetrators because then I started feeling them how they feel if they

177
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:33.370
know that their families has done such a thing.
That's like a,

178
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.960
it's just a shame that you carry on and do we end?
They didn't even do anything.

179
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.300
So I ha I learned so much about what [inaudible] calls the genocide,

180
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.410
but we read it to really understand those three months of the genocide,

181
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.330
you have to revisit the cornea or the Colonia error.
Sure.
Because before the,

182
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.490
the colonial era,
um,

183
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.510
the Rwandans did not have tribes or ethnics or classes,
you know,

184
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.370
it was classes actually.
So,
uh,
we was,

185
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.320
the Tutsis were the elite class and the Hutus with the,
the,
the,

186
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:13.060
the middle class in the twin or the word poor.
And,
and the hunters mainly.

187
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.020
So they lived together.
They shared everything.
And you,

188
00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:20.110
if you own more than 10 cows,

189
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.320
you will join the Tutsi class because we did not have money.

190
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.520
So we'll count the richness.
I don't know how to say it in English,
but,

191
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:36.010
well a few wealth,
it depends on how many colors that you have.
So,
uh,

192
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.470
when the colonias came,
which I always feel like we're really,
uh,

193
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.650
it was an in 19,
early 1930 days.
And that for me,

194
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:48.010
I feel like we can never give what we don't have.

195
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.940
So when the Germans came in Rwanda back then,

196
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.350
you know what was happening in New York,
it was holocaust that was going on.

197
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.690
And that's the only thing they brought in a Rwanda.

198
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:02.020
So they started categorizing Rwandans,
studying them,

199
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.010
measuring their noses are dividing them.
And uh,

200
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.190
seeing the Tutsis are told that lighter skin,

201
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.120
they probably are from Ethiopia.
So,
um,

202
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.320
they're not from saint choice Africa and the Hutus are the,

203
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.160
so they wouldn't really measuring everyone to putting them in the classes and

204
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.950
they used to give them ID cards.
Um,

205
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.360
and I don't know how my people,
they accepted that,

206
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:32.200
but I don't know cause that's,
yeah,
I was way before it was born.

207
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.450
But they learned how different they were.
It took few decades to,

208
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.780
for them to really,
I guess it's easy to teach hate

209
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.730
because they learn in only three decades.
And when they,

210
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.140
when the Germans left and give the country to the Belgians because the Germans

211
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:53.390
were,
were losing power in Africa,
um,

212
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.800
the Belgiums had Congo and Congo is huge and had them ends and all that.

213
00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:01.130
So they give one or two Belgian so they can rule it together.

214
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.330
But really Rwanda had nothing.
It did not have minerals,
didn't have,

215
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.100
sue was just a little part of Africa.
Small and the beautiful,

216
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:13.770
they can just have the,
almost a headquarters.
So,
um,

217
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.250
in 19,
in 1959,
the,
the killed the king.

218
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:19.791
They say,

219
00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:24.791
I'm not 100% sure if the really the Belgians poison the king in de Bruyn de,

220
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.540
but when they did kill the king,
um,
the,
the,

221
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:30.410
the Hutus to cover.

222
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.990
So when they'll colonias in Aronda they promise they built schools,

223
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.710
hospitals.
Um,
and those,
all those privileges were,

224
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.450
were for the elite class.
So the WHO,

225
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:47.060
two children wouldn't go to those schools.

226
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:52.470
So really the constantly began from what we are having more than we are and this

227
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:58.310
is a lowland,
how dare you have all of this.
So when the Hutus got in power,

228
00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.600
they were already angry.

229
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.650
The Tutsis that they are not from there and they're having everything.

230
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:05.120
So they wanted to kill everyone.

231
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.160
So the civil war really began in 1959.
And the,

232
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.290
the,
the key the child does,

233
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:17.291
prince fled with a lot of Tutsis and the neighboring countries and um,

234
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.260
the tutors who stay in the country lived in fear.
So the,

235
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.860
everywhere in the country they started learning how the tutors are not humans.

236
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.220
So those propagandas the name calling really begun.

237
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.380
I in 1915 and there was a lot of civil war in [inaudible] 68 to 72.

238
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.170
Um,
so really the,
the 1994 it was,
it was,
uh,

239
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.450
it was,
it was,
it was,

240
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:45.830
it was the time for the race to race on the planet.

241
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.440
And it was well organized,

242
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:53.441
well planned because I remember when I was growing up hearing stories that on

243
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:57.440
how the government will give,

244
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.870
cause he used to train young people who are at 16,
15.
Um,

245
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.730
and then we'll train them how to kill and with the traditional weapons.

246
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.080
Um,
and there's the,
there's this one with them.
They used to call.

247
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.400
It's really interesting cause they,

248
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.050
that's the one they wanted to use or to use on me.
And as a child I never get it.

249
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:22.040
Like even the weapon is cold.
No period for the enemy.

250
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:26.180
How can my child be an enemy?
Because you really don't even know who you are.

251
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.550
But I'm there.
When they were training the CFO killers,
um,
the,

252
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:36.580
they give away free small radios and these radios,

253
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.540
you could chart them on the sun.
Now this is a very poor country,

254
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.380
but,
but um,
how hatred can really work.

255
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:49.970
He will spend everything you have to really succeed in Haiti and in Haiti.

256
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.660
So the,
the,
the,
um,
that's why the genocide succeeded in only three months.

257
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:58.230
In a million people were killed because neighbors were killing neighbors.

258
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.990
And in one night they were ready for it.
They,
in one night,
those radios,

259
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:08.880
the only thing that was on radios was go kill the enemy.
Hmm.
Um,

260
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.240
and do you just,
it just happened like that,

261
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.760
but it was already in the hearts of people.
Yeah.
People won't,

262
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.090
they justified it because they couldn't,
they didn't,

263
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.480
they had already learned for a long time that the Tutsis are not human.
Yes.
Yeah.

264
00:18:22.481 --> 00:18:26.900
So,
um,
I think,
I think even in,
uh,

265
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.230
in the world today,

266
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.490
people justify calling each other names and um,
yeah.
And,

267
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.980
and they forget that when you're doing that,
you're actually losing year.

268
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.730
You're human.
Yeah.
She managed it because being a human is being,

269
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.010
having,
loving and being kind and having compassion towards each other,

270
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.810
but mostly the popular trails.

271
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:53.190
I actually think of themselves as more human as,
yeah.

272
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.330
That's the other side.

273
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.020
<v 0>So let's,</v>

274
00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:01.230
let's talk about your story more directly because the memoir really focuses so

275
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:09.001
much on the family and you're familiar relationships and there are a source of

276
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.610
both power and a comfort.

277
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.890
But also,
um,

278
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.230
there was a lot of difficulty connected with the relationship with your,

279
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.420
with your mom,
especially with your dad.

280
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.980
The separation of them is you mentioned when you were a child.
Um,

281
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.940
but also like the valor of the extended family,

282
00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:38.941
people like on to Agnes who were rescuers in many ways.

283
00:19:39.131 --> 00:19:40.450
So as a child,

284
00:19:40.451 --> 00:19:44.890
how did you process family then?
How,

285
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.920
how did it play a role in your sense of survival and as you reflect now as an

286
00:19:51.251 --> 00:19:54.040
adult woman,
how do those,
uh,

287
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.690
those perspectives on family,
how are they different or similar?

288
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.970
<v 1>I think it cultivates it coated in something in me that was,</v>

289
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.440
uh,
these life is not just from me.
And I think it's kind of,
it's,

290
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.880
it's,
it's,
um,
it's kind of like a nice idea.
It's a savior.

291
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.900
Like it can save your soul because then you become stronger than you can eat.

292
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.770
You can think because you're leaving for your siblings,

293
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.920
you're leaving for somebody else.
And,
um,

294
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.670
and I remember at 13 years old I couldn't,
I couldn't understand the life.

295
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.740
I couldn't,
I couldn't understand life.
My,
uh,
I have,
when genocide ended,

296
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.700
I had just made my parents for the first time since birth.
So was always really,

297
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.020
really excited to experience love from a parent for the first time.

298
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.160
But it was not there.
Um,
the hardware were already destroyed.
They had,
my parents

299
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.900
<v 2>had lost his siblings,
his nieces,
his parents,
and he couldn't see life.</v>

300
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.450
And that's the person I was supposed to learn from,

301
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.050
how to love life and all of that.
My mother was the same.
She never,

302
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.450
she was strong,
very strong.
She never cried.

303
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.190
I never saw her crying for help siblings.
But the other day for the first time,

304
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.290
23 years later,
she cried for her brothers and she,

305
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.220
cause she was in a therapy session and,
and then she called me,
she said,

306
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:18.150
I think I'm being weaker.
And I said,
why?
She said,

307
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:23.190
I promised my family that I stayed so that I can take care of their family,

308
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.450
their children,
but now I am.

309
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.630
So she never really took the time to grieve.
And,
um,
and I think that's where,
um,

310
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.570
even for me it was more of like,
even when,
uh,
when I was about to,
this is it,

311
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:42.180
I don't really want this life.
Why would God create life if meant to suffer?
Um,

312
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.830
I remember when to this lake in the north of Rwanda and,
uh,

313
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.230
I had to really,
really giving up on life.
But when I got there,

314
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.940
we lived with my father then and he was always traumatized.

315
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:56.980
Then for some reason he's trauma is trauma,

316
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.550
told him that he will be easier if he will be,
um,

317
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.310
then,
but not with a machete.
It's,

318
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.980
they didn't want us to suffer as his family did.
So,

319
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.490
so would really suffered from that and will flee all the time from him.
And,

320
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.510
and this time I said,
this is it.
I'm done.
But when I got there,

321
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:22.650
for some reason I thought of my brothers and sister and I thought,

322
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.980
Whoa,
how were they going to take the news?
How were they going to leave if,

323
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.180
if I'm the oldest and I'm doing this for,
so I've,

324
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.600
I've cried for them and fell asleep.
Thank God.

325
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:40.650
And I woke up around 6:00 PM when a gardener was kicking me and kicking me out

326
00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:41.560
of the,

327
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.820
the other beach because the children were not allowed to stay there later than

328
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:49.900
six.
So those kind of little moments saved my life.

329
00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:54.901
But I think was more because my family had this value of loving the entire

330
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:00.580
family.
Even when they found out you were long

331
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.370
lost cousin,
you weren't they?
Yes.
And this,
this,

332
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:10.710
that protection that when my aunt doing that,
my aunt was my age,
Jake,

333
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:15.100
almost my age to other genocide,
Agnes and she took care of all those children.

334
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:17.740
She was the only adult in the fence.
She never had children.

335
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.550
And she had my brother through all those three months in her back.

336
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:28.150
Um,
so,
and even when she tried to leave him,
she did not because,
you know,

337
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:29.260
fleeing,
running,

338
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.200
and now I cannot imagine myself doing what she did.
Um,

339
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.320
when I think of it as like,

340
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:39.310
would I really be able to take care of all these children if anything happens?

341
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.773
But,
um,

342
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.780
I think when you extend yourself to be something bigger than yourself,

343
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.780
he actually helps you.
It helps you not,
yeah.

344
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.560
More than you can imagine.
Yeah.
So talk,

345
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.670
talk to us about the,
the escape to Uganda

346
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:04.070
or did you get out ultimately,
um,

347
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.190
during the genocide?
During the genocide?
Well,
um,

348
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.140
so in eastern province it's the one main road that goes all the way to Uganda.

349
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.830
Um,
and when we're fleeing,
um,

350
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.810
we were heading to Uganda,
we,
which we did not really make it there,

351
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.070
but I remember a few things went because on the way there,

352
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.320
my dad who was,
uh,
was big in the military in the,

353
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.620
in the RPF,
when he really came back,

354
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.030
he was looking for us and he looked for us first.
Uh,

355
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.490
and he couldn't find us.

356
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:44.660
We found that we made in the streets cause he's so my aunt and he recognized her

357
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.650
and then he came,
he came to us,
but I didn't know him.

358
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:53.410
My baby brother did not and he wanted to take us and my,
um,

359
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.260
my brother crying cause he didn't know who this guy was.

360
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.270
And my aunt looked at me,

361
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:02.090
she had her way of looking and you'll know what she's talking about.

362
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.990
She's a really strong woman.
And she looked at me and she said that,

363
00:25:05.991 --> 00:25:10.250
then you go,
this is your dad and we'll meet you.

364
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.240
So cause I was,
she couldn't really carry all of us.

365
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.640
So I put him on a motorcycle.

366
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.350
He wasn't a motorcycle then and we actually went back.
So my aunt is,

367
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.340
my aunt was going to Uganda because my dad was on a mission.

368
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.470
He brought me back,
uh,
in,
in Rwanda.
Which,

369
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.240
um,
those,
those are,

370
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.130
those are memories that didn't leave me because when we were going back,

371
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.620
if there were dead bodies everywhere and,
and,
and uh,
in the streets.

372
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.400
And I remember it was fun meeting on him.
Um,
cause I was,

373
00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:50.170
I was holding him from the back and I,

374
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.330
I would try to closing my eyes,
but I was smelling because had been there.

375
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.050
Um,
yeah.
So she,

376
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.080
few days later he left me in a comp soldiers come cause he was,

377
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.640
um,
he was,
he went on a mission.
I left,
made some soldiers and it was,

378
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:08.474
it didn't go well.

379
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.490
So you have to take me back to my eyes because I couldn't eat and drink or do

380
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:18.020
anything.
And they decided to find my aunt because my aunt told before,

381
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.860
culturally,
because the tension that was in Rwanda,

382
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.460
they already knew that they did not like each other tribes.

383
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.010
So even when you were a child,
they will tell you never eat in a stranger's home.

384
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.630
That's right.
Or never take anything from a stranger.

385
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.790
So I couldn't open my mouth for anything from anybody that I don't know,

386
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.510
except it wasn't my aunt or someone I know.
So when my dad took me,

387
00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:45.000
I didn't know him and I didn't know anybody,
so I did not have any even water.

388
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.420
So he decided to take me find my aunt and we went to the center,

389
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:53.340
a small center and,

390
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:57.480
but things were really getting bad because then it was not just my shit.

391
00:26:57.481 --> 00:27:02.000
Is the government though the military,
the Hutu government,
the,

392
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.340
the x far you just to call them.
Yeah.

393
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.090
The x far had started fighting with,
uh,
with,
uh,

394
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.550
without a PFS was not now.

395
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:15.840
It wasn't just not running from somebody was running from bullets,

396
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:20.340
from grenades.
And it was,
it was then,
it was a war.
Yeah.

397
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.370
So this place where my aunts,

398
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:27.050
where we're hiding where the are a Pfo was rescue,
I don't,

399
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.630
the rest of fuels tutors never hide left and put them in small centers and

400
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.123
gotten them.

401
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:38.340
Then the who took government would throw grenades on those places.

402
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.080
So when it got there,
that's what I,
I've,

403
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:46.170
I guess I fell asleep when my dad was taking me there and I woke up in with my

404
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:51.140
aunt and,
uh,
was everything was flying.
And um,

405
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.050
so,
um,
yeah.
So it was those kind of,

406
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.120
those kind of moments.
Yeah.
Yeah.

407
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.140
<v 0>So the title of your book is,</v>

408
00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:04.880
is embracing survival and if you,

409
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.900
if you had to try and locate what were those things that allowed you to survive

410
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:17.170
and to kind of emerge to where you are today sitting on this stage,

411
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:19.970
where,
where do you locate those,

412
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.250
those critical things that allowed you to hold on and to survive during that

413
00:28:25.251 --> 00:28:26.084
time?

414
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.210
<v 2>Hmm.
Well,
I think,</v>

415
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.670
you know,
it's,
um,
the surviving the genocide.

416
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:40.080
It's one thing then surviving after surviving,
it's another thing.

417
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.650
Yeah.
Cause um,

418
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.480
cause it's really hard because you life just changes completely.

419
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.880
And of course you don't know any other life and,

420
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.100
and that's the only thing that is around you.

421
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:57.840
So it's really one way you survive or then,
or you die.

422
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.890
Um,
most of the survivors did not,
they're all,

423
00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:06.570
most of them I reckon my dad or the or the already passed away after the

424
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:11.571
genocide or they became alcoholic or drags or twice you to just anything that

425
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:18.870
will just make them not think.
So it was really those,
those traces that we had.

426
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.710
And um,
and for me,
I guess I was,

427
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:28.470
I d I guess my dad was more of like a learning for me.

428
00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:32.850
So I always cause even when,
when I was having those nightmares as a kid,

429
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.720
my mom would be like,
I cannot take it.
If you end up like your dad.

430
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.800
And she was really strict streets,
she wouldn't,
if I remember when it was,

431
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.240
my biggest dream was to go to boarding school to turn 12 and go to a boarding

432
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:49.660
school.
And the Sh.
I remember when I was going to school,

433
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:54.070
she told me like,
you know,
when you're sending your kid to school or girl,

434
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.080
you would tell her some things like to take care of yourself.

435
00:29:58.081 --> 00:30:00.910
What are some sweet things?
No,
she was,

436
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:06.610
don't dare get traumatized.
So I really carry,

437
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:10.000
I did carry that with me and I knew that if,

438
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.130
if I'm broken inside,

439
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.780
that's what I'm going to be giving and I will try so hard to do.
When I loved,

440
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.270
I loved singing,
I loved writing.

441
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:23.060
So I would rate my emotions down and I'm seeing,
oh,

442
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.060
become a church girl or,
so I do all those little things,

443
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:33.061
but I didn't know that was my survival techniques until then.

444
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.880
I was here three and a half years ago and I remember calling my survivor friend

445
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.830
after two weeks and they told her,
you know,

446
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.890
I didn't know that one can sleep all night,

447
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.500
all night long without anything,
just flipping.

448
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.820
Yes.
So really for me,
when I was growing up,
sleeping was luxury.

449
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:59.320
Like knowing that you're going to sleep in,
just sleep all night.
And,
um,
and I,

450
00:30:59.321 --> 00:31:04.180
and I guess I ended up learning how to embrace that life.

451
00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.900
Yeah.

452
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.490
And just the way it was in love with the way it was and just knowing that

453
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:14.020
there's someone out there who was leaving a worst life.
Donna,

454
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.780
how was that saves me in going to the museum,

455
00:31:17.781 --> 00:31:22.450
seeing this children who are my age.
Um,
what do you not survive?

456
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.060
It made me for the first time,
I appreciate it.

457
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:29.210
The person who walked out and choose to save me,
but,
well,

458
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.650
I'd never met him.
I wish he goes,
when we went back,

459
00:31:31.651 --> 00:31:36.570
he had already passed away women to see his wife,
but I always feel this,
um,

460
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:42.100
this gratitude towards his,
so,
you know,
the,
and those people are around there.

461
00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:45.130
We have a lot of good people like that,
but he did save me.

462
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:48.820
And for some reason I just seem like,
why am I even alive?

463
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.360
So there's a reason and,
uh,
and it's not just for me,

464
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.770
it's for other children out there who are going through the same thing.

465
00:31:56.771 --> 00:32:00.760
To know that there is hope.
Tomorrow's going to be okay.

466
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.250
<v 0>Which is where you're devoting your life to now.
Yeah.</v>

467
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.600
So we're gonna open it up for questions if,

468
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.140
if folks want to throw up at the mix.
Um,

469
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.850
so bring us up to today.
What,

470
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:19.140
what's the status of Rwanda today?
Um,

471
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.980
how were you,
how were you connected to the country?

472
00:32:22.981 --> 00:32:26.580
How have things changed?
What's your perspective there?

473
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.170
<v 2>I think Rhonda today is,
is okay.</v>

474
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:36.470
I wouldn't say that he's perfect because it's only been 23 years and it takes a

475
00:32:37.641 --> 00:32:42.170
long time to peace then teaching.

476
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.450
He taught some reason hate this really loud.

477
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:49.460
And when love is like quiet and people don't like to one pill,

478
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.490
it's vulnerable.
Yes.

479
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.580
So we don't get to learn it as much as when hate goes over there,

480
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.750
but we're trying to learn to have reconciliation,
forgiveness,

481
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.890
having survivors learn how to forgive because it's really more for the survivor,

482
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.090
uh,
to be able to leave after,
after the journals,

483
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.380
the survival.
Um,
and I,

484
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.630
I love The v after genocide,

485
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:19.400
they actually learned that there were no reason to have tribes.

486
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.960
So Tho those stores some people's hearts and minds.

487
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:28.250
But in our ID cards there's no tribes.

488
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.750
You're just a London,

489
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.760
which was a big Stape and I hope maybe we'll take a generations and generations.

490
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:37.870
I,
but I,
I,
I hope that one day,
um,

491
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.170
younger children's,
we'll look at each other and just see them,

492
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.740
see each other as humans,
not thinking twice about,

493
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:50.030
cause that's how he grew up and grew up looking at my Lou,
my classmates.

494
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:53.420
And the first thing I'll want to know is where they're coming from,

495
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:55.940
what their tribe and my enemies and then they are not,

496
00:33:55.941 --> 00:33:57.750
they are just children like me.
Yes.

497
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.090
So the country is trying to move forward and heal,

498
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:05.480
but it will take very and very long time.

499
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.190
<v 0>Yeah.
Any questions so far?
Okay.
Um,</v>

500
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.540
so just staying on the,

501
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:16.430
on the topic of contemporary situation in Africa specifically,

502
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:21.490
I share with you an article by Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times.

503
00:34:23.331 --> 00:34:28.280
And the title of this article was conflict is more profitable than piece.

504
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.540
And the,
the article was about the Cert,

505
00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:37.460
the current situation in the Central African Republic and the genocide.

506
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:42.020
That's been happening there for about 14 years now.
Um,

507
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:47.140
and the premise of the article was that for us to actually eradicate poverty and

508
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.320
all of the difficulties in developing countries,

509
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:59.650
we have to first deal with conflict and apparently 80% of UN humanitarian

510
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:07.361
budgets these days goes to dealing with conflict as opposed to getting people

511
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:12.320
food and those sorts of things.
So what,

512
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.160
what do you think is behind that kind of intractable issue of conflict in places

513
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:24.800
like the central,
the Central African Republic,
South Sudan,

514
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.190
Yamen what,
what is the,

515
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:33.310
what is the answer there in terms of dealing with that kind of a conflict that

516
00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:36.740
just continues to perpetuate itself?

517
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.820
<v 2>I think for me,
I think,
um,</v>

518
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.020
you when or because they can look,
look,

519
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.130
look over the whole entire world.
For me,
I think it's really,

520
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.150
cause when there's conflict it takes a lot of work to fix it,

521
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:59.010
but there's ways that you can see the conflict is coming and to prevent it

522
00:35:59.011 --> 00:36:03.690
before it happens to really less work.
Then you donate grow coach,

523
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.710
how would you call it?
Raw Red Cross,
right.
There is a lot of,

524
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.940
um,
a lot of,
um,

525
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.660
a lot of work when there's conflicts,
people that it's not really profitable.

526
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.420
Well,
I don't know.
His point was that it's profitable for the perpetrator,

527
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:25.230
the puppy treader but they kind of,
uh,
for me,

528
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:27.930
I think the puppy traders,
they think they're profiting,

529
00:36:27.931 --> 00:36:30.780
but they're not because most of the time for me,

530
00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:34.230
I think the puppet or is doing the general side,
where are they now?

531
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.620
They don't have a life.
They're the,

532
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:43.530
they're in prison or they're fleeing all of her.

533
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.770
But can you imagine if you've taken millions of lives,

534
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.090
you're not really profiting maybe in that moment,
but he would,

535
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.890
he just,
I,
they just need to be informed.
And most of the time,
um,

536
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.940
we need to really educate people the importance of profiting from peace because

537
00:37:02.881 --> 00:37:06.390
it's more profitable.
You have more joy,
you are happy,

538
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:11.230
and when you're happy,
everything makes sense.
Yeah.

539
00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.900
So I,
I think if they can be able to prevent it before it happens,

540
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:20.760
if they can be able to share this world,
because I guess,

541
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:23.290
I dunno why,
but one,
um,

542
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.170
one person say that we share the same sky,

543
00:37:27.171 --> 00:37:32.171
we share the same sun because we don't have control over them.

544
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:38.190
So we can't really fight for it.
But we'd learned,
um,

545
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.320
people should think it.
Think about it the fan wise because really what is home,

546
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:49.230
it's where my hard is because you just find,
you find yourself there.

547
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.000
You never ask where to be born,

548
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:54.990
unifies the color of your skin or ask family rules.

549
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.280
I really want to be born in a very,
very wealthy family.
No,

550
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:01.260
that's never going to happen.
You just find yourself there.

551
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.480
So why in the world who would you blame somebody to be born the way they are?

552
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:11.700
It's just more of like educating our children for educating,
uh,

553
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:15.990
we in the,
in the curriculums,
they should really include peacebuilding.

554
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.913
They should,

555
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:21.330
they should teach children to love each other and just be as if you're teaching

556
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:25.350
a history,
but have,
have the importance of peace.

557
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.840
How it is,
how I fixed individuals and,
and uh,
knowing,
giving the children that,

558
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:36.430
just giving them that,
I think it's having a PC as well.

559
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.890
If it's life and if we don't have peace,
we don't have life.
Yes.

560
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:45.040
So they're the UN and they should learn.

561
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:50.070
I don't try to create a system where if a child is born,

562
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.570
they don't even think twice then,
oh,

563
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.970
I am this color or I'm this or that's that.

564
00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:00.140
Just see ourselves as humans and the won't,

565
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:05.160
we won't have to deal with people killing each other or the entitlements.

566
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.300
This is my land,
this is mine.
And just knowing that we can,

567
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.490
I think the world is not that poor.
No,
we make it,

568
00:39:13.491 --> 00:39:16.710
pour it or we have more than a week we should and,

569
00:39:16.711 --> 00:39:18.820
and then there are people will not have anything.

570
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:24.060
So if we can be able to have compassion and give more and prevent this kind of

571
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.990
killings in Rwanda,

572
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:32.020
we hired someone seeing it before it happened.

573
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.000
I guess millions of people have.
Hundreds of people would have been saved.
Yeah,

574
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.223
yeah.

575
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.280
<v 3>Yes sir.
Thank you for being here.
Thank you.</v>

576
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:46.510
Your story is amazing and you are truly inspirational.

577
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.323
Um,

578
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.720
can you tell us if you're involved with any organizations or efforts here?

579
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.800
Uh,
as you said,
you know,

580
00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.340
hate somehow screams and love is more vulnerable.

581
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:01.893
Uh,

582
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:07.470
some curious about efforts that you're involved with to help teach children or

583
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:13.021
just people in general about compassion and love and acceptance and tolerance

584
00:40:13.331 --> 00:40:14.740
and all of that good stuff.

585
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:19.900
<v 1>I am,
um,
I am involved with this one.
Um,</v>

586
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.460
a nonprofit,

587
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:26.320
it's called tea at night and it was founded by a farmer.

588
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.650
White supremacy is,
he's my friend.

589
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:36.500
I met him the first time,
my find,
my first talk when I got here.

590
00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:40.000
It was three months after I got here,
my English,
some horrible,
but he had,

591
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.140
he had patience to listen to me and uh,

592
00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:46.150
and they learned so much about his work and,

593
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.420
and it was a curious because when I came here,
before I came here,

594
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.030
I learned a lot about,
about the,

595
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:56.170
about the civil right movements and all of these things,
the history of America.

596
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:59.320
And he was like,
oh my God.
Like if this is a lot,

597
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.050
but I know what's a lot of movies.

598
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.490
Cause when I met him with all these tattoos and he has a really very heavy voice

599
00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.550
because he was a rock and roll when he was young.

600
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.050
So he's voices are greeted and I was strong.
Um,

601
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.820
he told me about his work and I asked him,
how,
how did you change?

602
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:21.100
And he said,
you know,
I,

603
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:27.240
I changed because I had a daughter and it was very young and it was a single

604
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:29.650
died in one day where I,

605
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:34.150
the other store in the car and my daughter,

606
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:38.480
so at what men walking?
And she said,
Oh dad,

607
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.690
look at that Nigga at four years old.

608
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.760
So for the first time,

609
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:48.761
that's when that word sounded wrong in his ears.

610
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.130
And he,
he told her to never say it.

611
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.480
And he tried because he had learned so much the compassion when he was,

612
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.990
it was at a thing in his 20s.
Um,

613
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.020
he had received a lot of kindness from a Jewish person,

614
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.020
from a black person that helped him because it was,
oh,

615
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:09.230
it was too drunk or just in a misery.

616
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.770
Because mostly when you have the hate we are,
you are hurting yourself.
You know,

617
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:14.900
you're not happy at all.

618
00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:17.870
You just want to blame the entire world because of your misery.

619
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:22.130
But when he changed,
he became,
he's a wonderful Saul.

620
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.010
He's an amazing person.
Sometimes I tell him,

621
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:30.280
are you doing this because you're paying back?
And uh,
but he just,

622
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:34.610
so he has this group that you,
he leaves in Milwaukee and I,
I,
I told,

623
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.350
I speak to the children.
They actually designed,
the children are 14,
13.

624
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.360
They designed this cover out would have done them since a huge poetry they met

625
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:48.740
when I was finishing my book and they send me a picture and I was like,
oh my,

626
00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:52.880
this is going to be my book cover.
So,
um,
these children,

627
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.940
the serve two unite,

628
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:58.670
they learn piece and I share with them my story and they ask me questions.

629
00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.970
Really beautiful.
Children are very,
very authentic.

630
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.820
They tell you what they think.
So there's those programs and um,

631
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.440
and I work with our last deal.
My friend Aaron is,

632
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.870
is here and his wife,
they're the founder of the,

633
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:19.740
I'm not a prophet and a helping children,
um,

634
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:24.470
to learn,
um,
and uh,
to go to call to nicer schools,

635
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:28.580
children from underserved communities.
Um,

636
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.350
so I end up with age is trust.
That's when I started in my public speaking,

637
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.650
sharing my story and learning the,
um,

638
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.930
learning the history and not just the Veranda,

639
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.410
but what really is relevant to the entire world.

640
00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:45.950
Because I think we all are looking for the same thing to be happy.

641
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.110
We just look for it in different ways.

642
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:52.460
But if we can be informed and how to find it in the right way,

643
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:56.540
I think we're able to change.
And I sit with our,
no,
I stayed,

644
00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:01.750
my friend used to be a white supremacy and I met this person who,

645
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:06.890
um,
who's in the KKK.
I was for some,

646
00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.170
somehow I find myself myself in the sewers,
but,

647
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.050
but this guy,
um,
he,

648
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.620
his name is Chris,
he was reforming.

649
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:22.790
So he was still in the K K K and I didn't even know that care care case still

650
00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:24.020
exist,
but it does.

651
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.830
So he was sitting across from me and trying to reform.

652
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.980
But I so how when when we were talking about

653
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:36.420
<v 2>about love and he was really shy,</v>

654
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:41.400
he didn't want to let it out but,
and that we'll ask him so many questions,

655
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:45.420
why do you do these and did the,
why did you do that?
But when he got to the,

656
00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:49.350
where I asked him,
so are you a cure with Muslim?

657
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.540
He was really aggressive and really aggressive.

658
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:58.440
I got scared and then you could talk like really talk and it was like,
yes,

659
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.720
I am going to say how,
why,
how about children who are Muslim?
And he said,

660
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.290
you never know.
You never know what those kids have done.

661
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:09.450
There was say why in those dresses?
And they say,

662
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.600
what do you mean there's like maybe they have something,
a bomb or anything.

663
00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:16.590
So he was,
then he became the person that he is.

664
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.500
But when he was learning how to reform,

665
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.370
when he was trying to be a nice person in the front,
in front of a black girl,

666
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.920
she was really quiet and shy and,
and he would even cry.

667
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.900
Um,
because they told him it was the first time,

668
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:35.390
it's a facade across a table with a black person.
And,

669
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:39.900
and I think,
uh,
if we can,
we can be able to switch to that.

670
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.580
He can use that,

671
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:46.710
that strength and that strength in him that comes out when he thinks about what

672
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:51.120
he hates so much to use it when it's thinking about what he loves so much.

673
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.100
And I think we all have that capacity.
We can,
we,
cause we grow up what we feed,

674
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.000
you know,

675
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.590
we have those two sides in ourselves and we'll feed more light in us.

676
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.150
We really,
it really,

677
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.840
it really comes up cause I used to not be this girl.

678
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.340
I used to be angry all the time about to everyone and everything.

679
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.310
You're shocked.
Leave that are used to today.

680
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.120
Thank you.
And I used to have and my mom,

681
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:24.510
I will spend months and not talking to my mom,
blaming her,

682
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.410
not giving me the life of that I want and she doesn't really have any.

683
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:32.790
But I still always still feel like I want more from her and whatever that was

684
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:34.080
not going on in my life.

685
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:37.350
I'll find somebody to blame the children of perpetrators.

686
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:40.890
I blame them that they have everything on.
I don't,
and it's because of them.

687
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:44.040
So banging of victimization mode,

688
00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:49.340
it makes us like giving ourselves a justification of um,

689
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.030
of hating and,
and we're really,
really,

690
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.640
when you hate for some reason,
I don't know.
Cause you know,

691
00:46:56.641 --> 00:46:58.950
even children when they don't want something there,

692
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.420
they come out like really strong.
Like I don't want that.

693
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:06.240
And then when they left something that miss shy away.

694
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:11.070
But I think that's what we learn so we can really be able to teach how to be

695
00:47:11.071 --> 00:47:14.790
excited when something wonderful is happening.
How,

696
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:19.050
or we've done something wonderful than,
uh,
than we can.

697
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:23.330
We can change the way we see life and yeah.

698
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.290
Thank you.
Thanks for being here.
You're incredible.

699
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.040
You my

700
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.450
<v 4>question is more about the post genocide and recovery,</v>

701
00:47:32.451 --> 00:47:34.630
specifically the role that the government plays in that.

702
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:39.050
I think if you look at the immediate years following and the way that Paul

703
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.740
Kagame they've really embraced international trade and turn the economy around

704
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:45.610
really quickly is undeniable,
but then you fast forward to today,

705
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:49.670
almost 20 years later,
some people would say he's an authoritarian.
Um,

706
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.830
I don't know if that's true or not,

707
00:47:50.831 --> 00:47:54.700
but I'm curious if you think that you guys are in a place where you can now have

708
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:56.890
more of a,
somewhat of a cleaner democracy,

709
00:47:56.891 --> 00:47:59.740
if you still think that it needs to be a lot tighter government control to keep

710
00:47:59.741 --> 00:48:03.010
things back on,
to keep things on track.
Thank you.

711
00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:05.000
That's a really tough one.

712
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.733
<v 5>It's Google.</v>

713
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.670
<v 1>I did not know what I'm getting myself into.</v>

714
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:21.030
Um,
so Rwanda very,
it's a very complicated country,

715
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.770
very complicated.

716
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:27.750
And as you can imagine after the genocide,

717
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.873
um,

718
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.150
the country was a mess and um,
and do behind a lot of,

719
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.630
uh,
people different.
I don't know.

720
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.350
Let me see how I'm going to describe this because we had two t's,

721
00:48:43.351 --> 00:48:47.580
will fled Rwanda.
The were the ones I explained it and they 10 to 50 years,

722
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.840
so they grew up in neighboring countries in Burundi,
Congo,

723
00:48:51.841 --> 00:48:56.620
Uganda and Tanzania.
And after the genocide read it,

724
00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:58.640
they say the,

725
00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:03.670
the cause of the genocide or the conflict was because the children who were born

726
00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:06.090
and grew up in the neighboring countries,

727
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:11.390
they were in exile and they were never taken as a Congolese or burned down.

728
00:49:12.091 --> 00:49:16.200
So they were always refuges there.
So they always wanted to come back home.

729
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.840
And that for the who took government,

730
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.960
that was in power then they told them that it's not,

731
00:49:21.961 --> 00:49:25.290
it was the country that the Highbury Mana,

732
00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:27.860
the president in his speech he used,

733
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.930
sometimes I say how the prison can have that kind of speech,

734
00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:36.170
but he would say that Rwanda is like a glass full of water and if you tried to

735
00:49:37.411 --> 00:49:42.411
drop to drop a little bit of one drop of water in it spreads.

736
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.260
So you told,
he will say the one is full already.

737
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.010
Nobody can come in if you try to come in and with spread and the spread is,

738
00:49:50.011 --> 00:49:53.120
was it was,
it was blood.
So when the,

739
00:49:53.121 --> 00:49:55.400
the Tutsis tried to come in 1990,

740
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.470
they killed a lot of Tutsis inside the country and they,

741
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.680
even publicly there was say on a radio is that if you,

742
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:03.870
if you've tried to come in,

743
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.110
we can kill your families so that we have space for you.
Um,

744
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:13.220
so when general site ended after the genocide ended though though the Tutsis who

745
00:50:15.271 --> 00:50:19.710
were leaving in a neighboring countries came back in Rwanda and the,
the,

746
00:50:19.711 --> 00:50:24.180
the in the,
and the perpetrator has fled,
were fleeing to Congo,

747
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:27.030
which still now they still have a rebel group,

748
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:32.170
the Congo that's growing and the word either Hutus who weren't going in jail and

749
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:35.990
there weren't more direct Hutus and there were survivors,

750
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:40.991
which was 30% of the two days in a row on a very small number of survivors.

751
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.880
So there were all these groups coming in,

752
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:47.600
this little tiny country with a different,
some of them are excited,

753
00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.280
others has lost everything,

754
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:54.550
others are coming back home or they have a victory or they are fleeing.

755
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:59.450
So sue was calm.
It was a very,
very different dif,
difficult country.

756
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:04.500
And just having all those mixed of feelings,
um,
who,

757
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.960
it was hard.
It was,

758
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.280
but there was no really a quick solution to fix what has just happened.

759
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:15.830
The first with the first thing was to bury the dead bodies and,

760
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.770
and move on.
So
for me as a survivor,

761
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.710
there was no time to grieve.
There wasn't what it was.

762
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:29.060
There was just no time because you have to leave again and on the same,
uh,

763
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.120
the same speed as everyone else was coming home.

764
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:37.121
So the con then the economy was not as horrible because they come back with

765
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:43.310
things or though the houses were destroyed and all of the,

766
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:44.960
but that was for the survivors.

767
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.160
So when and we had to go on that system,
go back to school,

768
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:51.770
do this and this and this was always,
um,

769
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.410
that's why like my mom now,

770
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.470
the time is coming out now because she never had that time.

771
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.660
And now with the economy and everything,
it's way before I came,

772
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:06.680
I worked in a rural areas that are places,
there are people really,
really hungry,

773
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.360
really hungry.
They have one meal a day,
a terrible one.

774
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.650
So there's of course there is done that is happening.
The,
the,

775
00:52:15.651 --> 00:52:19.250
because also mostly though the entire world,

776
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.160
those students still jumping the channel side by the,

777
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:26.180
after there was a lot of nonprofits that came in Rwanda.

778
00:52:26.181 --> 00:52:28.060
There's suits very,

779
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.300
it's very vague situation.

780
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:37.280
I was a student of 27 years old and um,
I'm not even in the politics.

781
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:42.130
I don't know how it can make really like touch it and,
or detangler it.

782
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.240
Do you have confidence in the current government that's there still?

783
00:52:47.241 --> 00:52:50.330
I've never known any other government shouldn't.

784
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:55.910
I've never known any other um,
government.
That's the um,
the old,

785
00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:00.740
cause I,
yeah,
the,
the,
the who took government.
I was a kid,

786
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.670
I was a child.
I just,
I really,
really didn't understand the assistant.

787
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.830
And this is the only government have even known.

788
00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.890
And of course there's a lot of change and there is,

789
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:14.180
and leading a country like Rwanda,
it takes a special

790
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.680
kind of individual to be able to really control those kinds of minds that are

791
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:26.040
completed.
It's,
yeah,
it's really,
I can,
I

792
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.390
<v 2>don't know,
like how a team,
yeah,
it's really complicated.</v>

793
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:32.820
It's not perfect,
but at least we're not.

794
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.020
<v 1>Uh,
it's not nine,
1994.
Yes.
At least we were not there.</v>

795
00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:41.700
And hopefully we'll never go back there.
Hopefully we learn

796
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:46.090
<v 2>our lesson and,
um,
and when did,</v>

797
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:50.160
will have peace somewhere in the near future.
Thank you.

798
00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.960
Thank you.
I hope I just responded.
Well,
thank you.

799
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:59.250
<v 0>So we're,
um,
we're,
we're basically out of time,
but one,
one final question.
Um,</v>

800
00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.450
oh,
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I didn't even see you over there.
How about you?

801
00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:05.370
She was the last question.
Okay.
Um,

802
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.450
I think an easier one.
Uh,

803
00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.880
there's so much wisdom and you've had so many experiences and it's basically an

804
00:54:14.381 --> 00:54:18.940
amazing person.
Um,
thank you.
What are your,
um,

805
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:23.200
drink fear life going forward?
Like what do you want to do?
What do I want to do?

806
00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.073
If it's a hard question,

807
00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.170
<v 1>Aye,</v>

808
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:30.560
<v 2>I want to do this,
you know,
like,
um,</v>

809
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:36.230
I wanna I love inspiring people.
I want,
I love,

810
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.760
especially as children and,
uh,
I want to write more.

811
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.450
I wanted to touch as many lives as I can before I die.

812
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.820
And it's hard.

813
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:51.910
I remember Aaron and I were in Boise I think two weeks ago and it was,

814
00:54:54.141 --> 00:54:58.550
um,
a human right.
Um,
uh,
[inaudible] month,
Westman,

815
00:54:58.551 --> 00:54:59.930
center of human rights.

816
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:05.470
And the director came to pick me up from the airport and then he said it then,

817
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.650
uh,
pricing is a really wonderful,
and he was talking to me,

818
00:55:09.651 --> 00:55:14.651
but he was kind of what your dad kind of preparing me for the talk and he was

819
00:55:15.621 --> 00:55:17.420
having a conversation in a car ride.

820
00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:21.980
And then I was asking me how I feel when I do this.
Um,

821
00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.450
and I'll say I'm,
I'm fine,
but I didn't tell,
I never wanted culturally,

822
00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:28.010
we don't really,
even if you ask me what did you have for lunch,

823
00:55:28.011 --> 00:55:28.910
I wouldn't tell you.

824
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:36.870
<v 1>So we always say,
where are you going?
I'm going down there or how are you?</v>

825
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.850
I'm fine even if I'm dying.

826
00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:42.600
And so he asked me that in the fit,
I'm fine.

827
00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:47.000
<v 2>And then he said,
you know,
I'm a few years ago I had,</v>

828
00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:50.720
I've had a friend who was a holocaust survivor.
Her name was,
um,

829
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.600
her name was rose barrel.

830
00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:58.601
And I asked her how she felt after the talk and,

831
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.960
and then,
and then she said,
you know,
then,
um,

832
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.850
when I speak it,
you hear it.
And when,
when I speak it,

833
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:10.770
I see it.
And,

834
00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:14.840
and that really scared me because this is cause I knew that this is what I

835
00:56:14.841 --> 00:56:17.510
wanted to do and they know a lot of survivors do to do it.

836
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.220
But then I knew that it takes me a long time to get over a tog fixing me.

837
00:56:22.221 --> 00:56:26.860
At least I have to be able to talk,
call my friends right after the tall.

838
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:28.180
Have to distract myself.

839
00:56:28.181 --> 00:56:32.860
It takes me a list a few days or two weeks to really get over the talk.

840
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:36.730
And I thought the more I do it,
I will give them better.
So asked her,

841
00:56:36.731 --> 00:56:39.730
how old was she?
He said she wasn't

842
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:48.690
promising.
How am I really is doing that to myself?

843
00:56:48.691 --> 00:56:53.070
Maybe I should quit.
But when,
when he was saying,
and I said,
oh,

844
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.970
that's not fun.
I don't know if I'm going to keep it.
I'm doing this.
And he said,

845
00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:00.270
but didn't remember she started when she was 81.

846
00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:05.070
So she really never talked about it until she wasn't he one.

847
00:57:05.071 --> 00:57:09.630
And it's always all inside her.
And um,
and they said,
oh,

848
00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.380
maybe because I started young and maybe I 40,

849
00:57:14.381 --> 00:57:18.250
I'll be fine.
So I want to keep doing it.

850
00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:22.380
I know sometimes it's hard.
When I met Iran,
when I published the book,

851
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.630
I was creating public speaking,

852
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.620
then I should just go work somewhere entertainment.
And I went to CBS,

853
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:32.820
I need to tell me tonight,
and everyone was a Canadian.
When you're ready,

854
00:57:32.821 --> 00:57:36.930
just let me know.
And because you have to be out there and inspiring people.

855
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.340
And that when by that time I was,
I was,
I couldn't,
I will be.

856
00:57:41.341 --> 00:57:44.040
So being on the stage,
of course I did cry a little bit today,

857
00:57:44.041 --> 00:57:48.720
but I used to really,
really cry like,
so I was like,

858
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:51.780
this is not pretty,
I should just not do this.

859
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.530
So the more I do it,
the more I,

860
00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.560
I remember most of them because the more I think about it comes back and I,

861
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:01.800
but I think,
um,

862
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.610
I took meditation classes now and my deep meditation teacher told me,
um,

863
00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:08.940
what happens to you,
Hopkins for you?

864
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:14.220
So it really made me trim meets with so that I can help someone else.

865
00:58:14.221 --> 00:58:18.780
So I want to do this the rest of my life.
And,
uh,

866
00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:21.510
hopefully,
uh,
40 or 30 something,

867
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.860
I won't be still seeing it

868
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:29.490
<v 0>behalf of Google and the group here.
Thank you so much for your time.
Thank you.</v>

869
00:58:29.491 --> 00:58:30.324
Thank you so much.

870
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.690
There's a book signing odd that will be happening in the back.

871
00:58:36.691 --> 00:58:41.430
If any of you would like to get the Dean's new book.
Thank you.
Thank you.
