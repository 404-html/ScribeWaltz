WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.930
Uh,
and I have not only a the pleasure,
but the privilege of introducing a,

2
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.070
and we're going to be having a talk today.
So before we get started,

3
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.720
I want to read a quick bio.

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.880
So Shanti sacred teaches creative writing at the California College of Arts and

5
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.190
is a member of the San Francisco riders grotto.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.540
Her work has appeared in the New York Times best new American voices and

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:31.500
Huffington post and online at [inaudible] and mother magazine.

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.100
Her first novel,
the prayer room was published by Macadam cage.

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.850
She is a California native who lives in Berkeley with her husband and two

10
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.240
children.
And today we're going to be talking about her book lucky boy,

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.500
which follows two stories that have solely Castro Valdez and undocumented

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.560
undocumented Mexican woman and that of Rishi and Kavio ready and Indian American

13
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:55.140
couple who live in Berkeley,
California as well.
Please welcome me in joining.

14
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:55.974
Shanti,

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.900
go ahead and start off by thanking t for being here.

16
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:05.820
I had the pleasure of meeting with her a couple of weeks ago,

17
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:08.020
so I'm particularly excited for today.
Um,

18
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.550
but I'd love to just start with maybe reading a couple excerpts from the book.

19
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.330
<v 2>Sure.
Yeah.
So I'm going to read two excerpts from the two sides of the story.</v>

20
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.640
So one side is,

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900
one of my main characters is an undocumented young Mexican woman who crosses

22
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:27.150
into California from Mexico.
She's from Wahaca,

23
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.780
Mexico and she ends up in Berkeley,
California not far from here.

24
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.180
So solely,
um,
um,
I don't think you need to know much else about her.

25
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:40.840
She's uh,
she's crossing the border,

26
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:45.730
just getting close to it in this scene that I'm about to read right now.

27
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.630
And she's met a man named Chicco on her way.

28
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:53.740
She had sort of a romance on her journey.
Um,

29
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.350
so that's all you need to know.
And here we go.

30
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.760
It had been five days since solely had last seen Checo and thoughts of him and

31
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:05.170
what might have happened to him.

32
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.410
Jangled inside her like shards of 10 solely and two other women's sat on the bed

33
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:15.631
of a yellow onion truck with crate stat tie to shield them every now and then a

34
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:19.630
thin whistle of air and made it through the slats of the truck and passed the

35
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:24.340
crates and for those swift seconds,
she since the suite and Uranus of the end,

36
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.100
what the air,
the morning light,

37
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.240
the company of calm women among who she could at last close.

38
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:36.241
Her eyes solely felt that she would hold together cohered by a single strip of

39
00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:40.450
hope just long enough to arrive at Sylvia's door.

40
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.560
They stopped twice that day to Piss on the side of the road and stretch their

41
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:48.070
legs,
so at least slept for how long she did not know.

42
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.200
She did not dream of what had happened to her.

43
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.830
She did not dream of Chico or if the British men who came later,

44
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.320
the case between her legs was numb,

45
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.270
but her thighs were sticky and began to blister the day's heat.
When she awoke,

46
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.050
the air was still a woman named Luce,

47
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.460
squinted at her across the mound of onions.
Where are you going?

48
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.370
She asked Berkeley solely answered.

49
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.350
Where's that close to San Francisco.
You know someone there?

50
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.750
Yes.
My cousin.
Your cousin have money?
I think so.

51
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.810
I think she has money lose.

52
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.580
Shook her head like she did not see good things for solely a few hours after

53
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:34.750
dark,
the driver stopped the truck and stuck his head out his window.

54
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.090
Get flat.
He called.
What's he talking about?
Solely asked lose,

55
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:44.080
rolled herself into a ball.
The truck slowed to a halt.

56
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.810
The engine stopped.
Get down,

57
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:49.960
she hissed and pulled sleeping fatty mouth from the bench to the floor

58
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.520
or we hear [inaudible] quiet,

59
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:59.521
make yourself small through the crates and the slats solely saw the flicker of a

60
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.190
dark green uniform.
The flicker spoken English.

61
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.690
He spoke in English,
we're here so they whispered.

62
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.660
Shut up.
Loose was kneeling beside her and she took us all these hand in hers.

63
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.380
She slipped her fingers along solely his knuckles like they were rosary beads

64
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.590
and solely prayed silently thinking of her own lost rosary though his words were

65
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.610
muffled by onions.
She knew the uniform demand was questioning their driver.

66
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.900
Shuffling paper,

67
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:33.160
more questions and before she could move a stick shot through the slats,

68
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.270
she gasped.
It grazed her skull again and again.

69
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.600
It rammed through the slats,
a guards iron wand,

70
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.580
trawling for migrant flesh hoping to hit something live enough to cry out and

71
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.830
prove the truck carried more than onions.

72
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.230
She held her hands to her head and prayed.
She knew she was shaking,

73
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.690
but luckily for her fear made no sound.

74
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.310
Moments later she heard footsteps crunch away and vanish.

75
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.740
The engine started up again and they rolled forward.
Loose,
released,

76
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.510
released a tremulous breath.
Lucky she said,
a lazy one.

77
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.980
She looked up at solely grinned and pushed her tongue through the gap in her

78
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.814
teeth

79
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.950
were here in the North America.
Amea.

80
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.610
That's what they call it.
Here we are in California.

81
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.430
Now solely looked up to the sky.

82
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.900
Same blue as the Mexicans guy.
She looked through the truck's slats.

83
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.530
This was California,
the United States of America.

84
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.570
She had arrived and here's what she discovered.
This place,

85
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.600
this America,
this new place.

86
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.400
This streets of gold place looked a hell of a lot like the old place.

87
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.770
America streaked by her stripped and tender with heat.
She watched it all.

88
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:56.020
Rush pass through the slats of the old truck,

89
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.160
the tin roofs sees of broken glass glinting and breathless like a fever dream

90
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.600
America was it Dustin?
Her hair,
the wind in her throat,

91
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.310
the sun that shouted against her eyelids between the slats of this truck,

92
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.560
America was nothing but a high tech,

93
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:16.070
high speed dream of trees and houses and fences,

94
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.900
a sliver of interrupted light.
The old folks back home,

95
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:24.230
those who'd been here in back told solely she would do well here,

96
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.400
that she had the spirit,

97
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.050
they told her to keep her head down and work hard and for God's sake keep her

98
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:32.240
mouth shut.
Okay.

99
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.493
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.420
<v 2>So that's solely,
um,</v>

101
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.410
the other side of my story is a couple of named caveat and Rishi ready.

102
00:06:44.411 --> 00:06:48.010
They live in Berkeley and coffee is a chef at a sorority,

103
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:50.640
which is its own story.
But um,

104
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.630
Rishi is a worker at a Silicon Valley company.

105
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.390
He does stuff with air quality in buildings.

106
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.990
So he works for this gigantic Silicon Valley company that I made up.

107
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:05.620
It's called the webbies and it's a,
it's one of these,

108
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.390
it's a company that just,

109
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.420
it's like a gigantic Amazon for children's and babies suppliers combined with

110
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:15.760
some social networking stuff.
Um,

111
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.150
so this little bit is going to be a little bit from copyists point of view,

112
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:25.600
but then we're going to transition and to me,

113
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:28.480
she's point of view and here we go.

114
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.980
Despite the clarity of her desire,

115
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.300
Kavya had no real idea of what sort of mother she'd be,
the parents around her.

116
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:42.670
It seemed to take great pride in their work,
like artisans of a dying craft,

117
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.200
jogging through parks and waiting and Bart Stations Kavya had come across

118
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:50.470
American mother's speaking French to their American children,

119
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.090
fathers explaining the physics of underground transport to their preschoolers

120
00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.100
property tax law to their eight year olds at the farmer's market the week before

121
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.300
a little girl had fallen and scraped her knee as she stood,
sobbing,

122
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.620
inconsolable.
Her mother knelt down beside her here,
sweetie,

123
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:13.180
have some Kale.
And she's,
uh,

124
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.010
the little girl had taken it,

125
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.460
chewed on the tough primordial leaf and stopped crying.

126
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.660
The stakes were high in Berkeley.
The toddlers were eating there.

127
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:23.890
Cruciferous Greens.

128
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.600
There were things she couldn't know about being a parent without being one.

129
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.410
This she sends from the way men and women with children in tow seem to have

130
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:33.370
little to say to her.

131
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.740
Parenthood was a members only organization closed to freelancers and temps.

132
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.140
Outsiders could visit for lunch,

133
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.130
but they tended to leave quickly overwhelmed by the demands of belonging,

134
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.090
but Kavio didn't want to leave.
Kavya wanted to in

135
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.520
for Rishi,
the brilliant bonus of this new world,

136
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.770
this procreative world was a sudden abundance of sex.

137
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.060
They were doing it every day,
sometimes twice like they'd done in the early days.

138
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.820
They had sex for lunch and eat burritos in the car.

139
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.570
They had sex in the living room and topple the throw pillows from the sofa.

140
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.770
They had sex in a restaurant once in the bathroom and once in a parking lot,

141
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.350
but after two months,
then three,

142
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.820
these trysts began to feel inappropriate like their control was slipping.

143
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.280
He began to wonder what it was about.

144
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:27.270
All the spontaneity he supposed Kavio was trying to keep things fun.

145
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.300
Maybe even for his sake to combat the impatience that lurked in the shadows for

146
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:33.480
three months.

147
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.950
Kavya refused to look at her calendar or take her temperature or do any of the

148
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:41.670
things a woman did to track their fertility.
It shouldn't matter.

149
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.540
She said it should just happen,
but then it didn't just happen.

150
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.160
After three months of trying and failing that sex could no longer be casual.

151
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.170
She began taking her temperature,

152
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.920
tracking her oblation Rishi had been on board with us.

153
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.540
He would think of it as a project.

154
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:01.950
He decided project managing was what he did and driving his management approach

155
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:03.390
was the Weebly's principle,

156
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.390
the silicon valley principle that nothing was impossible.

157
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.440
Impossibility was not an absolute,

158
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.450
but it's shiftable as a heavy boulder trial and error and a little cognitive

159
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:18.720
daring.
We're all it took to make the impossible possible.

160
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.920
It had worked for PC's,
the Internet,
smartphones,

161
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.110
it would work for his baby sex.
Whenever it became sex on a schedule,

162
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.180
Kavya felt a sense of purpose,
satisfaction,
even she was taking charge.

163
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.740
Kavya began demanding sex is Rishi hurried from the house to catch the wave us

164
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.000
she wants actually drove out to the [inaudible] campus and showed up at his

165
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:44.760
office store.
I'm obviating right now.

166
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.250
She said like now rush.

167
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.090
She had found them a nap room disobeying the strict single occupant limit.

168
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.411
They did merge,

169
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:56.520
flushed and rumbled and full you view of his coworkers gathered at the espresso

170
00:10:56.521 --> 00:11:01.470
machine often from across the bay.
She texted him in all caps,

171
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:06.000
mid meeting,
mid presentation,
mid epiphany to say,
come home.

172
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.350
I need you now.

173
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.750
What once would have thrilled Rishi stirred in him a sense of anxiety,

174
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
futility in gratitude.

175
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.840
He felt less like a man and more like an indentured servant keeping up his end

176
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:25.560
of a shady bargain.
And every time,
every month they tried to get pregnant.

177
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.080
Rishi watched Kavya grow more brittle.

178
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.490
He thought of himself as a rational person,
good at compartmentalizing,

179
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.740
good at avoiding flights of fancy,

180
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.420
but trying to have a baby to fight as powers of reason and strategy and desire.

181
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.990
He bought into the idea that hard work bred success,

182
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.450
but Rishi and Kavya were working hard.

183
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:50.160
They were working a naturally hard at this most natural of tasks.

184
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.400
Six months passed and still nine months and Kavya had found herself at Preethy

185
00:11:56.401 --> 00:12:01.401
these wedding and now 10 the gravel in her throat had grown to a stone.

186
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.680
Every time she saw a baby or a woman with a luscious globe of a belly,

187
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.970
the stone grew harder and larger,
but Kavio knew this much.

188
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.550
She was a woman.
She was an Indian woman.

189
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.720
Surely a country with 1 billion people had produced some capable wounds.

190
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.910
She was going to have a baby.

191
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.170
She and Rishi just needed to get away from the theater of failure that had

192
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.280
become their bedroom.

193
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.750
They needed to escape the chili corners of their bungalow and have the sort of

194
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:33.670
relaxed intercourse from which babies seem to spring or ears buzzed with

195
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:36.970
certainty and farther inside her ovaries winced.

196
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.050
She texted Rishi Napa valley this weekend,

197
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.810
SPA BNB on booking

198
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.780
the exclamation mark.
So hopeful she began to delete it,

199
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.490
then decided to let it be

200
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.360
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

201
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.820
<v 0>Thank you so much.
I,
I don't know about those of you that heard it,</v>

202
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:04.060
but I went through the full range of emotions from like the powerful,

203
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:08.610
beautiful descriptive language in the first one to uh,
I dunno,
the second uh,

204
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.000
segment seemed a little familiar.

205
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.970
I think you did a great job at capturing all world tech in the bay area in

206
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:15.460
general.
Uh,
so before we go into lucky boy,

207
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.640
I'd love to just hear about your beginning as an author.

208
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:21.250
Like what's that journey like that you always know you wanted to right.

209
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.050
<v 2>Um,
I did not always know that I want to try it.</v>

210
00:13:24.051 --> 00:13:26.630
I knew that I loved books and I think my brothers,

211
00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:30.110
I have these two older brothers who are 10 years and 11 years older than me.

212
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.670
<v 0>I think they knew before I did,
we used to play fresh air,
like wasted.</v>

213
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.010
Like pretend we were on fresh air and together,

214
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.340
like my brother would be Terry Gross and I would be me talking about a book.

215
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.940
<v 2>And,
um,
so I think they had some sense that this was what I loved,</v>

216
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.620
but I'd spent a lot of my school years thinking I was going to be like an

217
00:13:48.621 --> 00:13:53.621
English literature professor until I realized how theoretical that field is.

218
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.340
And what I loved was the books and the language and talking about that.

219
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.790
So it was really only when I was about 22 that I had started writing creatively

220
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.610
and took really just the first pages of like my first attempt to creative

221
00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:13.850
writing and sent those into an MFA program and got in,

222
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.260
got into one and went to that one and

223
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.981
<v 0>took it from there.</v>

224
00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:21.800
I was just to sort of see if this was something that I could do.

225
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.170
And so it was a slow process,
but the love of books was always there.
I love that.

226
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:29.570
That's wonderful.
Yeah,
I feel like we're all,
at least for me,

227
00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:32.120
I'm still trying to figure out like what is,
what is a niche?

228
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.080
Like what is the thing to do?

229
00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:36.380
And I love hearing from authors their journey because it ranges from always

230
00:14:36.381 --> 00:14:39.710
knowing that you wanted to write just one day.
Realizing that it's your passion.

231
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.280
Um,
and in terms of genre,
did you ever think about what you wanted to write,

232
00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:46.740
whether it was fiction or nonfiction,
particular topics?
I

233
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.080
<v 2>had always wanted to write fiction.
I think poetry is kind of scary.</v>

234
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:54.430
I really admire poets,
but you really,
there's no safety net with,
with poetry,

235
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.450
you're really putting yourself out there.
Um,
nonfiction,
you know,

236
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.290
this was the closest I've ever come to nonfiction as a writer.

237
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.260
So this took a lot of research and um,

238
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.260
I now feel like more adept at nonfiction.
I feel like I can go in that direction,

239
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:16.130
but it took a sort of transitional book,
like lucky boy.
Yeah.

240
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:17.300
So it's wonderful because it is,

241
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.500
it is a fiction book and yet there are so many areas that when you and I
chatted,

242
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.590
you really wanted to explore it and make sure that you,
you know,
do it justice.

243
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.830
So do you mind telling us a little bit about your preparation and learning about

244
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.700
tech companies immigration,
the lender's experience?
Yeah.

245
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:36.140
So I was faced with this task of writing,

246
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.520
you know,
writing these worlds that I was not familiar with from Soliz world,

247
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.520
the silicon valley or worlds to fertility issues.

248
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.220
So I started very basic with some documentaries and oral histories.

249
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:50.570
Just getting a sense of,
you know,

250
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:53.540
what the undocumented experience might be like for people,

251
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.070
what it's like to cross the border,

252
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:59.360
why people feel they need to leave their homes and come to America.

253
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:05.090
Um,
it started pretty,
pretty sort of straight forward,
um,

254
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.740
in that way.
And then I started to just look for people who would talk to me.

255
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:13.480
So immigration lawyers,
immigration policy scholars,
um,

256
00:16:13.481 --> 00:16:18.110
adoptive parents because Kavya and Rishi end up being foster parents to solely

257
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:21.500
his child.
Um,
yeah.

258
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:25.280
So in all of these realms,
you know,
people who'd undergone fertility treatments,

259
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.050
just anyone who would talk to me about their experience,
um,

260
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.950
I tried to get ahold of,

261
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:33.700
and people are pretty open when you're a novelist and not a journalist.

262
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.420
People are pretty willing to talk to you.
And with Silicon Valley,

263
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:43.421
I spent a day less like a few hours here with an less is here and just kind of

264
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:48.470
like went to lunch in the cafeteria,
walked around a little.
Um,

265
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.800
I've never worked in silicon valley,
so a lot of like,

266
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:56.801
I think I absorbed literally like 37 details and put them all in this book

267
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.370
during those few hours and then just living in California,
you know,

268
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:05.760
it's part of the zeitgeisty you absorb stuff as well.
That's wonderful.
Um,

269
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.920
I couldn't help but chuckle when you said the Wiebe us reminded me.
Yeah.

270
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.540
So I was like,
yeah,
I had all kinds of things like I had,
um,
we edited it out,

271
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.460
but I had the snack cupboard,

272
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:20.300
which was called [inaudible] because it's all free and I thought that was too

273
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:20.541
much,

274
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:25.541
but then we were outside and he called the dog a Dougal or do colors here.

275
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.090
Yeah,
I do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is why I appreciate it.

276
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.700
This knew that you had done your research and as I was reading through this and

277
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:35.660
I was like,
this is so accurate.
Yeah.
You did a great job of capturing it.
So,

278
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:39.050
speaking of tech,
obviously it's a predominant part of the book,

279
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.090
what role do you think tech has as an industry,
um,
in this topic and immigration?

280
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.080
What role does tech have in immigration?
Um,
you know,

281
00:17:49.081 --> 00:17:54.081
I've been thinking about the h one B issues that have been coming up like in the

282
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.720
past few days.
And I see tech is the new,

283
00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:02.850
it is the new industry in the world and especially in California and it needs

284
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:06.700
people.
It's,
uh,

285
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.720
it needs people who are capable and we're such a globalized society now that

286
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:16.890
immigration and Tech,
you know,
immigration feeds tech at this point.

287
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:20.080
And I feel like that's the way it should be.
Um,

288
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.270
and on the other side of it,
um,

289
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.790
being one of our biggest industries right now,

290
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:30.840
I feel like tech might have a role to play.

291
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.900
And I dunno in having a say in some of these issues and issues of immigration,

292
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.380
I'm not actually completely certain what I think of that.
You know,

293
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:44.640
I don't know if business should stay away from politics as business,

294
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:48.720
should stay away from,
um,
issues of immigration or not.

295
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.800
I'd sort of be interested to hear what people think being in this world.

296
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.860
<v 0>Yeah.
We'll have an opportunity to get someone a questions,</v>

297
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.380
maybe even some opinions from the group.
So,
speaking more about immigration,
uh,

298
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.960
there's a lot of themes in the book about immigration,
uh,

299
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.640
intersecting with motherhood or parenthood or family.

300
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.230
I feel like often in our nation we talk about immigration as an individual
topic.

301
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.540
So what opportunities do we have to be immigration from that more family or

302
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:19.374
motherhood perspective?

303
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.790
<v 2>So one thing that I found out pretty early on is that of our 11 million</v>

304
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:29.770
undocumented immigrants,
um,
within that statistic,

305
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:35.190
5 million children in the u s have at least one undocumented parent.

306
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.720
So we think of immigration.
You're right as a very individual pursuit.
You know,

307
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:45.721
America was built on these ideas of individualism versus collectivism and um,

308
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.000
and this idea of bootstraps and you know,
just being,

309
00:19:52.001 --> 00:19:55.900
being your own person and forging your own way,
which is all very admirable.

310
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.800
But it's worth noting that these issues,
you know,

311
00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:01.660
when we talk about undocumented immigrants,

312
00:20:01.661 --> 00:20:05.800
we're not talking about the one immigrant who crosses the border on his own.

313
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.160
We're talking about the family that he might build in the u s his family back

314
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:12.630
home.
Uh,

315
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.620
we're talking about generations of ramifications for whatever we decide to do

316
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.820
with immigration.
Definitely.
Um,

317
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.720
<v 0>and I liked that you were talking about that because we often think of an image</v>

318
00:20:24.721 --> 00:20:29.610
when we think of immigrant,
right?
And it's often the unlucky,
right?

319
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:33.390
Or the unfortunate or,
uh,
having to deal with the same struggles.

320
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:36.150
But we have immigrants from all over the world and they come with different

321
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:41.100
experiences.
Um,
you wrote an op Ed in the New York Times called the,

322
00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:42.780
uh,
the privileged immigrant.

323
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.150
Do you mind talking a little bit about that article and that,

324
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.010
how that correlates with what a lucky boy tells

325
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.720
<v 2>us as well?
Yeah.
So the privileged immigrants that came out in November,</v>

326
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.780
and it basically is a discussion of my own family's immigration experience,

327
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.770
which was that my parents came over in the 1960s as foreign medical graduates.

328
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:07.480
My Dad had graduated medical school at that point and the U s was trying to fill

329
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:09.440
it's hospitals with its,
um,

330
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.630
it's medicare network that had just been put in place.

331
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:19.260
So that article sort of looks at their experience of of yes being alienated,

332
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.050
yes,
struggling a lot,
but at least having,
you know,

333
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:25.900
having solid work and having a visa,

334
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:30.901
having like a solid legal way to be in the u s and that not only put them at

335
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:33.400
ease psychologically,

336
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:37.930
but it allowed them to put structures in place in their lives that have brought

337
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:39.510
them where they are today.
You know,

338
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.320
it allowed them to start savings accounts and start investing and buy property.

339
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.790
And um,
we see,
I,

340
00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:50.650
I enjoy the fruits of that now and my kids enjoy the fruits of that.
So again,

341
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:53.200
we're going forward for generations.

342
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:58.120
And when you think about an undocumented immigrant,
you know,
there are,

343
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.520
there are structures in place where undocumented immigrants,

344
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.670
they can go to a bank and open a bank account,

345
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.610
but it's terrifying to walk into a bank.
You know,

346
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:11.140
we saw what just happened to the first Daca recipient who's who was deported.

347
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.450
Um,
it's,

348
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.480
it's scary to go in and give your official information to an institution when

349
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:22.660
you don't actually belong here with legal papers.

350
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.490
So it's really hard for undocumented immigrants.

351
00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:31.630
I realized while researching this book to put those,

352
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.570
those building blocks in place for a stable future.

353
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.170
And how much of like your own personal experiences would you say influences look

354
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.810
cause in your first book that you wrote also has a lot of your personal

355
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:46.940
experiences as well as we'd love to see how much of that you incorporating

356
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.350
writing.
So my personal experiences,
you know,

357
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.380
in order to start to understand solely I had to understand her in my terms,

358
00:22:56.051 --> 00:23:00.940
you know,
I had to relate to her as a person.
And so motherhood is in here a lot.

359
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.800
I have two kids.
Um,

360
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.730
there's some material right after the little boy is born in this book that comes

361
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:10.060
straight from what I had jotted down right after my little boy was born.

362
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.200
And then the ideas of immigration and particularly with Kavya and Rishi,

363
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:17.350
you know,

364
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:22.240
these ideas of ambition and what parents want for their children and what it's

365
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:27.241
like for a second generation Indian American or a second generation immigrant.

366
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:32.470
There is this unspoken sometimes spoken agreement between immigrant parents and

367
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:36.850
their children,
which basically says,
look,

368
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.090
I gave up everything I knew to come over here,

369
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.860
so you'd better do something with this.
Um,
and,

370
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.820
and so failure is not in many parents view an option,

371
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.753
you know,

372
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.990
so that that fed into coffee has experience in the story and it fed into rushees

373
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:01.690
experience and it also fed into the narrative around fertility and being able to

374
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:05.000
have a child.
That's wonderful.
Um,

375
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.120
<v 0>so no,
that we,
when we were talking,</v>

376
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:10.790
we were talking a lot about the things that you learned when you were doing

377
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:14.450
research.
Um,
and particularly when looking at the differences in immigrants,

378
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:18.020
there was,
uh,
the detention centers that you observe.

379
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:19.310
Then you learned a lot about that.

380
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:21.020
Can you tell us a little bit more about that experience?

381
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:24.320
What it was like to see what undocumented immigrants go through them?

382
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.850
<v 2>Yes.
So I trained with a group called civic and isolation,</v>

383
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.900
and they do a lot of work with undocumented immigrants.

384
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:38.850
They started out sort of providing legal representation because when you're in a

385
00:24:38.851 --> 00:24:42.660
detention center,
you're not given a defense lawyer.
You're not given a lawyer.

386
00:24:42.661 --> 00:24:47.230
It's not like being a criminal in the u s um,

387
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:52.670
so they were helping people find their families and also try to get some legal

388
00:24:55.141 --> 00:24:59.700
aid for their situation.
Um,
and when I trained with them,

389
00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:04.440
I visited the detention facility out in Richmond,
California,

390
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.770
and it was just,
you know,
I,

391
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:10.220
I didn't get to see where people were actually living.
Um,

392
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.380
and the Richmond facility is,
is,
is a somewhat reformed one.

393
00:25:13.381 --> 00:25:16.280
Like people have a little more room to wander.

394
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.110
They can leave their rooms when they want,
they have a little more freedom.

395
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.980
But a lot of what I learned about detention centers came from writings in know

396
00:25:26.461 --> 00:25:30.150
lawyers who have devoted their careers to researching different detention

397
00:25:30.151 --> 00:25:30.984
centers.

398
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.670
And much of what I learned revolved around the fact that detention centers are

399
00:25:35.671 --> 00:25:40.290
basically prisons.
They're often at,
within the prison facility itself.

400
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.870
Um,
but they're like prisons without facilities because it's not considered a

401
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:50.710
permanent,
a longterm solution for an immigrant.
Um,

402
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.710
so they don't give you like resources.

403
00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:56.940
So if you're a parent in detention and you're separated from your American born

404
00:25:56.941 --> 00:25:57.774
child,

405
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:03.230
like there's nothing there that allows you to reunite with your child,

406
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.850
you know?
So if a family court says,
okay,

407
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.830
we want you to do this and this and this to qualify for reunification,

408
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.940
like there's no way a detainee can do that because there's nothing in the center

409
00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.990
for them.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.

410
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.050
<v 0>So the research behind it,
uh,</v>

411
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.280
I mean I was so impressed with the amount of work that went into finding out and

412
00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:26.950
understanding that experience.
And actually you were just talking about this,

413
00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:30.560
that the story beautifully contrasts two different journeys,
right?

414
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:33.240
Of immigrants that have different experiences.
Um,

415
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.060
our nation often tends to privilege certain minorities over others.

416
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.680
And what I like this,
that you,
you are treading lightly.

417
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.180
Like you want it to dig deep and information about the Latin x experience,

418
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.070
but you want it to make sure that you did it well.

419
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.150
So I personally think that you took the time and you handled it very eloquently

420
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:53.670
and beautifully,
and you are as a Latino,
I think you,

421
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:58.050
you told the story very well,
but did you ever feel,
uh,

422
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.820
maybe you were,
um,
and,
and I asked this a kind of contentious question,

423
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.430
um,
in terms of cultural appropriation,

424
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:09.030
like what is the fine line between being an ally and telling,
uh,

425
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.470
someone else's experience from your perspective to show your allyship,
um,
versus,

426
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.540
you know,
potentially appropriate in that culture?

427
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.020
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a good question.</v>

428
00:27:17.021 --> 00:27:22.021
I did struggle with this idea of appropriation and whether I was telling

429
00:27:22.061 --> 00:27:24.940
someone's story when I shouldn't be telling their story.

430
00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.990
So the way I approached that was first of all,

431
00:27:28.991 --> 00:27:33.830
to accept the fact that I would never truly understand solely,
you know,

432
00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.830
my Mexican character.
Like I can never truly understand the Latin x experience.

433
00:27:38.831 --> 00:27:42.670
I can never truly understand the undocumented experience.

434
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:48.130
Um,
so one thing that I eventually realized that I had to do was after all the

435
00:27:48.131 --> 00:27:49.990
research,
which was necessary,

436
00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.620
I had to figure out how I personally related to solely to my character.

437
00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:02.170
And,
um,
I eventually realized that,
you know,

438
00:28:02.171 --> 00:28:07.030
this was essentially a story about a young woman who became a mother and he

439
00:28:07.031 --> 00:28:11.980
wanted certain things for herself and the fact that she was let Latina,

440
00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:14.380
the fact that she was undocumented,

441
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.710
these all determine the trajectory of her story,

442
00:28:17.711 --> 00:28:21.940
but they were not the story itself.
Um,
so I was able,

443
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I tried to connect with her in that way and um,

444
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:28.961
you know,

445
00:28:28.961 --> 00:28:33.961
I just had to realize I had to accept that I was never going to do it complete

446
00:28:34.361 --> 00:28:38.470
justice and I just had to tread carefully and make her as fully fledged as I

447
00:28:38.471 --> 00:28:39.250
could.

448
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.870
<v 0>Was a former Spanish teacher.
Your pronunciation of all the names is absolutely</v>

449
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.010
made me very happy.
Great.
So obviously the topic of lucky boy is very timely,

450
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:53.130
not only internally here at Google,
but domestically and globally,

451
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.170
particularly in the last few months.

452
00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.180
What a struggles or obstacles do you feel you faced as an author writing about

453
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:01.014
this topic

454
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:05.540
<v 2>in 2017 struggles as an author?
Um,</v>

455
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.540
you know,
there is,
there was this looming question of cultural appropriation.

456
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.650
You know,
that's a big issue for us right now.
Um,

457
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.520
I did sort of wonder initially if this book was going to be sort of taken up,

458
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.300
you know,
I'm not,

459
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.540
it's not your classic American novel about people in Upper East side Manhattan.

460
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.650
Um,
in fact the,
you know,
the people who are white,

461
00:29:32.651 --> 00:29:36.580
they're sort of on the periphery of this book.
And so I did wonder,
you know,

462
00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:39.410
if that,
if the fact that I had,
you know,

463
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.020
this group of Brown people and Brown woman and everyone is brown,

464
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.070
if that would be sort of a,
an obstacle to getting it published.

465
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.000
And at one point I said to my agent,
you know,
it wasn't getting published.

466
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:55.240
I went through like two or three rounds of projections and I said to my agent,

467
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.350
maybe I should just make all my Indians white and see what happens.

468
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.030
And she was like,
absolutely not.
He's like,
no.
Well,

469
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:07.210
she pointed out to me that this is not just about a Mexican woman.

470
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:12.211
This is a story of immigrants on American soil in 2000 whatever it was.

471
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:14.620
Then 2000,
you know,

472
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:19.621
the two thousands and so that allowed me to sort of take a new perspective on

473
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.370
what I was doing.
So,
yeah.

474
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.750
<v 0>Um,
so in looking into your,
your future endeavors,
what's next?</v>

475
00:30:26.751 --> 00:30:29.840
It could be a specific book or do you think you found a,

476
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.440
your area and you want to continue talking about uh,
the immigrant experience?

477
00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.940
<v 2>I kind of want to do both,</v>

478
00:30:34.941 --> 00:30:39.800
so I'm going to start slowly working on it on my next book as soon as all this

479
00:30:39.801 --> 00:30:44.330
touring and,
and I also feel like,
you know,

480
00:30:44.331 --> 00:30:47.800
I've written this book so this is what I'm grappling with.
You know,

481
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.690
I've written this book,
it's,
it's about this topic.

482
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.650
What am I just going to drop it now and like talk about something else next.

483
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.990
You know,
cause I feel like now that I've written this book,

484
00:30:56.991 --> 00:30:58.250
I want to do something more with it.

485
00:30:58.251 --> 00:31:03.251
I want to actually use it in some way to enact some beginnings of change and

486
00:31:05.091 --> 00:31:08.460
something that I care about.
So hopefully I'll do that.
Yeah.

487
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.910
<v 0>And just out of curiosity,
obviously you're a writer,</v>

488
00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:14.460
were all super excited that this book is out.
Um,

489
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.200
nothing but positive feedback at least that I've seen.
Um,
but,
uh,

490
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.290
what are some of your favorite authors?
What do you like to read?

491
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.030
Do you look up to,
who inspires you?

492
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.100
<v 2>My favorite authors.
So for this book in particular,</v>

493
00:31:26.101 --> 00:31:30.360
I really looked to beloved by Toni Morrison,
um,

494
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.900
because for one thing,
on a technical level,

495
00:31:33.901 --> 00:31:38.640
I was trying to figure out how to work with past and present.
And in beloved,

496
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:43.730
Tony Morrison does this beautiful job with memory where she passes seamlessly

497
00:31:44.371 --> 00:31:48.990
from the present day narrative into her characters,
um,

498
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.920
days as a slave and her journey up north as a slave.

499
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.780
And when I was writing this,
I literally had my little notebook.

500
00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.390
It was like on the 20th revision or whatever.

501
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.250
I had my little notebook and I would copy out Tony Morrison's sentences just to

502
00:32:05.251 --> 00:32:08.700
sort of understand like how she made those transitions.

503
00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.120
So beloved by Toni Morrison,
I really liked Zadie Smith.

504
00:32:12.121 --> 00:32:16.110
She's a British writer and,
and the end,
right.
Um,

505
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:21.210
her book,
the green road kind of influenced this.
I like reading writers whose,

506
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.630
whose voices are very different from my own.

507
00:32:24.631 --> 00:32:28.650
It loosens up something in me creatively.
Wonderful.

508
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.530
<v 0>We definitely want to give the audience an opportunity to ask questions.
Um,</v>

509
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.050
I haven't read your book yet,
but I look forward to it.

510
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:40.051
But I hear you telling the stories of two Brown women who have had the

511
00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:44.270
experience of like being immigrants or second generation immigrants in America.

512
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:45.530
And then I hear about your op Ed,

513
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:48.260
which talks about like the privileged immigrant and then obviously the flip side

514
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:53.200
of that is the like unprivileged or underprivileged immigrant.
Okay.
Sorry.

515
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.170
Um,
so I was just wondering like what you think,

516
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.890
why you think those two narratives that sounds so similar at their root have

517
00:32:59.891 --> 00:33:04.030
developed so differently in America and what we can learn from deconstructing

518
00:33:04.031 --> 00:33:04.864
those.

519
00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.660
<v 2>So the two narratives,</v>

520
00:33:07.661 --> 00:33:11.730
they have evolved very differently on American soil.
Um,

521
00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.090
to some extent,
you know,
it's not a matter of what country you come from.

522
00:33:16.091 --> 00:33:21.050
It's a matter of the,
uh,
the,

523
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.460
the structure is that you've been able to put in place for yourself.

524
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.780
So if we talk about my characters,
you know,
caveat and Rishi,

525
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.270
they own this little house in Berkeley.

526
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.810
They were able to buy that house because their parents were able to help them

527
00:33:34.811 --> 00:33:39.580
buy that house.
And I never really go into what their parents did for a living.

528
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:44.170
But,
um,
the assumption is that their parents,
you know,
were similar to my parents.

529
00:33:44.171 --> 00:33:47.950
They came over in the 60s,
seventies had good,
stable jobs,

530
00:33:47.951 --> 00:33:51.660
are able to accrue some savings and then,
um,

531
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.190
if you have someone like solely,
you know,

532
00:33:54.191 --> 00:33:57.910
she sort of kept her money in her home,

533
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.870
she wasn't able to invest.
And so much of this,

534
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:06.900
so much of this just comes down to the technicalities of money and land and you

535
00:34:09.281 --> 00:34:10.420
know,
neighborhoods,

536
00:34:10.421 --> 00:34:14.250
the neighborhoods and the schools that you're able to send your children to.
And,

537
00:34:14.251 --> 00:34:17.530
and I guess the choice,
I guess really what it comes down to is,

538
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:21.760
is the power to choose where you want to live and what you want to do with your

539
00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:23.020
life and for your children.

540
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:27.370
And I think that that really has informed the various trajectories that we see

541
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:28.623
in the u s

542
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:32.821
<v 0>just very quickly,</v>

543
00:34:32.821 --> 00:34:37.230
particularly on that point in the op Ed in the New York Times you mentioned that

544
00:34:37.231 --> 00:34:38.460
it's not one Imon Group,

545
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:41.730
immigrant group is better or stronger and more competent than the other,

546
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:45.540
but rather the opportunities or the path that has already created for them in

547
00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:47.550
this nation before they come here.
Right.

548
00:34:47.551 --> 00:34:49.590
So I think that distinction that you made was beautiful.

549
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.540
<v 2>Thank you.
Um,</v>

550
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.270
<v 4>so you live in Berkeley and you've written a book about,
um,</v>

551
00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.600
the topic good in some parts of the country,
kind of like plays better,

552
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.720
better accepted than they were in other parts of the country.
I'm curious,
uh,

553
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:09.810
if you're going to other parts of the country and if in those places,

554
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:12.330
like,
is this more or less of like a political novel?

555
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.270
Is there some sort of statement about that based on where you are,

556
00:35:15.271 --> 00:35:16.830
who you're even talking with?

557
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.540
<v 2>Yeah.
Talking to about it.
So whether or not this is a political novel,</v>

558
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.210
that usually comes down to the individual reader.

559
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.710
So people who really want to engage with the political aspects of this,

560
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.130
they'll talk to me about that.
And people,

561
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:34.820
some people are just not very politically engaged and so they see it for like

562
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:35.171
the,

563
00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:40.171
the interpersonal drama of the book and in terms of traveling to different parts

564
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:41.401
of the country.

565
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:45.330
So I've been mostly on the west coast and then like New York and DC.

566
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.320
But I did go down to Dallas and I've been waiting,
you know,

567
00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:53.670
for the person with the red hat to stand up and ask me some questions what they

568
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:58.420
haven't yet.
I find,
you know,
if,

569
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.110
if I assume that there is dissent,

570
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:03.930
I assume that there are going to be people around who don't like what I'm

571
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:07.710
talking about in this book.
But they haven't said anything yet.

572
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:11.610
And I think that like a lot of us,
when they don't like something,
they,

573
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.710
they're keeping quiet or they're just not thinking about it.
So that's,

574
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.700
how would I respond to that?
Dissent.

575
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.680
I'd first want to know if they read the book.
You know,
cause I feel like if you,

576
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.490
when you engage with someone's story and you really sort of connect to them as a

577
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:31.140
character,
like you,

578
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.920
you start to see things in a more complex way than you would normally.

579
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.570
Um,
and I guess I would,

580
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.280
I would want to listen to where they're coming from.
You know,

581
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:45.114
it's,

582
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:50.120
I'm not the sort of writer who can get into a political argument with the

583
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:51.980
reader.
Um,

584
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.180
but I could talk to them about the issues within the book.

585
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.020
And really,
you know,
I can't,

586
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.720
I can't pretend to want to convert people,

587
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.340
but I want people to understand that this is a more complex situation than they

588
00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:10.110
may have initially assumed.

589
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.461
I'm curious,

590
00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:19.330
you mentioned that you're a teacher and you're a mother and you wrote this book,

591
00:37:19.331 --> 00:37:19.691
obviously.

592
00:37:19.691 --> 00:37:24.490
I'm just curious how you structure your time and like what a day in the life is

593
00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:28.270
like when you're working on a book like this that requires so much research and

594
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:33.470
time and engagement.
Yeah,
so I,
it was very slow.
Um,

595
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:38.770
I should say I wrote most of it when I had just one kid not to because when you

596
00:37:38.771 --> 00:37:41.530
have to,
it's like you have a thousand.
Um,

597
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.750
so basically what I would do is I would drop my kid off at preschool.

598
00:37:46.751 --> 00:37:49.240
I was teaching at the same time but only part time at a,

599
00:37:49.241 --> 00:37:51.250
at an art college at CCA.

600
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.940
And so I would drop my kid off at preschool,

601
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.490
take Bart into San Francisco.

602
00:37:57.491 --> 00:38:02.260
I used to go to the writer's grotto in San Francisco to write a lot.
Um,

603
00:38:02.261 --> 00:38:06.250
so I'd have one or two days where I would just spend the day there and then be

604
00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:09.970
back in Berkeley for like the 4:00 PM pickup at preschool.

605
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.290
And so I had a couple of days like this per week that were just completely

606
00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:18.490
devoted to the book and slowly,
slowly,
you know,

607
00:38:18.491 --> 00:38:22.090
it builds and at a certain point you get enough into the book that you can just

608
00:38:22.091 --> 00:38:26.290
write anywhere at anytime,
you know,
you can be standing on a bus and writing.

609
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.043
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

610
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.950
<v 2>How long did the whole thing take?
So it took about two and a half years for one,</v>

611
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:40.950
and then it was about three and a half more years of reworking it and editing.

612
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.453
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

613
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.370
<v 2>Yeah.
That was a lot slower than I thought.</v>

614
00:38:46.371 --> 00:38:49.010
I thought I'd like write it and it would be ready,
but no.

615
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.590
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

616
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.220
<v 5>I haven't read the book that,
I'm curious,
how do you set on it,</v>

617
00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.290
on the title when there's these paths of luck and unluck depending on the

618
00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:01.410
different journeys and where their characters are in there and their stages of

619
00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:02.230
their lives.

620
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.760
<v 2>Yeah,
so the title,
you know,</v>

621
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:08.650
I never thought of lucky is in terms of the character's journeys,

622
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:10.420
but I guess it does apply to that.

623
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.480
So lucky boy refers primarily to Ignacio who's a little boy born to solely.

624
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.520
And it's,
um,
it has sort of a,

625
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:23.620
an ironic side,
but also a sincere side.

626
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:28.621
He's sincerely lucky because he has these two mothers who love him and want him

627
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.500
and he's not so lucky because it's this love that sort of pulls apart his

628
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:36.071
destiny.

629
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:39.460
He doesn't know where he's gonna land or we don't know where he's going to land

630
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.590
<v 3>really.
Um,</v>

631
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.410
<v 2>and in terms of picking the title,</v>

632
00:39:43.411 --> 00:39:47.190
I think this was maybe the fifth or sixth title than I settled on.

633
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:52.530
Can we ask what some of the other titles where,
Oh yeah.
So I think,
um,

634
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:56.580
the first one where I didn't really know where this was going completely was our

635
00:39:56.581 --> 00:40:01.110
winning smiles,
which is from the Belle and Sebastian song.
I just,
I liked it.

636
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.880
Um,
and then there was some not so great ones,

637
00:40:05.881 --> 00:40:10.690
but one of the other major ones was season of the beast because I,
um,

638
00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:15.330
that that image of the beast comes up a lot.
But also there's lobbyists,
Thea,

639
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.770
which is the freight train that migrants right up through Mexico.
Um,

640
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.970
they write the top of it and it's,
it's pretty dangerous that's in here as well.

641
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:28.230
And um,
at one point in this is bad.

642
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:33.150
So at one point as Ignacio's nickname that his mother gives him is not shown.

643
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.180
So at one point it was not show,
exclamation mark.

644
00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:39.660
Um,

645
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.660
and then eventually there's this one line that Tom has the phrase lucky boy in

646
00:40:44.911 --> 00:40:48.180
the book.
And so eventually I was like,
oh,
okay,
I'll just go with that.

647
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.020
And my editor wanted to change it and then we decided not to.

648
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.230
<v 5>Um,
so thank you so much for coming.
We had a blast.
Really appreciate it.</v>

649
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.550
<v 3>Thanks.
[inaudible].</v>
