1
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.940
So please welcome enthusiastically and more me,
Viv.
Cost Croft.

2
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.773
<v 1>Thank you very much.</v>

3
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.700
<v 2>In the spirit of Google translate,
I feel like I should say you loss by sea,</v>

4
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:31.370
but the Yellow Blue Tibia,
that's very rude or any Russian speaking.

5
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.240
Yeah.
So what did you say that hello?
Thank you.
I love you.

6
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.020
How are you?

7
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.060
<v 0>I can see this is going to be a great,
a great chat with you.</v>

8
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.060
Let's just start with what,
what do you mean owning the room?
What does that mean?

9
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.440
<v 2>Wow.</v>

10
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.440
You just demonstrated it actually with that little slipup that you had not being

11
00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:56.450
able to say and that Cardinia,
Nah.
Uh,

12
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.290
so can you say it now?
No.

13
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.450
And owning the room,

14
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.750
it's about feeling really comfortable in the spotlight.

15
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.700
So comfortable that you're okay with failing.
That's,
that's it.
Basically.

16
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.360
Because in everyday life when we're talking to people,

17
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:18.470
when we're just moving through our lives,
we don't go around thinking,
oh,

18
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:20.870
I'm going to meet by Fred with coffee for coffee,

19
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.680
but I haven't prepared anything to say,
you know,
we,

20
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:27.110
we move three life very comfortably and we don't question ourselves.

21
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.430
But suddenly when we're in a position like not,
not literally like this,

22
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:34.370
but sometimes literally like this where we're in a spotlight,

23
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.390
but that spotlight can feel like it comes anytime.

24
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.050
Like in an interview situation,

25
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.960
job interview in a difficult conversation with your boss,
a in a confrontation.

26
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.990
We can feel like we're in that spotlight and that is the moment when the

27
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:51.350
adrenaline comes and we have that fight or flight,

28
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.110
which is a very natural human reaction.

29
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.480
It's about learning how to be comfortable with that controller and feel like

30
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:03.110
you're just owning yourself in the way that you do in normal moments.

31
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.550
I've gotten quite poor Mckenna quite early on.
That's okay.

32
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.123
<v 0>So,
um,</v>

33
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.420
we're going to go into things sort of get practical about what you learned and

34
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:14.980
what you've shared in the book.
Before we do that,

35
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:18.820
I mentioned this idea of doing a hundred standup gigs in a hundred days,

36
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:22.360
which you did when you had a child under one.

37
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:26.740
I think a is if it wasn't stressful enough and just tell us a bit about like,

38
00:02:26.741 --> 00:02:28.480
why did you do,
why you do?

39
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.960
<v 2>Some people will do anything to avoid bad time for small children.</v>

40
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.030
And I was one of those people and they,
what happened to me was the,
as you said,

41
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:44.031
I had this long and very happy career as a freelance journalist.

42
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:49.080
I started my career in my early twenties working in old school fleet streets,

43
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.150
which lots of the beautiful young people in the rain and to even remember,
uh,
I,

44
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.160
so I had to office job until I was about 25 working for places like the Daily

45
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.180
Express and the Daily Telegraph and places I hated.

46
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.120
And that was a good experience for me to be in a job I hated.

47
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.650
It made me go freelance.

48
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.150
And then I had about 10 years of loving writing and freelancing and that was how

49
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.150
I was able to have my three children.
I have three children,

50
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.460
which is an answer to the question,
how many children there's to money.

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.050
And as I go into my mid thirties and I felt like I had a lot of control over my

52
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.570
life because I had a lot of flexibility and I loved my work.

53
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.710
I began to realize that as my children were growing up,
I was telling them a lie.

54
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.360
So I was always saying to them,
do what you want with your life.
Live your dreams.

55
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:38.260
Don't let other people tell you what to do.
Um,
the more I said this to them,

56
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:39.094
then more memorialize.

57
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.090
It wasn't true for me and that the thing I'd always wanted to do,

58
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.350
which was to perform,
to entertain,
to be in the spotlight,

59
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.550
to really try stand up comedy was what I really wanted to do.

60
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.510
I'd never done it because I was too damn chicken.
I was cheeky.

61
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.920
That's what you wanted to do.
Um,
I had had an idea from,

62
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:03.460
went from when I was a child of people who again,

63
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.350
were too young to remember the kids from fame.
Yeah.
1980s.

64
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.510
Yeah.
Doris,
Doris Schwartz,
Doris Schwartz,

65
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:17.160
and Bruno Martelli.
It's from fame.
Mr Swarovski

66
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.570
don't,
Doris Schwartz was this character in the sort of mid eighties,

67
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.610
a woman stand up,
uh,

68
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.550
in the New York High School of the performing arts and um,

69
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.490
New York is in the room cringing.
And then I loved her when I was a child,

70
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.200
but I grew up in the kind of environment where my parents later turned out to be

71
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.550
massive Brexit voters until I quiet sort of closed,

72
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.020
don't take any risks,
do not do anything creative sort of environment.

73
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:53.560
So I was never,
I didn't feel I was able to set that as a goal.

74
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.790
Like I'd love to do stand up.

75
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:57.310
I'd love to do acting if I could live my life over again.

76
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:00.730
I would've done that from a much younger age.
But instead I kind of was like,

77
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.770
okay,
well maybe I can be a writer.

78
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.740
And just through seeing my own kids grow up and realizing that,
you know,

79
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:10.030
life is too short to stifle the stuff you really want to do.

80
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.410
I had to acknowledge,
yeah,
actually I'm kind of hiding behind this keyboard.

81
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:18.730
I'm hiding behind the words and I've got to get out there and at least try.

82
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.710
And so I ended up doing some workshops and all that kind of stuff that you do

83
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.150
when you first try it.

84
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.220
And realizing that I loved it after the first workshop I ever did in standup

85
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.850
comedy when I was 35 I'm 45 now.
I know,
it's amazing.

86
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.400
And uh,

87
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:40.401
I came home and my husband said to me after doing three hours of this standup

88
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.660
training,
this is the most relaxed I've seen you in 10 years.

89
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.930
And I knew I really wanted to do it,

90
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.790
but then you learn very quickly how hard it is to actually do it and that if you

91
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:54.970
are going to do it seriously,
you better get to a hundred gigs fast.

92
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.430
And I just had my third child,
um,
and he turned one.

93
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:00.800
When he turned one I was like,
okay,
you've had enough attention from me.

94
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.100
Now I'm going out every night,
a hundred gigs,
a hundred nights.

95
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:09.101
And that was in 2011 and since then I've gone on to do five shows,

96
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:11.570
Adam Bra,
one woman shows,

97
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.850
and ended up hosting book tools for Graham Norton,

98
00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:19.640
dawn French and Saunders doe brands,
and moving into more radio and TV work,

99
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:23.540
which is what I really wanted to do.
So it was a route to something else.
Yeah,

100
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:27.320
it was.
And I would,
if you'd have said to me 10 years ago,
oh,

101
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:30.950
you're going to be doing standup and you're going to go on stage with,
with,

102
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:33.260
you know,
Graham Norton or any of these people,

103
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:36.470
and then you're going to write a book for people about how to own the room,

104
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.210
I would be like,
no thanks.
No,
I don't really want,
that.
Sounds horrible.

105
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.520
But as time went on,

106
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.380
I realized how much I learned about all of this and that I really wanted to pass

107
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:52.490
it on to other people and have this discussion about it's not an entirely

108
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.640
gendered discussion and that's really important point to make.

109
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.240
But I do think it's harder sometimes for women to try these things.

110
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:04.241
And that's obviously a huge conversation in comedy is why aren't there as many

111
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:04.761
women,

112
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.700
I think we've loads more women are coming through now and the last 10 years I've

113
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:11.120
seen a massive change,
but the numbers are always really skewed.

114
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.590
And on a comedy bill,

115
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.360
your often the only woman out of six and you're genuinely going to be the

116
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:22.360
opener,
like the lowest status spot.
Um,
all that stuff.
Um,

117
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.570
so having learned how to do this on the fly late in life,

118
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.060
I wanted to pass it on.
And then I found,

119
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:32.240
I was constantly thinking of for the idea for this book and for the podcast

120
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:36.320
where I interview lots of women about,
about all of this stuff.

121
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.070
I was thinking,
I can't write that because who will listen to me?

122
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.240
I can't,
I'm not famous.
No one knew.

123
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:46.910
I'm not a massively successful standup comedian.
Like,

124
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.400
and I remember saying to this friend of mine who's a writer,

125
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.820
I can't write this book.
This book should be written by Joan Rivers.
Like Joan,

126
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.980
who,
who would want to read how to own the room by Joan Rivers?

127
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:00.650
I mean that would be the most amazing book ever.

128
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.970
And my friend just looked at me and said,
Viv,
Joan Rivers is dead.

129
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.250
And if she were an eye,
she went to not be bothered to write this book.

130
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.670
She is not a book writing kind of person,
although she did write a lot of books,

131
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:19.730
but she would not want to write this book.
So this is your book,

132
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.480
this is your idea.
Put it out there and see if people are interested.

133
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.880
And that the book came out in November,

134
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.910
I met use shortly after it came out and it's become a best seller.

135
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.870
It's sold in three countries.
It's coming out in Canada next week.
I'm,

136
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:38.300
the podcast has gone top 10 on Itunes,

137
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.470
which the podcast got put together in two weeks.
Literally because Mary Portas,

138
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.730
uh,
the retail,
Gloria came to me and said,
how can I help you with your book?

139
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.630
And I said,
well,

140
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.070
it's coming out in two weeks so I can't interview you for it or anything.

141
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.300
How about I interview you for the,
which doesn't actually exist,

142
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.110
but it will if you say yes to an interview.
And she said yes.

143
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.220
And so then suddenly I had a podcast which happened in two weeks.
So

144
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.710
<v 0>you are on a mission though.
And he really,</v>

145
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.641
<v 2>yeah,</v>

146
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:13.641
because this stuff is really important and I've been really,

147
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.640
um,
I've had a lot of moments of being really upset actually of what I,

148
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:21.420
the stories that have come out from doing these kind of events.
Um,

149
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.460
I do one on one work with people.

150
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:27.480
I do workshops where people can come and have a clinic with me for 10 minutes.

151
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:32.481
And I do little in interventions about presentation and confidence and man as

152
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.060
well as women,
but often from women,

153
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:41.061
like the depth of people's insecurity and the weight that they're carrying with

154
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:47.040
them about,
um,
my voice sounds weird.

155
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.480
No one wants to listen to my voice.
I've got an annoying voice.
Um,

156
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.610
I feel like I'm talking about myself here.
Um,

157
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.090
all of these tiny little niggling gremlins are so prevalent in every body.

158
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.200
Yeah.
And there's got to be a way to talk about this and get rid of it because

159
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:08.280
everybody thinks it's personal to them and they have this specific problem that

160
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:11.980
they would need some help with and it's not everybody has it.
Yeah,

161
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.430
<v 0>absolutely.
So,
um,
I want to get into the book.</v>

162
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:18.210
So one of the things I love about the book as it's written in chapters around

163
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.670
people and so be more Michelle Obama is the first chapter.

164
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.260
<v 2>Yes.
Demonstrate it now Matt,</v>

165
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.290
<v 3>I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.</v>

166
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.250
<v 2>You actually are.</v>

167
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.320
<v 0>I said to Viv,
actually I uh,</v>

168
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.330
that chapter is about something called happy high status and we'll ask you about

169
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:43.751
that in a second.

170
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:48.751
But yesterday I had those three words in my mind when I went on stage at a big

171
00:10:48.821 --> 00:10:53.230
technology media and telecom is event and I was speaking between the CEO of sky

172
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.580
owned by Rupert Murdoch and the CEO of News Corp owned by Rupert Murdoch.

173
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.871
And I was thinking,

174
00:10:58.871 --> 00:11:02.110
I know what these guys are going to say about the technology companies and I'm

175
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:05.800
going to be more Michelle Obama in between.
And so thank you.

176
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.020
<v 3>No.
But now I have a snoop.</v>

177
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.430
Did he wear a sleeveless?

178
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.980
Quite gold this time.
So

179
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.340
<v 0>but happy high status.
Yeah.
That is a great concept.
Tell us about that.</v>

180
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.670
<v 2>Yes.
I,
when I first started training in,</v>

181
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.790
in standup and taking all of these workshops and trying to work out how I was

182
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:31.770
going to start doing this stuff,
uh,

183
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.620
I came across this idea in Improv comedy called happy high status.

184
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.190
And it's about the moment where you are so open and comfortable in a space that

185
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:50.420
you can accept disagreement,
you can accept descent,

186
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.680
you can accept that the person coming after you is going to you.

187
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.200
You can take on haters and be like,
yeah,

188
00:11:56.201 --> 00:12:00.680
tell me more about why you hate me and be very open and collegiate where there

189
00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:05.200
and allow everybody's,
uh,
viewpoints to exist at any one time.

190
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.070
Um,
I am personally not very good at this because I'm quite neurotic,

191
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.300
but it's an energy that you need to have a,
for example,

192
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:18.100
if you're emptying in comedy where you might have to switch the energy from one

193
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.270
comedian to the next,

194
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:22.420
you might have to bring up the energy in the room or calm it down if somebody

195
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:23.590
was really crazy.

196
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.510
And it's about being able to feel your way into situations where you make sure

197
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:31.480
everybody feels unthreatened and everybody feels welcome.

198
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.390
And Michelle Obama is the expert of this.

199
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.480
But the other example to show it's not gendered as well.

200
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:42.270
The other example is George Clooney.
So the fee,
the story,

201
00:12:42.271 --> 00:12:45.720
they use an Improv about George Clooney.
It's supposed to be a made up story,

202
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:49.020
but I like to think it's true unless it's going to happen to me one day.

203
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.700
So you imagine that you are going to a Hollywood party,

204
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.970
it's the Oscars and you're going to the Vanity Fair party,

205
00:12:56.971 --> 00:12:59.850
which recently discredited by the New York Times.

206
00:12:59.851 --> 00:13:03.990
But imagine it's still in its hay day and you're going to this fabulous party.

207
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:06.990
Everybody's in black tie.
You're late.
To your meeting,
your friends,

208
00:13:06.991 --> 00:13:08.550
who you really want to see on the way in.

209
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:12.390
You tap her waiter on the shoulder to ask for a drink because you're late and

210
00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:16.290
you're in a hurry.
Oh,
could you just get me a drink?
You go and join your friends.

211
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.670
The waiter comes over with the drink,
you turn round,

212
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.780
it's George Clooney and you mistook George Clooney for a waiter,

213
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.830
which in a black tie situation could happen,
right?
Matthew,
move in these circles.

214
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.350
<v 0>I've done it twice,
right?</v>

215
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.820
<v 2>And the happy high states,</v>

216
00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:39.780
his lesson is that George Clooney hands you a cocktail or your glass or

217
00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:44.781
champagne or whatever without making you remotely feel small because he's George

218
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.310
Clooney and he can,
and Michelle Obama could do that.
Barack Obama could do that.

219
00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:52.920
They're not going to turn around and say,
excuse me,
I'm not a cocktail later,

220
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.470
but to show you that happy high status is not the same as high status.

221
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.770
The person you could not do that with is Donald Trump.

222
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.230
So it's not about conferred status or a business card.

223
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.190
It's not about the actual position that you occupy in the hierarchy.

224
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.120
It's about how you conduct yourself with other people.

225
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.100
<v 0>He's a great concept.
Thank you for sharing that.
You mentioned Joan ridges,</v>

226
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.190
rivers.
She's in your book as well.
Be More Joan Rivers.

227
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.410
What do we do when we want to be more Joan?

228
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.900
<v 2>Oh my God.
Well,
I was,
I was tricky.</v>

229
00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:32.750
I'm including Joan Rivers in this actually,
um,

230
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.990
particularly because she's an example of somebody.

231
00:14:35.991 --> 00:14:40.900
I think his comedy would not exist anymore nowadays cause woke,
she ain't,

232
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:41.820
uh,

233
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.820
so that I wanted to include her as an example of a person who is everything

234
00:14:47.991 --> 00:14:51.050
we're told,
man,
I'm winning.
We shouldn't,

235
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.660
so we shouldn't talk too fast.

236
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.370
We must make sure that we speak in a measured way.
We must,
uh,

237
00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.900
lots of women are always saying,
should I lower my tone so that people can hit?

238
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.930
No,
no.

239
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:07.700
Just speak like a normal person and Joan Rivers breaks and lots of these rules.

240
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.890
Okay.
She can't because she's a standup comedian,

241
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.840
but she's a person who speaks way too fast,
who has way too much entity.

242
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.860
You can barely sort of keep up with what she's saying supposedly.

243
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.590
And yet you never miss a single word.

244
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.630
So I wanted to include lots of examples in the book of women who break the rules

245
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.760
because there's a lot of these kind of fake bullshit rules around speaking and

246
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:35.630
presenting and how we come across to people that we all know.
In reality,

247
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:40.070
we all have,
even within our day to day lives and work like managers who,

248
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.310
they're not a stereotypical manager,

249
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.820
they are actually maybe a bit more introverted than you would expect.

250
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.510
Or there's somebody who's a bit more relaxed in a corporate culture than you.

251
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.460
There are always people who break the rules.

252
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:56.900
And for me it's really important to try and find your own energy and your own

253
00:15:56.901 --> 00:16:01.310
style by looking at these people and saying,
oh,
that's,
that's not orthodox.

254
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:04.580
How are they getting away with that?
That's really interesting to me.

255
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.370
<v 0>So we were working on trying to get,
uh,
uh,</v>

256
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.770
workshop lined up so people can experience this in practice,
which will be great.

257
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:15.410
So look out for dates on that.
Um,
but what,

258
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:18.010
what do you most often find when you're working with people?

259
00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:21.370
Is there something that's a really common issue that you have to encourage

260
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:25.360
people to deal with or is everybody got their own different challenges?

261
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.090
<v 2>There's one very specific thing I want to mention because I've noticed you doing</v>

262
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:33.710
it Matt.
So there's,

263
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.060
it's really interesting.

264
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:40.061
I know we had lunch in your lovely canteen before we came on stage and you were

265
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:45.100
talking,
he's really what you want.
No you're not cause you,
you have the high to,

266
00:16:45.101 --> 00:16:49.390
so you're not worried about what I'm going to say.
So you're okay.
You're okay.

267
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.920
So we were talking in a group of about 10 of us in an informal conversational

268
00:16:55.641 --> 00:17:00.641
situation and you and lots of other people in the group and probably me as well

269
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.750
when we were talking,

270
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:06.380
we tend to talk like this and say what's been going on in our week and

271
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.690
everything that we say goes up at the end of every sentence.

272
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.050
And I was really interested because I noticed you were doing it as well.

273
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.600
And I often say,

274
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.220
oh this is something that's very common to women and younger women.
And,

275
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:24.260
and I was very interested to notice that you followed that inflection as well,

276
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:30.610
which is totally useful and appropriate in a conversational setting.

277
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.200
However,

278
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.740
lots of people then transfer that into a formal interview presentation situation

279
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.930
and it makes everything you say sounds like a suggestion and it weakens your

280
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:49.740
power.
And it's the one thing that everybody needs to work on.

281
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.230
Because if I start talking to you like this,

282
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.540
you don't know if I really mean what I'm saying.

283
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.080
And last weekend I went to Paris and my husband's name's Simon.

284
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.790
Did I even know my husband's name?
I mean it's,
yeah,

285
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.590
so it,
it's uh,

286
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.680
and it's really interesting to me that you were talking like that because this

287
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:15.471
kind of talking is actually necessary for forging bonds and for showing,

288
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.410
you know,
this isn't a formal situation where we're having a normal chat.

289
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:20.244
This is day to day,

290
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.900
but the moments where you are in the spotlight and you want to step up and be

291
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:28.020
heard,
move out of that,
hey,

292
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:31.290
we're just hanging out in the canteen and having some Laksa.

293
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.110
<v 0>There's a fun lunch.
I'm so good.
So it's,</v>

294
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.590
we shouldn't have had that second vodka cutter.

295
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.600
<v 2>No,
it's,</v>

296
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.960
it's recognizing the difference between conversational speech and more formal.

297
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.670
<v 0>Okay.
Thank you for that.
Now you made me feel a little uneasy,
but thank you.</v>

298
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.540
That was intentional.
No.
Can I ask you another question?

299
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.220
<v 2>You see that it is a question.</v>

300
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.820
<v 0>I'm really confused.
So what I'm going to do,</v>

301
00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:09.760
I'm going to come to you for questions,
uh,
in a moment.

302
00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:14.140
So please come to the mic in a sentence.
I say something.

303
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.950
<v 2>You as well say the I'm embarrassed.
Okay.
Right.
Um,</v>

304
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.920
so Matt and I,
we,
we don't really know each other,
right?

305
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.960
But we are neighbors.

306
00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:31.961
We live two minutes walk apart and our children have been at the same school

307
00:19:33.951 --> 00:19:35.960
then at different times.

308
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.000
And I have known for a while,
there's this Scott,
I live in Teddington.

309
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.980
There's this guy who lives locally who works for Google,
Matt from Google,

310
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.470
and he's a parent,
right?
I going with this.
Right?

311
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.130
And so then I met Matt,
yes.

312
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.250
At a friend's party.
And I'm like,
Oh yeah,
he's the Guy Matt from Google.

313
00:19:58.251 --> 00:20:02.670
He lives here.
Um,
and we talked about this.
We did.

314
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.120
And you said,
Oh,
I'm really interested in this.

315
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.310
This is so important for people to talk about this.

316
00:20:07.311 --> 00:20:11.510
Can you come around and chat about it?
And so I go round to,

317
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.200
he invites me to his house.
Gonna chat about it.
I'm thinking,
Oh yeah,
yeah.

318
00:20:15.201 --> 00:20:19.310
Matt from Google is a parent at the school.
And on the way I thought,

319
00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:22.850
I'm just going to check who he is.

320
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.740
I was googling.
I was like,
oh,

321
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.600
okay.
Yeah.

322
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.090
So what was it that came up that

323
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.840
I was Oh,
I see.
It was not very kind to me actually.
Yeah.
Well No,
no,

324
00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:48.820
I don't mean that something came up.
I just mean I then realized who you were.

325
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.540
Okay.

326
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.620
Because I was thinking I was just getting to meet this guy for it called Matt

327
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.600
who,
who's from Google?
Um,
yeah.

328
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.480
<v 0>So can I ask you another question?</v>

329
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.440
<v 2>Yes,
you can.</v>

330
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.140
<v 0>Okay.
So thank you very much of that story.</v>

331
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.200
<v 2>Ah,
you didn't like,</v>

332
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.490
<v 0>so something else you mentioned in the book and,</v>

333
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.590
and I think people will have maybe heard of before,
it's like how physic,

334
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.510
how your physical posture can,

335
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.560
can help you or hinder you in these settings as well.
And you have a chapter,

336
00:21:18.561 --> 00:21:21.190
it'd be more Amy Cuddy.
She's a body language expert.

337
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:22.240
And I was like going through the book actually,

338
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:25.480
I was watching each of these people on Youtube and what you meant is really

339
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:29.860
interesting to read the book and see the,
the stuff.
So what,
what does,

340
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.760
what does she teach us

341
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.400
<v 2>how the is probably somebody,
somebody,
lots of people in the room will know.</v>

342
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.670
She has one of the most watched ted talks ever about power poses.

343
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.030
So embrace this smart.
Okay.
Okay.
Ah,
you see,

344
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.470
right.
So,
uh,
if people haven't watched this ted talk,

345
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:55.270
it's from about five years ago.
It's now in about 50 million views.
And Amy Cuddy,

346
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:58.400
she has a book called presence,
which is all about body language.
Um,

347
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:03.450
but it's more about how your body language affects how you feel inside rather

348
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:08.530
than how it affects how you come across to other people.
So power poses are

349
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.900
wonder women.
Usain Bolt's

350
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.550
very nice and the one I call Citi banker less.

351
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.530
Yeah.
The whole point of the power pays is,

352
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.590
is opening up your body and her ted talk explains if you hold these poses in a

353
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:37.000
private place,
like not in your meeting,
hello,

354
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.530
you guys were private place and you hold this pose for at least two minutes,

355
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.810
it changes the chemicals in your brain.

356
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.700
That's what her research showed is very interesting because that was five years

357
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:52.660
ago and then that went viral and led to a book and everything.

358
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.950
And since then of course because she's popular neuroscience or the other neuro

359
00:22:57.951 --> 00:23:00.250
sciences said,
actually no,

360
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.940
there is not enough evidence to show the chemicals in the brain and your sample

361
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:08.941
size is very small and that it's been a bit of a sad kind of thing.

362
00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:12.310
But for me,
these power poses really work.

363
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.210
I don't care if the real science is there or not.
I'd done it.
It works.

364
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.140
And it makes a lot of sense to me of this opening up of the body,

365
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.210
not for public consumption.

366
00:23:22.211 --> 00:23:24.190
So it's not about how you come across to other people,

367
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.910
but for fooling yourself into,
oh,

368
00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:32.911
I've got this and that feeling of you bolt crossing the finishing line is the

369
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:37.921
feeling of I've got this and it's very hard if he's been and stood in a dressing

370
00:23:38.531 --> 00:23:42.460
room in a toilet in like standing over there,
I was like this,

371
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.780
um,

372
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.780
it totally you and takes away any feelings of smallness and nerves that you

373
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:50.234
might have.

374
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.110
<v 0>And something else you touched on in the book is,</v>

375
00:23:53.111 --> 00:23:57.590
is that people take their cue from you,
um,
in terms of,
yeah,

376
00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.160
if you're on stage and your nervous and their attentions on yeah.

377
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.200
<v 2>You see the difference in how someone comes across when they do this.</v>

378
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.650
Yeah.
It's so important.

379
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.940
So if you go into a situation with this bigger energy,

380
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.080
I think we're frightened of this because we don't want to come across as a,

381
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.380
as an asshole.
Can I say like I've said it now.
Um,

382
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.940
so we don't want to come across as that person.
You know,

383
00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:31.870
nobody wants to be that person who he,
you know,
we don't,

384
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.170
nobody really wants to be like,
Hey,
I own the room.
You know,

385
00:24:35.171 --> 00:24:39.820
nobody wants to be that person.
So we're scared of that openness and that,

386
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.370
but in fact,
most people,

387
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.140
they just need a bit more of that and a bit less of this.

388
00:24:47.141 --> 00:24:51.700
And don't be afraid to like overdo it.
You can always rein it back in,

389
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.650
but we're so afraid that we go too far the other way and we don't need.

390
00:24:56.651 --> 00:25:01.600
And then other people,
they do take their cue from you in all things.
You know,

391
00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:02.800
how you enter a stage,

392
00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:07.180
how you enter a room that they will meet you with the same energy.

393
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.970
<v 0>Do please come to the microphone because have we go?
Fantastic.
I'm terrified.</v>

394
00:25:11.971 --> 00:25:15.840
I'm just going to get an interrogation or more.
Thank you very much.
Go ahead.

395
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.940
<v 4>Hi.
Thank you so much.
I really enjoyed the talk.
Um,
I have a question around,
um,</v>

396
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.550
how you started,
um,
in terms of failure.
Like actually you,

397
00:25:24.551 --> 00:25:27.940
you mentioned that owning the room is being comfortable with failing.

398
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.290
And I guess my question is,
especially because you do stand up comedy,
um,

399
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:36.760
have you ever failed when you've actually owned the room and what was it like to

400
00:25:36.761 --> 00:25:41.050
kind of pick yourself up from that point and actually take control of the room

401
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.940
again and if it was even in the same situation or if it was when you came back

402
00:25:45.941 --> 00:25:46.774
to it?

403
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.830
<v 2>I almost didn't listen to the,</v>

404
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:51.740
I did listen to the question but I almost didn't listen to the question cause

405
00:25:51.741 --> 00:25:55.240
you have a great tone and great presence.

406
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.750
I know up talk unless it's a question.
Very lovely.

407
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.730
Yeah.
The question is we all have so much to learn.
Uh,

408
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.140
the question is,
yeah,
what,

409
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.460
so what constitutes failure and how have I recovered from that?

410
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.500
In sounds up,
you learn nothing unless you fail.

411
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.780
And it's like any artist.
I'm not saying standup has an artistic endeavor.
I,

412
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.400
I think it's a bit pretentious to say that,

413
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:27.380
but in any creative endeavor or something where you're giving people something

414
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:29.000
that they didn't actually ask for,

415
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.320
that's always the really interesting thing is that you're trying to say you

416
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:36.800
didn't ask for this or you're not expecting this,
but look,

417
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:37.670
you're going to like it.

418
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.030
It's that is always a huge risk and constitutes she's failure.

419
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:46.030
So many times I would fail very badly.

420
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:50.430
I remember the first time I ever did a Sassy night gig and that's a big deal.

421
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.860
And when I was trying to do my hundred gigs in a hundred nights,

422
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:57.090
I could never get Saturday nights booked because that's the night when people

423
00:26:57.091 --> 00:26:59.100
pay a lot of money to see professionals.

424
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.000
And I was not a professional then and I'd be missing a night.

425
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.520
And because I was doing a hundred gigs,
100 consecutive nights,

426
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:09.880
that would mean I'd have to do to the next night.
Or if I missed three Saturdays,

427
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.580
they don't have to do three and one other night.

428
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.690
And so I was desperate to get this Saturday night gig and I got it and I was

429
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:18.900
opening.
And I did material,

430
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:23.901
the I done maybe 20 or 30 gigs before a five minute slot that had gone really

431
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:27.870
well and I knew it was good.
It was solid,
it was gold,

432
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:32.871
solid gold and absolutely bombed in a room of about 200 people.

433
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:38.250
That's a lot of silence and it was a full on tumbleweed for the whole of the

434
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:43.251
time and I had no skills and no experience of knowing how to turn that around

435
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.980
and my head split into three parts.

436
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.990
The first part is the front of my heads.
Keep talking,
keep talking,

437
00:27:51.991 --> 00:27:56.970
just keep going,
keep going.
Middle Part,
think of something else to say,

438
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.850
find some know and there isn't anything.
Then you know what?

439
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.940
Nothing.
And the back part of my head.
The third part was like,

440
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.690
why don't you decide what method of suicide you're going to use

441
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.630
when this is over?

442
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:18.300
Because you will not want to live in society any longer because you have shamed

443
00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:21.480
yourself.
And it was really,
really horrific.

444
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:24.390
And it was a painful death because lots of the other death I've had,

445
00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:25.360
like many deaths,

446
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:29.460
a open Mike or whereas the workshop vide or as much easier,

447
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:30.480
the audience knows you're new,

448
00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:32.400
but there's some my first professional thing and I,

449
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.820
and I fluffed it and I went to the back of the room after I'd finished and you

450
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:40.020
know,
walked offstage to like

451
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:48.030
walk of shame.
And I said to this comedian at the back of the room,

452
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.930
what am I doing wrong?
What am I doing wrong?

453
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.850
Is it what I'm wearing?
Is it my hair?
Is My boy?
I was kind of,

454
00:28:56.851 --> 00:28:59.850
I can understand why it worked once,
but not that time.

455
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.980
And he looked to me and I thought,
Oh wow,

456
00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:04.830
he's going to say something so profound now and it's going to change everything.

457
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.090
And he said,
just be funny.

458
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.123
Right?

459
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.690
And I did walk home in tears and I was still crying the next morning.

460
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.900
But after a while I learned,

461
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.480
especially because then I was doing my hundred gigs and that was the trick of

462
00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:27.900
the hundred gigs.
That was like number 27.
Well,

463
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:30.480
tomorrow's number 28 let it go.

464
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.440
So I had to go back and do another one and then the next night it was fine.

465
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.400
And the thing is,
he was right.
Just be funny.

466
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.500
Like just fail.
Learn from it.

467
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.820
Try again and just be,
but you know,

468
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.410
that's a stupid thing to say.
It's like saying just relax.
But the reality is,

469
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:52.990
is just force yourself through difficult situations.

470
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.450
Accept it as a learning curve.

471
00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.790
And I wish I hadn't put myself through so much personal torture because what I

472
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:04.060
was experiencing was not really personal to me.
It was the process,

473
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.790
processes failure and learning from failure.

474
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:08.170
<v 5>Thank you.</v>

475
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:08.760
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

476
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.810
<v 5>no welcome.
Wow.</v>

477
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:16.440
<v 4>Um,
my question was just around humor and how important you feel about is.
Um,</v>

478
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.240
I guess it's one of those things you mentioned you either innately habit where

479
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.060
you don't.

480
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.680
So would you suggest that people should learn to be humorous or use humor?

481
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.870
Was that the only tool?
What would you say?

482
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.950
<v 2>Oh I love the question.
Well this is a,
there are two parts to this question.</v>

483
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:35.080
Number one is do you have to be born funny?

484
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:40.660
And I think some people are naturally funny and they can channel that in

485
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:41.351
different ways.

486
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:46.150
Being naturally funny in life doesn't necessarily translate to being funny as a

487
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:46.984
performer.

488
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.820
And there are lots of performers who are really awkward in life and lots of

489
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:52.780
[inaudible] they really are.

490
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.400
And there are lots of people who are very funny in life who you put them in a

491
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:01.990
standup situation and you actually working from a script and that's a whole

492
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:02.920
different disciplines.

493
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:07.630
So knowing what's funny on stage is not the same as knowing what's funny in
life.

494
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.530
Um,

495
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:13.090
but I don't think that you're necessarily born with it or not born with there.

496
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.100
I think you can allow yourself to play cause a lot of it is about accessing your

497
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:23.560
childhood self.
Cause when we're kids we're all pretty funny,
right?

498
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.070
All kinds of funny.
It's a funny half kids.

499
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.030
<v 3>Yeah.
Let that be the message to you
today.</v>

500
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.470
Happy International Women's Day.
Have children.
No.

501
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.240
Use contraception.
That's mostly,
yeah,
but [inaudible] sorry.

502
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.730
Sorry.
Um,
but yeah,

503
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.570
kids,
kids

504
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.951
<v 2>funny.</v>

505
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:52.330
And when we kids we play and we make each other laugh and with silly and we

506
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:53.164
don't care.

507
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.310
And then ran about the age of like parents will recognize this age of seven,

508
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:57.671
eight,

509
00:31:57.671 --> 00:32:02.671
nine what they call the social editor starts to kick in and the social editor is

510
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:07.690
the person who makes you think inside.
Oh No,

511
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:10.810
what if other people think I said the role thing and Oh,

512
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:15.811
in this situation I'm not allowed to do that and this really important to have

513
00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:19.090
that social editor.
Otherwise we would all be,
you know,

514
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:24.010
leaking out stuff the whole time and acting out,
which is what kids do.

515
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.580
Um,

516
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.560
but it's really sad because the flip side of that is that we lose the play that

517
00:32:29.561 --> 00:32:33.430
we have.
So anytime that you feel like you want to get more humor into something,

518
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.070
just try and access your kid self.

519
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.580
<v 4>Yeah.
To your answer to for other questions.</v>

520
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.110
<v 0>Oh,
here we go.
Thank you.</v>

521
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:48.710
<v 6>So let's say you work with a range of clients who are high sadness to happy,</v>

522
00:32:48.751 --> 00:32:49.584
high status

523
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.100
<v 2>asking for a friend.</v>

524
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.540
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

525
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:57.550
And you are not yet either status but more of an aspiring happy high status.

526
00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:03.140
How do you own the room as that person with high size?

527
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.630
<v 2>Very interesting.
Specifically working with,
yeah,</v>

528
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.660
some people who've had difficult and some people who are fine.

529
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.100
You're saying?

530
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.680
<v 6>Yeah,
like an Anna Wintour for example.</v>

531
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.690
<v 2>Aw.
What would you do if Anna winter was your boss?
Right.</v>

532
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.380
What a great example.
So yeah,

533
00:33:23.381 --> 00:33:27.580
I mean Anna Winter is somebody who is not happy,
high status,
right?

534
00:33:27.581 --> 00:33:29.080
She is guarded,

535
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.133
<v 0>unhappy.</v>

536
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.130
<v 2>Well.
So I imagine in herself she's very happy.</v>

537
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.790
She's got things set up just how she wants,
but she's kind of guarded,

538
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:42.420
high status.
But the queen is not happy,
high status.
Um,

539
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.490
she can't be,
you know,
she can't have the same energy as Michelle Obama.

540
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.170
So for example,
Michelle Obama,
when she met the Queen,
she touched her,

541
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.750
which was a breach of protocol.
But she's so happy.
I say to she,

542
00:33:55.751 --> 00:33:56.930
she got away with it.

543
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.260
The Queen would not touch anybody because she's not in that kind of happy zone

544
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.690
and neither was Anna winter.
She's in that kind of garden zone.

545
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.460
For me it's really important to underline that point of it's not about the

546
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:12.470
status that you actually occupy.

547
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:17.860
It's about your energy and your generosity and your willingness to accept any

548
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:23.150
opinion and work with whoever you're working with and yeah,

549
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.950
it's not a magic wand.

550
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.700
So sometimes you work with difficult people and the reality is they are

551
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:31.280
difficult and it doesn't matter how happy.

552
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:36.230
How states as you are happy high Stacy's might help you be more zen about

553
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:37.820
accepting,
oh yeah,

554
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:42.320
this person is quite tricky but that's about them.
It's not about me.

555
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:44.810
I'm going to maintain my,
yeah,
my poise.

556
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:45.741
<v 0>I just,
as you're talking,</v>

557
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:48.710
I think there's something about getting your attention off yourself and not

558
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:53.120
taking it personally.
Radio test and I think what you say about high status,

559
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.110
happy ice status seems to me it's about putting people at ease and having that

560
00:34:57.111 --> 00:34:58.580
sort of grace to be able to do that.

561
00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:00.860
There's something in that about getting her attention off yourself,

562
00:35:00.861 --> 00:35:05.210
which is hard to do when there's somebody that makes you feel sort of defensive

563
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:05.970
or smaller.

564
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:06.810
<v 2>Yeah,
exactly.</v>

565
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.320
And that is something that is very hard one in comedy because there can often be

566
00:35:12.541 --> 00:35:14.610
negative energy somewhere in the room.

567
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.640
Like people are often too drunk or they could even be violence in the room or

568
00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.550
they could be,
um,

569
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.950
just somebody in a bit of the room who doesn't really like you and his hair for

570
00:35:25.951 --> 00:35:30.530
someone else and you have to learn to like,
that's fine.
No,

571
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.870
everybody has to be here to like me.
You're a bit drunk.
Great.

572
00:35:33.871 --> 00:35:37.020
Let's look after you,
make sure you're okay.
You want to hackle okay,

573
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.400
let you have your moment.

574
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.240
It's having that kind of lightness of everything is fine.

575
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.740
<v 0>Thank you very much.
Yeah.
One thing you talked about in the book is,
you know,</v>

576
00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.130
there are often occasions when you're asked to be on a stage or a platform when

577
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.350
you're part of a panel and you know,

578
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:54.630
how should you behave when you're not the person talking.

579
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.720
And just before we came on we talked about that and say,
well you need,

580
00:35:57.721 --> 00:35:58.950
if you want to know how not to do it,

581
00:35:58.951 --> 00:36:03.480
look at Alan Partridge and I've been struggling ever since then with the sort
of,

582
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.670
<v 2>that's a very good impression.</v>

583
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:13.780
<v 0>Been working on it for awhile.
So um,
just tell us a bit more about that.
You know,</v>

584
00:36:13.781 --> 00:36:16.540
there are a whole bunch of other things to do with being on stage where the

585
00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:18.210
attention is on you are not on your,

586
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:20.050
how'd you deal with that sort of mixture of things.

587
00:36:20.051 --> 00:36:23.080
You did lots of hosting panels for example and that kind of,

588
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.890
<v 2>yeah,
I had to learn this uh,</v>

589
00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.480
over a long period of time because I was staying in before I was really

590
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:34.110
confident doing a lot of stuff on my own.
I started,

591
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.960
and this is a good lesson for anybody who wants to do more speaking,

592
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.350
volunteer for the kind of,

593
00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.440
I was going to say vice president role,
but that's a bit grand.

594
00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:47.550
But the volunteer to be the moderator volunteer to be the person like Hank,

595
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.330
I'm Hannah dead.

596
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:53.330
Then the in person introducing volunteer to be part of it but not the keynotes.

597
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:59.040
And so then you have to learn sometimes how to be on stage when the attention

598
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.620
isn't on you.
And as you say,

599
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:05.460
there's a tendency sometimes if you're on a panel or you're an interviewer and

600
00:37:05.461 --> 00:37:10.020
somebody giving a very long answer,
um,
to to be like,

601
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.143
<v 1>mm,</v>

602
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.430
<v 2>you know,</v>

603
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:18.430
I to almost sort of overly show how self conscious you are.

604
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:23.710
So you have to learn how to have an active listening role and I don't,

605
00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.830
it's annoying.
I don't have a pen with me,
but I would do you have a pen?
Right.

606
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.420
So what I would often do is have pointless pen point.

607
00:37:32.421 --> 00:37:36.230
This pen is very useful for that role also in meetings.

608
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.980
So it's going to avoid you doing this or

609
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.710
you know,
we've all done that.
Right?

610
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:49.770
So if you have pointless pan your disciplines to hold it and be still and just

611
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:56.230
be actively listening.
And that's useful I think in meetings as well as,

612
00:37:56.231 --> 00:38:00.250
yeah,
in a public situation where actually at an awards thing,

613
00:38:00.251 --> 00:38:04.180
I have to do awards things where they could be 27 awards and there's loads of

614
00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:07.900
stuff going on on the stage and people having their photos taken and I have to

615
00:38:07.901 --> 00:38:10.990
stand there and I'm not be like,
Oh,
I'm checking my,

616
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:14.230
I can't check my phone or look bored,
you know,
I've got,

617
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.500
and this could go on over three hours.
I have to be engaged.

618
00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:21.580
So pointless pen twice.
She's my secret weapon.
Yeah,
absolutely.

619
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.600
But the other thing I want to say in relation to that is sometimes it doesn't

620
00:38:25.601 --> 00:38:27.190
matter that you don't have anything to say.

621
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:32.970
And that's really important on a panel as a moderator in meetings of it doesn't

622
00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:34.830
always have to be your turn to talk.

623
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.590
Sometimes it can be your turn to listen to facilitate others.

624
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.400
<v 0>Yes.</v>

625
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.330
I think the audience is always grateful when I just pass onto the next person.

626
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.090
So it's good mostly.
No,
that's true,
isn't it?
When you were in the audience,

627
00:38:45.091 --> 00:38:47.160
you don't necessarily want everyone on the panel to say yes,

628
00:38:47.161 --> 00:38:48.080
let me just build on that.

629
00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.120
<v 2>Exactly.
Really annoying.
Exactly.
And on panels,</v>

630
00:38:51.121 --> 00:38:55.560
what I love is where the panelists talk to each other and the moderator says,

631
00:38:55.561 --> 00:38:58.060
yeah,
in advance,
please don't,
you know,

632
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.100
use me as your safety net and as your like,
oh,
I'd like to speak next,

633
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.370
but speak across each other.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.

634
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.560
<v 6>Jessica.
Hi.
Um,
my question is actually connected to what you're discussing now.</v>

635
00:39:10.561 --> 00:39:14.790
I think often at Google we have to go out in groups or pairs and we might go to

636
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:19.770
client events or various situations where you can't own the room and sometimes

637
00:39:19.771 --> 00:39:22.410
it's obvious who that leader is and you might know or you know,

638
00:39:22.411 --> 00:39:23.970
it's my turn to be low presence.

639
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.260
I guess my question is around how do you recommend dealing with that,

640
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:32.130
either having that conversation beforehand or even if you're in a low presence

641
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.023
role,

642
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.440
how do you still own that moment without taking the limelight from either one of

643
00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:38.880
your colleagues or clients?

644
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.260
<v 2>Yeah,
for me that's a happy high status question.</v>

645
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:47.640
And of course you need to have a clear conversation,

646
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:52.670
I think as you would at any performance of an or you know who's going on first,

647
00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:56.340
how are we going on together?
Who's going to be introducing her?

648
00:39:56.341 --> 00:40:01.341
Like setting the parameters and the expectations and the sign pasting is not

649
00:40:02.401 --> 00:40:05.700
only good for you but good for whoever you're going to see.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

650
00:40:05.701 --> 00:40:07.560
this is the person who's taking the lead.

651
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:10.800
And you don't have to say those things when you get into a meeting,

652
00:40:10.801 --> 00:40:12.840
but you'll just show it and your body language.

653
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.650
So being open and agree upfront and agreeing those things.

654
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.970
But also the thing I learned is it's not all,

655
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.960
it's not about you,
it's not about you and it doesn't have to be about you.

656
00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:26.970
And I had to learn that when I was doing,

657
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.630
sometimes when I was early on doing things like Graham Norton,

658
00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:34.350
but tour or dawn French book tour and stuff,
I would be really,

659
00:40:34.351 --> 00:40:39.150
really nervous going on and thinking people need to know about me.

660
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.980
This is a big audience.

661
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:44.460
They should know about me and they should know that I'm a comedian.

662
00:40:44.461 --> 00:40:45.241
And Oh my God,

663
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:48.780
what if some of them think I'm not funny and I had to remind myself,

664
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.750
this is know about you.

665
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.870
You are just there to be a safety net for that person to be the fall guy if they

666
00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:58.740
need you.
You got to find your other space,
your own space to shine in.

667
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.280
So knowing when it's your moment and living up to it and knowing when it isn't

668
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.540
is really important.

669
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.193
<v 6>Thank you.</v>

670
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.180
<v 0>Actually can I just answer that cause I think,
um,</v>

671
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.740
one thing I think really helps is preparation.
So whether it's in a meeting,

672
00:41:13.741 --> 00:41:16.440
whenever kind of once you've really well prepared then you can pay attention to

673
00:41:16.441 --> 00:41:19.050
what's going on in the room.
And so something like this,

674
00:41:19.051 --> 00:41:22.260
I actually prepare a lot for this kind of thing.
So I've read your book,

675
00:41:22.261 --> 00:41:25.620
I've listen to podcasts or know what I'm interested in and then I can not worry

676
00:41:25.621 --> 00:41:27.680
about it.
Like what's the next question?
Cause I can just listen and,

677
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.800
and that sounds really interesting.

678
00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:32.940
I think the same I find applies in those meetings.
You know the,

679
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.140
and therefore you can relax and pay attention to what's happening in front of

680
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:39.590
you.
And sometimes we're so caught up in our own heads that we can't do that.

681
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.560
I get that a lot.
Uh,

682
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.480
I've just realized I've now taken the limelight when it should be yours.

683
00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.870
<v 7>Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming to speak to is to,</v>

684
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:51.020
if I've enjoyed this so much,
I promise I'll try the power poses.

685
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.670
And my question was,

686
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.270
do you think that the rules for owning the room deffer for women and finance?

687
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.570
<v 2>Yes.
Why does this the elephant in the room,
this question isn't it?</v>

688
00:42:00.571 --> 00:42:05.400
Is it different for women and for men?
So the book is called how to own the room.

689
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:10.430
Women in the art of brilliant speaking and that doesn't need to be a book called

690
00:42:10.801 --> 00:42:13.590
how to weigh in the room.
Man and the arts have been at speaking,

691
00:42:13.591 --> 00:42:17.670
it would not get published.
The reason I wanted to write it,

692
00:42:17.671 --> 00:42:19.590
and I wrote it in the way that I did,

693
00:42:19.591 --> 00:42:22.770
which is by a woman for women about women,

694
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:28.130
was that all of the other material on this subject was by men for men about men.

695
00:42:30.271 --> 00:42:35.271
So you go back 10 20 years and the only examples are Martin Luther king,

696
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:38.130
Winston Churchill,

697
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:43.410
that they're all very classic and they're all very masculine examples.

698
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.120
And I wanted to do something that reflects the last 20 years when we've had this

699
00:42:48.121 --> 00:42:52.470
huge turnaround,
largely due to digital media,
you know,

700
00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:53.880
without digital media,

701
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:58.380
who would have ever seen Michelle Obama's speaking at the democratic
conventions?

702
00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.450
Um,
even television hasn't had as big an impact as youtube,

703
00:43:03.451 --> 00:43:05.700
ted talks,
Facebook live,

704
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:10.730
all of these things that give us a media access to women's speaking in terms of

705
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.310
where the audiences respond differently to men and women,

706
00:43:14.311 --> 00:43:16.080
I think there's still something going on there,

707
00:43:16.081 --> 00:43:17.700
but we don't really know what it is.

708
00:43:17.701 --> 00:43:21.330
And it's something that is deep within our culture because I,

709
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.730
I'm not sure it's so bad now,
but when I started out as a standup,

710
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.960
I feel the energy change in the room of I,
it's a woman.

711
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:32.390
That's a shame.
Uh,

712
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:38.270
and that's the truth because a lot even women and women will offer,

713
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.480
oh,
women standups complained about this.
Women come up to you at the end and say,

714
00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.220
oh,
I didn't expect you to be funny.
I don't like women Comedians,

715
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:48.540
women's saying this.

716
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:54.030
So there's a lot of cultural baggage in this stuff that's difficult for us to

717
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:57.630
talk about and difficult to know why we feel this way.

718
00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.140
And for me it's more important just to let go of all that and just let it be and

719
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.690
do whatever you want to do to try and break through it.

720
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:08.620
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

721
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.250
I would recommend the book dove for men because pretty much everything in there

722
00:44:12.251 --> 00:44:17.230
is also really,
really helpful for anyone doing public speaking,
I would say.

723
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:17.500
Yes.

724
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.200
<v 2>Yeah.
And lots of men who've writes it.
Um,
and they're into the podcasts.
Um,</v>

725
00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.480
which only features women or that I'm thinking of having like a token male

726
00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:28.940
series.
Um,
maybe no.
Uh,

727
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:33.240
they will say that this is not about gender.

728
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:38.510
It's about trying to do something to counter the phenomenon of the Alphas.

729
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.160
So the Alpha person who always,
and it doesn't,
again,

730
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:47.220
it doesn't have to be like the most high status person.

731
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:49.050
It could be a low status person.

732
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:54.051
He's just really noisy and takes up all the energy in the room and men feel that

733
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:55.050
as much as women.

734
00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:00.060
And it's wanting to find a way to find your voice so that you get heard and it's

735
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:04.910
not just the most charismatic,
the most dynamic.
Do you know what I mean?
And,

736
00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:08.250
and there's loads of other prejudices around this area as well,
like class,

737
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.540
accent,
how good looking you are.
Like the more good looking you are there,

738
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:16.080
more people are going to listen to you that that's a prejudice that's deep

739
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.520
within us as well.

740
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.690
So it's trying to break through one of these things and finding a way to be okay

741
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:22.524
with yourself.

742
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:25.840
<v 6>I'm great.
Thank you so much.</v>

743
00:45:25.841 --> 00:45:29.860
This was really hilarious and amazing to hear you speak.
Um,
I was wondering,

744
00:45:29.861 --> 00:45:32.590
my question is kind of similar to the whole female male dynamic,

745
00:45:32.591 --> 00:45:33.820
but more seniority level.

746
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.940
So something for example that I notice in my team is our,

747
00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.460
my boss's boss was a director is very funny,
right?

748
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.090
And he'll open up a meeting and always kind of do something funny to kind of

749
00:45:43.091 --> 00:45:46.630
lighten the load and to make it a little bit,
you know,
to make it easy going.

750
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.740
However,
when you're more junior,
right,
it's actually tricky to do that.

751
00:45:50.741 --> 00:45:52.660
Sometimes you can do that in full flat on your face.

752
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:56.320
So kind of knowing where your place is in a meeting or kind of what you talked

753
00:45:56.321 --> 00:45:58.360
about earlier.
I was wondering if you,

754
00:45:58.361 --> 00:46:00.910
if there's any kind of guidance you have around,
you know,

755
00:46:00.911 --> 00:46:04.180
how much power you have,
right?
Like it's easy for Matt to be hilarious.

756
00:46:04.181 --> 00:46:06.370
He's like the person in Emia,
right?

757
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:11.550
But if you're [inaudible] you can be,

758
00:46:11.981 --> 00:46:16.180
you could walk,
but you know what I mean?
So how do you,

759
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.190
do you have any experience with that?

760
00:46:18.191 --> 00:46:21.670
Have you seen people that are more junior kind of pull it off and to what
degree,

761
00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.190
and I don't know,
just what are your thoughts around this?

762
00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:25.600
I know it's a little bit of a Dick,
you know.

763
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.650
<v 2>No,
it's a really great question and it's one that comes up quite a lot.</v>

764
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:35.710
I do some work with senior women in much more formal organizations in this where

765
00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:44.080
they are preparing a big keynote and they know there's a lot resting on it and

766
00:46:46.221 --> 00:46:50.810
they'd like to find a moment of lightness or to make a joke at the beginning and

767
00:46:50.811 --> 00:46:52.730
they don't know if they can get away with it.

768
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:58.390
And a lot of it is to do with risk and you have to become really expert at risk

769
00:46:58.791 --> 00:47:01.970
assessment and you have to choose your battles.

770
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:07.510
So I think it's very personalized to each situation as to how high a risk that

771
00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:13.091
would be to try that Jake and let it fall flat on your face to try a joke or

772
00:47:15.981 --> 00:47:20.981
make a comment and for it to bomb can actually be a very high status thing

773
00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.510
because you can bounce back from it.

774
00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:28.100
And other people in the room were very inspired when that happens.
You know,
I'm,

775
00:47:28.101 --> 00:47:31.660
I was telling Matt earlier about earlier this week,

776
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.720
I was doing a publishing event with eight offers where I was hosting everybody

777
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.360
getting through it on interviewing the more bigging up there,

778
00:47:40.361 --> 00:47:44.650
Burkes and the headline act was going to be Bill Bryson,

779
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:48.490
uh,
the multi award winning multi,

780
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:51.010
massive big selling travel writer.

781
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.930
And he hadn't turned up and he wasn't going to come.

782
00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:00.670
He canceled,
he keep genuinely couldn't physically get that in the end.

783
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.920
And they didn't want me to say this until the end of the event.

784
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.950
So I had this kind of weighing on me throughout of light.

785
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:12.400
At the end I've got to manage this energy and the time it was quite sort of

786
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:14.590
stressed and nervous and trying to camouflage that.

787
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:18.760
And then as I came to interview,
what are the last authors,

788
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.930
the notes that I had about her said that she'd written a contemporary debut.

789
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:28.360
So I announced their contemporary debut,
how exciting,
let's speak to the author.

790
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:32.950
And she sat down and I said,
congratulations on your first book.

791
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.550
And she said,
it's not my first book,
it's my third book.

792
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:43.750
And how I bounced back from that in that moment and I immediately was like,

793
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:48.580
Oh,
this is,
oh no,
I felt terrible for her because I insulted her.

794
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.880
I felt terrible for me because I looked really stupid and I felt bad because I

795
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:57.340
knew that after this there was going to come a moment where I had to say,
yeah.

796
00:48:57.341 --> 00:49:01.190
Also by the way,
guys,
Bill Bryson's not here.
So,
uh,

797
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:05.260
in that split second I had to recover and say,
Oh,

798
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:08.200
I'm so sorry,
but this is a contemporary debut.

799
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:10.300
So your previous books must be historical.

800
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.020
Tell us why you moved into contemporary rather than historical.

801
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:19.030
So quickly find something to acknowledge my error.
Say Sorry,
move on.

802
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:22.000
And afterwards everyone in the room,
it was,

803
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.160
it was the publisher who published this book.

804
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.700
So everyone in the room had worked on it.

805
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.990
Everyone who'd worked on the book was in the room.

806
00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.780
The Guy who bought the book was in the room.
All of this stuff.

807
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:36.370
One of my colleagues and they know know that I'm supposed to be the expert on

808
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:40.790
how to own the room and all of this.
And they said,
oh,
we loved what she needs,

809
00:49:40.791 --> 00:49:45.070
screw up.
We loved it.
And to me,

810
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:50.071
that was a great moment and a great lesson because it's good to get things

811
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:52.080
wrong.
It's good to have a drink.

812
00:49:52.081 --> 00:49:55.780
Fall flat is good to say the wrong thing sometimes.

813
00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.340
I mean,
these things are kind of easy for me to say because I'm an outsider.

814
00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:02.320
I'm external.
I do not work in a company.

815
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:07.330
And you need to also recognize the limits of these things and temper your

816
00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:08.770
expectations.
Cause the same,

817
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:12.670
you can't say the same thing in the comedy club that you can say in this

818
00:50:12.671 --> 00:50:16.960
environment or at your Q four marketing report,
right?

819
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:20.350
So you've got to adjust it.
So don't,
you know,

820
00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:24.700
you're not going to go into the meeting and be Joan Rivers.

821
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:28.130
Um,
but yeah,
take a risk.

822
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.390
<v 8>Why not?
Thank you.</v>

823
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:34.010
That was really huge things to cross crop.
Thank you very much.

824
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.490
[inaudible].
