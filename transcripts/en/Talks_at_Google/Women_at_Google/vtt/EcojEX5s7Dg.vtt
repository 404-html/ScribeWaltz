The good afternoon everyone.
Greetings from Seattle.
Well,

21
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.980
I would like to start by thanking all of the organizers and especially my friend

22
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.460
Jessica Hawaii for inviting me here.

23
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.170
Come here to talk about social role of the Tibet and the woman.

24
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.670
I must say that I am honored and humbled to be a dog person,

25
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:52.070
sort of the sexy blend and uh,

26
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.720
and they'll very active young minds.

27
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.410
I am Tibetan old woman Hartej Sheena was born in east Tibet and,

28
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:04.730
uh,
uh,

29
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.060
strong background at the Buddhism and later I married such a Dalton Rumba chair

30
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.310
in psychiatry.
And,
uh,
as many of you know,

31
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.500
we have a new Tibet days,

32
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:24.000
four set of Tibetan Buddhism and the suitcase case for one of them,

33
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.580
which we'll call it new Mapa Guy,
Cuba psychopathy and get Luba.

34
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.170
And the second dodge in Roma,
Chez father was the door 48,

35
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.200
uh,
thrown holder in the second Tibet.

36
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.480
So I married,

37
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.660
lived in a palace with many 70 Sarah Hunt and uh,

38
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.670
then 90,
59,
uh,

39
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.020
we were forced to out to exile from Tibet,
lacquer,

40
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.220
all other Tibetans.

41
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.380
So then we lived in India the short for yet,

42
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.860
but then University of Washington abroad us to research,

43
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.560
uh,
teach you reach this research too.

44
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.561
My husband Dartin Dodgy Cha as well as my anchor for the three years grant.

45
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.230
So since we cannot go back to bed because the

46
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.640
skeleton when it's under the,
uh,
uh,
Chinese,

47
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.150
so we,
uh,

48
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.540
emigrate to the states in United State.

49
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.890
So then I was working like any,

50
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:46.180
like any of you like working hard,
raising a lot.

51
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.930
He mentioned,
now I mentioned that,
uh,

52
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.300
five children to put in school,
so forth.

53
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.170
So I try to keep up with the growing change in the modern world and all its

54
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.410
modern gadgets and main cities.

55
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.150
I haven't seen much experience much in over 80 years that I have lived.

56
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.711
Today.

57
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:19.711
I speak to you through my experience as a woman and especially as a wife,

58
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.733
mother,

59
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.890
grandmother and great grandmother and the Tibet and the woman and Tibet would,

60
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.080
does petitioner.

61
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.050
So very little was knowing to the words of Tibet to the woman.

62
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.220
And 10.
We lost our country in 1959

63
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.800
since then,
large number of us lived,

64
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.450
um,
have lived to in egg assign various countries.

65
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.530
We have learned to adapt to the culture and the language or whatever country we

66
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.930
found ourselves Livia however no mantra way we are and no matter what challenge

67
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.360
life threw at us,

68
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.740
we are strong as people and Chandra

69
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.880
Tibetan culture is filled with a strong feminine roles and the model.

70
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.770
So specially like Tibetans always decided a major things and from mother

71
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.060
as we are deeply spiritual people,

72
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.900
very often our roles are the female deities.

73
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.060
We have [inaudible] the mother of goddess who do you got it as all her children

74
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.190
and guiding at protecting us and taking care of which Tibet and we called the

75
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.370
drama,
which is savior.

76
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.030
She made a vow to save all sentient beings from the suffering and be reborn in

77
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.370
female form and our life men now all the lifetime we have with snitch.

78
00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:32.770
But I was also given us goddess who gives a long life.

79
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.930
One of the most powerful protective deity is the female deity,

80
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.520
which we call a bandaid humble.
Who is the,

81
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:50.521
also predicted it as wrathful foam and created and fear all

82
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.450
and names like Machiel have Jane and famous female protector of the 11th century

83
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.750
who initiated the Sobel practices of the spiritual development.

84
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.420
And he shits all your condo IISHA soldier who help us this desperate and the

85
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.180
Buddhism in Tibet are and
help to us.

86
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:21.870
The great reverence

87
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.680
woman are not very active in the political field.

88
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.890
Before we lost our country,

89
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.070
there have been many Tibetan,

90
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:41.750
the woman who were involved in the politics of the,

91
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.870
uh,
regional governors,

92
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.170
but to such a permanent was not a soul invisible in a central administrator.

93
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.400
But,
um,
for example,

94
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.240
like he would call up and book Zombie all over color.
Uh,

95
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.270
if the leaders,

96
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.480
kings and the husband had died or woman take over the,

97
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:15.281
for example,

98
00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:20.281
like a queen of the gay or region in east Tibet rule our region until her young

99
00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:28.441
son attended by a majority queen's Hall Hummel,

100
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.170
who was very popular leader and did much the promoted literacy and learning

101
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:36.720
during the whole regent.

102
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.000
There was other Tibetan,

103
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.020
the woman who played a prominent rules in tribes,

104
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.810
especially in the eastern Tibet.
Tibet.

105
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.860
Women have always had a strong rules of a family and all of harmony.

106
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.910
If they have some big decisions and always make by mother many household,

107
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.230
uh,
rude by a matriarchs

108
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.740
and old Tibetan woman,

109
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.720
or let's see,
matriarchs.
Okay.

110
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.850
And then automate the woman,
my verse and business owners,

111
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.300
nomads and a farmers.
In fact,

112
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.350
it was not uncommon for the Tibet woman to be married.

113
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.630
The tool has been,

114
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.980
oh three husbands as same time and most drag their brothers though living in

115
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.830
harmonious and the same household.
Oh,

116
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.273
of course.

117
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:56.090
It was for the particle purpose of keeping the land and the divided and the such

118
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:04.761
a household as woman would always one who rules in the roots and roofed

119
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.150
a large number about Tibet.
The woman,

120
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.230
yeah,

121
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:19.230
put full percent become nuns and also a Buddhist nuns.

122
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.140
The nunneries war place to all lonely.

123
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.150
And a woman could put Shui and the educated,

124
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.370
which was not really available for the young girls.

125
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.990
In fact,
both man and woman,

126
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.360
and a tone to monasteries.

127
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.830
And the nunneries for education as these instructions,

128
00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:55.831
we're the sole providers of education in the old days.

129
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.630
<v 0>Secular education was not widespread at the same time.</v>

131
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.290
Like my time.

132
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.550
<v 0>This is kind of a silly problem city.</v>

134
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.960
I tell you something.
I remember when my aunt,

135
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.120
my aunt was nunnery 11 nunnery.
I visited them.
Nanda you quite often.

136
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.970
I enjoy this very much with the nuns.

137
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.040
They have a beautiful voice with the chanting in the singing and I will try to

138
00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:33.644
make it,

139
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.200
you know like way or non close and the cover mine here for their towel and I

140
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.410
enjoy it very much.

141
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:47.411
Had to go visiting in the [inaudible] but I never wanted pay none.

142
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
The reason why as he,

143
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:55.900
you know an a Tibetan no on what pod [inaudible] east,

144
00:11:55.901 --> 00:12:00.400
west Central,
all all over to bend and girls,

145
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:05.401
a woman's where they were all kind of a jewelries covered with the hair and head

146
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.100
dresses.
So I always say,
see they're so beautiful.

147
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.210
They,
you know,
because the Tibetans and my time at that time,

148
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.800
we don't have banking system.
And the jewel is his,

149
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.810
was the acid in the family and the men may have a horses or raffles or salts

150
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.570
does that's we have.
So this is like silly and said,
you know,

151
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.400
I never wanted it to be nine because again,
not a way of jewelries.

152
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.700
That was it today.
When I think back,
it was silly.

153
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.193
So,

154
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:47.450
so we're losing our country and living in exile Tibetan woman have played very

155
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:49.641
cool,

156
00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:54.641
sure rule and preserving our culture and tradition in a foreign lands like

157
00:12:57.551 --> 00:12:58.384
myself.

158
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:01.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

159
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.930
<v 0>Now in exile Tibetan a woman are well represented in a politic of fields and</v>

160
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:14.221
members of parliament ministers and hold position of power of decision making in

161
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:22.720
the various administrative and offices

162
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.600
today to when woman are doctors,
nurses,
teachers,

163
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:31.300
lawyers,
business owners,

164
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.310
artists and other occupation.
Like,
oh,
I was toiling today.

165
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:41.460
There's an a Google,
I'm sure you have thousand,
maybe 10,000 days to Tibet.

166
00:13:41.461 --> 00:13:44.920
The woman are working here.
So that was,
you know,

167
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.140
I was very happy to know that.

168
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.260
So this is what,
um,
you know,
to when a woman's are today,

169
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.830
two can do it.

170
00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.020
So to when people are generally knowing as a peaceful people due to our

171
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:06.481
spiritual practice of generating loving kindness and compassion for all beings,

172
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.690
we strive to feel great compassion for others as the does for ourself

173
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.660
in order to help the more motive.

174
00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.060
As in this practice,

175
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:29.090
we are talked at the early age regarding all the sentient beings as the one's

176
00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:31.530
own mother.

177
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.310
<v 0>A mother is regarded as a compassionate one who phone nine months carries child</v>

179
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
within her womb and who continue to love and nurture her children well and to

180
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.130
become a dot.
So this is a,

181
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.160
we have to think more.
A mother is the

182
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.680
publication of loving kindness and compassion.

183
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.160
So in our culture and the mother is regarded with great reverence as life force

184
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.623
and nurture.

185
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.230
So we also things mother protects the child until I get eight,

186
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.920
eight years old,

187
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.870
even the protectors from the mother's shadow protect the child.

188
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.820
So therefore women are treated with great respect and are equal partner in

189
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.880
their homes.

190
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:01.723
So,

191
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.720
and the Tibetan also the now the exile before exile,

192
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.910
you know,
Japan is lucky,

193
00:16:09.911 --> 00:16:14.390
you know all the culture like we have heard it,

194
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:15.201
you know,

195
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:20.201
not Tibetan woman exile and the live too many countries,

196
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.450
specialty Levine,
ice skating,
many thousands and first when we came,

197
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.800
we don't have an education background as well as the language problem.

198
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.360
So many Japan woman are worked in a nanny's housekeeping and so forth.

199
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.470
So I have heard that Tibetan women are very much a demand as nannies and

200
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.100
caregivers for both young and old people because they have compassion and talk

201
00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:54.651
to the,

202
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:59.651
when they're young it is their kindness and compassion and that makes them

203
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.910
provide the best to carry and the love even for those that are not their own

204
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.370
blood,
uh,
or race.

205
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.853
Today,

206
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.890
working mothers are truly superhuman in their abilities to more to task between

207
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:32.330
their work environment and their home front.

208
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.343
However,

209
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.440
women are still woman and bring warmth and softness and whatever.

210
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.810
And whenever they are doing

211
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.790
now in Tibet,

212
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.590
now in the Tibetan families,
you know,
beef whole

213
00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.290
mini part of in Asia and the Tibet,

214
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.640
it's always the window.

215
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.530
How many have a child,

216
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.590
they always like to have boy select many pots in the war to be fought.

217
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.850
Now in the Tibetan family,
when the girls was born,

218
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.040
the praying parents express grief,
joy,

219
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.760
and they will have someone who would look after them after they get old.

220
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.530
So the,
you know,
time changes.

221
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.930
So to begin a woman like the woman as around the world have faced a challenge

222
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.770
due to the Genta bias.
However,

223
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:51.810
we have very compassionate spiritual leader.
His Holiness,

224
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:56.811
the Dalai Lama threw his mini initiative.

225
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.600
His wholeness has encouraged Tibet,

226
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.570
the woman to be part of governance and social ICAN,

227
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.550
ICAN.
He,

228
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.880
he kinda make growth in the exile.

229
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.890
Even recently in the 90,
uh,

230
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.890
2016 last year,

231
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.460
he's holding is confirmed Ashima degree and the 29th in south of India,

232
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:34.430
which is first in our history of Tibet and it abandoned people.

233
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:40.500
[inaudible] my degree is [inaudible] a men,

234
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.670
uh,
compatible to the direction and the philosophy.

235
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.090
And the degree is confound after 21 years of rigorous study of five main

236
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.160
Buddhist tabs,

237
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.040
this is the step forward in the equal right.

238
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:11.041
And the Tibet in the woman as the education is the key to changing and

239
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.950
development.

240
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.990
I would like to invasion to feature we women are equal partner in the all the

241
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:28.290
field of life in the workforce.

242
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.340
I would love to see women be equally

243
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.710
compensated for her time and effort.

244
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.060
I hope this that they will come to time when women are not Fred to go way they

245
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:49.990
want and what they want to do.

246
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:52.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

247
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.480
<v 0>At the home,
a woman is the daughter,</v>

248
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.390
sister,
mother,
wife.

249
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:03.821
Hold on.

250
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:08.821
Should it be the safe even from the all the trade and the challenge of the

251
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.090
outside world,
if they are round in the home,

252
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.040
unfortunately the world is not perfect place and a woman well continue to face

253
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:31.070
discrimination at the work abuse at home

254
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.810
and the disparity due to the Yantra.

255
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.830
It is true that even today

256
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:48.370
there are countries where the woman out treated tweeted little better than

257
00:21:48.711 --> 00:21:50.930
cattle.
However,

258
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.440
we can still strive to change the plight of women all over.

259
00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.120
If woman are United in the common cause,

260
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:08.320
if they are afraid,
if they are afraid,

261
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.680
tell other women,

262
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.710
<v 1>okay,</v>

263
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.780
<v 0>we need to speak openly.</v>

264
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.030
If you are abused,
tells other women.

265
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.460
If you are a happy Lee,
increase it by sharing,

266
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.570
uh,
sharing your happiness.

267
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.800
If you are sad like it,

268
00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:36.100
by sharing your story with someone.

269
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.240
We live in an age of social media,

270
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.480
which is powerful tools.

271
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.970
All of you now.

272
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:53.240
So solve yourself to being a woman and embarrass other woman,

273
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.840
to farm a strong circle of support when a woman can't be here,

274
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.690
great pain like woman,
the one who brings the child.

275
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.250
I mean,
I have to go to through the all pains and not me,

276
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.180
but men have you realize how to share what pains going through one man,

277
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.340
<v 1>okay?</v>

278
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.200
<v 0>And come out.</v>

279
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.630
But if even these painful come out to shiny,

280
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.610
in the end,
we are mother,
wife,

281
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.280
daughter,
and we are strong.

282
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.860
If we should have more female leaders in the world,

283
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.300
we would be more peaceful place and woman have the innate quality of patient and

284
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:53.660
compassion and in the war and the war word,

285
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.910
not that I Atara we should feel honored and proud to be born in a woman and we

286
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:09.500
can do much as woman of the knowledge and compassion.

287
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.470
Tibetan woman are always strong and we remain a strong.

288
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.790
And since our exposure to the outside world,

289
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.570
we are inspired by women in the west who stand shoulder to shoulder with men

290
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.860
while still holding down the fort at home.

291
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.960
I am inspired to outrigger woman,

292
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.420
African American woman who made sure their voice or hood in the day movement and

293
00:24:56.931 --> 00:24:57.870
the civil right.

294
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.800
I paid homage to all the great women who have come before us and the struggle

295
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.360
with the restraint of time and uh,

296
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.880
prejudice and who have made the path easier for us now follow.

297
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:25.770
So this is part of what our Tibet in the woman,
how,

298
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.910
wait,
hello.

299
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:32.270
How is still how our saw and if you have any question.

300
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.100
<v 2>Thank you Donna for [inaudible] in the spring talk.</v>

301
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.790
So I have to take this chance to,
to,
to ask you the first classroom,

302
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.420
I suggest the mentioned that,
uh,
you think,
uh,

303
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.210
women should take a more leadership role in the word in the modern world.

304
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.590
And so I wonder what kind of a Buddhist teachings can help women to become more

305
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.360
common than tomorrow?
Capable for taking the leadership?

306
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.570
<v 0>Well,
Lord,
Buddha,
Shakyamuni as the teachers to us,</v>

307
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.010
no Genera woman made any age,

308
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.930
any race is equally,
we can be enlightened and equally,

309
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.670
but it's,
uh,

310
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.910
the award is the [inaudible] and the misunderstanding and things it takes

311
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:21.800
getting better.

312
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.040
But I still think women should be strong and they shouldn't be subs,

313
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.450
you know,
how to sell on.

314
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.910
You have owned the courage and uh,

315
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:40.030
and think that we are happy a Doobie born with this.

316
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.830
I knew we wanted to help with whatever can

317
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.540
<v 3>and did I make,
so you'll know yourself,</v>

318
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.730
don't try to lower down to make think of we all equal.

319
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:59.600
And the teaching says all the ego is like that.

320
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.210
The uh,
uh,

321
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:06.990
the petitioner or Tibetans monks or lamas or all the petitioner and equally in

322
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:12.360
lighting.
What did they do?
The right path,

323
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.500
right route is most important to see some motivation.

324
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.890
<v 2>Yeah.
Thank you.
And also I'm a particular interest in Arabia,
Linda Edge,</v>

325
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.040
because I know that so far all the throwing holders have satellite centers have

326
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:28.800
been male members of [inaudible] family.

327
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.980
I wonder if in the future maybe a female member cows,
I'll be a leader.

328
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.150
Do you think that's possible?

329
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.470
<v 3>Very good.
Good question.</v>

330
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.420
Just like I mentioned it earlier in the Tibetan Buddhism as four set and what

331
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.700
doesn't.
And like those all four sets,

332
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.900
many have a Dorian conditions,

333
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.120
which is just like you already know.

334
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.770
These are like Dalai Lama is like 1413 reincarnated.

335
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.460
And so it's come up,

336
00:27:56.461 --> 00:28:01.000
I like 17 reincarnated and does unluck psychopaths,

337
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:06.240
psychopaths or region in a descended from celestial realm.

338
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:11.580
I knew a person from celestial realm and married with the human and the produce

339
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:18.120
to not children.
And that's why they need to carry on these,

340
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.980
the no reincarnation father to son.
And so this is a,

341
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.680
it's a different than reincarnation.

342
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:31.250
And so other lamas recognize and condition like we all,

343
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.540
we all are somebodies England,
Asia.
Anyway,

344
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.820
so that unlike the [inaudible] lineage and then,
uh,

345
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.860
uh,
mentioned it.
Yes.

346
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:46.130
It's a true up to my time is always the male system.

347
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:51.540
And I heard a lot of psych.
Yeah.
Historic,
uh,

348
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:56.541
when the alarm I'm married and don't have a son and then the maybes have,

349
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.290
don't marry second a toad wife and chill brain son.

350
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:07.010
And so I remember myself when I got married with my husband,

351
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.520
my father in law to give a blessing with name change legs.

352
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:13.980
It also says bring Sun.

353
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:20.160
So huck why's that?
But today's different,
but they have,

354
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:24.740
if they have a daughter,
daughter,
is he equally teach psych?
Yeah.

355
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.613
Any teaching,

356
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.740
but daughter's son is not be the [inaudible] care lineage,

357
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.380
but it's not the same.
It's mail.

358
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.890
So that's a different,

359
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:43.430
but it's just the [inaudible] is the always the lady to father to son when they

360
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:46.890
passed away,
they way you pray to be born.
The same.

361
00:29:46.891 --> 00:29:50.530
How many this is up to over a thousand,

362
00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:52.870
maybe close to thousand years.

363
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.780
<v 2>Thank you.
Yeah,
I understand.
This is a tradition and uh,
yeah,</v>

364
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.180
I think there are a lot of,
I like it,

365
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.380
a female members of the family and they live very good to practitioners that

366
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.290
probably even though they are not the throwing a holder of [inaudible] role is

367
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:15.160
to help grow the time on teaching and also help with the family.
Uh,
how,
how,

368
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.330
how would the community,
yeah.
Thank you.
Okay.
So no,

369
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.800
sit and take some questions from the audience.

370
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.833
<v 4>I a Buddhist,</v>

371
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.950
my husband always say you do a chanting and uh,

372
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.270
reciting Mantras,
just suture and you're also making lots of donation.

373
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.600
And how would that,
oh,
the things that you did.
Um,
Ben,
the fair,

374
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:41.160
me and our family.
This is my first question.

375
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.770
<v 3>That is good.
Yes.
If we are connected,</v>

376
00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.810
for example,
my cell phone example,

377
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:56.110
I have a lot of friends and students who are kind of the light on me and ask me

378
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.140
and I will do this sincerely to topology to help whatever they need and the

379
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:11.650
healer,
their suffering.
And this is the,
yes,
you cannot,

380
00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:16.580
like I mentioned yesterday,
there's the what the donee and the giving,
the taking.

381
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:22.400
That's why if you pray your husband,
will it help?
Yes.

382
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.990
Even he doesn't believe in Buddhism.
There's always some blessing there.

383
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.780
<v 4>And my second question is,
uh,
would you please share,
um,
yeah,</v>

384
00:31:33.781 --> 00:31:37.730
wisdom about emptiness.
So that way I can share with you Kim,

385
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.360
<v 3>that is a big question.</v>

386
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.820
Emptiness is we talk a lot,
I'm emptiness,

387
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.480
but there's always the essence.
There is everything.

388
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:55.450
Phenomena is like emptiness,
never the same.
It's changing,

389
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.960
changing salons.
But the essence is there too.

390
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.890
Why you called?
Um,
uh,

391
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.340
part of your life is he born and every teen is never the same.

392
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:13.900
It's just implemented.
But uh,
same time,

393
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.430
this essence there.
So that's the big cause.

394
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:23.431
You but a few practice Buddhism you will learn if each of us has some wisdom to

395
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.490
leading us.
If you really follow that too,

396
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.460
to concentrate,
do some meditation,

397
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.460
then we'll show that what to do next.

398
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:40.790
But it just are talking emptiness.
Emptiness means everything.

399
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.840
Nobody knew what you miss.
It is elite team emptiness,

400
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.440
this essence of,

401
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.320
<v 4>and my second,
a separate question.</v>

402
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.140
This us a lay practitioner,

403
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.360
especially for a woman,
how to balance their family life.

404
00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.810
And um,
also practice Buddha Dharma.

405
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.270
<v 3>Thank you,
dawn.</v>

406
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.210
I usually call doctor might use a daily life.

407
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.500
Those are the Lama's monks and nuns.

408
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.540
They have nunnery monetary this day.
They're supported and they do it all a prey.

409
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.890
But the late protection as us like husband,

410
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.500
why would have to raise children,
go to school,

411
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:29.390
work and so forth every day.
Your life just to,

412
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:34.180
you'll know it in the Tibetan Buddhists and will also say is human lives.

413
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.440
How precious,

414
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:41.930
most precious in the life.
Which means we have an opportunity,

415
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:45.410
we can do things,
we have a physically,

416
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.770
we have everything round,
especially the US.

417
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:54.140
I knew all the teachers and teachings and a living,

418
00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:58.460
everything.
Freedom.
Okay.
So since you get up in the morning,

419
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:01.580
you should be happy.
Oh,
I'm happy.
I'm still alive.

420
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.120
I wanted to do something for good myself and my family and extended for my

421
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:09.060
neighbors whole world.

422
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.770
And this is thinking that's the positive thinking,

423
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:17.771
positive attitude and that helps a lead through the day is happy and that is

424
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:23.090
part of your Dharma practice.
Parlay petitioner.

425
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.130
But everything you do,

426
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:30.340
you think something you do dried and helping others with from sincerely.

427
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.900
That's why we say it has to come from a heart.

428
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.730
You wanted to help somebody and give them,
maybe I get something back.

429
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:46.130
Don't think that you'll have to do and conditioner walk.

430
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:51.020
Unconditional love.
Unconditional love.
How you do your own children.

431
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.850
I see.
So this is what I help.
It does.

432
00:34:55.851 --> 00:35:00.110
So the you can never see or you know,

433
00:35:00.111 --> 00:35:05.111
any lay people what can be enlightened if did have her at the right path.

434
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.960
Yes.
Always good.
It doesn't matter.
Any race,

435
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.210
it doesn't matter.
I said I had to have a good heart.
Thank you so much.

436
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.790
Thank you.
Hi.

437
00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.740
<v 4>I have one question,
uh,
out.</v>

438
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.470
What's the most of the challenge you'll fishing?
Uh,

439
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.230
you think when you are flat from a debate.

440
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.030
That is my first question.
I mean the most of the challenging.

441
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.890
You think you how do you have challenges?
Thing?

442
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.013
Yeah.

443
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.530
<v 0>I don't recall.</v>

444
00:35:45.531 --> 00:35:48.890
I done tremendous things,

445
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.530
but I feel I'm good.

446
00:35:51.531 --> 00:35:54.620
I haven't done something in this life.

447
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.840
So benefit others,

448
00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:01.510
tried to teach something positive and raised.
Uh,

449
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:06.920
and my family and try to go to teaching wherever I can,

450
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:11.300
whatever I can do.
And then I lived with this,
I'm 84 years old.

451
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.970
I still maybe feel more years,
who knows?

452
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.390
And so I always tanking and myself,

453
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.500
I'm very happy and can do this.
Thank you.

454
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.680
<v 4>Hi.
Thank you very much for come and give the talk.</v>

455
00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.360
Um,
one question I have is uh,

456
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.400
you mentioned 4% of Tibet and women become nuns and they are nunneries in Tibet.

457
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.560
Uh,
is that still the case now?

458
00:36:41.561 --> 00:36:46.561
There are still quite some nunneries in Tibet or this is in the old age before

459
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:48.070
you left Tibet?

460
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.843
<v 3>Yes.</v>

461
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:54.910
I just recently visited in the Tibet last month and I offered support many

462
00:36:58.281 --> 00:37:03.281
nunneries and those lands as a summer Landry's only problem.

463
00:37:04.011 --> 00:37:05.300
There is a limit.

464
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.890
You can have so many each Landry before anybody who wish to go.

465
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:13.010
But now this,
each nunnery has a lot,

466
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.640
so many nights we have in the router Satya and his two nunneries I visited one

467
00:37:20.661 --> 00:37:22.310
is like 250,

468
00:37:22.311 --> 00:37:26.300
almost one is like last time I visited only a 25.

469
00:37:26.301 --> 00:37:29.270
Now it's 37.
But they have limited,

470
00:37:29.271 --> 00:37:34.271
they have to get past kind of passport from government to get in certain things.

471
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.830
Otherwise,
yes they are nunneries and this and answer very good.

472
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.780
Partitioners and of course anonymous in India and Tibet.

473
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:50.230
And they will have a debate like monks and they do vary.

474
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.900
And I also heard that some people are patrons who wonder,

475
00:37:56.061 --> 00:37:56.894
ask,

476
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:02.110
pray for Montessori or nunneries and they like to do nannies because Nancy,

477
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:07.400
the the and the do until prayed done and monks and maybe not choice,

478
00:38:07.401 --> 00:38:11.000
some will get up and walk out.
So anyway,

479
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.530
these are very good.
And then old Nance,

480
00:38:15.531 --> 00:38:18.980
like my time before,
they are still nuns.

481
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:23.990
I heard in still in the cave to practicing all their life.

482
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.000
But like I said,
it's a,

483
00:38:26.001 --> 00:38:31.001
before the Tibetans came out in exile and warming and not out because man,

484
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:37.770
it Ma Lama's monks tacos or so many of the women are not really even petitioner.

485
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.920
They do the to the uh,
do their own practice.

486
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:49.100
Not so much going around the teachings,
but now they are.
Yes.

487
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:54.420
<v 4>Uh,
so the teachers are,
the nunneries are nuns.</v>

488
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.770
So there's no,

489
00:38:55.771 --> 00:39:00.530
like a male Llama teachers at the nunneries?
Um,

490
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.330
<v 3>I would say most languages have a dog.
Just none.</v>

491
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:10.170
I bet to know I've witnessed what I call,
but some llamas,
um,

492
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.680
who are qualified llamas and uh,

493
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.260
Cambos or took,

494
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.310
who's can't go give a teaching certain Marianna teaching so they can practice.

495
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.170
But like our mind and our practice,

496
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:29.410
we have to have received a certain teachers without receiving transmission and

497
00:39:29.691 --> 00:39:33.080
teachings.
We cannot practice.
So the,
yes,

498
00:39:33.081 --> 00:39:37.730
the male lamaze go there,
teach and not live with nuts.

499
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:42.970
<v 4>Okay.
So in general,
the Buddhism teaching in a nunnery,</v>

500
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.160
are they very similar to the Buddhist institute?

501
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:51.590
Where monastery for a monks or,
uh,

502
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.960
anything special,
uh,

503
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:58.980
for nunneries we're maybe not as stringent as the monks are.

504
00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:05.140
Your main Tenet,
the teachings and the bad and the India and those places?

505
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.940
Uh,
yeah,
I mean,

506
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:11.830
just compare the nunneries and in a monastery for monks,

507
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.900
are these very simple,

508
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.520
<v 3>yes,
they are very similar.
And,
uh,
even now,</v>

509
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:22.020
or nuns have a more like I just mentioned,
uh,

510
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.330
his whole legs get vacation Ma degree,
which is equally is uh,

511
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.970
you know,
[inaudible] which is a doctorate degree.

512
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:35.400
And this is just first time happened in Tibet history.

513
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.880
So Nancy doing debates announced to all of what the monks I teach.

514
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.020
Yes,
he could.

515
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.040
<v 4>Yesterday you mentioned about you,</v>

516
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:49.460
it's our phone to Ben and climbed the Himalaya.

517
00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.840
Just imagine that it is still very difficult for nowadays.

518
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.530
So would you please share your insight?
How come you can be so strong?

519
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.120
<v 3>I can get leading by two point Jim and I at that guide me and help me,</v>

520
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.660
uh,

521
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.660
like all other people who are two guiding from the torch him.

522
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:17.370
But it's a true and when I came out from Tibet with three children,

523
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.380
youngest one is just about year old is still diaper on and crossing the

524
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:27.910
Himalayas.
And you wasn't easy,

525
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:33.630
but we left country because we don't want to give up Dharma.

526
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:41.300
That's why we left.
And then like I said,
it,
uh,
sometime my life,

527
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.360
I lived in the palace in Psychia.

528
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.100
I raised by my wonderful family is too bad.

529
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.890
I lived in this,
again,

530
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:55.930
married with the head with the [inaudible] and liver doing palace and then cross

531
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:03.080
mountain and the refugee camps and then came here.

532
00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.370
Uh,
Leo bought from a Rockefeller Foundation for three years.

533
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:10.250
Grant I ever,
since we cannot go back.

534
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:15.650
So here I had to do,
I wrote his book,
first book,

535
00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.860
I can get it and I give the first book to the His Holiness Dalai Lama.

536
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.340
And he was very happy and he was saying that this is very good because it gives

537
00:42:28.441 --> 00:42:33.320
us courage.
You pour the other Tibetan woman because you are in Tibet,

538
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:37.850
your first lady and hear your American seven,
which is true

539
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.590
mother,
grandma,
everything.

540
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:46.220
I only like working for Tibet.
No American.

541
00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.470
Yes.
So that's why now on the sensor,
I've tired.

542
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:53.600
He tired.
I know I tried it.

543
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:59.300
I do much is practice myself and it helped the others teaching not just women,

544
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.060
men,
anybody who needs in my own experience,
my Sherry.

545
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:09.710
I also grateful lots of men who supports us.

546
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.810
Thank you.
I'm only talking today one,
but man,
a wonderful helper.

547
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:16.910
Lotta things.
Yes.

548
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.720
With how the lag I had that I even said there's no men if a days,

549
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:27.500
no woman as equally,
but he wanders remain.

550
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:31.940
Did he wound with a woman too can help the all the beans.

551
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:35.880
<v 4>Thank you for more.
And my last question is,
there's recently,</v>

552
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:37.620
there's a movie called wonder woman here.

553
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.840
I feel that I was so attached by the,
the uh,

554
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.350
wonder woman's compassion.

555
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:47.040
And so when I saw yesterday's topic Dakini power,

556
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:52.400
is there any special training for us to female first female to like have

557
00:43:53.841 --> 00:43:57.420
received some kind of special training and to become more powerful to help the

558
00:43:57.421 --> 00:44:02.360
sanction pain because that is so beautiful.
What kind of power?
Just,

559
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.560
<v 3>I hadn't,
I only just recalled it.</v>

560
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.270
The spiritual and the,
you'll have to,
in a Tibetan Buddhism,

561
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:17.280
you cannot just pick a book that he eat.
All you can say,

562
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.180
I'm lots of my western,

563
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.560
the street in will sometimes say I'm Buddhist.

564
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.210
Many years I've read so many books,
I went to lots of classes.

565
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:32.180
But that doesn't mean to your Buddhist.
In the Buddhism I go,

566
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.780
it's necessary.
You'll have to receive the refugee vow,

567
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.560
which is the some commitment there.

568
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.170
And after you receive that,

569
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:48.500
then if the teacher and the student have commendment teacher triple gem with

570
00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:55.500
protect you,
guide you and your students followed that guidance.

571
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.980
But finding teacher is the very hard.

572
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.760
Today I would say there's so many young teachers allow mas and all kinds of,

573
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.590
I don't even know that lots of them,
but uh,

574
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.610
you'll have to really find right teacher not just follow their ranking or they

575
00:45:18.631 --> 00:45:22.890
look,
oh,
they dress good.
Oh on it.

576
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:25.380
Look what the background,

577
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.900
carry the tones,
mission lineage.

578
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:34.740
Who are their teacher?
Then you'll go for it.
Once you have it,

579
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:39.060
you don't need them.
Any teachers,
then you'll follow that.
That's it's an um,

580
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:43.770
Mahayana Buddhism is many teachers,
some are good,

581
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.280
doesn't matter man,
woman,
none or month doesn't matter.

582
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.840
It's just something that answers your question.
Some tea,

583
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:56.520
you're connected.
Usually we can tell once first we made a few talk.

584
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:01.730
You kind of tell that and most time into people goes just to look all written so

585
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:08.760
much about background.
He's holding.
This is the,
all those,

586
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.600
that doesn't means any tea.
You'll have a connection

587
00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.600
<v 5>in the formal.
You thinking about this connection?</v>

588
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.750
I told my husband if I saw like a formal,

589
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:23.760
I feel connection but my husband wasn't,
that's not um,
is not logic.

590
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:28.920
So was she at answer him?
That's okay.
That's okay.
All right.

591
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:34.600
So I have a question about are the software engineering profession.

592
00:46:34.601 --> 00:46:36.910
So in this profession is actually,
uh,

593
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.400
Ms. Bell is of our agenda destiny a lot more guys than girls.

594
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:48.920
So why do think ar could help to balance the dip gender is because to,

595
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:57.640
to me it seems very good for,
uh,
for old men to work for them.

596
00:46:57.641 --> 00:47:00.480
Put in the software industry because it's possible to work from home.

597
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:03.980
She can take care of her family,
who,
when she needs to.
But what,
uh,
what,

598
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:08.730
what do you see are the obstacles and how can we help attract more women to help

599
00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:09.930
balance this industry?

600
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.080
<v 3>I think that's what we all know.
Be Nice.</v>

601
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:18.230
Listen and listen what they want,

602
00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:23.110
how they talk.
You may have is connected.
You'll make any help,
uh,

603
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.360
she made can help you.
You make,
can you help hook?

604
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:32.930
I saw this is just a gentle is really not much difference on it.

605
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:35.950
The connection with the your

606
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.990
thinking or your wisdom.
Oh,

607
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:44.830
you're related or most faint event,
we'll call it the Karma.

608
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.930
We always relate it and it was,

609
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:53.060
I would always say the two best attains have to be nice with your parents and

610
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:58.810
the parents have you take care of parents.
They showed him mother,

611
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.110
you will be happy life
and this is the one,

612
00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:06.390
the only way we pray.
We always say early,

613
00:48:06.391 --> 00:48:11.391
pray with all mother and all Sunday bs because we considered this sometime.

614
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:15.140
I was your mother Mamie the years.
Who knows we are.

615
00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.540
There's something like we are here today.

616
00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:23.830
Just there's some collected I believe every time I believe it will have somebody

617
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:28.310
to closer and talking.
I'll feel,

618
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:32.270
and this is some lifetime we had some condition.

619
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.341
Yes.

620
00:48:34.341 --> 00:48:39.341
So it's most important patient and especially woman.

621
00:48:39.981 --> 00:48:41.270
Need a patient.

622
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.433
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

623
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:45.561
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

624
00:48:45.561 --> 00:48:50.561
A very sensitive women are more sensitive so you give a patient then you'll

625
00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:54.180
always find the right path through your wisdom.

626
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.930
<v 2>Okay.
I want to ask the last question.
Uh,</v>

627
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.630
so because we were allowed leaving in the west number,
um,

628
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.530
and especially like in coming in as in like,
Oh God,

629
00:49:06.531 --> 00:49:09.550
we have very diverse background,
but he will perform,

630
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.780
will come from different countries in the world.

631
00:49:11.781 --> 00:49:15.970
They have different religions and maybe a lot of our youth is,

632
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:17.370
they have different beliefs.

633
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.590
I sounds so what do we think's the best way for us to my,
uh,

634
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:26.450
promote [inaudible] teachings or to help more people in Google or in the

635
00:49:26.451 --> 00:49:27.284
society?

636
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.780
<v 3>All the religion I respect.
Yeah.
The,</v>

637
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.080
the religion spiritually,

638
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:38.050
they day helping the all bs,
whatever they need.
It's always,

639
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.370
but what we need is to everything.
Uh,
today's alive.

640
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.360
Um,
we just too fast.

641
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.400
Everything you,
oh,
you'll have to have that new,

642
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:55.030
you don't need it as so slow down tank.

643
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:59.170
Do I really need this?
Uh,
things,

644
00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.920
materials too much.
And also,

645
00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.640
and when you have a something,

646
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.830
somebody says something you didn't like it here,

647
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.780
you just patient listen,
not answer right away.

648
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:19.500
So this kind of helping for calmness and communication and the peaceful the

649
00:50:21.741 --> 00:50:25.960
world.
So this is because it's like I mentioned yesterday,

650
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:30.290
some people have one or you did again,

651
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:34.360
another one.
If you'll help him,
that one car,
I need better car.

652
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.930
She's like iPhone,
everything.
It's too much.
These,

653
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.400
if you know how to work,
that might be helpful.
Ward is lots of things.

654
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.950
For example,
I have iPhone.
I only know how to,

655
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.540
we chat or to call is has fancy things,
but I don't know.

656
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:54.900
So why I need that.
So something you really,
sometime you don't need.

657
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:59.210
Yes sir.
Yes.
You'll have one car,
unit,
second car.

658
00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.670
You cannot drive two cars and time.

659
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.980
So it's just slow down and do leisure.
Meditation.

660
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.780
Doesn't have to be Buddhist.

661
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:13.490
Just little bit down to the patient talking anything.

662
00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:15.280
Just think more than two.

663
00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:21.140
I think this is the leads to easier and peace for everyone.

664
