1
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.380
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

2
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:11.590
It's really an honor to be back and it's so exciting for me.

3
00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:16.591
It's one of my messages in the book that pivot and our jobs and the economy,

4
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:18.850
it's so fluid now that it,

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.880
this to me is really a joy that even though I left Google as a fulltime employee

6
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.890
to still come back and partner and talk and be here.

7
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.870
As I was reflecting on what would be most meaningful to share today,

8
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.140
it occurred to me that to the outside world,

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.520
hitting a pivot point or plateau at Google is a bit of an oxymoron.

10
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.500
You used to be nothing but 100% fulfilled and 100% grateful.

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.040
100% of the time,
Hashtag blessed,

12
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.040
but in some ways it's its own first-world career problem

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.533
<v 2>that</v>

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.250
<v 1>we feel and we feel that there's something wrong with us.</v>

15
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.280
If we hit a plateau or a pivot point and very naturally start asking what's

16
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.470
next,
what's next within my role within the company,

17
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.920
within my broader career,
where am I trying to go?

18
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.190
And we start to internalize some of this shame and blame that that I think we

19
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.840
feel from the outside world like you're so lucky.

20
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.190
I would kill for that job and I used to get this a lot and I don't know if any

21
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:25.920
of you going to parties or meeting someone at a conference.

22
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:29.820
The first question is what's the food like or what's the culture like?

23
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:32.140
And all of a sudden it

24
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.070
<v 2>okay</v>

25
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.150
<v 1>seems unreasonable to talk about what's really going on and how you might really</v>

26
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:40.990
be feeling and that it goes in very natural ways.

27
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.100
What's interesting is that I still am experiencing this even five and a half

28
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:46.630
years out.
I left Google.

29
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:51.130
I started in 2006 as the company had 6,000 employees and was here as a group of

30
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:54.220
36,000 and when my first book was coming out,

31
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:58.870
I left to kind of go out and go all in and give myself six months to see if I

32
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.330
could make it.
And here I am five and a half years later,

33
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.300
not without its ups and downs,
but I'll give an example,
this,

34
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.760
this kind of judgment that comes.

35
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:11.530
So one of the early reviews for the book came in Success Magazine,

36
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.590
and this is before the book was even out,
and the reporter writes,

37
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.950
how ironic is it that a career development manager at Google's much envied

38
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:24.700
career guru program hit a career plateau and needed to take a sabbatical?

39
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.450
Play that back for you.
She says,

40
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:33.451
how ironic is it that a career development program manager at Google hit a

41
00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:37.690
career at Google's much envied career guru program,

42
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.810
hit a career plateau and needed to take a sabbatical?

43
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.610
At first I thought out that's things and then I realized you shouldn't want

44
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:50.440
nothing less of the team's working here on career development and Career Guru

45
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:53.950
and internal coaching.
Then for them to be asking these big questions.

46
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.650
So I don't find it ironic at all.

47
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:01.390
I actually think it's really important that we think about and consider what's

48
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.960
next.
And career guru is something that I'm very passionate about.

49
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.890
Becky and I worked on this together during our time here and the mission was to

50
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:13.450
provide dropping coaching for any Guler so that if people wanted to talk about

51
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.210
their career in a kind of safe,
neutral way,

52
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:19.210
you know we always of course are encouraging talking to your manager,

53
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.140
but also to have a space to think about what's next.

54
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.020
And before we go any further,
let me just say that pivoting,

55
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.950
sometimes people get the wrong impression from the book title that it always

56
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.640
means drastic career changes changing your career completely.

57
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.930
That's not it at all.

58
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:39.870
So pivot is inherently some one related they into the next and you can even

59
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.020
pivot within your role.

60
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.260
So the way that as I wrote this book and started researching it,

61
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:49.030
it's really a mindset and a method for mapping your next move.

62
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.950
So a lot of what we'll do,

63
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.580
I'll share some context and what I discovered in working on this book and then

64
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.220
we'll,
there'll be some time you to reflect today too,

65
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.060
because ultimately pivots are very personal and not only as,

66
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.330
there's nothing wrong with you if you've hit a pivot point or plateau,

67
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:08.470
but that's as to be expected.
That in fact,

68
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.210
especially at a company like Google,

69
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.760
hitting a pivot point is a product of your success.

70
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.840
It means that you've acclimated to the role that you're in and the,
uh,

71
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.510
the nature of the tasks that are a part of your role.

72
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.470
And now you're very naturally looking to say,
okay,
what else?
Give me more.

73
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.670
How else can I grow here?

74
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.070
When I started unpacking this question first,
I had two main questions.

75
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:34.030
One,
how can people be as agile as startups?
And then two,

76
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.540
how do we get better at asking and answering this question?
What's next?

77
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.010
So a little bit about my background.
I was working at a startup out of college.

78
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:43.690
In fact,
I was studying political science,

79
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.080
took a leave of absence to work with a professor at a startup as the first

80
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:48.940
employee.
One of my roles,

81
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:52.540
maybe five to 10% of my role was managing our Google ad words accounts,

82
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.670
and when I hit a plateau there,

83
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.640
I moved over to Google on the adwords product training team.

84
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.860
The career conversation that I regret the most is the one I never had and that

85
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.500
was with the founder of the startup that instead of telling him,

86
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.520
I've hit a plateau here,
what else can we do?
How can I grow in my role?

87
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.670
I started interviewing for Google in my car on lunch breaks,

88
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.070
but I ended up,
you know,

89
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:19.090
so thankful to get that role on the training and development team.
Two years in,

90
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.360
I hit another pivot point and once again,

91
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.060
at that point I really thought something was wrong with me.
I'm at Google,

92
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:29.800
I'm at the Disneyland of companies,
what's wrong here?
And my role had shifted.

93
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:30.790
I'd become a manager.

94
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:34.960
I was working on a lot of PowerPoint strategy decks and I felt like there was

95
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.760
some element that was missing.

96
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.690
So thankfully because of a serendipitous running with Peggy cotton in the

97
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:42.940
parking lot,
she said,
you know,
we're creating,

98
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:46.000
there's this career development team forming and there's a role open,

99
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:50.740
you should apply for it.
And now I see Steve.
Hi,
good to see you.
And uh,

100
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:54.700
so I applied and I got the role because I'd been working on a 10% project with

101
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.500
Becky to try and bring dropping coaching to Google.

102
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.940
And then sure enough about a year or two later hit another pivot points.

103
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.110
The book was coming out.

104
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.470
I was working around the clock at both at Google and the nights and weekends on

105
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.130
my own thing.
And at that point I realized I did take a sabbatical,

106
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.870
my ironic sabbatical,

107
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.110
that border so nicely described and I had every intention of coming back.

108
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.950
But once I was on the road,

109
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:23.600
I realized it's not going to be fair to either Google or to my own projects if I

110
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.840
give them both the short shrift,
if I spread myself too thin,

111
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.130
I'm just going to hit burnout and not be effective anywhere to anyone.

112
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.570
So at that point I made the tough decision to go all in on my own thing and see

113
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:36.404
if I could do it.

114
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.550
And so I gave myself six months and for the first year and a half I rode the

115
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:43.280
adrenaline of that.
Like,
okay,
I can do this.
I'm going to,
I'm not,

116
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.220
I'm not going to prove everybody.
Right.
Who said you're crazy to leave,

117
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.560
you're an idiot.
How are you going to feed yourself?

118
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.320
And so I kind of poured everything into my business until once again,

119
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.650
a year and a half after leaving Google,
I was asking what's next?

120
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.940
I had written life after college on podcasts and in interviews I'd become the

121
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:05.540
girl who left Google and that was all anyone wanted to talk about was what I had

122
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:09.560
left behind.
And I was really confused about what lies ahead.

123
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.340
What do I stand for?
What can I create content and emission around?

124
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.860
How can I be most helpful to people?
Who am I?

125
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.670
And this time I didn't have a steady paycheck to fund that exploration.

126
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.880
So as my bank account dwindled down to zero,

127
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.360
many of my biggest fears about leaving Google were coming true.

128
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.230
I didn't know how it was going to pay the rent in two weeks.

129
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.980
And that was really different than every other time in my career where I had

130
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:36.380
asked what's next.
At that point,

131
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:39.200
the question is not what do you do if you knew you couldn't fail,

132
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.870
but what do you do when your back is up against the wall?

133
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.690
And I knew I could either solve this and I pretty much had two weeks to do it,

134
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.350
or I would have to leave New York or go get another job.

135
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.650
And while neither of those things is categorically bad,

136
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.490
it just didn't feel like the right thing for me.
So in that moment,

137
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:00.200
I came to one of two conclusions.

138
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.030
Either there's something really wrong with me and I'm destined to be unhappy in

139
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:07.340
my career and I keep asking what's next?

140
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:11.720
Every few years and there's a problem here and I'll forever be unhappy and I

141
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:12.500
felt ungrateful.

142
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.460
I felt ungrateful for hitting these points within Google and now outside of it,

143
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.650
what is it going to be?
Neither one.

144
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.470
I hadn't clicked into my skis yet if you will,

145
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.870
but the second conclusion was that this feeling of a midlife crisis or quarter

146
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:29.060
life crisis was actually accelerating,

147
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:34.390
not just for me but for everybody and that instead of getting granted permission

148
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.500
for two of these in a lifetime,

149
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.190
that because our economy is moving so quickly and particularly in tech in

150
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:42.560
silicon valley and a company like Google,

151
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.250
we are going to be asking and answering what's next every few years and that

152
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:48.320
actually I would expect nothing less.

153
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.070
So as I looked at how people can be as agile as startups,

154
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.860
one of the things I recognized was that when we talk about startups pivoting,

155
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.450
it's often as plan B.

156
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.500
The original strategy or direction has failed and the startup needs to pivot to

157
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:05.220
stay in business.
So just like youtube used to be a video dating site,

158
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.810
it pivoted to what it is today,
multibillion dollar part of the company,

159
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.630
but when it comes to our careers,

160
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.690
pivot is the new plan a that when I think about what it takes to be successful,

161
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.140
pivot is really a mindset that says,
again,

162
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.320
not that you have to make drastic career changes.
I'm not here to say,
Oh,

163
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:28.860
you all need to leave tomorrow.
That's not it at all,
but it's,

164
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.770
it's asking how can I pivot?
How can I grow within my role?

165
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:35.520
How can I double down on what's already working and shift methodically into

166
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:39.390
something new?
As I started to understand,
okay,

167
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:43.020
well who's really doing this?
We hear about the term high net worth.

168
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.500
These are people who over the course of their lifetimes,
a crew,

169
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.420
a lot of financial assets and so we call them high net worth individuals.

170
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.800
But for the people who certainly those who work at Google or at least for the

171
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:59.130
most part and those that I started the interviewing for my book,

172
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.990
I consider them high net growth.

173
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.950
These are people who really value learning,

174
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.890
growth and exploration.
And when given the choice,

175
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.020
they would make a lateral move within the company.

176
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.410
They would take on a 10% project in addition to what they're already doing.

177
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.330
They would bootstrap a business,

178
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.570
they would sacrifice in some way if needed money in order to keep pursuing their

179
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.590
learning and development and that when their personal needs for growth are being

180
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.080
met,
they then turn toward making an impact.

181
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.410
So ultimately I call them impactors for short,
high net growth.

182
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:35.190
Individuals thrive when they're learning and growing.

183
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.600
That's oxygen to them,

184
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.290
but it's not just about vv meet people who are high net growth and ultimately

185
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:41.124
high net impact.

186
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.700
Also want to know that the work they're doing has an impact on their team,

187
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.820
on clients,
on the company,
on the broader community.

188
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.380
And there's no,
I mean Google is ground zero for this,

189
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.460
that just the definition of googly miss,
the people who Google hires,

190
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.610
all of you are so smart and hungry and committed and adaptable and all of these

191
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.550
qualities that you probably don't even realize how valuable they really are.

192
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.200
And so this idea of hitting a pivot point,
if you're high net growth,

193
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:16.500
I would actually expect nothing less.
And that once again,

194
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.060
hitting these pivot points within your role are an opportunity to ask what's

195
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:24.930
next and how can I make the biggest impact.
And there's a lot of,
you know,

196
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:28.020
I mentioned the shame and blame that we see in our media and in the culture,

197
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.580
particularly around millennials,

198
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:33.720
but I actually think that it translates to those of you working at a company

199
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.040
like Google,
which is that,

200
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.660
oh there you are so entitled to want more meaning in your work or to want to

201
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:42.060
make a bigger impact that there's something wrong.
Well,

202
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:44.580
actually if so much is getting automated and outsourced,

203
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.850
that I think everybody is smart to say,

204
00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:51.660
am I using my strengths to the fullest and my making the biggest impact that I'm

205
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:56.260
able and what are some small ways that I can continue to do that and to

206
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.094
experiment?

207
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.110
We tend to think of growth as a very linear process,

208
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:06.130
so we expect that if we look at growth on the y access and time on the x axis,

209
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.830
we're going along and we think it's going to be a straight line,

210
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:12.100
kind of like the old career ladder paradigm that you're going to get a job at

211
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:14.290
Google or get in a new role here,

212
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.590
or even just take on a new set of responsibilities.
It's like,
okay,
great.

213
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.870
Now I've set,
you know,
I can coast,

214
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.770
but what ends up happening is that our growth tends to naturally taper and we

215
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:27.250
hit a pivot point at that point.
As we start to look ahead,

216
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:32.251
we either see a plateau and that's just a general feeling of I'm fine work

217
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:34.510
spine.
Things are okay,
you know,

218
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:38.080
it's a little sense of stagnation or an active decline.

219
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.610
That's where if you're in a role or have a set of responsibilities,

220
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:45.610
that's just really not a fit.
Sometimes our bodies,
we'll start sending signals,

221
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:47.530
getting sick more often than usual.

222
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.610
I had a friend who used to get panic attacks when she would get off the subway

223
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.220
on her way to work.
So the,
there was a clear sign,

224
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:57.940
her body is now starting to ring alarm bells like you have got to make a change.

225
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.650
So at this point,
whether we plateau or decline,
the choices to pivot.

226
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.350
And by the way,
if you're a high net growth,
if you're an impactor,

227
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.920
studies show that boredom has some of the same physical manifestations in the

228
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:13.060
body of stress,
increased heart rate,
increased cortisol levels.

229
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.170
And so Tim Ferriss captures this well in his book,
the four hour workweek,

230
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.110
he said the opposite of happiness is boredom

231
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.690
and that pretty much captures the impact or sentiment.
So at this point,

232
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:28.240
the choice is to pivot.
When you think about a pivot,

233
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:32.260
pivots can be very small again within your role or they can be larger.

234
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.360
And generally the way to measure a pivot,

235
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:38.860
and actually I have to give credit Steve Maxwell because Steve back in the day

236
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:43.240
we used to Steve as the best white border I know and we would wipe board things

237
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:47.710
like comfort zone and stretch zone and so credit to Steve.

238
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:49.720
I've kind of rethought on the pivot access,

239
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:51.100
well what does this look like when you're,

240
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.090
when you're taking on new responsibilities and so if you're in your stagnation

241
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:57.130
zone,
that's one thing it's a little hard to see here,

242
00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:59.410
but this next level is your comfort zone.

243
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.730
Then the optimal range for change for impactors in your stretch zone where you

244
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:08.410
feel challenged and edgy and exciting,
and then if you try and turn to sharply,

245
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:11.740
if you try and pivot too quickly,
it's might sends you into your panic zone.

246
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.850
You can consider this at any point,
not just with a bigger pivot,

247
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:19.180
but with any next step or project that you're going to take on.

248
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.930
When I have coaching clients come to me and they say,

249
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:27.931
I'm working at a big company and I've hit a plateau by number one thing is to

250
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:32.500
ask what can you do in your role?
I'm not the person that says,
Oh,

251
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:35.410
you should quit tomorrow.
That's an I.
I don't believe that.

252
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:38.930
I think that we're in such a fluid economy now that and,

253
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.360
and I always look and ask for them to mine what's right in front of them,

254
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:47.980
what's already under their feet.
So if I had said,
if I said to any of you,
oh,

255
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:50.370
the right thing for you to do is to quit tomorrow,
it start,

256
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.660
start a business from scratch,
that would probably send you into a panic zone.

257
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.550
It's probably not the right move.

258
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:58.670
I mean maybe with rare section if you've already got that planned.

259
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.900
But really the,

260
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:04.340
the goal of a pivot is what next steps within your own career development.

261
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.530
We'll keep you in your stretch zone,

262
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.680
feeling engaged and challenged and excited.

263
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.880
And so this is something that you can get gauge as you go with anything that

264
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:16.370
you're doing.
And also to look where am I playing it too safe?

265
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.200
Where am I hanging out of my comfort zone?

266
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.800
Just so we're all on the same page.

267
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.530
The way that I define a career pivot is a methodical shift in a new related

268
00:15:25.531 --> 00:15:29.220
direction based on a foundation of your strength and what's already working.

269
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.110
So it's not a one 80 if I had left Google to become a yoga teacher,

270
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.960
that would have been a one 80 but instead I was doing coaching and career

271
00:15:36.961 --> 00:15:40.530
development within Google and I left to do coaching and career development on my

272
00:15:40.531 --> 00:15:41.280
own.

273
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.660
Even within Google I was doing adwords product training and then I did CTI coach

274
00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:49.350
training on nights and weekends and I pivoted internally when I did coach

275
00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:52.230
training,
there was no career development team.
It didn't exist,

276
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.410
but I pivoted onto it once the team was formed.

277
00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:58.920
So you can see these are examples of leveraging something that was already

278
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.730
working.
And this is really important and I will say this is the thing that I,

279
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.760
the biggest mistake that I made during my self-employment pivot was focusing too

280
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:12.600
much on what I didn't want.
What I didn't know what I didn't have.

281
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.370
And I think that we inadvertently do that sometimes when we vent to friends and

282
00:16:17.371 --> 00:16:21.240
family about work.
It's,
it's what bugging us.

283
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.840
But it's rare that people stop and say,
what is working?

284
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.500
What are your strengths?
What are your interests?
What do you want?

285
00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:32.340
What can you double down on?
So if you think of a pivot,

286
00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:33.540
it's like a basketball player.

287
00:16:33.541 --> 00:16:36.540
And this is the analogy that came to me when I was in my really tough spot,

288
00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:39.180
which is that a basketball player,
when they stopped dribbling,

289
00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:40.410
they plant both of their feet.

290
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.370
Then they have one foot firmly rooted and planted in the floor and that's their

291
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:46.680
foundation.
And that gives them strength and stability.

292
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.520
And then they get scanned for opportunity with their pivot foot instead of what

293
00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:53.430
I was doing,
which was running around the basketball court,
like a crazy person.

294
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.640
So the key of a pivot of how I define it,

295
00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:59.100
which is different than what we typically hear in Silicon Valley,

296
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.370
is that a pivot always involves doubling down.

297
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.640
Having this plant foot by doubling down on something that's already working.

298
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.410
Before we go further,
I would love for you,
and if you're watching on video,

299
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.870
this is something you can reflect on,
but if you're in the room,

300
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.830
turn to someone next to you and reverse engineer a recent pivot specifically

301
00:17:16.831 --> 00:17:21.450
highlighting what the thing in common was to switch metaphors for a moment.

302
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.270
Think of it like a pole vaulter.
Whenever you pivot,
there's this poll,

303
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:27.150
this point of leverage that you slam it into the ground and that's what

304
00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:28.800
catapults you in this new direction.

305
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.640
So think about either a pivot that you've done internally at Google or the pivot

306
00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:33.630
that got you here,

307
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.890
and go ahead and share with each other in pairs because it's likely that you've

308
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:40.620
all already done this,
even if you didn't have the language for it.

309
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.890
All right,
let's come back together.

310
00:17:56.891 --> 00:17:59.680
I would love to hear a few of these cause that's really fun to hear.
How,

311
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.240
how you've already done this.
As Steve Jobs said it is 2005 commencement speech.

312
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.100
It's much easier to connect the dots looking backward and reverse engineering,

313
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.140
reverse engineering pivots as much the same way.
Like I said,

314
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.160
you've already done this and I'm actually not here to tell you something new or

315
00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:16.390
something you don't already know.

316
00:18:16.391 --> 00:18:19.690
I'm just giving you language and a process to put around it.

317
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.320
So I would love to hear either your pivot story within Google or what got you

318
00:18:23.321 --> 00:18:27.070
here or you can nominate a friend if they had a particularly interesting one.

319
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.640
Have you want,
don't be shy.

320
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.120
<v 3>Alright.
So I'll start off and then see if it's someone else.
Um,</v>

321
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.990
get some likewise moved.
Yeah,
I mean for me at least it was,
you know,

322
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.430
volunteering on the toxic Google program,

323
00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:47.230
like leading tours for the visiting speakers,

324
00:18:47.231 --> 00:18:51.580
trying to find a need there based on something that was already doing.
And then,

325
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.020
you know,
like,
like you said,

326
00:18:53.021 --> 00:18:55.690
perfecting that skill and then expanding to the rest of the business.

327
00:18:55.691 --> 00:18:57.490
And you know,
starting up the talks program,

328
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.240
<v 1>that's a great example of starting something small as an experiment and then</v>

329
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:05.610
later it grows into a full time role,

330
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.150
which is a much more common and doable then you might think,

331
00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.890
<v 4>hello,
hello.
So I,
my most recent switch was,
um,</v>

332
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.770
from a learning business partner role and to the managing the learning programs

333
00:19:17.771 --> 00:19:20.680
overall.
And the pivot was,
I mean it's still in learning and development,

334
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:23.360
but I realized I was actually trying to do a whole bunch of problem solving from

335
00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:24.250
the learning partner role,

336
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.890
which was actually the job of the person who was running the learning programs

337
00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:27.970
role.
So I wanted to do,

338
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:32.230
I was already trying to solve their problems and then the position opened up and

339
00:19:32.231 --> 00:19:34.840
so it just seemed right in that shelter.
So sort of move into that.

340
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.530
<v 1>That's so interesting.</v>

341
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.810
So you kind of doubled down on what you were already doing within the role.

342
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.160
Right.

343
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.030
<v 4>I'm,
what I knew was a deeper skill set that I haven't been using recently,</v>

344
00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:46.990
but I'd have from 20 years earlier that I developed deeply in college.

345
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.550
<v 1>That's so interesting.</v>

346
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:53.830
I heard so many people who say once they find that that next iteration of either

347
00:19:53.921 --> 00:19:55.900
their existing role or the new one,
they say,
oh,

348
00:19:55.901 --> 00:19:59.140
it feels like my whole career has been preparing me for this and that.

349
00:19:59.141 --> 00:20:01.380
I love hearing about latent strengths,

350
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:05.140
strengths and waiting or in hiding that you're not fully using,

351
00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:09.440
but you look back and you think,
oh,
I've had this 20 years.
That's how I felt.

352
00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:13.300
They just trained a group of pivot coaches and it was the first time in five and

353
00:20:13.301 --> 00:20:15.370
a half years I was doing coach training again,

354
00:20:15.371 --> 00:20:19.420
which I used to do with Becky here at Google for a career guru and it was this

355
00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:24.250
deep source of joy that came back to me.
Just came flooding in like,
Oh,

356
00:20:24.251 --> 00:20:25.990
I've done this before and I can do this,

357
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.430
and so I encourage all of you to think about strength and waiting,
strengthened,

358
00:20:30.431 --> 00:20:32.380
hiding,
even things that you enjoyed doing as a kid.

359
00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.050
I know that's a little cliche in the career space at this point.

360
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.180
We hear it all the time,
but it really is true.

361
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.950
There are so many clues in what you've already done and that's why if I only

362
00:20:41.951 --> 00:20:43.180
leave you with one thing today,

363
00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:46.450
it's that the answer to what's next is already under your feet.

364
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.270
You're doing it in some way.
You already know it,

365
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.640
it's not so far outside of yourself.

366
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.970
So let's look at how to actually unpack this.

367
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:59.380
I developed a four stage pivot method because as anyone who did work with me

368
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:03.970
here knows I really love structure and templates and organization and one of my

369
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:08.020
favorite guiding mantras in life comes from the practice of agile development.

370
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.800
And they have this phrase,
each time you repeat a task,

371
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:15.520
take one step toward automating it.
And I felt like,
well,

372
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.630
if every time one of us impactors or high net growth individuals,

373
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:22.690
if every time we hit a pivot point we start asking what's next?

374
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.930
And then we're driving ourselves crazy and taking it personally and beating

375
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:29.170
ourselves up and feeling ashamed that we feel that way.

376
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.990
Well that's really inefficient and that bugs me.

377
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.320
So how can we get better at asking and answering what's next?

378
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.020
The pivot method is my unpacking of that.

379
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:41.680
And both of reverse engineering my moves and interviewing hundreds of people and

380
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.930
doing coaching for the last eight years.

381
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.220
It's a four stage process that really starts from that basketball player
analogy.

382
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.630
So this is where we'll get a little interactive.
The first stage is plants.

383
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.850
This is the one that most people want to skip,

384
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.470
especially if you're a problem solving go getter like everybody is here.

385
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.520
The natural reaction is I've hit a pivot point.
What's next?
What's out there?

386
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.540
The first thing most people want to do is start looking outside of themselves

387
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.510
and what ends up happening is you're scanning without a plan.

388
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.420
You're looking for the next thing with without being grounded,

389
00:22:13.421 --> 00:22:17.530
without being rooted in this plant foot.
So it takes up is up,
taking longer,

390
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.550
it feels more stressful.
You might feel overwhelmed by choices,
feel,

391
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:24.190
compare and despair or analysis paralysis.

392
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.220
These are the kinds of things that happen when we skip the plant stage.

393
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.560
So number one is what's already working.
Have you look at this graph?

394
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.130
It's what are your values?
What's most important to you?
What are your strengths?

395
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.820
I love how Steve's example is about what are you doing within your role that

396
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:41.500
might not even be in the job description,

397
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.310
but that people keep coming to you for or that you keep kind of working your way

398
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:49.150
to.
When does time fly?
When are you the most in the zone?

399
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.190
What is working within your role?

400
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:54.970
Whether that's 95% or 5% identify it,

401
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.320
and this can also be outside of work too.
What do you enjoy doing on the side?

402
00:22:59.321 --> 00:23:00.340
What do you do for fun?

403
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.280
My friend Neil wrote a book called the happiness equation.
He says,

404
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.050
what's your Saturday morning test?

405
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.960
What do you do on Saturday mornings when you don't feel like you need to be

406
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:08.950
doing anything else?

407
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.120
And the second most critical part about planting his vision,

408
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.600
I don't believe in asking,
where do you see yourself in five years?

409
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:20.530
I think that question is totally irrelevant at this point.
Who,

410
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.380
who of us could have said where we would be five years ago?

411
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.230
Things are moving much too quickly for that.
And certainly at Google,

412
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:29.500
I know when I was here we were reorging as much as we were Oregon.

413
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:34.710
So there's nobody better at dealing with chaos and uncertainty venue and sitting

414
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:38.920
at the edge of that.
But I do think we can say a one year vision.

415
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.250
So one year from now,
what does success look like?

416
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.650
What would you be thrilled to have happening in role?

417
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.990
What is your ideal average day look like?

418
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.950
What kind of impact do you want to have on your team,
on your clients,

419
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:55.010
within the company,
on the company as a whole on the broader community?

420
00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.350
These are all questions that help.
I'd call it in the book,
put a pin in it.

421
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.790
So just like in Google maps,

422
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:03.980
you know where you're starting and now you've got to put a pin in it.

423
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.830
And the reason a lot of people skip this is one,

424
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:11.330
it seems kind of fuzzy and then for some it might be a little too soft,

425
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.180
but it's really important.

426
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.140
The other reason people skip it is often our gremlins Russian.

427
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.810
So as soon as we say something truly exciting,

428
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.210
what I really want to be doing a year from now,

429
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.780
it might say you're not good enough,
smart enough,
capable enough,

430
00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:30.560
that's not possible.
It's harder to move internally than it is to get a job.

431
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:34.940
Like all the,
the,
the cancer,
the sheds or even the how.

432
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.080
How are you going to do that?

433
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.650
I don't know if any of you have had this experience that you tell a friend or

434
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:42.530
family members something really exciting that you want to do and they

435
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:45.500
immediately start peppering you with house.
How are we going to do that?

436
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:48.020
How are you going to find that?
How are you going to have time for that?

437
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.230
And so it kind of starts to shoot it down before the vision is even developed.

438
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.190
When we're in,
we're doing coach training often describe this.
The vision,

439
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.600
it starts as a black and white photograph and the work here is in blowing it up

440
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:03.740
to a three d movie.
The more vivid that movie,
that vision,

441
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.600
the more clearly the more effectively and more efficiently you can scan for

442
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:10.220
opportunities for what's next.

443
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:16.570
So now just take a moment and in fact we'll just give let's say 30 seconds even

444
00:25:17.511 --> 00:25:22.310
with your eyes closed and think about what you're currently enjoying most and

445
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.450
what's working best.

446
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.623
<v 2>Okay?</v>

447
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.990
<v 1>Because I know not everyone has a pen and paper,
which is a real throwback</v>

448
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.520
and now start to reflect on what does success look like a year from now.

449
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:47.270
So a year from now,
how do you want to feel?
And again,

450
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:50.600
I encourage you to close your eyes.
If you're watching on video,

451
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:53.510
you can definitely jot things down on paper and pause

452
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.740
what a smashing success look like a year from now.

453
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.380
I encourage you to spend much more time on this when I'm working with coaching

454
00:26:04.381 --> 00:26:04.711
clients.

455
00:26:04.711 --> 00:26:08.970
Sometimes I spend a month or more on each of these stages if we're doing 30

456
00:26:08.971 --> 00:26:12.090
seconds,
which is just the tiniest tip of the iceberg,

457
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:16.500
but you start to get a sense for how to work yourself through this process.

458
00:26:16.501 --> 00:26:21.360
And I also encourage you,
if you do this later,
don't stop brainstorming.

459
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.490
Keep going.
Go for your stretch zone.

460
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.180
It's often the case that when I say what does success look like a year from now,

461
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.990
people give me something pretty safe,
what feels reasonable?

462
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:35.160
And I encourage you not to do that at these early stages.
Instead,

463
00:26:35.161 --> 00:26:37.800
go for quantity,
write down as much as you can,

464
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.860
and then later you'll get a chance to narrow it down.

465
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.460
The next stage is that once you're rooted,

466
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:47.130
so once you know where you are and where you want to end up these form the

467
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:48.210
brackets of your pivot.

468
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.010
And now we have a much clearer picture of this gap between where you are now.

469
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.780
Where do you want to end up and how to bridge the two.

470
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.640
And the way to bridge this gap is through people skills and projects.

471
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.610
So when you're scanning now,
so we're rooted in our plant.

472
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:05.190
So based on your strengths and your one year vision,

473
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.940
now we can look for people skills and projects that are connected to that.

474
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.770
So the,
the scanning is anchored.
So the people who do you admire,

475
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.160
who can you connect with,
who is doing what you want to be doing?
I like,
again,

476
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.360
do you Steve's example?

477
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.840
Someone who had this role that he was really interested in and when the role

478
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:25.920
opened up he knew he was perfectly positioned to move into it.
So,

479
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.460
and this can be within the company or outside of it.
These mentors can be,

480
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.600
it can be friend tours,

481
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.080
friends of yours who you can brainstorm and collaborate and connect with.

482
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.330
They can also be mentors from afar.

483
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.410
It's perfectly fine if you want to say Larry Page and you look to him to see

484
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:45.120
what is he doing,
how does he manage his next move or even podcasts,

485
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:45.511
books.

486
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:49.110
There are so many ways that you can learn from people that it doesn't all have

487
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:52.620
to be people within your direct access skills.

488
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.390
Usually when we're here and we want to get here,

489
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.100
there's a skill gap and that's exciting.

490
00:27:56.101 --> 00:28:00.630
That's the whole point of wanting to plan.
Our next move is what can I,

491
00:28:00.631 --> 00:28:04.080
how can I learn and grow that feeds our soul as impacters.

492
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.050
So what do you want to learn?
What do you want to become an expert in?

493
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:10.560
Get strategic about what skills,
if you were to develop them further,

494
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.800
would most help you move from where you are now to where you want to go?

495
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.760
I've mentioned while we were fixing the slides that when I applied to the job at

496
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:22.470
Google I was absolutely terrified to speak in front of people and I've mentioned

497
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:26.580
I got red hives all over my chest and neck so I applied for the training team

498
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:30.660
role because I knew that that skillset of being in front of the room and somehow

499
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:34.950
trying to remain calm and not embarrass myself with my physiological response

500
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:39.210
would be a good asset to have someday and that's what's allowing me to be here

501
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.060
now and not be freaking out and not be wearing a turtle neck.

502
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.300
So skills is important and then projects,

503
00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:47.760
then you can start to narrow down projects that are going to be,

504
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.510
again based on what you identified in the plant stage.
Exciting to move into.

505
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.750
So I know we're doing this all kind of in our head at the moment,

506
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:59.250
but close your eyes for another 30 we'll do a minute total,
but 30 seconds on.

507
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:02.580
Who Do you admire?
So based on your one year vision,

508
00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:06.090
who's currently doing things that are interesting to you,

509
00:29:06.091 --> 00:29:07.950
either within the company or outside of it,

510
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.900
and who might you talk to,
who could you schedule lunch with?

511
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.300
Okay.
Once you have a sense.

512
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.730
So scanning is about seeing what's out there and then the third stage pilot.

513
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.650
So this will be near and dear to your heart.

514
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:32.280
That's Google or is it certainly I share so many stories of Googlers in the book

515
00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:34.980
and so much of my philosophy around applying,

516
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:39.060
pivoting to career comes from what I learned at Google and what I learned both

517
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:42.700
doing training.
And then later moving into coaching and career development pilot.

518
00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:46.810
We talk about pilots all the time at Google pilot programs,
pilot launches.

519
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.930
So it's a way to test an idea and see how it goes.

520
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.710
I mentioned in the book there's a chapter it's called get scrappy.

521
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.220
So we know and I directly say this is something I learned at Google launch and

522
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:58.000
iterate.

523
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.750
And what's different is applying that to career because a lot of people put

524
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:04.420
pressure on themselves when they think about career development.

525
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.890
To have the next huge move and there's so much pressure and when we're thinking

526
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:10.870
on the old paradigm of the career ladder,

527
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.100
there's a lot of pressure to to time magically jump from one rung all the way up

528
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:18.460
to the next,
but instead of you can think about career pilots,

529
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.870
smaller experiments,

530
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:24.160
think about your own personal 10 or 20% projects in your career.

531
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.080
Then you can be much more agile.

532
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.520
So I mentioned that I like to use the analogy of your career as a smartphone,

533
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.610
so your education and your upbringing is you're out of the box model.

534
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.430
Then it's up to you to download apps for different skills,

535
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.130
interests and experiences that are exciting to you.

536
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:42.760
Just like what we've done in the plants and scan stages we'll piloting is all

537
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:43.960
about downloading an APP.

538
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.460
Becky and I downloaded an APP which was a 10% project of trying to build this

539
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:51.550
dropping coaching program with a whole team of people.
Early on,

540
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:56.410
cliff had an APP of volunteering to manage talks when it was not at all your

541
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:57.131
fulltime role.

542
00:30:57.131 --> 00:31:02.110
It was just a small passion project and even doing campus tours is a,

543
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:03.850
is a really interesting career pilot.

544
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.040
So I encourage you to think about how can you now test what hypotheses you've

545
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:12.820
come up with and the plant and scan stages based on your strengths.

546
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:16.720
So it all should build from what you've looked at previously and a good pilot,

547
00:31:16.721 --> 00:31:20.470
a good career pilot.
We'll test what I call the three e's.
One,

548
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.620
do I enjoy this new area to,

549
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:26.770
can I become an expert at it and do I want two and three,

550
00:31:26.771 --> 00:31:31.300
is there room to expand?
So for example,
when I went to coach training,

551
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.650
I knew I enjoyed it.

552
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:35.860
I could have believed that my bookshelves had come to life and there was a room

553
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:40.780
full of people that were interested in talking about things like human potential

554
00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:45.640
and fulfillment in life.
Okay,
expertise.
Could I become an expert?
Who knows?

555
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.630
But I was willing to try and invest in that and feel really awkward and nervous.

556
00:31:49.631 --> 00:31:52.720
I used to be sick to my stomach before coaching sessions because I was just

557
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:57.310
nervous.
But I kept pushing through that.
And then expansion.
At that time,

558
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:59.890
there was not a role for me to be a coach within the company,

559
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:03.070
but by continuing it built naturally,

560
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.440
I searched Astera Seth Marvin story in the book sets,

561
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.760
started Google serve as a response to a Google culture idea,

562
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.710
call out one year and the first year he had 700,000 people from 40 countries and

563
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:17.590
it was over one day and the following year he doubled it.

564
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:22.300
He had 14,000 volunteers from 70 countries and it was a full week.

565
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.660
And then over the years,
again,
there was no role at the time,

566
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:29.770
but he ended up pitching a role managing Google's volunteer outreach fulltime.

567
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.970
So that's a great example of just,
you know,
you're enjoying it,
you,

568
00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.900
he's becoming better at it.
He's proving the market.
So even within the company,

569
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:40.220
kind of proving the market need and that,
hey,

570
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:42.170
this can really make an impact on the business.

571
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.210
And then it grew naturally from there.
So now consider it.

572
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:51.140
Take 30 seconds and think about what experiments could you run in the next
month.

573
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.160
So based on the skills and the people and the strengths that you've already

574
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:59.920
identified.
Think about this is kind of comfort zone.

575
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.220
Stretch zone.
Okay,

576
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:04.430
so think about things and a career pilot could even just be having lunch with

577
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:08.750
someone so they don't all have to be massive projects.
Okay,

578
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.840
close your eyes.
Take 20 more seconds to brainstorm on this one.

579
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:20.140
Small experiments,
go for quantity,
not quality at this point.

580
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:33.280
Now think about in the next six months,
what would fall in your stretch zone?

581
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.440
Reconnect with your one year vision.

582
00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.980
What pilots would most move you toward that one year vision that you identified

583
00:33:41.231 --> 00:33:43.030
that you could run in the next six months?

584
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:44.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

585
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.910
<v 1>Okay.
Time again.
You could spend a whole lot longer on these.</v>

586
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.410
This is really fun to brainstorm,

587
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:54.080
so I encourage you to again go for quantity over quality.

588
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.300
Think about things in your stretch zone.

589
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.840
Think of what would move you closest to your one year vision and know that pivot

590
00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:04.160
is a cycle so you can plant,
scan,
pilot over and over and be perfectly happy.

591
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.050
In fact you can do this for years and this is a way to frame career development

592
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.010
that there doesn't necessarily have to be this fourth stage,

593
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:14.540
which we'll get to in a minute of launching,

594
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.430
but you can continuously be plant scanning and piloting.

595
00:34:17.431 --> 00:34:21.620
You can continuously say every quarter what's working,
what can I double down on?

596
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.800
What's out there,
what do I want to learn?
Great,
what pilots can I run?

597
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.930
And I love metaphors.

598
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:30.710
So if you think about pilots like race horses at the Kentucky Derby there like

599
00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:34.070
race horses at the starting gate and eventually one of them will pull ahead.

600
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.320
Well we don't know which one.
I mean even for me,

601
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:40.430
pivot just launched last week and I've been working on this book for three
years.

602
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.350
It's my own pivot point and people are inevitably going to ask what's next?

603
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:48.530
Which triggered my first existential crisis when my first book came out.

604
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.390
And the truth is I don't know.
I really don't.
I have pilots,

605
00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.670
I have ideas,
I have hypotheses,

606
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.660
but actually I have no clue which of my income stream,

607
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:03.740
race horses is going to take off.
And so part of,
and again,

608
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:08.510
what you're so good at already being in the Google culture is being okay with

609
00:35:08.511 --> 00:35:11.930
that and it's one of the biggest things that I learned writing this book from

610
00:35:11.931 --> 00:35:15.530
the time I interviewed people to a year and a half later when I went to fact

611
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:19.100
check almost nobody had stayed in the same place both by choice and by

612
00:35:19.101 --> 00:35:23.510
circumstance.
People got hired,
fired their companies got acquired,

613
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.690
then they got fired,
they quit their jobs,
they started their own business,

614
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.270
they hated their own business,
so they went back to a job.

615
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:34.070
I mean I saw it all I saw at all and even within Google we know that things

616
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:38.040
change so quickly and you think you're in one role or then your manager changes

617
00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:39.180
or the company,

618
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:43.770
the org changes or the building changes or you go work in an office of process.

619
00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:48.810
There's so much going on and you can kind of always be looking at what do I want

620
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:51.960
to double down on?
What is working and how can I do more of it?

621
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.690
Sometimes there is a launch moment,

622
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.560
so that's when you go all in on a new direction.
My editor and I were very clear.

623
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:01.890
We actually took out the word leap,
which this used to be called leap,

624
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.420
and we realize that when you follow the pivot method,
it's not a leap anymore.

625
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.410
It's not a blind leap.

626
00:36:07.411 --> 00:36:11.730
It's not a jump that you reducing risk by piloting so that by the time you do go

627
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:15.150
all in on something,
you take a new role,
you moved to another team,

628
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:19.530
you do go work in an office abroad,
you're more clear,
there's less risk.

629
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:21.210
It hasn't sent you into your panic zone.

630
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:25.170
You have very methodically worked your way into that launch where it becomes

631
00:36:25.171 --> 00:36:29.130
really clear and of course there's still be some uncertainty and some fear,

632
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:33.510
but nobody that I talked to regretted their launch decision no matter what their

633
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:35.670
move,
what was which I found really interesting.

634
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.660
So I say in the book that if you're an impactor,
we don't have fomo.

635
00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:42.600
We have font fear of not trying that.

636
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:47.601
Ultimately our biggest fear is to have an idea about ways to better leverage our

637
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:50.790
strengths.
To make a bigger impact.
Our biggest fear is not to try.

638
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.360
So ultimately when you're ready to launch,
a lot of people ask,

639
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:57.030
well how do I know what I'm ready to launch is when you know that you would

640
00:36:57.031 --> 00:36:58.740
rather try and fail,

641
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.720
which one does that even mean then than not try and stay in the same place.

642
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:05.403
<v 2>Okay,</v>

643
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.940
<v 1>so we didn't use paper so there's nothing to circle,</v>

644
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.640
but I would love for you to now turn in pairs.

645
00:37:10.641 --> 00:37:12.140
These are two of my favorite questions.

646
00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:16.310
You can ask them of yourself on any project you could even use pivot method on

647
00:37:16.311 --> 00:37:17.480
projects that you're stuck on,

648
00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.920
but considering turn to someone next to you and just share one small step you

649
00:37:21.921 --> 00:37:26.300
can take in the next week based on everything that you were reflecting on and

650
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.820
what next step would make the biggest impact.

651
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.110
And these can be professional or personal for some people,
their skills,

652
00:37:33.111 --> 00:37:36.470
it's like cooking or salsa dancing and that would be an app they want to

653
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:37.670
download it feel fulfilled.

654
00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:40.310
So go ahead and share in pairs and then we'll do some as a group.

655
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.740
Great.
Okay.
In the interest of time,
we'll keep moving,

656
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:55.230
but I encourage you to share these,
ask each other.

657
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.230
It's also one of my favorite questions now when I meet new people is,

658
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:03.330
and even talking to other Googlers staff about their pivots internally or what's

659
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.830
what they're thinking about next.

660
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.070
This can also be used as a conversation framework.

661
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:11.580
So a lot of times when people come to us and they're stuck and they say,
oh,

662
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:12.780
I just don't know what I should do.

663
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.270
W our first instinct is to jump to giving advice,

664
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.060
but actually that's sort of robs them of their own,

665
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.150
facilitating their own thought process and being the expert in their own life.

666
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.410
So you could even apply pivot as a,
as a conversation framework where you say,

667
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:29.340
well,
what is working?
What do you want?
What's out there?
What can you try?

668
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:31.620
What's a small next step you can take?
And you can see,

669
00:38:31.621 --> 00:38:35.260
I just thought less than a minute so you can do this and as little as 10 minutes

670
00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:36.490
with someone.
And so I encourage you,

671
00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:40.990
that's also a nice way to try having conversations with other people to frame it

672
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:43.300
up in a really strengths based approach.

673
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.720
One of my favorite quotes is from poet David White,

674
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:50.050
who says that what you can plan is too small for you to live.

675
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.770
One of the things that I feel most passionate about is just to release you all

676
00:38:57.011 --> 00:39:01.060
of the pressure to have to know imperfect specificity,

677
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.120
what's next and that actually you don't need to.

678
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.010
And if you did you would be bored.

679
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.140
And that even Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg and their book how Google

680
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.990
Works,
they talk about smart creative and that,
you know,

681
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:17.020
we do all this work to bring in smart creatives and then they inevitably wanted

682
00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.370
change and shift and grow.

683
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.260
They still fight like hell to keep them and I love that perspective that it's

684
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:23.411
like,

685
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:28.390
what do we expect anything less of anyone in this room then then to feel this

686
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:30.940
way that that would,
you can plan is too small for you to live.

687
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:34.750
So as uncomfortable as the uncertainty can be,
sometimes it is.

688
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.080
I wish I could convey that it is such a Ninja skill that you're all developing

689
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:43.690
that as I did the research and what does it really take to be most agile in a

690
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:44.620
modern economy?

691
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:49.630
One of the things is the ability to handle uncertainty if you work at Google

692
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.890
check.
Another is openness and willingness to try new technology.

693
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.050
Once again,
check the third,

694
00:39:56.051 --> 00:40:00.120
we're moving from knowledge workers to relationship workers that actually uh,

695
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.830
we're at peak data,
peak information,

696
00:40:02.831 --> 00:40:07.831
peak content online and that with automation and robots and outsourcing that the

697
00:40:08.621 --> 00:40:13.000
real value is in being coming,
relationship workers,
collaborating.
Once again,

698
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:13.870
check,

699
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.820
you have everything that you need and if you've hit a pivot point in your role

700
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.790
at the company,
you're human.
You're human.

701
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:25.180
This is to be expected and this should be celebrated.
And again,

702
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:27.880
it doesn't mean that these have to be big,
drastic changes,

703
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:32.050
but something I'm so passionate about is just giving us new language that's

704
00:40:32.051 --> 00:40:36.730
gender neutral and judgment neutral.
So pivot.
It doesn't have to be a crisis.

705
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.240
One of my personal mottos that I've adopted as build first,

706
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:42.760
then your courage will follow.
I came to realize that

707
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.860
courage doesn't drop down from the sky.
Will we want to make a move?

708
00:40:47.861 --> 00:40:50.530
Sometimes we're waiting.
Oh well,
when I feel courageous enough,

709
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:54.670
I'll do this next thing all approach my manager about this idea that I have,

710
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.200
but actually it works the opposite way that when we just start taking small

711
00:40:59.201 --> 00:41:04.201
steps and planting seeds and running pilots pretty much on faith,

712
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.830
not knowing what's going to work,

713
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.530
but trusting that if we keep trying these small experiments,

714
00:41:08.531 --> 00:41:09.580
something will click.

715
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.300
That's when we really start to feel progress and then taking those steps,

716
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:16.780
we start to feel more courageous and that actually wisdom,

717
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.120
not what actually fear,

718
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:24.190
insecurity and uncertainty are the biggest doorways of opportunity that we have.

719
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.820
So when you feel those things,
when you're asking what's next,

720
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:33.560
you can stop taking it personally and know that you're absolutely on the track

721
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.360
and that in asking those questions,

722
00:41:35.361 --> 00:41:39.500
the answers will come and that you don't have to have every next step map out.

723
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.180
The only move that matters is your next one.
Thank you.

724
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.570
Thank you so much for having me.
And if you want to learn more,

725
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.430
there's the book and I have a pivot podcast,

726
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.910
and there was a full full toolkit online.

727
00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:56.840
