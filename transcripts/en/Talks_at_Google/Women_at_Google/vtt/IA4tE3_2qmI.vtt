00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.813
Please welcome

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.760
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.580
<v 1>it's really great to be here today and talk about a lot of different things.</v>

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.490
And I was one of those kids that was kind of different,
uh,
growing up,

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.470
bullied and teased in school.
Well,

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.950
and the thing that saved me was my science teacher.

7
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:27.700
I had a great science teacher that got me interested in doing all kinds of

8
00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:29.770
interesting projects,
which brings it down.

9
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.200
Do you want to get kids doing interesting stuff?

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.960
You're going to have to show them interesting stuff.

11
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.340
There was a scene on the HBO movie where I got really interested in optical

12
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:40.180
illusion rooms.

13
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.710
Well and I actually saw that optical illusion Rome on a bell labs,

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.390
16 millimeter movie.

15
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:50.020
Now I'm showing how long ago that wides on optical illusions.

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.530
So you know,
gotta get 'em out there and show him stuff.

17
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.750
Now the thing is I want to do is to get you thinking about different kinds of

18
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:03.250
minds that think differently.
You know,
when I was in twenties,
30s,

19
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.200
early forties,
I thought everybody thought the same way that I think.

20
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.580
Then I asked this question and this is where I learned how thinking can be

21
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:16.270
different access your memory on a church steeple.

22
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.640
How does that information come into your mind?

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.130
I was shocked to find out that a lot of people get this vague,
generalized thing.

24
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.720
I don't have any vague generalized thing.
I only have specific ones.

25
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.560
Now you might ask,
why am I talking about Church steeples on,

26
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.590
why don't I ask how her,

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.160
well most people are so familiar with their own home with their own car that

28
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:42.250
they're going to see that,
but I wanted to ask you something.

29
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:46.840
You don't own what the out there and you have to see them and everybody knows

30
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:51.010
what they are.
You don't,
so you have to see a whole lot of them.

31
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.810
You just can't even drive around without seeing them.

32
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.090
And that really started giving Michigan role insight that different people think

33
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.953
differently.

34
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.410
So then I divided the world kind of into on people are thinking words and people

35
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:06.880
that think in pictures and then I started to,
well wait a minute,

36
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:10.270
this is other kind of person that kind of thinks in patterns.

37
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.860
This is more of the mathematical kind of mind now.

38
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.270
One is something they come and abnormality.
You know,

39
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.190
you get a little bit of the autism trait,

40
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.940
you take out some social stuff in the brain.
Yeah.
And you get geeked,
uh,

41
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.410
traits for all kinds of fun tech stuff.

42
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640
I think a brand can either be made more confident of a more thinking or brain

43
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:38.200
can be made more social because after all,
who invented the first stone spear?

44
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.490
It wasn't the Yak,
Yak surround the um,
the campfire,
that's for sure.

45
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.300
Now with some geek out there in the back of the cave,

46
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:50.590
chipping away at a rock and figured out how to get it fast into a stick and that

47
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:53.090
make a stone spear.
You see,

48
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.650
you get a little bit of that kind of watches him trait.
You get some advantages,

49
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.900
you get too much of a trait.
You got a very,

50
00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:02.680
very handicap because one of the big problems we've got with the autism spectrum

51
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.180
is it's so huge.

52
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.620
At one end you have got a lot of people,

53
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.940
probably people like Tesla who invented the power plant and you got a lot of

54
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.670
people in Silicon Valley.
There's a lot of them that alive.

55
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:18.610
I don't talk about life once.
I'm only in our talk about dead ones.

56
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.640
When I showed her pictures,
you know who all the live ones are.

57
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.140
You going to look a lot businessweek magazine and it's really,
really obvious,

58
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.140
but you get a little bit of um,
you know,

59
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.760
you have to creative people while you're there.

60
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.850
There tends to be relatives have on people that may have bipolar disorder,

61
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.450
you just more techies and they um,
autism careers.

62
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.490
Now the thing is an autism diagnosis is not precise and over the years they kept

63
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.540
changing the diagnosis and the early nineties,
they put an Asperger's.

64
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.990
We're now just geeks nerds with no speech delay become autistic.

65
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.750
Then in 2013 they took that out.

66
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.910
So now you've got this great big mucky autism diagnosis that goes from heads of

67
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:04.750
silicon valley companies down to people that are,

68
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.500
remain nonverbal and cannot dress themselves.
So you've got this huge spectrum.

69
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.350
Okay,
maybe that's Harrison and I put his picture up here,

70
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.390
but I promise that I would only talk about dead ones and stuff I could dig off

71
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:23.620
of publicly available things like a very popular book that's out now.

72
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.550
Now the thing I want to get you to think about is what happened the Little

73
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.770
Albert today,
Little Albert Einstein,

74
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.490
he had no language until he was three years old,

75
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.490
wasn't very social like the lineup blocks.

76
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.720
He'd probably be labeled autistic spectrum today.
You know,
um,

77
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.080
little stating,
oh,
weird loner.

78
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.460
This is right out of publicly available information.
A weird,

79
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:55.900
weird loner that brought snakes to his elementary school and turn them loose.

80
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.620
And then he was bullied and bullied and bullied and teased.

81
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.160
And what saved him was getting out in the neighborhood computer club.

82
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.410
This brings up a really important thing,

83
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:08.410
getting these teenagers that are kind of different now today they're getting

84
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.670
addicted to video games,

85
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.060
sometimes getting addicted to video games and get an autism diagnosis and get

86
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.360
paid social security to play video games.
Yeah,
and people say,
well,

87
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:18.970
I'm too much down on video games.
Well,

88
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.260
I was just down at JPL yesterday and if you want to work at JPL all day and play

89
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.240
video games at night,
I don't have a problem with that.

90
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.680
What I'm getting concerned about is the kid that's getting addicted to video

91
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:34.090
games and they're not getting a job at JPL,
that concerns me very,
very much.

92
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.950
And so he was bullied and then when he went to work for Atari was such a filthy

93
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:43.330
slob.
They made them come in at night not being a filthy slobs,
not okay.

94
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.560
And there's a scene in the movie where they slammed down the deodorant and they

95
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.520
said,
you stink.
Use it.
That actually happened.
This is where you know,
you know,

96
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:52.351
this were bosses,

97
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:56.110
they're going to just have to give some instruction on how to behave at work and

98
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.100
being an absolutely filthy dirty slop.

99
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.210
I don't think he'd be very acceptable here either.
It's just too gross.

100
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.660
Now I like the look at personality differences or of like a music mixing board.

101
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.530
You know,
it's not black and white.
Like if I get a diagnosis for tuberculosis,

102
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.323
that's definite.

103
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.130
I either got tuberculosis or don't or the that had tuberculosis or I didn't.

104
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.840
So I checked the Australian customs form,
which I did two months ago.
I can check.

105
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.410
I have never had tuberculosis.
That's definite,

106
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.240
you know,
and it's see autism,
it's a,
you know,
that's a much more gray area.

107
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:34.880
Geeks and nerds,
one this that turned into mild autism,

108
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.020
no black and white dividing line.
It's a continuous trait.

109
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.880
And if you've got rid of this trait completely,
you won't have any new employees.

110
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.100
It's just that sentence.

111
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.800
Now I am a total visual thinker.

112
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.330
I think in photo realistic pictures,
I don't think in words.

113
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.630
So when I think about designing something,
I can test run it.

114
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.650
And see it in my head in three d,
You know,

115
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.990
before three d virtual reality,
computer programs were invented.

116
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.930
Like I sit in a conference room and they could sort of like try stuff and they

117
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.970
say,
well yeah,
if you do that,
that's not going to work.

118
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.180
And you might wonder why as the shooed curved.
Well,

119
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.130
as the cattle come on around the band,

120
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.730
they think they're going back to where they came from and that's one of the

121
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:26.600
reasons why that works.
I'm always get asked that all the time.

122
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.780
Questions like the cows,
no,
they're going to get slaughtered.

123
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.030
I had to answer that question very early in my career and I found they behaved

124
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:39.260
exactly the same way at a slaughter plant as they behave going up a shoot for

125
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:41.990
the veterinarian.
It's not stress free,

126
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.280
but the amount of stress they have in both of those places is approximately the

127
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:46.941
same.
In fact,

128
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:51.941
I just updated that literature for my class slides and it's still the same.

129
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.180
No,
they tell us to do a blood samples in both places.
Yeah.

130
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.020
It can vary from very little stress from a higher stress,

131
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:04.070
but it's about the same in the two different places.

132
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.340
Well,
when you're aware a geek,

133
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.900
one of the things I've found is that the way that I had to so myself was by

134
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:14.360
showing off my work.
Yes.

135
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:16.910
Selia work rather than yourself.

136
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.420
So I'll put portfolios together.
Okay.

137
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.760
I'd say the quality of this projectors about medium good.

138
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.140
You know,
I've had had ones where it showed up better than that.
Now the thing is,

139
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.340
when I first started out,

140
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.210
I'd go to the AG engineering meeting and they thought I was really,
you know,

141
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:41.780
we are,
no one wants to talk to me.
And then I whipped out a big foldout drawing.

142
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.790
Then I started to get respect.
That's selling your work.

143
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.310
And the thing I learned about my portfolio,

144
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.630
you want to make a portfolio where someone looks at it and 30 seconds later
it's,

145
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:56.700
wow,
don't put too much junk in a portfolio.

146
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.500
You just put enough stuff in there.
So look at it really quickly.
Wow.

147
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.180
This person really has some,
uh,
you know,
really can do some stuff now.

148
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:10.590
I used to joke around that I had huge Internet access to my visual cortex.

149
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.030
Well it turns out I've got a pretty big circuit there and that's probably in the

150
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:19.710
top 10% or so of on circuits.
And they um,
you know,

151
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.460
going from the frontal cortex all the way deep to the back of the visual cortex

152
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:26.880
where the graphics files are stored.
Now,

153
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.010
Walter Snyder,
the University of Pittsburgh as a new scanning technology,

154
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.280
which I'm sure some Asperger people had to develop the computer to enable this

155
00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:40.170
scanner to track white matter fibers.

156
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.420
So your brain's got the gray matter on the outside,

157
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.010
the inside of the brain's all white matter,
big long axons,

158
00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:48.750
the all the way across the brain that form cable bundles.

159
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.160
And this new technology can actually dissect out the cable bundles.

160
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.290
It can tell the difference between a bridge.

161
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.480
They cross each other or an intersection.

162
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.370
And that took a lot I computer power and they can fit it inside a box that

163
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:06.040
Walter can pick up,
you know?
And so I'm an associate of thinker,

164
00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:08.880
so I start thinking about that song and get eight great tomatoes.

165
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.800
And that anybody can,
that's an ancient old ad for tomato sauce.
Uh,

166
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:18.780
so that came up.
You can get lots of computing and an itty bitty box,
you know,

167
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.620
that's sort of how my mind works.
Okay,

168
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.850
now this is the cable bundle for speak.

169
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.220
What you see,
and it goes from the visual cortex up to the language area.

170
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.150
That's the normal one.
And that's mine.

171
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.250
And those branches you see,
you can see they've been truncated there on that,

172
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.920
on that rendering.
They actually go all of the brain.

173
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.630
So I basically have got a search engine like Google for images where you type in

174
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:52.590
keywords and I get lots of pictures and they are specific.

175
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.310
The thing I find so fascinating about search engines is they weren't just like

176
00:10:56.311 --> 00:11:00.060
how my mind works well,
who made it search engines?

177
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.670
Some people in a much more linear in their thinking.

178
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.270
I don't like the way the search engine works.
I liked the way it works just fine.

179
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.920
And one of the things I got to teach my students is yet got to use all the

180
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:14.880
different key words.
All right,
let's just take cattle for example.

181
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.830
There's bowls,
cows,
cattle,
bovines,
Cath,

182
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.330
uh,
calves.
You got to use all those different words.

183
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.870
That's really obvious to me and I find if you use all the different Warren's you

184
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:30.030
find a lot of papers you wouldn't find otherwise.

185
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.430
Now the price I paid for this circuit is I have less bandwidth for the speak

186
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:37.650
what you see,
so I had,
I had speech delay,

187
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.780
didn't talk until age four and I couldn't get my words out there.

188
00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:43.950
There's always a price.

189
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.820
This scanner was originally paid for by the Defense Department to look at

190
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:52.821
veterans hand injuries and if this had been an injured circuit would look like

191
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:56.920
dried spaghetti and like I broke about half of them.

192
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.460
I'll tell you the football players thaws and look very [inaudible].

193
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.450
Okay.
Now this is another scan is done at the University of Utah and presented

194
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.230
neuroscience meeting and the blue part is basically full of cerebral spinal

195
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:18.880
fluid.
It's full of water and you can see I've got a bay.
The asymmetry there,

196
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.420
I got visual thinking and my math department got trashed.

197
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.050
See where I think innate differences make the biggest difference is either real

198
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:33.310
deficit in something or an extreme ability and something,
yes,

199
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:34.540
there's brain plasticity,

200
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.210
but that's happening in the gray matter out on the edge.

201
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.350
Those big white fiber bundles,
I don't think he grows big axons back.

202
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:46.300
I mean that that long.
Okay.
You know,
Malcolm Gladwell says,

203
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:49.450
if you have enough practice and you have enough access to services,

204
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:52.390
anyone can learn anything.
Well,
back in 68,

205
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.140
Bill Gates and I had access to this exact same computer system.

206
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.390
I wanted to learn how to program.
It was just hopeless Algebra,

207
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.500
just hopeless.
Uh,
wanting to become an expert skier.

208
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.000
I could never keep them together.
I could get to the good intermediate stage.

209
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:14.020
I mean,
I could ski recreationally but get really good.
There were other kids,

210
00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:16.000
one winter they'd be experts

211
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.770
and I just couldn't do computer programming no matter how hard I tried.

212
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.750
I agree with Gladwell about the practice and of course the access to,
um,

213
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.790
you know,
they'll do the teacher you,
you have to develop abilities.

214
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.930
This is probably one of my most important slides,

215
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.140
the different kinds of mines slide.

216
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.200
I am a photo realistic visual thinker,
an object visualizer.

217
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.130
A lot of people in programming are a pattern visualizer,
a spatial visualizer.

218
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.320
See in your brain you have circuits for one is something that's me and then

219
00:13:56.411 --> 00:14:00.790
you've got circuits for,
whereas something and people that are super good at the,

220
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:05.070
whereas something instead of like located in space tend to not be so good at the

221
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.980
object.
Visualist affiliation and the visual son,

222
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.200
the pattern thinkers are also good off.
I'm good at math.

223
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.060
These kids often have trouble with reading.

224
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.030
I hear stories where I'm okay to have a handwriting problems.

225
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:18.550
They won't let them type on a laptop that's like just stupid.

226
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.230
Another thing that I hear that's really bad political correctness gone crazy is

227
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:28.231
you've got a fourth grader bored doing baby math and they make them do baby math

228
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:32.470
and they don't give them the more advanced book.
That's just ridiculous.

229
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.510
You can get into a situation where a kid may be gifted math but needs special ed

230
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:41.590
and reading.
Now I like to bust out of the silos.
You know,

231
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:45.370
everybody tends to get inside their own bucks.
Okay.
There's a tech box,

232
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.980
there's a farm and ranch box,

233
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.460
there's a gifted box and there's an autism blocks or ought or silos and I liked

234
00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:56.540
it.
I kind of like pick out my speaking engagements,

235
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:59.120
so I like to get a little mixture of all these different things.

236
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.270
I think as I'm seeing something that kind of disturbs me,

237
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.380
I go to an autism meeting and a geeky little 10 year old walks up to me,

238
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.650
a real smart little 10 year old and he's fixated on his autism

239
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.690
and sometimes they get kind of a handicap mentality and they're not learning

240
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:17.960
basic stuff like saying please and thank you.
You know,
learning,
just,
you know,

241
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.010
basic skills kind of get over protected.
Then I go to a gifted meeting.

242
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.920
The same little Geeky kid comes up to me,

243
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.010
but he wants to tell me about what he saw under the Brock Maggi scope,

244
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.770
which is a really cool little children's,
a microscope.

245
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.510
And then I go to place like this,
all full of undiagnosed,

246
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.340
a little bit on the spectrum.

247
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.220
Avoid the labels like the plague because I might hold you back now where the

248
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.690
were learning about autism going can really help.

249
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:51.020
Some of you guys here is in your relationships.

250
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.200
You don't need to go out and get diagnosed,

251
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:56.300
but just reading about it that can help you out.

252
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.900
And then I go over to the farm and ranch in the meat world and I go to this big

253
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:03.140
huge meat packing plant and this is old gray haired hippie.

254
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.430
And he runs the maintenance shop and he's out there playing with the giant Lego

255
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.610
sa putting up a new cooler.
They huge concrete lego's.

256
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:14.660
You use the crane to put them up and he's pure spectrum.

257
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.590
But he had welding in high school with a worst things they've done in the high

258
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:23.240
schools is taken out the hands on classes.
In fact,
at JPL,

259
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.360
they make all the metal parts of something like the Mars Lander.

260
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.980
They make them there and shops and they're having problems finding,
uh,
you know,

261
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.380
who's going to replace the machine.
You when they were tired.

262
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.230
Now a third kind of thinkers,
the verbal facts thinker,

263
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.830
they know everything about whatever their favorite subject is and our verbal

264
00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:42.080
thinker now,
so called normal people.

265
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.110
They are mixtures of these different kinds of thinking,

266
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.160
but I'm finding when you getting the autism programs,

267
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:52.310
there's an awful a smart kids that ought to get headed down a track towards

268
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:57.311
Google or JPL that the teachers and the schools are having a hard time shifting

269
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:01.280
gears,
how to deal with the nonverbal kids and then they got smart,

270
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:04.310
Geeky kids in that same class.
So really,

271
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:09.370
really big problem because I can think of kids I went to school with when I was

272
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:12.800
in college that I know are on the spectrum today,

273
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.640
but the problem that the parents of little kids have and the schools have,

274
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.720
in order to get service,
you have to have a label.
Now,

275
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.090
I don't think it hurts a kid when he's three to put a label on him to get speech

276
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:23.924
therapy,

277
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.650
but then you get the kid that's like 10 or 12 years old getting bullied in

278
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:30.290
school and he gets a label because he's getting bullied in school.

279
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.230
You know Steve Jobs is one of the kids who had,

280
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.000
well I had to take them on a lung school,

281
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.020
put them over in another school in Cupertino and unfortunately he had a,

282
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.100
he had a dad that had a machine shop.
That was another thing.

283
00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:46.400
It was his salvation.
He was doing hands on things.

284
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.300
Now I know that Steve may not be the best thing and he mentioning here,

285
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.800
but I only can talk about the dead ones where I have information I've gotten off

286
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.040
of publicly available things like books and Business Week magazine,

287
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.470
which I've read carefully now in the autistic brain book.

288
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.420
I now show evidence that these two kinds of visualizers actually do exist.

289
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.900
You know today the schools are all about evidence based.

290
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.760
Well Marie Colson Offs Work,
surfing the Internet,
three o'clock in the morning.

291
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:21.300
I found her stuff about the two kinds of visualizers.
This pet,

292
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.370
a brain scan study showed that these two kinds of visualizers exist.

293
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:30.240
I was so happy when I found this because I had just observed each things just on

294
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:32.550
my own and when I did my ted talk,

295
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:36.390
I hadn't found these references yet and they weren't there.
Very easy to find.

296
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.730
There's kind of a biased about innate ability.
No,
everyone's not.

297
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:44.070
The same is,
yes,
there's a lot of plasticity.

298
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.650
You got a lot of people here in the middle,
you know,

299
00:18:46.651 --> 00:18:49.110
you can get them pretty good at programming up to here or whatever,

300
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:51.780
but you probably won't get them to here and I can move back and forth in the

301
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:54.300
middle.
The gray matters got a lot of plasticity,

302
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.960
but then you've got the great big huge white matter cables willing to kind of

303
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:02.460
born with those things.
Okay.
There's two ways you can do the math.

304
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.010
You can do it the verbal way or you can do it the more visual spacial way on.

305
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:09.180
There's kids that can just do the math in their head.
The school says,
well,

306
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:13.230
you can't do that.
They don't get it that he thinks differently.
Well,

307
00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:14.640
I'm saying let him do it in his head,

308
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:19.050
but we will take some precautions against cheating.

309
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.260
So we're gonna put them in a room stripped of everything electronic,

310
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.360
and if ain't do it then just absolutely fine.

311
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.300
Now I just want to show you something.

312
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:32.301
It's definitely not my mind that praying Mantis as many out of a single sheet up

313
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.940
folded paper,
no cutting,
no tape,
and what you see in the background,

314
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.960
that is the folding pattern.
Paypal,

315
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:45.150
look at that and go,
well,

316
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.840
well there's no way I could start with a square piece of paper and make it into

317
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:51.660
a praying mantis.
That's not my mind.

318
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.560
And here are some great little origami stars that some kids gave me.

319
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.470
Now they need to be in the advanced math class.

320
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.820
Now my thing was art and when I was in elementary school,

321
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.630
my ability and art was always encouraged and I was encouraged to do lots of

322
00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:07.350
different things.

323
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.310
So it wasn't just done drawing the same horse head over and over again.

324
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.090
You got to take the things to fix that it on and broaden it out because you've

325
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:16.560
got to learn how to do stuff.

326
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:22.220
Other people are going to want always like to show my drawings off again and

327
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:27.450
here's a beautiful bridge that I'm Jesse Park Do.
She was kind of more moderate.

328
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.690
Well her favorite thing used to be electric blanket controls.

329
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.310
We had to get her off of that.

330
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.270
And while on the subject of bridges,

331
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.690
I think our governments are going crazy when you've got a governor and his aides

332
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.310
are deliberately creating traffic jams on a branch and one it looks just like

333
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:51.490
this.
This is absolutely ridiculous.

334
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.010
They're getting totally separated from reality,
you know,

335
00:20:57.011 --> 00:21:00.610
and we have great things going on with private industry document the space

336
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.001
station.

337
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:05.500
But instead we have stupid thing on the news this morning about government

338
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:10.180
officials messing up traffic on purpose on a bridge.
And some dumb thing about,

339
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.830
you know,
I think,
uh,
you know,
sports players getting scared by their own mascot.

340
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.173
I mean that,

341
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.310
that was on the news this morning when I was having breakfast.

342
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.120
Think there's more important things to have on the news than that and these

343
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:27.580
people as far as causing a traffic jam on a bridge.

344
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.760
That's the kind of mindset of about an eight year old.

345
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.180
It's also something that done,
uh,

346
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.510
I would've learned when I was eight years old that you don't do stuff like that

347
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:39.220
cause it.
Inconvenience is other people.

348
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.920
You don't do those kinds of things cause he wouldn't like it.

349
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.590
You are in that traffic jam.
It's just that simple.

350
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.420
There are some other gorgeous artwork made by a person that was kind of at the

351
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:52.570
mid level on the autism spectrum.
All right,

352
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.190
now I'm going to tell you math people,
why you need to have us,
our minds.

353
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.490
One of the things that really worries me,

354
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.060
uh,
with all the stem emphasis and we're going to have to have Algebra now.

355
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:10.660
How can I get to college Algebra and now I got through college because thank

356
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:15.661
goodness for the educational fads of 1967 and in 1967 the required math class

357
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:21.880
was finite math,
probability matrices and statistics.

358
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.330
Bit more visual,
tons of tutoring.
I managed to get through it.

359
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.370
What the engineering mind does need the art mind cause I've learned there's

360
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:34.300
certain things the engineering mind doesn't see now what's there.

361
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.080
I don't know if that came from,
I don't know where it's going to satellite image.

362
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:41.380
I don't know if it's the googles or not.
I did get that off the Internet.

363
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.710
I certainly wasn't going to fly over it and get my own picture of the Fukushima

364
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:45.640
nuclear power plant.

365
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.150
Not something you want to get very,
very near.
That's for sure.

366
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.500
Cause sometimes the most obvious is the least obvious.

367
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.350
So I was getting all these newspapers,

368
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:01.270
all this stuff and reading about it on a plane.
It's,

369
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:04.270
I find this stuff interesting and what I found out why this happened,
I'm going,

370
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.280
how could you do this?
I can't design a nuclear reactor.
There's no way.

371
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.710
But if I had been drawing the concrete work for the plant and doing my side

372
00:23:13.711 --> 00:23:17.310
elevation drawings,
there's no way I would've made the mistake they made.

373
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.260
All I have to know about a nuclear reactor is if the emergency pump fails to

374
00:23:22.261 --> 00:23:26.220
work after you've scrammed it.
See it doesn't quite get turned off all the way.

375
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.060
It burns up and you're in so much trouble.
You're not,
it's not funny.

376
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.000
That's all I have to know about it.
Well,
okay,

377
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.330
earthquake broke all the power lines and everything and there's no electric

378
00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:38.790
power to run the main stuff,
so they had to scrap it.

379
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.360
And what happened is the emergency generators that ran the emergency equipment,

380
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.450
we're in a non waterproof basement.

381
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.640
How could you make a mistake that basic.
Now when I was young,

382
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:54.620
I used to think well of stupidity.
No,

383
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.490
I found the mathematical mind doesn't see it.

384
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.230
I could see the water smashing out the baby blue movers and this plant was

385
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.600
painted baby blue of all colors.
A little clouds on the top of the boxes,

386
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.380
make it look innocent and pretty.
See those baby blue louvers.

387
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:12.740
We're going bust it out and two seconds later those big generators,

388
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.120
all electric panels underwater and it's not going to work.

389
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.720
There's no way I would've done that.
I mean,

390
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:22.950
I would've been going to every ship building company.

391
00:24:22.951 --> 00:24:25.460
There was a sidewalk catalogs,
volume,
waterproof doors.

392
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.270
I want to try out all your waterproof doors.
I want to find waterproof doors.

393
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:33.000
They're really easy to open,
don't have to have training open and close them.

394
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.970
Close really tight.
Obvious when they're closed and it wouldn't have happened.

395
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.190
This is why you really need all the different kinds of minds.
You know,

396
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:46.160
I've been thinking about a lot of other things too.
You see,

397
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:51.140
cause I can visualize ways that it can break,
you know,
especially anything,

398
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:55.910
you know,
mechanical sorta stuff.
Okay.
Okay.
Steve Jobs.

399
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:59.760
I went to college,
any audit,

400
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.000
a cleaner of the class,
which she didn't pay for it,

401
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.340
but it really influenced the computing and all the computers have nice fonts as

402
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:10.790
a result of that.
And he was an artist.

403
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.370
He developed the interface for the phones.
No one,

404
00:25:14.371 --> 00:25:17.360
I know there's a lot of bad blood going on,
but the lawsuits,

405
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.530
I read all about that.
Steve wanting to go thermal nuclear on android.

406
00:25:21.531 --> 00:25:24.860
I know all about that kind of stuff.
But again,

407
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:26.810
I can only talk about the dead ones.

408
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.820
So that's the reason why I have these slides.

409
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.900
But the point or the point I'm trying to get across is he wasn't an engineer.

410
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.510
This is where you need to have the art mind and the engineering minds working

411
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:41.990
together on projects.
They have complimentary skills.

412
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.120
Well there's a big debate right now that maybe a humanities programs are just

413
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:48.410
useless in colleges.

414
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.650
I was at a state about two years ago that we remain nameless,

415
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:55.010
but their governor said they wanted to charge extra tuition at the state

416
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:59.240
university for humanities classes and so on the chronicle of higher education,

417
00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:02.600
David Barish said that the connection between Steve Jobs and so called useless

418
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:06.470
humanities programs such as calligraphy cannot be ignored.

419
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.650
Now one thing about calligraphy is it's a hands on class.

420
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.980
You actually have to do it and there is a need for humanities.

421
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.780
I thought this was really interesting.
You want evidence based science,

422
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.360
the Premiere Journal that um,

423
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.620
you know when students read serious literary fiction helps them with some of

424
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:31.280
their social skills rather than this reading the latest Stephen King or

425
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:33.950
something like that where Michael Crighton,

426
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.420
I have to say those kind of books I like when I'm going to long airplane flight

427
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:41.450
and it's really boring.
Okay.

428
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.080
Some of the other work I've done with livestock was the look at the things that

429
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:49.080
they're scared of.
Okay.
They're going up but shooting strange place,

430
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:54.060
neat plant for example.
They were afraid of a lot of little things,
shadows,

431
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.990
reflections,
chains,
hanging down,
seeing people standing up ahead,

432
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.250
things that we tend to not notice.
And if you take those distractions out,

433
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.490
maybe change a light to get rid of a reflection,

434
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.370
add a light cause I don't like going to a dark hole.

435
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:09.820
<v 4>Okay.</v>

436
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.010
<v 1>Then they would move through the shoot more easily,</v>

437
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.840
especially when it was in a strange place.

438
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:18.760
Now how many people here noticed this animal is locked on to that Sunbeam like

439
00:27:18.761 --> 00:27:21.970
radar?
Raise your hand if you notice that.
Okay.

440
00:27:21.971 --> 00:27:25.430
We're doing pretty good here JPL.
A little bit better than here.

441
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.500
Well,
see that's purely the visual thinking sort of stuff.
Well,

442
00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:34.810
I know there's some people interested in animal issues,

443
00:27:34.811 --> 00:27:37.240
so I think we'll talk a little bit about some of the things I've done.

444
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.680
When I was young,
I used to think I could fix everything with equipment.

445
00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.190
If I could just build the right magic system,
everything will be perfect.

446
00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.100
When I found his equipment is only half the equation,

447
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.120
the other half is management and management wanting to do things.

448
00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:56.950
Right now I have a saying heat softens steel.

449
00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.240
Then people like me who want to reform things can now shape it and bend it into

450
00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:02.470
pretty grill work.

451
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.870
And when Mcdonald's back in 1997 decided they were going to um,

452
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.710
do something about bad stuff going on in slaughterhouses,

453
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.490
that resulted in a lot of change.
And it was my job to implement it.

454
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.370
And I came up with a very simple scoring system.

455
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.780
There was like traffic rules for slaughter houses and if you didn't follow

456
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.990
certain rules and make certain numbers,
you fail the Mcdonald's on it.

457
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.800
95% of the cattle dead on the first shot.
You fail the audit,

458
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.850
you've got to get them all dead before you hang them up on.

459
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.870
Only three animals are allowed.
The Moon Beller in the stunning area,

460
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.500
only 1% falling and if you want a real excellent score,

461
00:28:41.501 --> 00:28:45.910
only 5% and get hip to the electric pride if you want.
Excellent score,
simple,

462
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.490
very simple.
You see these are outcome measures.

463
00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.200
I'm not telling you how to build the plant.

464
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:55.330
They are very simple outcome measures and it worked because it was very

465
00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:57.430
objective and very,
very,
very simple.

466
00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.720
When big customers say that something's got to be changed and things are going

467
00:29:01.721 --> 00:29:02.021
to change,

468
00:29:02.021 --> 00:29:05.980
Walmart has just come out with a big statement that came out with two days ago

469
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.990
on I'd put video cameras and swine houses to make sure people aren't,
you know,

470
00:29:10.991 --> 00:29:14.740
beaten the pigs up with gate rods are throwing a peg let's or doing some other,

471
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.720
you know,
really nasty thing like that.

472
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.870
I'm sure you've all seen that show undercover boss.

473
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.940
I think that's a great show.

474
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.750
I saw those kinds of bosses eyes opened up moments when on took some of the

475
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:35.220
executives from some of the large on a hamburger restaurants on their first

476
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:38.010
trips to farms and slaughterhouses.
I remember the day,

477
00:29:38.011 --> 00:29:43.011
and this was back in 1999 or 1998 that time when one of the executive saw a half

478
00:29:43.751 --> 00:29:48.370
dead dairy cow go into the product,
boy that was a real undercover boss moment.

479
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:53.020
I'd like to do another show called undercover legislature.

480
00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.363
<v 2>Well,
let's,</v>

481
00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.593
<v 1>okay,
let's take it,</v>

482
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:04.630
take people that do things like deliberately cause traffic jams and we've got a

483
00:30:04.821 --> 00:30:08.080
real,
real special trailer set up for them.
Oh,

484
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:13.090
it's about 10 miles from the local Walmart and we're going to drop him off there

485
00:30:13.911 --> 00:30:16.340
and we'll just have his license and his wallet and that's all.

486
00:30:16.341 --> 00:30:19.940
There'll be a $50 debit card on the counter,
a Walmart Pan,

487
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.710
couple of beans on the shelf,
this much gas in the car.
Okay.

488
00:30:24.711 --> 00:30:26.450
You report to work tomorrow of Walmart.

489
00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:29.990
You're going to be there for two months and we've taken away your medical

490
00:30:29.991 --> 00:30:34.400
insurance card.
You know,
let's get them get a taste of,
um,

491
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:35.241
you know what?

492
00:30:35.241 --> 00:30:40.241
Some people are actually up against living in a total rarefied world.

493
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.253
<v 2>Okay.</v>

494
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.400
<v 1>Oh,
look at how the horse and a zebra put an ear on each other and then the other</v>

495
00:30:48.401 --> 00:30:52.000
ear is on me.
Watch animals are all,
it's all about details,

496
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.140
all about details.
Well,

497
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.640
there's what the entrance to them thought or plan it looks like.
In fact,

498
00:30:57.641 --> 00:30:59.170
I saw your great Google earth thing there.

499
00:30:59.171 --> 00:31:02.560
I think I'll go Google earth a few of my jobs and that's always fun.

500
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.660
I to show a slide to my students and I'll say,
okay,

501
00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:11.610
now tell me what I can improve here.
What is bad here?
Well,
one,

502
00:31:11.611 --> 00:31:15.910
one thing that's good is inside the tunnel I got white translucent plastic.

503
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.110
So they're not going into a dark hole.
But the bad thing is,

504
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.320
and I'd say about half my students don't notice it because you've got three

505
00:31:23.321 --> 00:31:25.810
people standing right where there should not be standing.

506
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.560
Then sometimes the most obvious is the least obvious.

507
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.440
Now there's evidence that in the normal human brain language covers up art and

508
00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:40.441
mathematics because of the type of Alzheimer's that when the language parts of

509
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:41.800
the brain get wrecked,

510
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.690
art comes out for about three or four years and one van Gogh was painting starry

511
00:31:46.691 --> 00:31:46.901
night.

512
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:50.330
I don't think he realized he was putting mathematics in it and there's gonna be

513
00:31:50.331 --> 00:31:55.180
a new book coming out on a guy who got in a bar fight,
got bashed on the head.

514
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.920
Now he's a mathematician.

515
00:31:56.921 --> 00:32:00.670
Studying physics sort of got to inner mathematician turned loose.

516
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.690
Now there's a lot of things and we don't know about the brain now.

517
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:06.940
An important thing dealing someone,

518
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.110
understanding someone thinks the way I do is I'm a bottom up thinker.

519
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.820
My approach to things,

520
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.550
that was my sound approach on developing equipment for livestock was a go around

521
00:32:16.551 --> 00:32:19.540
and look at all of the state of the art.
Okay,
you go download all,

522
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.060
you get all the patents.
When we couldn't download them,
when I was doing it,

523
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.240
we had a right to the patent office and get them.
I was a real pain.

524
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.660
But you get all the patents,
you get all the state of the art,

525
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.840
go around visiting all these places and try to get the good ideas,

526
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:38.050
chuck out the bad ideas.
In other words,
it's bottom up thinking relevant,

527
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.140
top down or today.
What's happening,
especially on government stuff,

528
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.200
too much top down,
very vague things.

529
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.520
But concepts are formed by specific examples,

530
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:54.380
not as a young child.
Cats and dogs.
Okay.
All the cat pictures on this file.

531
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:57.680
All the dog pictures and this flyer,
well I was very young,

532
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.750
I could sort cat some dogs by size until our next door neighbor's got a

533
00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.940
document.
Okay.

534
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:09.941
Now I can no longer use size as a visual criteria and for like cat versus stock.

535
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.940
So then I noticed they all had the same nose shape as they were dogs.

536
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.240
So that was all visual feature that every dog has got.

537
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.610
Everything is learned by specific example.

538
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.820
So how do I learn what being nice or being bad?
It no,

539
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.340
I mother would just correct me if I got say please.
Well say please.

540
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:32.090
That's nice behavior.
You wait politely.
Alliance,
the movie theater.

541
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.320
That's nice behavior.

542
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:34.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>

543
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.420
<v 1>You want to teach something like up or down,</v>

544
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.330
you got to use a lot of different examples.
They guys,

545
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.830
there's some kids with autism where if you say put thought in just goes in the

546
00:33:43.831 --> 00:33:44.664
garbage.

547
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.110
They need to learn that and it could be put thought in the drawer in the

548
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:50.670
cupboard in something else,

549
00:33:50.671 --> 00:33:54.780
not necessarily in the garbage can so up can walk up the stairs.

550
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:59.340
I looked it up a cup,
the plane flew up in the air.
Lots of different examples.

551
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.290
My thinking is associative.
Josh liked how a search engine works.

552
00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:05.980
<v 2>Okay,</v>

553
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:10.630
<v 1>salt.
I'm at the Chicago airport there quite often.
Okay,
I'll look at that.</v>

554
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.660
Now I can start looking through Google for images in my head,

555
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.680
a glass structure category,

556
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:19.240
start going through that or I could start off at an airport category.

557
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.030
There are no generalized pictures.
You know,

558
00:34:22.031 --> 00:34:25.540
this was something that when I was kind of really a breakthrough in my thinking

559
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:29.560
when I did the church steeple as my question rather than house or car,

560
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.720
something that people weren't quite so familiar with.
Okay.
Glass structure,

561
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.960
biosphere and Arizona.
Crystal Palace,

562
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.670
greenhouse at Colorado state.
Now when I'm on this subject,

563
00:34:42.671 --> 00:34:45.310
I now I'm seeing our building.
It's now under construction.

564
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:50.560
Now I'm seeing other buildings that were under construction and the contractors

565
00:34:50.561 --> 00:34:54.700
used up 25 are super valuable parking spaces for their trade worse.

566
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:59.980
Okay,
so that's how I got from glass structures to contractor trailers.

567
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.740
Real sore point with me.
I wasn't home when they did that.

568
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.590
I think I would have told I would have walked out there like I owned the place,

569
00:35:05.591 --> 00:35:06.790
told him move the trailers.

570
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.910
But once they got established then you're just stuck with it.

571
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.510
Did they ask permission to put those trailers there?
I'm sure they did not.

572
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.050
Okay.
Airport category.

573
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.980
Now when you think about really big amounts of money,

574
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:26.110
let's start thinking about it in something a public and understand this is more

575
00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:30.280
$5 billion and a building a new light rail on new west and I got to get the

576
00:35:30.281 --> 00:35:33.490
price for that cause that's gonna be quite a lot more than $5 billion.

577
00:35:33.491 --> 00:35:37.090
When that's done well we start thinking about some of these big amounts of
money.

578
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.660
It's something real like airport units.

579
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.920
Then people if kind of really put it in perspective.

580
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:49.710
So all you've got Denver Airport,
Dallas,
Fort Worth,
Minneapolis,
Atlanta,

581
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.890
and he got the old dungy,
old terminal.

582
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:57.900
They look worn yet and I'd be fun to explore that place.

583
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.940
And when I asked an astro physicist about the church steeples he saw motion of

584
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:06.570
people singing and praying.
We go,
oh wow.
Trippy.

585
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.180
That is definitely not my mind.

586
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.780
Now we'll make a category if they get used to being handled by a man on a horse,

587
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.710
they've learned that safe the first time they see the man on the ground.

588
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.710
That panic.
You see it's different.
It's a different picture.

589
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.670
I've learned man on the horse of safe man on grounds,
new and scary.

590
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.510
I can also learn that man on the ground is safe,

591
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:35.130
but that's something totally knows he most people wouldn't think the man on the

592
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:36.210
ground was something novel.

593
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:41.700
Now I find when you're trying to categorize problems and a lot of people have

594
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:44.070
trouble categorizing,
where's a problem coming from?

595
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.380
Okay if I got something wrong in a factory,

596
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:51.240
is there something wrong with the equipment or something wrong with how people

597
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:53.340
are operating that equipment?

598
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.910
I find people often don't make that differentiation.

599
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.910
If it's an equipment problem is just a glitch.
Of course,

600
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:01.740
if it's a meat plant and have done a lot of work with them,

601
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.610
she stopped trolley or fundamental design problem.

602
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.470
They don't make that differentiation.
I've got a problem with a kid in school.

603
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.510
Does he have a biological problem?

604
00:37:12.511 --> 00:37:16.920
Like maybe your tummy hurts so much that he can't pay attention in school or is

605
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:20.460
he just,
I'm not wanting to do the work,
you know,
it's just strictly behavior.

606
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.300
Top down thinkers tend to over generalize,

607
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.070
especially when there aren't,
when they're not doing practical things anymore.

608
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.140
Well,
I got this out of,
um,
out of,
uh,

609
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.500
one of the tech magazines about dog fooding.
You know,

610
00:37:37.501 --> 00:37:40.800
you've got to use the stuff that you make then,
you know,

611
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:43.620
really find out if it actually works.

612
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:47.910
Policy makers need to be directly experienced the consequences of their
policies.

613
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.930
And if you want to mess up traffic cause a traffic jam than you need to be stuck

614
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:53.430
in the middle of the worst traffic jam.

615
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.470
Well there the guys up at JPL and was very cool to get to meet them,

616
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:05.220
you know,
uh,
no.
Kind of unconventional.
It's okay to be eccentric.

617
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.990
That's okay.
One of the most creative people are really,
really accentuate.

618
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.770
Then doing marvelous things and then talking to the public.

619
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.780
We need to tell the public,
well,

620
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.110
what are some of the spinoffs from maybe some of the JPL stuff?

621
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.780
Not stuff from the 60s that's ancient history.

622
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.990
Let's look at inventions in the last 10 or 15 years.

623
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.260
How about the active Pixel Center?
The Ha the sensor.

624
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:33.090
That's the heart of the cell phone camera.
How about coding?
That's involved.

625
00:38:33.091 --> 00:38:35.860
That will help one cell phone tower.
The phone to work.

626
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:40.030
One cell phone tower to another cell phone tower.
How about a mass spectrometer?

627
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.740
That's big.
Yeah,
we have a mass spectrometer the size of a giant desk.

628
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.700
Well you can put a sample in that and we'll tell you what chemicals on it.

629
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.670
Well that would have a lot of really good useful uses.

630
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.990
Now I was more interested in looking at pictures of things and pictures of

631
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:56.590
people,

632
00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:00.190
but we knew people interested in things cause a social yackety yack and aren't

633
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:02.830
going to solve some of the energy problems and stuff like that.

634
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.130
Let's help some of the kids that are different.

635
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.330
I don't care if they're labeled gifted,
they're labeled quirky,

636
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.990
weird nerds or mild autism.

637
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.560
One thing you've got to do with these kids when they're young is you got to

638
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:19.990
stretch.
I'm just outside of their comfort zone.

639
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.680
And the other thing is we need to be learning job skills that needs to start at

640
00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:29.050
age 12 we need to find paper route substitutes.

641
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.620
Things like walking dogs for the neighbors.
Things like maybe you know,

642
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:35.410
setting up chairs at the community center.
Something like that.

643
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.220
One place where all my teachers and everybody drew a line.

644
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.280
I wasn't allowed to become recluse in my,
in,
in my room.

645
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.410
That was absolutely not allowed.
I had to get out and do things.

646
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.350
Kids aren't doing free play,
which teaches valuable social skills.
You know,

647
00:39:53.351 --> 00:39:56.710
dogs need to do this too when they're young because if dogs don't do this when

648
00:39:56.711 --> 00:39:57.544
they're young,

649
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.330
then I fight and the dog's really efficiently has never learned how to get
along.

650
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.640
Taking out the hands on classes is the worst thing to schools ever did.

651
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:11.200
They took out cooking,
sewing,
woodworking,
machine shop,
welding.

652
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.140
We have a shortage of skilled trades.
I mean,

653
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:18.250
JPL needs people to make the wheels and stuff for the Mars lander or there's

654
00:40:18.251 --> 00:40:23.251
something really cool and really geeky about the wheels of curiosity.

655
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.420
We don't just let you figure it out.

656
00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:27.940
I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you or not,
but it's so,

657
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.510
it's so geeky and anti suit.
It's just really,
really cool.
Um,

658
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:37.780
but they need to have those machinists,
you know,

659
00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:39.190
it's not going to work without them.

660
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:44.950
The other thing that's bad about taking out hands on classes is we are losing

661
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:49.900
resourceful problem solving.
Even something as simple as,
you know,
with cooking,

662
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.300
you're missing an ingredient.
Can you do it with another ingredient?

663
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:54.580
Of course in the fifties girls were taught sewing,

664
00:40:54.581 --> 00:40:59.050
so I had a wonderful toy sewing machine was in fourth grade and I remember one

665
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.870
project where I cut the fabric wrong on a ruin it,
you know,

666
00:41:01.871 --> 00:41:03.070
it was like gotten a rush.

667
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.160
Some of the things you learned from doing hands on things.

668
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:08.230
This is the stuff that saved me.

669
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:13.000
These were things that were refugees away from teasing kids that did the
teasing.

670
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:16.300
We're not interested in woodworking or incident riding horses.

671
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:21.750
I was also an sts model rocketer now I loved model rockets and I was in the

672
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:26.710
model rocket club and I was horrified to go on the Estos website about a month

673
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:30.580
ago and you can buy a ready made rocket.
That is disgusting.

674
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.640
The point is the bull bummer.

675
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.130
I made a few or points with the other kids when I made a rocket.

676
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.600
They look like our headmaster.

677
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:46.601
I'm mister paty rocket and he was aerodynamically stable on a flute

678
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.420
on.
I didn't do very much studying,

679
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:53.540
but I was in a special boarding school for gifted kids with a lot of emotional

680
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:58.230
problems and instead of studying I was remodeling our ski Towle house.

681
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:02.990
What the headmaster letting me do that cause I was learning work skills and a

682
00:42:02.991 --> 00:42:05.360
lot of these kids are not learning work skills.

683
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.400
I cleaned a lot of horse stalls to an oss 15 lots and lots of them and I was

684
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:14.060
responsible for the Horse Barn and making sure it always close the feed box.

685
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.480
Got To always close the grain box.
The guy's horse dies.

686
00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:20.270
If it eats out of the grain box,
you've got to close it.

687
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:24.840
I think we need to limit screen time.
Little kids.
I,

688
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.550
the thing that I'm finding with electronics and really little kids is yeah,

689
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:30.080
a little kids want to play with electronics,

690
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.680
but we need to get that teacher in there and get them taking turns.

691
00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:37.820
These kids are got to learn how to take turns.
Well,

692
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.860
I think we need to start making connections,

693
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:44.890
physical connections between the virtual world in the real world and one really

694
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:47.450
enterprising mom.
She went to the lumber yard,

695
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:51.470
got some two by fours cut up and then she brought them all home to the driveway

696
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:55.720
and had the kids paint them to make Minecraft blocks in the dry fly.

697
00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.150
Although words linking the online world to the real world.

698
00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.400
Then our kid had rural autistic kid,

699
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:04.430
had lots of friends coming over to play with the Minecraft blocks,

700
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.310
activities with animals,

701
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.100
get kids involved in activities they can do with other kids.

702
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.470
Four H FFA robotics clubs,

703
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.060
makerbot three d printing clubs,
get them involved in these things.

704
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.750
My ability and art was always encouraged.

705
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:24.650
We need to be working on building up the area of strength.

706
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:29.510
You know,
the kid gets good at math and let them do more advanced classes.

707
00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.590
Use fixations to motivate great online sources.

708
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:35.960
Now I was reading that on you,

709
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:39.890
Udacity or some of these things like this that only like 4% of the people took

710
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:40.880
the entire class.

711
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.710
I don't consider that a failure because there's an awful lot of people that

712
00:43:45.711 --> 00:43:49.010
might want to just look at some programming stuff and just take a couple of

713
00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:50.960
lessons to learn something and needed for work.

714
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.860
Because back when I was doing hydraulic stuff all the time,

715
00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.320
I had all these books for hydraulics.

716
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.320
I didn't need Algebra because I had all these tables for things like fluid flow,

717
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.440
look it up on tables and I,

718
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.170
when I first started out I took the first book and I did read the first book

719
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.160
pretty well,
but I didn't read all the books.
I use them as reference books.

720
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.190
I think the thing they need to look at is how many of those people that went on

721
00:44:13.191 --> 00:44:17.540
you.
Udacity took a few lessons as a reference and it helped them in their work.

722
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:23.360
I think that's something that needs to be looked at.
But I show this to um,
uh,

723
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.751
you know,

724
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:27.170
a lot of parents that they don't realize there's a lot of free stuff out there

725
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.890
and we got to do something about rural Internet access is beyond awful.

726
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.320
You cannot play videos and you go out in the rural areas,

727
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:38.130
you still got the mom and pop DVD stores because they don't have movies on the

728
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:42.210
was.
It's just that simple.
It is atrocious.
Well,

729
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.120
there's the optical illusion room.
Well,

730
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:47.940
I got fixated on that and the movies did a nice job of showing me,
making it,

731
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:52.470
and there's one of my designs in sketch up.
I know you don't own it anymore,

732
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.280
but it's a great,
I've seen some really great things going on.

733
00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:00.570
Teenage kids doing sketchup and then they're printing their stuff out with three

734
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:01.860
d printers.
Really,

735
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:06.861
really cool stuff and I really liked this warning they had on the makerbot

736
00:45:07.141 --> 00:45:10.020
website.
You need patients.
Yeah.

737
00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.350
Let's kind of fiddly little machine and get mad at it if you're going to break

738
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:16.260
it.
No.
How in a sense of adventure required.

739
00:45:16.261 --> 00:45:20.400
I really liked that thing they wrote on the website.
Yeah,

740
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:23.190
you don't design it right.
Your little thing's going to collapse some goo.

741
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.560
You know,
you're getting back to the real world.

742
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.640
The other thing on something like this,
people say,
well,
they can't afford that.

743
00:45:29.641 --> 00:45:33.540
Okay.
It's $1,500.
$2,000 little,
the money's getting spent on sports.

744
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.080
That's the price of one major league football uniform.

745
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.050
All it costs maybe two high school uniforms.

746
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.890
It's not very much money.
I don't want to hear that.

747
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.310
And all that's just kind of neat little thing they made.

748
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.580
And this is some views through the Brock,
Maggi sculptor.

749
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:54.840
Great little really durable little child's microscopes.
$150,

750
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.920
no fiddly mirror.
Uh,
very easy for kids to use.

751
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:03.690
We don't have a glass slide and I was so happy to go to the gifted conference.

752
00:46:03.691 --> 00:46:04.890
It wasn't the autism conference.

753
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.040
I wish this has been at the autism conference cause it's a gifted conference.

754
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:12.960
They had a hotel room about the size of this and all these kids that they put

755
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:15.680
the electronics away and they were playing with the Brock magic scope and they

756
00:46:15.681 --> 00:46:19.140
have looking at pond scum and leaves and it's really cool.

757
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.020
Well just got to show people,

758
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:24.450
I mean you guys know about this stuff that's on the Internet,

759
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:28.590
but I do a lot of talks and a lot of places and I just want to give people ideas

760
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:32.070
of cool things that are out there.
Uh,

761
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:36.870
there's some evidence that kids are learning to write,

762
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.310
but it's going to help them on reading,
on learning,
reading.

763
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.700
Maybe you turn off all the bells and whistles and use the plain ebook,

764
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.600
maybe just with still pictures and you haven't read it and they're learning a

765
00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:52.410
story better.
And again,
this is refereed scientific stuff.

766
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.940
We're going evidence based here.

767
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.750
Well people need to touch to perceive not a really good time over at picks her.

768
00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:59.161
They finally,

769
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:03.810
sometimes they got to get them off the computers and get them actually drawing.

770
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.950
And when they print their figurines out on their three d printer,

771
00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.940
they put them around the computer mouse where they can touch them.

772
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.150
Got To touch to see.
Got It.

773
00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:16.410
Do that science teacher boy.
And he helped me out.

774
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.330
Well he was a NASA space scientist.
Was He accredited teacher?
No,
no.

775
00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:22.830
Stupid ed courses for him.

776
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.300
We got to get back to doing real things in this country.

777
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.170
That's all we got to do.

778
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:38.620
One thing a lot of employers want the new one.
I won won today.
As you know,

779
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:42.970
students know how to work.
It just came up with a lot of things.

780
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.720
I learned to sell my work,
not myself.

781
00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.570
Also in working with some of the people that are different,

782
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.720
you don't take that employee and go,
well,
just develop some new software.

783
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:53.411
You want to say,
okay,

784
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:56.920
I want to make an app for the android phone and it does this specific thing.

785
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:59.560
It uses this language,
this memory.
You don't tell him how to do it,

786
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.910
but it's got certain parameters.
Then okay,

787
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.090
that's easy to do and when mistakes are made,

788
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.010
the boss needs just pull them aside and say,
bull in the office quietly,

789
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:13.170
no yelling and screaming,
and he said,
well,

790
00:48:13.171 --> 00:48:16.840
we know what the project meeting last week and you call Jim and jerk in front of

791
00:48:16.841 --> 00:48:20.710
the other five colleagues.
That's not the Google way of doing things.

792
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.280
Just don't do that and I learned on you can get some people that will sabotage a

793
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:31.750
project due jealousy.
That was very,
very difficult for me to deal with.

794
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.510
And then you get other people where they just think differently,

795
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.620
you know like that kind of differentiate between the two.

796
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.690
Well if I was in in a plant,

797
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:44.170
one of my meat plant projects in a plant engineers sitting like this,

798
00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.850
I was hired by the manager,

799
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.490
you didn't like this weird geek coming in on his turf.

800
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:53.170
I would kind of pull them into the project and that oftentimes stopped that.

801
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.300
Okay,
tour guide,
great job for 12 year olds.
You don't,

802
00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.450
you going to demonstrate the correct distance to get from the visitor,

803
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.720
demonstrate the correct greeting and so it's like coaching somebody in a foreign

804
00:49:04.721 --> 00:49:08.710
country
and there's sensory issues.

805
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:11.170
Some people just can't stand a lot of noise,

806
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:15.580
can't stand 60 cycle fluorescent lights and you had a lot of sensory issues and

807
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:18.760
they can vary from being very mild to being very severe.

808
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.540
This needs to be researched and how to treat some of these problems.

809
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.320
When I was a little kid loud.
Sounds hurt my ears.

810
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.950
I still absolutely hate the vacuum toilets and airplanes.

811
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.290
If I'd had to deal with those when I was five,

812
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.430
I would have been shrubby sucked out of the airplane.
Well,

813
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:40.000
I visual thinking mind went wild when I was like six years old and they'll

814
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:43.790
remodeling our house.
They had this big circular saw and I saw him.

815
00:49:43.791 --> 00:49:47.100
I was afraid that maybe it's blade come up to the floor if my room just like

816
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:51.780
ludicrous,
but when you maybe six years old,
it wasn't quite so ludicrous.
I,

817
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.640
I had trouble hearing hard consonant sounds,

818
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:59.020
so my speech teacher slow down and annunciated the hard constants.

819
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:03.850
She'd say cup and then she say capa slow down and annunciate it.

820
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:07.510
So then I could hear it.
Tension shifting.

821
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:12.460
Some of this is I have problems with it.
Somebody said puts some rings,

822
00:50:12.461 --> 00:50:16.150
a cell phone off I orient takes me much longer to shift back.

823
00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:21.310
Tension shifting slowness.
Some people when they go to read the print,

824
00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:22.360
we'll jiggle on the page.

825
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:27.250
That's probably about 10% of students that are having some trouble in college.

826
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.890
Doesn't explain all autism.
It doesn't define all dyslexia,

827
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.550
but there's something wrong with the circuits back here.
Shape,
color,
motion,

828
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:37.310
texture.
They're not merging together.
Right.

829
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:42.470
And sometimes it can be fixed on a very simple thing like Pale pink glasses,

830
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:44.780
pale lavender glasses,
different.

831
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.660
Partly your work on some different colored papers.

832
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:52.490
Maybe try different background on colors on the computer screen,
different fonts.

833
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.760
Now wouldn't it be stupid to lose her job or flunk out of school?

834
00:50:55.761 --> 00:51:00.230
Do you didn't do this?
I'm finding one out of 50 Scott.

835
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.220
This problem with my livestock handling class because they do really horrible on

836
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:08.030
my drawing assignment.
They cannot draw.
I say draw this.

837
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:09.430
<v 2>Okay,</v>

838
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:14.250
<v 1>they're drawing.
That's what the draw.
They don't say it.
Well there's my head.</v>

839
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.570
Well that's all the white matter or that side inside the uh,

840
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:24.060
on the gray matter.
This is not lining up right.
Something got changed here.
I,

841
00:51:24.061 --> 00:51:27.700
there should be a little space there for the gray matter.

842
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.940
What's said something got out of sync there on that.

843
00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.810
And that's all the circuits.

844
00:51:34.811 --> 00:51:38.200
And also you can ask is that as a cable bundles that are the Inter office

845
00:51:38.201 --> 00:51:42.000
communication,
that's where you have differences in developmental problem.

846
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.330
Well,
my fear center was bigger than world know.
It was well,

847
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:49.790
that's controlled now with antidepressant medication.

848
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:54.990
Little protrack lost visual thinkers,
panic monsters.
Um,

849
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.040
I know a lot of visual thinkers.
We're a little dab of PROZAC in the morning.

850
00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:03.230
I'll Lexapro Zoloft on stops the anxiety,

851
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:06.200
then you're not getting whacked out on drugs and alcohol.

852
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:11.630
Cerebellum smaller.
So I've got really bad balance,
you know,

853
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:13.790
simple accommodations in the workplace.

854
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:16.970
Some people like got to get away from the 60 cycle fluorescent lights.

855
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.880
They get quiet place to work,
open office plan,

856
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.390
and I got to do serious writing.
Doesn't work.

857
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:27.680
The other thing that doesn't work,
if people are kind of on the autism spectrum,

858
00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:31.970
it's a sudden change in work routine.
They come into work and they just go,
okay,

859
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.390
we're yanking out all the office cubicles today and we're going to move them.

860
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:39.170
Okay.
If we're going to do that,
let's have some warning,

861
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.330
maybe a week at least a warning.

862
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.840
And I still can't tolerate scratchy call scratch close.

863
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:48.890
Just a horrible like sand paper.
Some cotton itches,

864
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.610
other cotton doesn't itch.
Now the thing is,

865
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.950
it's okay for Geeks to cry when the space shuttle that shutdown,

866
00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:01.820
there were a lot of people crying on 60 minutes and I got thrown out of the

867
00:53:01.821 --> 00:53:06.821
large girl's school for throwing a book at a girl teased me and what I want to

868
00:53:07.071 --> 00:53:10.640
boarding school,
I got in fist fight in the cafeteria after guy.

869
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:14.990
He called me some names and they took horseback riding away for two weeks.

870
00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:18.830
I still had to clean the barn,
but no horseback riding.
Um,

871
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.240
some always switched to crying.
It's okay for Geeks to cry.
That's perfectly okay.

872
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.140
And I would go and hide the electrical room because the tech companies don't

873
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:32.770
tolerate any violence.
Um,

874
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:38.420
I have to say that I made me shuffled to look in the clean room at JPL and

875
00:53:38.601 --> 00:53:41.850
here's this big giant craftsman tool chest there.

876
00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.210
The thank that bolts on the Mars lander.

877
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:48.390
What tightened to buy a tool kept in a craftsman tool chest,

878
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:53.250
but you better not throw that tool and why is it's by by job.
It's that simple.

879
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.160
It takes a village to raise a child.

880
00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:02.310
We got to figure out how we can all work together to make things work because

881
00:54:03.071 --> 00:54:05.830
I'm seeing too many smart kids going down the wrong road.

882
00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:09.370
You don't like go to the gifted meeting.
He's going down one road.

883
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:11.860
I go to the autism meeting and,

884
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.060
and you've got one situation where a kid did ought to be headed for Google is

885
00:54:16.061 --> 00:54:18.010
putting a class with kids that don't talk.

886
00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:21.370
Then I go to another school system and he's headed in the right direction really

887
00:54:21.371 --> 00:54:23.560
beautifully.
It's very,
very,
very variable.

888
00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:29.290
What these two silos don't talk because if I look at the book table for the

889
00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:31.120
gifted meeting and the autism meeting,

890
00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.750
there might be a 5% overlap in the books.

891
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.860
That should be more like a 25% overlap in the books.

892
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.800
They are not talking to each other.

893
00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:45.040
We got to get people to gather you all.
As I say,

894
00:54:45.041 --> 00:54:48.640
one deek goes to Google on Silicon Valley,
maybe JPL,

895
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:54.010
there's another good dig the goes to Hollywood and that stuff and unfortunately

896
00:54:54.011 --> 00:54:55.040
there's a brilliant cake dead.

897
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.420
So I go into the basement and play video games for 10 hours a day and he gets

898
00:54:58.421 --> 00:55:03.130
social security for it.
That's not where I want him going.

899
00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.510
No,
we've got to like reach out and get to these kids and you know what?

900
00:55:07.511 --> 00:55:09.010
We've got to hook them in middle school.

901
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.080
Middle School is where we got to hook them

902
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.210
and some states now I'll put the skilled trades back in.

903
00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:21.370
Okay.
I think that kind of on finishes up what I have to say,

904
00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.600
but I got time for questions.
Always like to do some questions.

905
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:31.010
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

906
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.770
<v 5>I'm curious,
uh,
over the course of your career,</v>

907
00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.800
you've shared a lot of the insights you had about the experience of animals and

908
00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:42.723
slaughterhouses.

909
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.460
I'm curious about what kinds of things you learned over your career.

910
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.340
Like where maybe you can look back on some of your earlier where I can see like,

911
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.740
oh,
this is what I understand so much more deeply now.
Yeah.

912
00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.490
<v 1>Well,
there's a lot of things.
I mean,
one thing when I,</v>

913
00:55:54.491 --> 00:55:58.210
in the 70s my first professional group was the American Society of agricultural

914
00:55:58.211 --> 00:56:00.520
engineering.
I thought I could fix the world with engineering.

915
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.090
I absolutely believe that everything can be fixed with engineering.

916
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:08.500
I now realize only half of it can be fixed with engineering,

917
00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:13.270
and I had a major equipment failure,
which was a real epiphany.

918
00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:18.460
I was hired by a company in 1982 on the old slaughter plants,

919
00:56:18.461 --> 00:56:19.151
saw the pigs,

920
00:56:19.151 --> 00:56:23.350
had to walk up to the third floor and a real old plants and they wanted to build

921
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:25.180
a conveyor system to put in the floor of the shoot,

922
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:30.010
takes pigs up this ramp and my office and all design that.

923
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:31.151
Well,

924
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:35.590
the problem is it flipped all the pigs over backwards and it did not work and we

925
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:38.890
had to tear it out.
But then I started realizing,
no,

926
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:42.970
why are some pigs not capable of walking up this ramp?

927
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:44.441
Well,

928
00:56:44.441 --> 00:56:48.850
I start getting the ID numbers off of the different pigs and I found out that

929
00:56:48.851 --> 00:56:49.990
all pigs,
they had a problem,

930
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:53.970
came from one farm and they had a genetic problem called Spratto,

931
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:56.380
like where the hips are very right week.

932
00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:02.020
What I should've done by trying to make it conveyor that was treating a symptom

933
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:02.854
of a problem,

934
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:07.780
we should have gone back to the source for fraction of the cost of this mess

935
00:57:07.781 --> 00:57:11.080
that we had.
We could've bought that farm new bores,

936
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.150
like five or six new bores,

937
00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:17.030
all would have taken just a few thousand dollars hey on died,

938
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:18.820
gotten rid of that genetic problem.
What assaulted.

939
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.680
One thing I learned from that is you've got to treat the problem at its source

940
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.740
rather than treating a symptom of a problem.
Now,

941
00:57:26.741 --> 00:57:30.430
I want a lot of six months of depression over that.
That was not fun,

942
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.190
but I learned a really important lesson from that.

943
00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.313
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

944
00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:38.330
<v 1>We're out of time now,</v>

945
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:41.900
so please everybody join me in thanking Temple Grandin for coming to door

946
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:47.020
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

947
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:04.550
Okay.
