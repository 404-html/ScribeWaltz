1
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.061
Well,

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.840
thanks for coming in your lunch off for what I'm going to say isn't going to

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.830
give you indigestion.
Okay.
Um,
let's see.
Um,

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.300
well I've written about the suffragettes in the past.
Um,

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.360
and I'd always concentrated on what they did in terms of their militancy.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.870
Remember,
these are the women who fought for the vote in a very insistent,

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.240
outrageous,
provocative,
direct action kind of way.

8
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.730
Um,
so I talked about that campaign,

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.960
which really started with shouting at meetings,
interrupting politicians,

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.610
what right through to burning down churches and attacking works of art over a

11
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.460
period of about eight years.
So it's,

12
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.320
it was very controversial and deeply unpopular.
So I'd written about that.

13
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.120
It also written about how modern they were,

14
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.860
how they invented political merchandising and marketing and branding.

15
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.550
The brand to that campaign really beautifully more about that in a moment.

16
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:04.530
Had a color scheme of purple,
white and green.

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.910
And they branded and merchandise their slogan votes women in all sorts of

18
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.180
different ways.
So I found that very kind of sexy and exciting.

19
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.320
And then I got to thinking about,
well,
who were these amazing women?
I mean,

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.150
what kind of person would do that would make that journey would become a

21
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:25.470
suffragette because make no mistake,
it was the most unpopular campaign,

22
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.180
political campaign of the 20th century.
Um,

23
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.910
it was a coming out moment for anybody who said,
uh,

24
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.450
by team in terms of conversation or by wearing a badge that they were

25
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:41.451
suffragettes because there was so detested and so losed I mean all they wanted

26
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:44.010
was the vote,
but the,
the,

27
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.030
the frontier of them you're asking me for it nicely but demanding it

28
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.100
outrageously and noisily and cheekily and violently was something that people

29
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:57.210
just couldn't stomach.
Um,
so I was interested in,
in,
uh,
who,
who they were,

30
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.410
where they came from,
what their biographies or what their backstories are,

31
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.070
what that pre history is.

32
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.980
And I was interested in their mums and dads and their siblings,

33
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:05.880
their brothers and sisters,

34
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:10.500
the neighbors and family groups because you have to have your family on your

35
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.120
side if this was going to work and your family have to be quite extraordinary to

36
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:18.720
buck year because they're going to get a lot of flack from neighbors and

37
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.940
colleagues and family members.

38
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.810
If you support your daughter embarking on this kind of campaign.

39
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:29.220
So I was really interested to get kind of the backstories on them.
Of course,

40
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.490
I'm the lucky suffragettes if you like,

41
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:36.960
who possessed and they have a long suffragette career are extremely fortunate.

42
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.880
They've got supportive hospitals and files,
etc. Which are some women who found,

43
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.150
found out that their fathers and families,
we're not going to support it.

44
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.020
You know,
they,

45
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.890
they had some very tough choices that either sort of shut up and stop it or they

46
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:53.850
leave home.
They thrown out,
they call start there,
disinherited that is uh,

47
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.160
in many of them had that experience.

48
00:02:56.161 --> 00:03:01.161
So marriages rocked and ended and some engagements broken off.

49
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.920
Quite a lot of women involved in the campaign were lost their jobs and in one of

50
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:09.790
their papers called [inaudible],

51
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.920
there's a regular feature where suffragettes or writing in asking in situ in the

52
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.921
situations wanted column and the classified ads section explain they need a job

53
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.880
because they've been dismissed from their post.

54
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.860
And you could be dismissed for even having a suffragette leaflet on your desk.

55
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.620
Not,
they've been spotted smashing a window or anything like that.

56
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:31.510
It was just the fact that you were interested,

57
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.010
you'd been to a meeting was enough to get you dismissed with mostly pretty

58
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:36.970
disastrous results.

59
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.330
So I was fascinated in the strength of character and the strength of a family

60
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.860
unit that can do this kind of behavior.
I was also interested in diversity.

61
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.490
I was interested in all kinds of women who are getting involved in this.

62
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:51.030
So I did kind of a lot of digging away at that kind of story.

63
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.380
I found some great examples of diversity.

64
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.420
I was interested in it being a regional,

65
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:59.200
at looking at the regions rather and understanding how nationwide it was,

66
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.470
which it was.
They had branches all over the country quite quickly.
Um,

67
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.570
in Scotland and Ireland in Wales and all of the United Kingdom,
all over England.

68
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.690
So that was a measure of its success and organization.

69
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.710
And they even had shops selling their merchandise,
suffragette shops,

70
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:18.040
selling paper,
white and green stuff all over the country.

71
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.770
So that I thought was pretty,
pretty sexy too.

72
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.580
And I was interested in working class movement because they've been very much

73
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.140
marginalized in this story.
There.

74
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.280
It was often said that the middle of the suffragettes were just middleclass

75
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.850
hobbyist.

76
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.220
They weren't interested in working class room and nothing could be further from

77
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.790
the truth.
So lots of things to go and look for.

78
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.160
And to weave into this story.

79
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.130
Well I have to talk about the ladies on the screen.

80
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.270
First of all by saying these are undoubtedly the stars of the campaign.
Um,

81
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.600
on the far on the far left is Sylvia Pancoast who's an artist and designer.

82
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.930
She gives the WSP the military campaign,
the look,

83
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.720
she designs exhibitions,
designs,
logos.

84
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.500
She is responsible for the branded look of the Wsp you,
uh,

85
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.200
sisters in next to her.
The next image along she is,
uh,

86
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.910
she has a first class degree in law,
but because she's a woman,

87
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.440
you couldn't be a lawyer then,
which was irksome to say the least.

88
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.740
So she gave her a great strategic thinking and logic and planning skills into

89
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:24.790
the campaign.
And she was their big thinker really.
And Mrs Pancoast,

90
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.820
the mother who got them all together.

91
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:32.821
And founded the women's social political union in her parlor in 1903 great

92
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:34.000
charismatic woman.

93
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.840
She could fire up a room and she could light up a room very quickly.
Um,

94
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.950
all of them could actually,
all the Pancoast girls were charismatics.
Um,

95
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.760
she's a tiny creature.
Her shoe size was too,

96
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.760
but she's like a cannonball when she was,
when she got going,
you know,

97
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:50.290
he's amazing.
Um,

98
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.970
and then Andy Kenney who is a mill girl from Oldham who joined the campaign,

99
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.780
um,
very early on,
she a very senior member of the campaign.
Uh,

100
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.470
she's supposed to go for the campaign and she can reach into working class

101
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:07.100
communities and recruit women in the way that the Pankhurst curse couldn't

102
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.400
always.
So she's a big part of the story.
And,
um,
she was,
um,

103
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.860
you know,
very pretty and the subject of management postcards,

104
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.330
which women collected at the time,

105
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.640
this is the candidate that's the context and suffered.
It's are operating.
And um,

106
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.100
Mommy's a suffragette is your wife was suffrage act,
you know,

107
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.140
domestic chaos comes when women are involved in politics and bought the vote.

108
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.150
How dare they.
Um,
and I just this,
there's hundreds of these flying around,

109
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:36.020
different designs,

110
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.160
thousands of them being sent around the country at this time.

111
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.770
It's the golden age of the postcard.

112
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.530
People kind of made arrangements to see each other with these postcards.

113
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.190
London had 12 postal deliveries a day,
those were the days.

114
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.830
And there they're a bit like tweets and texts.

115
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.740
You could make an arrangement in the morning and you could confidently expect

116
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.430
your postcard to be delivered and meet your friends in the afternoon for tea or

117
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.930
whatever.
And so in the evening.
So it was a brilliant means of communication.

118
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.580
So,
you know,
civilization is going to collapse if women get the vote.

119
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.180
And certainly domestic chaos reigns whenever they want to,

120
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.040
when they're at whatever they're asking for it.

121
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.790
It's the first suffragette postcard I for bought and offered.

122
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.790
It was just so daft.
I liked it.
Um,

123
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.360
suffragettes who've never been kissed.

124
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.170
And this is to frighten young girls from being involved in the campaign because

125
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:28.610
they said,
you know,

126
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:33.140
this is what happens when you don't take your life seriously.
Um,

127
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.470
and if you're involved in politics,
you're going to be so unattractive to men.

128
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.250
You're never going to be cast.
You can have a very site unfulfilled life.

129
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.100
So the messages,
you know,

130
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.000
it's the sexual frustration of an unfulfilled life is driving these women into

131
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:49.640
asking for the vote.
There we have it,

132
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.770
an apocalyptic vision.
When women vote,
this is what's going to happen.

133
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.660
There's about 10 in this series,
which are fantastic.
Layer isn't dark of course.

134
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.560
Um,
I love the idea of what happens when women vote.

135
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.940
They have their friends around,
how dare they,
they have cigarettes,
they smoke,

136
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.870
they have chocolate,

137
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:13.180
they just hang out and just relax while their husbands were in the kitchen,

138
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.690
getting a ray red in the face and coping very badly with a balling child and the

139
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:22.010
washing and the everything.
So the role reversal of roles here is,

140
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.410
it's a horrible prospect,
is horrible.
It's a topsy turvy world and it's,

141
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:30.490
it's to be stopped early in its tracks.
Uh,

142
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.400
we've got to make sure this doesn't happen.
And when women vote,

143
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:37.610
they're going to ask men to marry them,
not to going to cast,
sit around and wait,

144
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.140
hoping it's going to happen.

145
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.320
So they're going to kind of take the initiative and that's going to be horrible

146
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.570
too.
This is Annie Kenny.

147
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.010
I'm dressed up to lead a procession.
Um,
as I said,

148
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:52.340
she could reach into working class communities everywhere all over the country.

149
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.770
And these are the clothes she wore when she worked in the cotton mills and
older.

150
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.970
Um,
she was a half time or from the age of eight when she was 13,

151
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:03.900
she became a full timer and these were her mill clothes.
She was wearing clogs,

152
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.320
um,
with steel tips,
a skirt and shorts.

153
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.640
The shorts and other short has been put over ahead.
So you know,

154
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:16.260
it's a really powerful rather than haunting image and it was very successful and

155
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.180
thousands of copies of this image was sold.
Subjects can be really young,

156
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.530
it could be teenagers.

157
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.330
And this girl here was a 17 when she started a suffragette career.

158
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.020
She worked in a dad shop in Westminster,
had a kind of a chemist,
John.

159
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.330
And she got involved.
And with our father's blessing,
she'd gone involved.

160
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.740
Lucky girl.
Um,
but she did change her name to spare his embarrassment.

161
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.480
She was born Jesse Spinks.
She's such a nice name.
And she'd caught herself,

162
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:49.260
very Wentworth and that's how she known.
That's her prison record.

163
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.280
Noser as very what worth.
But you know,
her real name was Jessie spanx.

164
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.780
So you could be really young,

165
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.840
you could be in your 20s and 30s and forties and 50s.

166
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.650
And even feminists in their seventies who had fought all sorts of interesting

167
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:02.221
campaigns.

168
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:06.780
The 19th century in their seventies and early eighties were joining the

169
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:10.590
suffragette campaign,
adding that imprimatur to this movement.

170
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.210
And um,

171
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.590
marching alongside the punk code's going to parliament to talk to politicians,

172
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:19.740
to talk to politicians,
which is to insist on the vote.

173
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:21.810
It wasn't nothing to do with talking.
It was demanding.

174
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.120
So across the age spectrum,

175
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.110
women are in getting involved in the struggle and adding their own special and

176
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:31.630
unique qualities turret.
Um,

177
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.670
I like this image because it shows you how the,

178
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.160
the movement is kind of bursting out all over the country.

179
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.170
The map shows where they had branches in committee rooms and shops.
Uh,

180
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.180
it's a brilliant,
you're organized campaign.
There were,

181
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.070
everything was like a military maneuver.
The left nothing to chance.

182
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:52.530
They had lots of volunteers to make this happen.

183
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.900
They pay their organizers two pounds a week,

184
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.920
which a lot of the legwork was done by unpaid volunteers from all class

185
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:03.540
backgrounds,
not just middle class girls with nothing else to do.
And um,

186
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.750
it was,
it was well resourced.
They had a great,

187
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.230
a couple who were the business managers,
if you like,

188
00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:15.210
they provide a lot of the seed money and they have to be a generous kind,

189
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:20.040
noble,
intelligent,
a wonderful cup of the [inaudible].
Lawrence's.
Um,

190
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.140
Fred was a barrister,

191
00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:26.160
so we gave lots of legal advice and lots of his money was used to bail out

192
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:30.210
suffragettes from a custody until their cases were hurt at court.

193
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:34.050
So a lot of his personal fortune was going to support the campaign.

194
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.960
And Emily and his wife was the fundraiser.

195
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.200
She raised the equivalent of 3 million pounds in five years.
She,

196
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.580
the woman could not stop raising money.
She has dozens of ideas,

197
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.000
which are brilliant at filling up thief,
what they're called,
the more chest,

198
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.390
which is their campaign fund.
Uh,

199
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.480
Annie was having so much fun in the subject paint and her sister,
uh,

200
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.350
Jessie has come to Ron,

201
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.910
one of the London departments and here she is sitting in front of the map here.

202
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.290
She's got a senior position to so much nicer than working in a cotton mill is to

203
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.760
actually come to London and be part of something really vibrant and very,

204
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.720
very exciting.

205
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.600
This is the marketing and merchandising and the colors featured very
prominently.

206
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.590
Um,

207
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.610
there's sort of quite small in 19 eight with barges and resentments and sashes,

208
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.500
but very quickly there's a vast amount of merge available,
um,

209
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:31.180
to those women who want to buy it at the top end,
the top end,

210
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.990
if you were really well off,
you can't have a purple,

211
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:39.730
white and green car upholstered and decorated with suffragette logos.

212
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.500
So that's high end marketing.
Um,
you could get subject bicycles,
you get votes,

213
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:49.150
women's cigarettes and chocolates and moment and all kinds of food stamps.

214
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.060
Um,
you could get jewelry,
you could get dresses,

215
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:55.720
you could get slippers and shoes and hats decorate.
I mean whatever you wanted,

216
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.430
somebody out there would make it for you.

217
00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:00.370
And all the big department stores in London and the major cities,

218
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.630
Woodstock stock,
purple,

219
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:05.440
white and green clothing and accessories for suffragette customers.

220
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.300
Um,
this tea set that,

221
00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:13.750
that was on the market in 1909 and uh,
there are still a few around,

222
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:18.730
but they're extremely rare and very expensive.
Well,

223
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.480
subject campaign was,
I haven't got time to go into,

224
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:25.360
go to go into too many of the kind of year on year details,

225
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:30.361
but initially from moving away from interrupting meetings when we were bound

226
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:33.850
from political meetings,
cause you never know.
They look quite nice,

227
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:36.790
but there could be suffragettes there could be so troublesome.

228
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.440
They would just get up and fell a banner and shout.
We votes for women,
you know,

229
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:45.010
and a need to interrupt politicians in that making speeches.

230
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.080
So women were bound and and to,

231
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.580
and to protest that they would get onto the roofs of those buildings where they

232
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:56.320
were banned and they would have banners and they do rooftop protests like prison

233
00:13:56.321 --> 00:14:00.190
protests.
They will do that.
They started it really.
And when the police,

234
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.880
the firemen,
we try and hose them down off the roof,
extremely dangerous.

235
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.860
The suffragettes got so cross,

236
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.480
they just rip the slates off the roof and just chop them down on the police the

237
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.080
low.
So you know,
these,

238
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.440
these protests could end up extremely violent and dangerous.

239
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:19.240
And of course it adds to their bad reputation.
It's taught politicians as well.

240
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.270
They would follow them around and just make their lives a total misery.

241
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.740
They would go to them,

242
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.340
they would fold into church and every button hold them and grab hold and say

243
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.250
when you're going to give women the vote,
they would follow them.

244
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.250
When they were playing golf,
they hide in the bushes and jump out and say,

245
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.030
what are you going to give women the vote?
Is there a really upset pain?

246
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.000
That was kind of slapstick.
And finally,
and I'm not so bad,

247
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:44.860
but then when the government promises to seriously consider a bill and to give

248
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:47.260
it time in parliament and allow it to become law,

249
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.020
when they renege on these promises,
three years running,

250
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:55.220
things taught to get really difficult.
And the suffragettes think,
okay,

251
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.910
we're going to move on a bit.
When I move the action a bit further down the line.

252
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.260
And it's extraordinary.

253
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.250
We say these things because these are just straightforward,
ordinary women.

254
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.050
You know,
they'd,
all they wanted was the vote.

255
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.050
They found themselves caught up in this semester,

256
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.320
extraordinary battle between the police,
the government,

257
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.130
prison authorities,
and sometimes members of the public would attack them.

258
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.880
You know,
it was really dangerous thing to be,
to be a suffragette.

259
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.060
This is one particularly dark day in 1910,
um,

260
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.930
suffragettes were waiting to hear about a bill that was being debated in

261
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:27.764
parliament,

262
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.330
just waiting to hear when the legal time table was going to be drawn up for it

263
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:35.270
to become law.
Ask with WHO's the prime minister.

264
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.660
Just completely tore Peter's it and says,
oh no,
no.
Well,
we're not,

265
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.030
haven't got time for that.
We'll think about it again next year,

266
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.620
and this is after a lot of peaceful lobbying and campaigning,

267
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.750
so they'd be set off in groups of a dozen from Caxton Hall,

268
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:53.210
whether we're meeting and waiting and they try and get into parliament and the

269
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.590
police are ready for them.

270
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:59.360
They know they're going to kind of make that protest and parliament square and

271
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.280
Winston Churchill Church was the home secretary actually recruited a lot of

272
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:05.210
policemen from these.

273
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:10.211
Dan Too are used to dealing with violent thugs and they were there but in plain

274
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:15.020
clothes they just saw that members of the crowds in terms of public and they

275
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:17.960
were all,
they were in disguise really in two ways.

276
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.210
They were wearing badge with budgets,

277
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:22.720
which said men's League for women's suffrage.
So they were,

278
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.680
they were pretending it was support as they weren't they and the uniform police

279
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:30.170
like we can see here and mounted policeman.

280
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.740
Actually their mission was to handle that situation in such a way that women

281
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.350
would never come back and protest again,

282
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.760
which meant that women were crushed against the railings by police horses.

283
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.410
They were punched,
kicked,
beaten hair,
pulled close turn dot pulled off,

284
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:53.630
um,
really badly assaulted and about 40,
where more were taken down.

285
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.800
Very site streets around Parliament Square and sexually assaulted by uniformed

286
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:02.390
policemen.
And these are John provocateur and the crowd,

287
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.210
one coach to join in.
So it's a terrible day.

288
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:09.650
It's 150 women are involved in these kinds of assault,

289
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.180
physical and sexual assault.

290
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.250
I can't sit the hall where they'd been meeting becomes like a field hospital,

291
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.970
um,
suffragette nurses,
nurses with softer,

292
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:23.971
that's sympathies rush there and doctors rush there to do some very basic first

293
00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:28.970
aid.
But it was an awful day and it triggered riots the following weeks where

294
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.810
hundreds of women of being arrested,
some of them are being discharged,

295
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.580
but a lot of them are going to prison.

296
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.990
Holloway fills up and the others just bossed around the country because there's

297
00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:43.220
no room in Holloway.
They've got to go to Liverpool,
Bristol,
Newcastle,
Manchester,

298
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:47.120
anywhere just to kind of to cope with them while that they're going to be

299
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:51.870
charged and senators are going to be hunted down.
It's such a difficult day.

300
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.840
It's such a dangerous,
horrible moment.
Mrs Ponca said,

301
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.040
I don't think we can do this.

302
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:59.970
We can't go to Paula Mellon less because he gives the police too much time to

303
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:04.110
molest manhandle all sorts of things are going on.

304
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.380
So what we need to do is we need to have protests where women are arrested

305
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:08.214
immediately.

306
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.700
So that's going to be like gorilla campaigning and she said we're going to have

307
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:16.110
to wage guerrilla warfare on this government because we cannot trust the police

308
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:21.000
to police these demonstrations properly.
And so guerrilla warfare,

309
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.530
you know the campaign goes underground in the autumn of 1910 and violence and

310
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:30.030
vandalism breaks out all over the country and the idea is smashing windows.
Yes,

311
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.480
they stood there and waited to be read to be arrested because that would mean

312
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:35.470
they went straight to the police station.
There's one other,

313
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.480
there's pushing and shelving and Catlin.
We're still happens at demonstrations.

314
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.160
It's,
it's,
it's a contract.
Quick protest,
the video to present,
you know,

315
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:44.730
they don't mind.

316
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.520
I mean they don't want to go to prison but they don't mind doing that if this is

317
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:52.290
going to further the cause.
So this is a tipping point and this day,

318
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.880
the 18th of November,

319
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:58.881
1910 is remembered ever after by suffragettes and for the rest of their lives as

320
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:04.410
black Friday.
People sometimes say to me,

321
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:07.020
who's your favorite suffragette?
And I say,
well,

322
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.010
there's about 200 of them and they're in this book,
but I'm to pick one.

323
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:16.070
I have to pay Edith rugby because she was just so gorgeous and outrageous and

324
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:18.980
unconventional.
Um,
she was adopted,

325
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.260
still a doctor's doctor and the doctor's wife and Preston and she,
um,

326
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.810
was absolutely single minded in getting the vote and focusing on working class

327
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:30.870
women.
She comes from a nice,
comfortable little horse background,

328
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.610
but her interests lie in votes for working women.
And she recruits local women.

329
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.870
She takes them down to London,

330
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:41.340
they get involved in all kinds of protests and demonstrations and you just had

331
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:45.060
to take one look at it is to know how unconventional she was.

332
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.500
She did not wear the normal clothes and had ward in leading course.

333
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.300
It's pretty dresses and that kind of stuff.

334
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:55.110
She wore her clothes that she made herself.
Um,

335
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.810
I suppose we think of her now perhaps is the first heppy cause they're really

336
00:19:57.811 --> 00:20:00.210
big baggy dresses,
kind of homemade dresses.

337
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.950
She made their own jewelry and that's all a bit Bohemian and pretty but very

338
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.880
weird for the times.
Um,

339
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.560
nobody else was dressed like that and she wore sandals and we around people

340
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:13.320
thought that was weird and she chain smoked all the time.

341
00:20:13.321 --> 00:20:17.070
And that was most unladylike.
So that's what Edith was like,
you know,

342
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.690
and she does all the,
she does the whole suffragette number.

343
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.710
She goes to parliament,
she protests,
she breaks windows.

344
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.930
She burns down houses.
Yeah,
just point out that whenever suffered,

345
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:31.741
it's burned down a house.

346
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:34.960
It was always interesting in that they're always record the place first.
It's,

347
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.360
their owners were still unhappy about it,
but no human life was lost.
So,
um,

348
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.430
for the last few months of 1913,
um,

349
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.240
Edith on the run from the police,

350
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.610
even a husband doesn't know where she is because she's got out of prison.
Um,

351
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.210
cause she's been on hunger strike and she's been forced fed.

352
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.430
And she was released on a special license and she hides an island in Gallway and

353
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:59.200
she's there not,

354
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.580
not communicated with a husband or friends at all and just waiting to slip back

355
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:06.490
into the country to carry on doing more militancy.

356
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.430
So Edith rugby is a really interesting woman and I mean there are,

357
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.880
there are 200 women in this book with,

358
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:18.950
with incredible stories and they do things that I don't think many of us or any

359
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:21.730
of us would,
would be able to do now.

360
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:25.900
It required really particular mindset and phenomenal,
um,

361
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.730
sacrifice and courage.

362
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.640
I like this photograph because it's looks really modern.
Um,

363
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.440
it was taken by Special Branch,
um,
as a surveillance photograph,

364
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.780
um,
as man hiding in a van,

365
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.590
in the exercise yard or in a box and exercise yard at Holloway prison.

366
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.980
And he used to take a patient's got no idea.
She's been photographed.

367
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.490
Multiple copies of these prints would be sent all over the country to police

368
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:54.790
stations to look out for women because there were very mobile,

369
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.060
they would arrive in places with alias,
isn't it?

370
00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.850
And this and this and in disguise.
They moved all over the country.

371
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.090
They were like soldiers really in a campaign and they were turn up and they

372
00:22:05.091 --> 00:22:09.610
would smash windows and they were put phosphorous bombs and pillar boxes and

373
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.320
they would,
um,
vandalize sports facilities.

374
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:18.400
They would get asked.
And Vernon Golf Greens,
no vote,
no golf,
that kind of stuff.

375
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.720
And um,
so,
so they were,
there were a tremendous problems.

376
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:27.100
The police and Special Branch had lots of detectors following them and taking

377
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:32.101
photographs of them to try and get a handle on who they were and where they were

378
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:37.150
going and what to do when they turned up at grace.
His father was a clergyman,
um,

379
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.260
in,
in Norfolk and to risk,
I mean,
he knew what she was up to.

380
00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:44.710
He didn't try and stop her,
but to make life a bit easier for him,

381
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.500
they have a very distinctive surnames.
They're called mark on,

382
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.190
but she's got grace mark on.
So she had an alias,

383
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:54.100
quite a of suffragettes had an alias to spare their father's feelings,

384
00:22:54.101 --> 00:22:55.570
even though they knew there were suffragettes.

385
00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.090
And she caught herself free to Thomas.

386
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.750
And she has an interesting career in London.

387
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:06.340
She works as a gymnastics teacher and a Mizuho's,
but when she's on soft debt,

388
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:07.090
missing missions,

389
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.350
she's obviously not able to work and she's kind of on the run from the police.

390
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.790
A lot of the time it's a grace mark on is a,

391
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.440
is a tremendous character and she was about 20 when she got involved in this

392
00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:21.880
campaign.
Well,
being a suffragette was hard.

393
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:22.660
You know,

394
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.920
if you try to make a speech outside perhaps in Wimbledon common or wherever,

395
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.100
you know,
the crowd could be really hostile,
that could be very abusive.

396
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:35.020
It could be very vulgar unless it's mostly male rough crowds who are kind of

397
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:39.460
falling your round to just beat you.
Really.
They would perhaps through,

398
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.790
um,
you know,
rotting fruit and vegetables,
lumps of coal,

399
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:47.340
cabbages rocks were soft,
often stoned.
Um,

400
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.120
Sylvia had experiences in the stand where did cats and dogs with thrown us.
So,

401
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:57.310
um,
so it was horrible and dangerous and again,
it's hard too much.

402
00:23:57.311 --> 00:24:01.340
And doing that now in front of really rough crowd of course in those days was

403
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.880
even more unimaginable.
So there's lots of that.

404
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.450
There's all this stuff that's going on in prison,
which is being forced fed.

405
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.160
The reason why they go on hunger strike is they say,
were political prisoners.

406
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.880
We've been treated as common criminals.
What's what's happening?

407
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.590
Men who are campaigning politically and are being arrested for political crimes

408
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.800
that come painting methods are given special status,

409
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.640
right back to the 19th century.
That was,
why aren't we being given the status?

410
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.250
And the government would never give in on that.

411
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.360
They went on a hunger strike and hundreds of women were fed by force.

412
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.650
I'm the worst.
I'm the three ways of doing it.
I'll just go straight to the worst,

413
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.480
which was where liquid food is poured in a funnel down a tube,

414
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.310
which is pushed down your throat down here to the top of the stomach.

415
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.700
So it's just poured straight into your stomach.
It's,

416
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:57.750
it's melt with rural ag or it's melt with brandy or effect strap,

417
00:24:57.891 --> 00:25:00.140
that kind of thing.
And you tip back in your chair,

418
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:03.890
you're held down by four water says,
and that's poured into you.

419
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.200
Um,
imagine no,
the gag reflex would,
would not be happy about this.

420
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.070
And suffragettes had their vocal cords damaged like that teeth knocked out in

421
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:16.640
the,
in the struggle,
um,
while it's being poured in there,

422
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:18.980
vomiting it straight back out again.
Um,

423
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.670
sometimes if you've got into the lungs and they had pleurisy pneumonia,

424
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:27.230
so it's really dangerous because with pneumonia,
this is before antibiotics.

425
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.950
And so,
um,
you could die from pneumonia and all the people dead.

426
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.610
So it's torture.
It's torture by no other name,

427
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.770
but hundreds of them we're doing it is their decision.
Nobody told them to do it.

428
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.540
And then the decision is we can a force the government to give us the vote.

429
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.220
So the stories of hunger,

430
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:51.221
striking force feeding a really powerful recruiting tools to women who will hear

431
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:55.520
these stories and they're going to have a response to that.

432
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.100
They might not want to go out and do militancy,

433
00:25:58.101 --> 00:26:00.980
but they're going to give some money.
They're going to get to some time.

434
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.110
They're going to be involved in the campaign.
And you know,
these stories,

435
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:10.190
these moments where we're really important cause it galvanized women to support

436
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:12.420
the suffer jets.
They might not like militancy.

437
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.190
There might not really approve of it,
but they felt it was a means to an end.

438
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.480
A means to a very,
very important.
And so there's a lot of scary stuff,

439
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:21.260
dangerous stuff,

440
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.560
unpopular stuff you've got to kind of develop a thick skin about.

441
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.540
But this fund as well,
there are big on parties.
They're very big on tin cakes.

442
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:32.210
That was a big part of the kind of recruiting process.

443
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:37.400
And here the having a suffrage at sleepover there says when it's census night,

444
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:42.320
when the government sent round to count the population suffragists that we pay

445
00:26:42.321 --> 00:26:46.440
taxes,
we no voice in the making of laws,
so we're not going to be counted.

446
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:51.690
The government threatened to find most and the two person didn't matter of 4,000

447
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:52.860
women don't do the sentence.

448
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.530
They will have parked their departed wherever they went on the night.

449
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.090
The gather groups together,

450
00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.260
they hide caravans and went out on Wimbledon common and spent the night out

451
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:04.010
there.
And how the policy,
they had smoking parties,

452
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.800
the went rollerskating or my in,

453
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:10.170
it was a lot of fun and making it a really important political point.

454
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.890
Um,
you know,
uh,
no voice in our legislation,

455
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:16.110
so we're not going to be part of your official headcount.

456
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.320
So I like this cause it looks like it was fun.

457
00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.760
I was very lucky to meet this lady,
um,

458
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.330
in the 1990s when I worked at Museum of London.
Um,

459
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.850
there she is as a young suffragette.
She called Victoria,

460
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.090
Victoria Simmons in that photo golf.
She's about 19.

461
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.800
She came up to London and she broke windows in Whitehall in 1912 she went to

462
00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:41.220
prison for two months and she went on hunger strike,
which was force fed.

463
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.100
She came up with a sister Winnie.
We need managed to get away.

464
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:48.930
So when he went and sang songs every day outside Holloway prison to keep

465
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.310
Victoria kind of company.
Um,
and when,
when,
um,

466
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:58.440
when,
um,
Victoria went back to Clifton,
which is where she came from,

467
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.730
her local clergymen,

468
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.930
the man whose church she attended saw her selling a newspaper in the street and

469
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:08.010
he was so disgusted by the fact that had been to London and she did what she
did.

470
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.210
You just spat in her face,
which is not,
we'd expect a clergyman to do.

471
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:17.520
But people felt able to make those kind of,
um,
uh,

472
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.700
remarks and those kind of behaviors.
I met in 1990s when she was a hundred.

473
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:26.790
She's a hundred in that photograph and she was still a suffragette actually,

474
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.530
she still had that suffragette twinkle.

475
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.360
She still had that fire in her eyes and she'd been a political campaign all her

476
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:37.020
life.
She got married,
which was the first one.
We're not Titian.
Um,

477
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.130
she got involved in all kinds of animal rights campaigns and our last campaign

478
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.300
for the ordination of women priests,
she lived to see that happen.

479
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.370
And it was great.
The very first time I met her.
Well,
the only time I met him,

480
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.320
I spent a whole day with and it was such a thrill to actually meet someone who'd

481
00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:56.760
done it,
you know,
and I could see completely how she had taken that position.

482
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.460
I said,
well,
let's,
um,
let's go and have some lunch shelving.
And I'm,

483
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.490
it's just perfectly able,
she didn't eat it walking frame or anything.

484
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:05.910
She was perfectly fine living in a flat on her own.
And she said,
well,

485
00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.100
it'll have to be vegetarian dashes because I've been a vegetarian since 1897 so

486
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.640
you know,
that's,
that's actually was.
And I said,

487
00:29:14.641 --> 00:29:18.270
what's it like living here in Brighton and hove?
She said,
oh,
it's all very well,

488
00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:22.050
she's,
but it's full of old people.
I think she thought she was about 50 actually.

489
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:23.220
She didn't realize she was a hundred.

490
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.720
So it was really nice to meet her and to just kind of spend some time with

491
00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:30.060
somebody who'd actually been and done the firstness.

492
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.110
And the last photograph and want to talk is about,
is this one here,

493
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.950
and this is,
um,
was taking 90,

494
00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:41.920
67 and these are the magic campaigners and the militant campaigners.

495
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.020
They're brought together for a photo shoot.
The Observer of gathered 13 of them,

496
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.090
they can get together on particular day.

497
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.380
We're a big feature that was in the observer and I love this photograph.

498
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.300
I just love it because it's so colorful,
it's so vibrant.

499
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.190
And it's about the personalities.

500
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:04.450
I think the color of their clothes reflect the vibrancy of those characters.

501
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.770
And,
um,
I just wanted to point a few of my favorites.
Actually.
It's,

502
00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:13.240
I'm just going to move over.
Um,
now this is like the formal photograph.

503
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.960
It's all kind of,
everything's okay here,
right?

504
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.530
But things have relaxed a bit.
By the time we get to this photo golf,

505
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:26.410
right,
of the burning down buildings,
which has interviewed years later,

506
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:31.180
her eyes lit up.
You know,
she's really excited talking about,
um,

507
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.150
when she brought down these buildings.
So she's in that off president.

508
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.070
She's on hunger strike.

509
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.580
She's forced that she was somebody who had food go into her lungs.

510
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.270
She had pleurisy pneumonia at the same time she could have died.

511
00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:47.590
She was only 20 when that happened to her.
Um,
when she was charged in,

512
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:50.800
caught at both street,
the magistrate sort of centered down for six months.

513
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.410
She said,
oh,
well I'll be back,
you know,
next time I'm out,

514
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:56.010
I'm going to burn down two buildings a week.
You know,
that's my projects.

515
00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.520
If she's completely kind of irrepressible um,
Angie,

516
00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:01.980
because she's so small,
she could spit,

517
00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:06.981
smuggled out the in laundry baskets and what they often did was they were out on

518
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:12.100
special licenses.
They're being,
they're supposed to sit in this place,

519
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.250
this designated to duress to get better,

520
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.090
to put on some weight and just wait to be rearrested.
That was the scheme.

521
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.370
That was a police idea.
Well they're not going to do that.
Are there,

522
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.080
they're going to kind of recover a bit.
You're going to put on a bit of weight,

523
00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:29.890
just be looked after in like a nursing home context and then they're going to

524
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:30.520
get out.

525
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.070
They're not going to wait to go back to prison and carry on the whole business

526
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:37.450
again.
So they would arrange for parties of women would come to see them,

527
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:39.460
see how they're getting on flowers and chocolates,

528
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:42.790
all that [inaudible] and there'd be a body double amongst that group.

529
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:48.090
So it's an a number of times she got out by swapping clothes or somebody,

530
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:49.751
a young,

531
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:53.920
small person and she would just walk past the police who were on 24 hour guard

532
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.490
outside the premises where she's been looked after.

533
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.620
So very often she just walked straight past them,

534
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.460
which she goes out in a laundry basket and she had this brilliant ability and

535
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:06.190
that because she's so small actually she can be a child.

536
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.640
She's often dressed as a boy and that's how she gets away from the police.

537
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:12.310
So she had lots of,
she a very lengthy record,

538
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.850
but she hardly said anytime in prison cause she's so good at getting away.

539
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.430
I love her.
And this is a Mrs Gwen O'brian.

540
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.680
Whenever Brian was one of Mrs Pancoast body guards because there's about 40

541
00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:29.290
women who were part of the body guard,
um,

542
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.130
who used to mop her to make joints top of being arrested by the police.

543
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.840
So Gwen had

544
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.970
many fisticuffs with the police to keep trying to stop.

545
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:44.750
This is Pancoast being arrested.
And then also I didn't want to talk about,

546
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:48.500
is this one here,
she's called owner devolve.
They need to.

547
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:51.920
Val was,
um,
again,

548
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.350
total career suffragette she got married in 1912 and she made a press release

549
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:58.760
before she got married and said,

550
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.500
I shouldn't be seeing the words I obey in the wedding service and everybody will

551
00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:06.360
complete.
You're agitated about this.
The Archbishop of Canterbury said,

552
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.660
what are you,
you won't be married if you don't say I obey.
He says,
well,

553
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:13.130
I'm not going to say it.
So she carried on.
She got married,
she completely,
um,

554
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.410
kind of ignore the Archbishop of Canterbury and she just went ahead with it.

555
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.670
But that gives you a clue as to how,
how strong minded they were.
You know,

556
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.720
how dedicated they were,

557
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:28.721
how visionary they were and how insistent and persistent they were in their

558
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:34.490
views.
And uh,
she was,
uh,
she was part of a suffragette family.

559
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.360
Her,
she married into a family called the develop family.
So the dog,

560
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:44.410
the dog doesn't devolves numbered about six female suffragettes and two husbands

561
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:49.550
supporters.
Now they couldn't join the WSP EU,

562
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.610
but husbands were really important in protecting their wives,

563
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.080
the female relatives and friends from attacks from I needed a different

564
00:33:57.081 --> 00:34:00.740
direction.
And so this important family,
the dog,
the Duvall's,

565
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.860
we're part of this whole family of suffrage.

566
00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:07.370
I think all the women who got involved in suffrage felt they were part of a

567
00:34:07.371 --> 00:34:11.330
family and you really need to feel that to actually be able to keep doing it

568
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.460
because it was hard.
Um,

569
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.570
did it involved off of sacrifice and quite a lot of suffering.
Okay.

570
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.170
That's what I want to say about the images.

571
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:24.920
I'm very happy to take questions if you,
I'll try not to them.

572
00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

573
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.321
<v 0>My question was,</v>

574
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:38.850
have you been always been talking about this and researching this for a very

575
00:34:38.851 --> 00:34:41.840
long time and in time in doing so and more recently,

576
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:44.810
have you found the conversation has changed if your audiences change to become

577
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:48.680
more receptive,
more understanding?
Yes.
I mean for,

578
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.390
I've been involved with the subject for a long,
long time.

579
00:34:51.391 --> 00:34:55.710
And for years there was no love in the room for the suffragettes.

580
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.220
People couldn't stand them.
Even academics,

581
00:34:59.221 --> 00:35:01.590
even historians were quite dismissive of them.

582
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.730
They believed the lie that it was just middle class women looking after their

583
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:06.564
own interests.

584
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:10.680
But now there's quite a lot of love and lots of rooms where I talk about the

585
00:35:10.681 --> 00:35:15.681
suffragettes cause people can hear really the full story and understand about

586
00:35:16.141 --> 00:35:19.140
their characters and their strengths and their courage and their commitment.

587
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.880
And I think that the people that women that lots of people can be proud of and,

588
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:24.661
but the,
the,
the,

589
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:29.430
the mood and the attitude has shifted as the full store of the involvement in

590
00:35:29.431 --> 00:35:30.930
their struggle actually emerges.

591
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.860
Hi.
Um,
so I've got questions.
So I kind of feel

592
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.650
<v 2>right now with the meaty trend.
Um,</v>

593
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:45.750
I feel that we are perhaps living through another pivotal moment as we did a

594
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.471
hundred years ago with the suffrage jazz.

595
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:50.490
I don't know if you would agree with that.
And my question to you is,
do you feel,

596
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.780
I mean,
I guess I've got two questions.

597
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:55.980
One I wouldn't tell whether these ladies would feel proud of where we are right

598
00:35:55.981 --> 00:36:00.540
now as a society or whether they think actually hasn't moved on enough because I

599
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:05.280
personally feel we're still quite far from jet true gender equality.
Um,

600
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.600
and my second question to you is,

601
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:10.680
with this pivotal moment that we're living through now with the me too trend,

602
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.740
do you feel this will result in significant move towards kind of genuine gender

603
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:20.220
quality and the kind of world I guess these ladies hoped they would achieve?

604
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.850
<v 0>Well,
uh,
I mean,
excuse me,
that's two good questions.</v>

605
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:27.320
I think that the suffragettes um,

606
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:31.530
thought a lot of this would have been sorted out by now.
Um,
you know,

607
00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:33.570
I think one of that,
one of the,
uh,

608
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:37.800
[inaudible] one of their wishes was equal pay.
They're talking about equal pay,

609
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.320
you know,
at the turn of the century and before.

610
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:45.570
So they'd be very disappointed about the inequity of unequal pay.

611
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.920
And they would say,
I'm sure.
How did you let this go on for so long?

612
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.970
Don't forget,
in 1970,
the equal pay act was passed.

613
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:55.470
It's supposed to be right across the board,

614
00:36:55.471 --> 00:36:59.870
fully implemented by 1975 and it still hasn't happened.
So they,

615
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:04.140
they think that was weird,
which I think is code for shockingly bad.

616
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.810
Um,
I think the me too moment is going to actually,
I think,

617
00:37:08.811 --> 00:37:13.811
I think both of these issues are going to result a result in something in some

618
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:18.870
part because I think so many people are affected by it.
It can't just be,

619
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.590
um,
uh,
caught me just papered over.
It can't be ignored.

620
00:37:22.591 --> 00:37:25.380
It can't be brushed under the carpet.
So many people have,

621
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.700
have the issue of unequal pay as sexual harassment.
I can't see that.
It,

622
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.600
nothing can happen.
But I think what we do,
and the suffragettes would say,
well,

623
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:38.270
how,
how did this go on for so long?
Um,
because suffragettes were,

624
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.680
were campaigning for the vote to stop sexual harassment.
And they said,
well,

625
00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:44.040
we haven't got that yet.
They,

626
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.170
I think they would like us to have Mrs Pancha slogan at the top of our wines.

627
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.130
Deeds not words.
Stop talking about it.

628
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:56.850
Stop having committee meetings about it.
Just talk about it.

629
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.340
But make a strategy as to how it's going to happen.
What,

630
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.300
what are we going to do about it?
How we're going to bring this,

631
00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:07.020
I'm going to deliver these changes because talking about it just isn't enough.

632
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.370
And that's what he says.
Pancoast,
we'd love us to revive her slogan.
Deeds,

633
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:13.650
not words.
And I think we perhaps ought to think about that.

634
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:22.223
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

635
00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.010
<v 3>Thanks.
[inaudible].
Um,
I suppose along that the deeds,
not words so much,</v>

636
00:38:27.011 --> 00:38:31.250
and you talked about essentially ask with going back on his promises,
he says,

637
00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:32.390
yes,
we'll do it.
And then not.

638
00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:36.820
And then the suffragettes feeling that they had to escalate the types of actions

639
00:38:36.821 --> 00:38:40.690
to what it,
to what extent do you think they'd actually,
if you want real change,

640
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:45.430
that extreme actions actually take you to a place that dialogue just,

641
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.030
just can't do.
Is it,
is it something that is real change?
Can it be achieved with,

642
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.790
with dialogue or do you have in a democracy actually need to,

643
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:55.690
to demonstrate your frustration,
anger and more sort of vocal extreme.

644
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.420
<v 0>I mean,</v>

645
00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.230
I don't know if I've been taken over by suffragette spirits as possible at harm,

646
00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:05.360
but I,
I don't,
I don't think dialogues in off,
I think extreme action,

647
00:39:05.361 --> 00:39:07.370
whatever that is,
whether it's a general strike,

648
00:39:07.371 --> 00:39:11.420
women going on strike and not doing any work at all for I do,
but it's got to,

649
00:39:11.421 --> 00:39:15.740
it's got to be strong because talking just talk,
it's so easy.
It's so cheap.

650
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.760
It's how we,
how do you make,
how do you translate that into something?

651
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.890
And although government's never want to agree or conceived,
you know,

652
00:39:24.891 --> 00:39:27.680
they always give in to violence and extremism.

653
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.100
Eventually you just have to manage that really carefully.

654
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.280
But they will always have to make some concessions because you can't have,

655
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.920
you know,
the country at war that you,
you use is this can't go on.

656
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:44.000
So I think the suffragettes were right to proceed this campaign.

657
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.180
They suffered enormously because of it.
But in the end,

658
00:39:47.181 --> 00:39:51.740
the net result of it was during the war when they realized that,
um,

659
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.560
a lot of soldiers had accident.

660
00:39:53.561 --> 00:39:56.270
He lost the right to vote because they were away from home and hadn't been

661
00:39:56.271 --> 00:40:01.190
registered.
It's just a technical thing.
Once they realize that had happened,

662
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:05.720
they had to quickly ran franchisement it cause it's sort of a PR nightmare.

663
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.410
Um,
they then just say,
well all these men are fighting that.

664
00:40:09.411 --> 00:40:11.360
We've got a large number of men who haven't got the,

665
00:40:11.361 --> 00:40:14.780
that we've got to enfranchise them because they are putting their lives at

666
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.210
laying their lives down for our country and our empire.

667
00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.640
So the soldiers are,
you know,

668
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.630
reinvent sheisty 21 year olds men,
uh,
reinforced draw circles and projects.

669
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.290
Of course a bolt,
the board.
There's also like what,

670
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:32.330
how are we going to reward women for Woolworth's because we'll work done by

671
00:40:32.331 --> 00:40:34.490
women was critical.
The home front,

672
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.550
that war was fought and won by women.

673
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.060
So they have to make some kind of remark about that.

674
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:45.770
And that meant that women over 30 with certain property qualifications got the

675
00:40:45.771 --> 00:40:46.604
vote.

676
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:51.500
And I really feel that if the suffragette co hadn't pushed the struggle to the

677
00:40:51.501 --> 00:40:54.170
top of the agenda,
that wouldn't have happened.

678
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.220
The thought of the Cipher Jack campaign starting up again,
if they didn't,

679
00:40:58.221 --> 00:41:01.100
even when the vote was just couldn't,
just couldn't face it.

680
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.360
There's so much to be done once the war was over that dealing with that as well.

681
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.740
And also the software just would be so,
uh,

682
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:13.310
re invigorated by the moral high ground of saying,
hang on,

683
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:18.350
what more do women have to do to,
to get the vote?
No,
we've,
we've fought the war.

684
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.770
The men has been at the front and we fought the war at home.

685
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:26.770
So I think the suffragettes created a mood whereby the women have to get the

686
00:41:26.931 --> 00:41:27.320
vote.

687
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.320
I mean it was unfortunate that they weren't all in franchise on equal age thing,

688
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:37.820
but if they had been women that would have been in the majority and the

689
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.930
publicity was just,
couldn't we contemplate you tell me.
We think now more,

690
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:44.600
why not?
But at that time,
going from like no votes,

691
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:46.820
women telling a woman in the majority of their lecture,

692
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.960
that was just scary and it was just very unappetizing.
So I think,

693
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:55.430
I think the extremism of the suffragettes actually counted for something when it

694
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:59.630
came to,
um,
the,
you know,
the representation of the people aren't.

695
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:00.920
And that's how women got the vote.

696
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.420
Sorry it was a long winded answer but it's quite complex.
Question.

697
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.990
Hi there.
Thank you so much for joining.

698
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.720
Where did your personal interest in this topic come from?

699
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:23.930
I worked at Museum of London and they have this really important world class

700
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:26.930
collection called the suffragette fellowship collection.

701
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:32.510
And it's such a touching story because when the,
when the vote was won 1920s,

702
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:36.680
I always imagine what they did with themselves after that really exciting

703
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:40.890
campaign and the war period.
Cause they're all involved in all kinds of woodwork.

704
00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:43.910
And I,
and I thought,
and now I know what they did.

705
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.790
They collect stuff to remember the campaign.

706
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.260
They had this fellowship to remember the Pancoast and to remember militancy and

707
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:55.580
they gathered all the banners and posters and stuff and they made this huge

708
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:59.030
archive and they had a little museum and Cornwell road and you could just go

709
00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:03.510
along and kind of look at banners and,
and it was like a very amateurish thing,

710
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.590
but it was a collection that was growing and growing and growing.

711
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.650
People would donate and a hunger strike,
metals that jewelry,
the everything.

712
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.720
And we had this at the Museum of London.

713
00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:16.550
I used to just go and spend hours kind of messing around and they're looking at

714
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:19.190
stuff and picking up photographs and just learning about them,

715
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.780
finding names to put these photo goals.

716
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:26.840
And so I kind of immersed myself in ards and like started getting like on a

717
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:30.770
compulsion to write about them and just to work out what the stories were.

718
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.940
And I curated an exhibition in 1992 called purple,
white and green,

719
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:38.660
which talked about marketing is the foreground of the campaign.

720
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:40.310
If my exhibition in the background,

721
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.340
the backdrop was really busy and I've just kept with it and I had a break from

722
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.000
writing about them.

723
00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:50.630
I did other biographies of women and I kind of came back to them.

724
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.390
I'm thinking,
yeah,
right,
okay,

725
00:43:53.391 --> 00:43:57.370
let's get biographical where this lot and find out what's,
you know,

726
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.730
how this all came about.

727
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:03.760
So my book is a collective biography of 200 suffragettes and,

728
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.130
um,
and I say I'm,
I'm,

729
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.940
I think I'm possessed by them because everyday I think about them,
you know,

730
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:12.380
I kind of think,
oh,
I want to eat at the Rick.

731
00:44:12.381 --> 00:44:17.270
We would have done about what would eat if they've done,
you know.
So,
uh,
no,

732
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:20.600
they're really inspiring.
They're amazing.
I love them.

733
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:28.323
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

734
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.700
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

735
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.220
In the last couple of elections we've seen the women's equality party come to

736
00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.500
more prominence,
at least before d.
What's your take on,
on that movement?

737
00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:45.940
And is that just a modern embodiment of the suffragette spirits,

738
00:44:45.941 --> 00:44:48.000
or is it maybe a pale imitation and what would be,

739
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.100
what would the Pacific let's do in the current political climate?

740
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.881
<v 0>Well,</v>

741
00:44:51.881 --> 00:44:54.820
I think the suffragettes would say we should have had the women's equality party

742
00:44:54.821 --> 00:44:57.400
a long time ago.
I think they support them.

743
00:44:57.401 --> 00:44:59.560
I think they would endorse a lot of their policies.

744
00:44:59.561 --> 00:45:03.370
I think they'd like what they're doing.
They'd approve of it certainly.

745
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.210
And I think they'd want us all to vote for them.
Uh,

746
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.880
and I think lots of people say to me,
what do you,
what,
what should I do?

747
00:45:09.881 --> 00:45:13.990
I did an event at wow,
at the royal festival on Saturday,
11 of the world.

748
00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.370
And I talked about and a young woman still at what can I do?

749
00:45:18.371 --> 00:45:21.610
What can I do about this?
I said,
well,
join the women's equality party.

750
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.190
And sadly she said,
I've never heard of them.

751
00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:29.860
So my mission would be my advice to women's equality.
Get out there,
get no more,

752
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.910
get some candidates,

753
00:45:30.911 --> 00:45:35.260
get some money and try and think about adopting some of these suffragette

754
00:45:35.261 --> 00:45:38.590
tactics because I think that's what lots of women want and need.

755
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.630
<v 5>Um,
so we talked about it before you started.</v>

756
00:45:44.631 --> 00:45:46.940
We talked about technology and the impact that can have.

757
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:50.730
And one of the themes that you brought up was how organized the suffragettes.

758
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.210
Where do you think that technology is supposed to be?

759
00:45:53.211 --> 00:45:57.680
Hindering the ability to get out he consistent organized message to achieve an

760
00:45:57.681 --> 00:46:00.320
individual goal.
So for example,
women's equality party,

761
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.990
there are too many voices asking for too many different things.

762
00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:07.810
<v 0>Yes.
I think the suffered on the virtues of the suffragettes was that,
you know,</v>

763
00:46:07.811 --> 00:46:12.190
there were very clear,
the word democratic then we're interested in committees.

764
00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.210
They just walked,

765
00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:17.170
they made policy and they wanted their supporters to follow the policy.

766
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.970
And it's quite straight forward in where,

767
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.510
because I often think one way of making sure things don't happen to have a

768
00:46:22.511 --> 00:46:25.960
committee because he just takes her long,
it becomes a talking shot.
I'm sorry.

769
00:46:25.961 --> 00:46:28.450
But it just is so frustrating.

770
00:46:28.451 --> 00:46:30.730
It just ends up to being a little about the committee,

771
00:46:30.731 --> 00:46:32.740
not about the project and the goal.

772
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:38.370
So I think they need to have a single issue or a big identifiable message and to

773
00:46:40.061 --> 00:46:43.300
push that because that will bring so many people together.

774
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.340
We're reasons why the suffragette campaign was so diverse and so,
so huge.
Really.

775
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.530
Um,
is the fact they're going for the vote,
the vote,
the vote.

776
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.260
And that brings a lot of people too.

777
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:58.090
I like campaign and very importantly,

778
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:03.540
great diverse talent and it's talent that has so many impacts,

779
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.970
which isn't just so many aspects of the organization.

780
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:11.260
So I think a single issue campaign is something that really has a chance of

781
00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:14.530
success because you've got numbers,
you've got diversity,

782
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:18.430
and that's where I think results can be gained more quickly.

783
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.870
I thought her,
I think the is would love social media,

784
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:30.220
the way they would've loved tweeting and um,
Instagram,

785
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:32.590
they would have loved that.
They would have really embraced that.

786
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.840
They took the technology that was available at the time to the Max.

787
00:47:35.841 --> 00:47:38.890
So they really worked on that.
So they think,
hey,
you've got Twitter,

788
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:40.750
you've got all this stuff.
What,
what's happened

789
00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:50.020
to be nice?
You mentioned 200,
200 women,

790
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.880
200 suffragettes yeah,
I was wondering,
are there any prominent male,

791
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:59.650
um,
can we say suffragettes well,
yeah,
they,
they couldn't,
well,
I call them.

792
00:47:59.651 --> 00:48:02.440
And you came across.
Yeah.
Well,
there's some good guys.

793
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:07.390
There are lots of good guys.
Um,
Edith rigbys husband was a doctor,

794
00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:10.680
Charlie,
and he was just like the ideal husband.
He just let it go that,
you know,

795
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.350
he never stopped.
He was worried about hunger,
striking bigger doctor.

796
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.360
But he didn't ever try and stop her.

797
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:21.760
And a lot of the time when she was just in Ireland had no idea where she was.

798
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.950
And a family friend wrote and said,
Oh,

799
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:26.830
I'm so sorry about this is all very trying for you,
isn't it?
He said,

800
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:28.060
I don't want your sympathy.

801
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.930
I don't need it because I back Edith in everything she does.

802
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:37.290
She has the courage of a lion and I don't have the moral courage that she has,

803
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.150
so I will back her whatever she does now,

804
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:42.940
that's quite an admission for a man at that time to make.

805
00:48:42.941 --> 00:48:47.860
So there are lots of good men like,
um,
Charlie rugby,
but they suffered,

806
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.800
you know,
their reputations amongst other men.
Men thought they were like,
we meet,

807
00:48:52.801 --> 00:48:54.220
you know,
men in dresses,
you know,

808
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:58.700
they said there were unsexed they work sex treaters.
So,
um,

809
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.880
some of their careers stuff for the reputation suffered,

810
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:03.850
their friendships were broken.
But there are some,

811
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.030
there are some good men in Narberth to thank you so much and I think they're
not.

812
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:09.970
I was really excited to read the book.
Thank you very much for coming.
