1
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.050
And I'm super excited to be here today to be with Danielle teller who is an

2
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.620
author and a dear friend and I'm going to share just a little bit about her.

3
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.100
She grew up in Canada where she was a bookworm and dreamed of being a writer,

4
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.430
but she chickened out and went to medical school instead and attended Queens

5
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.960
University as well as getting her medical training at Mcgill Brown and Yo.

6
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.290
She's held faculty positions at the University of Pittsburg and Harvard where

7
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:48.751
she investigated the origins of chronic lung disease and taught in the medical

8
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:50.680
intensive care unit.

9
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
Then in 2013 she quit her job to pursue that childhood dream of writing.

10
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.230
She Co wrote sacred cows the truth of divorce and marriage with her husband,

11
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.910
our own beloved astro teller.

12
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.390
She has also been a regular writer for courts where with width as well as data.

13
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.410
She writes about controversial,
yet accurate,

14
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.470
unseen truths hiding behind many of our long held beliefs and some of my

15
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:26.021
favorite column titles include the idiotic argument Americans use in almost

16
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:31.460
every political debate.
Let mom down from the pedestal in praise of the messy,

17
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:35.240
imperfect,
authentic mother,
which was a mother's Day writing.
Of course,

18
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.910
nearly all our medical research is wrong.

19
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.220
<v 1>How American parenting is killing the American marriage.</v>

21
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.880
We're super excited to have Danielle here today and we'll be discussing her book

22
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.360
called all the other actors before we start discussing with her.

23
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.570
She's going to do a little reading for us.
Thank you.

24
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.430
Thank you.

25
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.160
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

26
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.213
<v 1>be here.</v>

27
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.850
And I'm super impressed that people are taking time out of their busy work days

28
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.140
to be Harem very touched.
So thank you.

29
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.910
<v 2>Um,
so I'm going to read the prologue from the book,
which I think really sets up</v>

30
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.880
<v 1>with the book is about and gives you a flavor of the style of writing.
Um,</v>

31
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:20.730
and then I'll in a couple of sentences,

32
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:25.560
just describe the arc of the book and then we'll have a chat.
Yeah.

33
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.570
Um,
hopefully all of us,
we'll have a chat

34
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.870
<v 2>prologue.
The royal courts.</v>

35
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.410
<v 2>Suppers at the royal court to become entirely too oppressive.</v>

37
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.820
It isn't just that they're interminable or that we must adhere to the newest

38
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.630
fashions,
the face powder or I hear tortured into great bejeweled Ram's horns,

39
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.940
the silks with sleep so tight that it's impossible to raise one spoon to one's

40
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:55.820
carefully tinctured lips.
No.
The worst is the gossip,

41
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.930
the sinister buzz of wasps ready to,

42
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.520
they're poisonous stingers into whatever tender flesh lies exposed.

43
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.410
This evening,
I was ordered to sit next to the Earl in Briston,

44
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.290
a pompous halfwit who has rarely been to court.

45
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.120
He presides over some God forsaken swamp and the north and he seems to believe

46
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.750
that his family's long history of loyalty to the crown gives him the right to a

47
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.680
pine on the behaviors of the royal family.
My Lady,

48
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.640
he said plucking at cuffs so voluminous that they draped into his suit.

49
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.920
I understand that you are noble daughters are not yet wed.
No.

50
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.610
My Lord,

51
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
I answered as briefly as courtesy would allow and yet I've heard that they once

52
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.240
vied for the attention of Prince Henry himself,
the Earl Dad's has crimson.

53
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:48.090
Let's daintily that they tried to alienate his affection from princess of
filter.

54
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.890
You seem amused.
My Lord,

55
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.700
he could not mistaken the coldness in my response.

56
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.840
I fear that much of what you have heard is not true.
Well,

57
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.190
it is an incredible tale.
He smiled broadly,

58
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.030
the beautiful downtrodden maiden who ascends to the royal palace,

59
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.740
the Jealous Sisters,

60
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.870
the glass slipper that would not fit my Lord.
I cannot credit such a tail.

61
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.850
Come at eight you know that the whole kingdom is enthralled by our radiant and

62
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:22.360
benevolent princess.
I've heard a great deal about you and your daughters.

63
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.070
He looked at me knowingly.

64
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.180
Compelling fiction often obscures the humble truth.

65
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.400
Do hope that you will.
Tell me about the slipper.
He said,
ignoring my reluctance.

66
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.450
He broke a piece of bread,
leaving a trail of crumbs across the table.

67
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.390
My wife is frantic to know the particulars.

68
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.040
They say that the prince that every made try the shoe,
even your daughters,

69
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.950
he laughed.
It is droll to imagine them receiving attention from a prince.

70
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.780
His drug was eloquent.
They are ugly and it filled is beautiful.

71
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.660
The Earl frowned and pursed his lips.
It's Genteel to imply nasty insults,

72
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.050
not to speak them directly.
My Lord.

73
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.520
I may have heard some of the rumors too,
which you allude to my mind.

74
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.770
The stories insinuate a plague of blindness.

75
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.430
Prince Henry would have to be blind not to recognize the object of his

76
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:19.390
admiration or to distinguish an ugly girl from one of unsurpassed beauty.

77
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.351
My daughters,

78
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:23.830
we need to be blind to the reflections and the mirrors and on the faces of those

79
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:28.750
who behold them.
My voice rose,
so I paused and began again.
Blandly.

80
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.780
They would also need to be blind to the truth that men persuade themselves that

81
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.660
beautiful women possess virtue and good character,

82
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.080
whereas no amount of virtue can make an ugly woman.
Beautiful.

83
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.790
My lady Princess,
a filter.

84
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:47.920
There's a dazzling star who shines in the royal for a moment where she belongs.

85
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.810
He did not attempt to conceal his disdain that she invites you and your

86
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:56.380
daughters to dine.
Here at the palace is a testament to her compassion,

87
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.680
forgiveness,
and generosity.
Indeed my Lord,

88
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.843
<v 1>I remembered.</v>

89
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.460
<v 2>Okay,
indeed.
That is so,
yeah.</v>

90
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.650
I'm only of interest to the Earl of Bryston and his ilk because of my

91
00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:12.900
stepdaughter princess of Hilda is the most celebrated women in the kingdom,

92
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.760
perhaps in all of history.
Commoners line the streets for endless hours,

93
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.200
even in dark and sleep,

94
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.650
hoping to glimpse her face through the window of her gilded carriage.

95
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.220
When the princess has a gang cut in a new way or adopts a different hairstyle,

96
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.800
every female creature in the city imitates or appearance.
Last Autumn,

97
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:35.310
she wore a choker of pearls to church on Michaelness and the next day,

98
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.120
every noble woman's throat was wound snuggly with pearls or other jewels.

99
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.600
By Christmas tied,
even the peasant girls wear chokers of beads or ribbon.

100
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.930
Whatever material they could find to replicate the fashion princess of filled.

101
00:06:46.931 --> 00:06:50.110
His popularity derives in large part from her astonishing beauty.

102
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.750
There's something else about her nature that attracts the masses,

103
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.550
her habitual mutinous and the gentle hesitancy of those rare words that do fall

104
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.700
from her lips make her seem bashful,

105
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.790
as does her manner of ducking her head and looking up through sweeping lashes.

106
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.310
Apart from her collection of bubbles and Kendall,
the favorite dogs.

107
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.900
She appears to have no passions or vices.
And when she attends royal functions,

108
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:16.860
her gaze drifts to invisible spectacles that only she can apprehend.

109
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.670
Her elusive character is a blank parchment upon which any story may be written.

110
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.410
And every girl who dreams of becoming a princess can imagine herself in Princess

111
00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:30.740
of fill this heinously tiny shoes.

112
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.360
I know more of the princesses history than anyone else alive.

113
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.090
And the true tale is not as fantastical as the ones sung by troubadours.
No,

114
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.680
but he's interested in the story of a flesh and blood nobleman.
His daughter,

115
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.210
when who wet her bed,

116
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.250
complained a boredom thought with her kin and turned up her nose at Winter

117
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.750
Greens,
just like any mortal child.

118
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.130
And what do I have any desire to diminish the adulation for the princess,

119
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.230
which makes both the admiring and the admired.
So content,

120
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.010
I do not set out to write the princesses history,
but my own,

121
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.320
the only tale I have the authority to tell my quill may resurrect ghosts to keep

122
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:10.670
me company during the long days at the castle.
And if it cannot,

123
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.530
at least my mind will be occupied.

124
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.650
And my hands busy as for fables about good and evil and songs about glass

125
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:22.890
slippers,
I shall leave those to the minstrels.
They can invent their own tales.

126
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.850
That's Cinderella.

127
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.710
<v 1>So that's the prologue,
um,</v>

128
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.300
which I think sort of sets up the book and that she's going to tell her story

129
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:34.850
from her perspective and it really is a story of her life.

130
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:38.310
So it starts from when she's at at 10 years old and we follow her til she's

131
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.163
about 50.

132
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.640
<v 2>And</v>

133
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.590
<v 1>I think of it as kind of a nested fairy tale where,</v>

134
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.520
<v 2>uh,
Agnes has her own rags to rich</v>

135
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.020
<v 1>arc of her life.
And then toward the last third a quarter of the book,</v>

136
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:54.560
we get much more of a Cinderella elements and get sort of Cinderella story

137
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.670
embedded the longer story of the stepmothers like.

138
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.030
So I'll leave it at that and we can have a chat.
Yeah,

139
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.170
I have questions that I wanted to ask Danielle,

140
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:06.440
but then we want to open it up to the group too and,

141
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.350
and have a discussion and hopefully you guys all have questions for her as well.

142
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:14.880
But I'd love to start with this is your first piece of fiction with everything

143
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:18.390
before has been very factual and interesting and beautiful,

144
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.090
but this is fiction.
What looked you're new to this methodology of writing?

145
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.260
Well,

146
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.940
I had always wanted to be a novelist my entire life and I took a very,

147
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:34.941
very long detour through medicine and science nonfiction and sort of finally got

148
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.760
back to my true love.
Um,
I just,

149
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:43.761
I think that fiction is one more way in which we can examine our lives and the

150
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:47.010
world that we live in.
I think it's a,

151
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:52.011
it's a tool that can make us think differently about our everyday lives.

152
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.573
So true.

153
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.670
And how did you come up then with this particular idea of the retelling of

154
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:01.380
Cinderella from her stepmother's perspective?

155
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.200
So I had had a different novel in the back of my mind for a long time.

156
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.190
Um,

157
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.190
but then I became a stepmother and I spent a lot of time thinking about being a

158
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:18.100
Scott mother.
Cause it was something that I struggled with.
It's not,

159
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.270
you don't grow up thinking when I grow up I want to be a stepmom.

160
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.900
It just happens to you and you haven't usually thought it through.

161
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.640
And I was really surprised at how challenging our relationship that was.

162
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.060
And what I realized was that there are a lot of intrinsic difficulties in the

163
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:39.690
relationship because for the child,
especially if it's due to divorce,

164
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:44.610
so the child already has two loving parents welcoming another parent to their

165
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.530
lives is not something that they're looking to do.
You know,

166
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:50.460
they didn't want this other stranger coming into their lives and ordering them

167
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:54.120
around and changing their routines and sucking up the attention of one of their

168
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.870
parents.
You know,
it's sort of a net negative.

169
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.360
They already feel supported and loved and have everything that they need from

170
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:05.040
their biological parents.
And also for the step parents.

171
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.490
I realize it's also challenging because I think,
you know,

172
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:12.690
we make a lot of assumptions about human relationships and one of the

173
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:17.070
assumptions we make is that if you're an adult and you enter into a child's life

174
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.460
that you are automatically going to love that child and that child is

175
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:24.570
automatically going to love you back.
But it doesn't always work that way.

176
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.920
It takes time.
You know?
It's not like when you have your own child.

177
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:29.870
I think that nature,

178
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.940
mother nature gives us the gift of this is bond when your child is born,

179
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.360
but being a step parent is a bit like your kid bringing a friend home and then

180
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.540
all of a sudden you have to be a parent to that friend and then so you don't,

181
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.220
you don't know that child as well.

182
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:48.510
You don't necessarily have that bond already and especially if they have

183
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:50.610
resentments or anyway,

184
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.000
they don't see you as a net positive in their lives can be a really challenging

185
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:57.610
relationship because you have to do all this stuff for the child that you do for

186
00:11:57.611 --> 00:11:58.241
your own child.

187
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:01.420
You have to cook and clean and care for them and drive them around.

188
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.190
But they don't necessarily,

189
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.460
I mean you're on kids probably don't say thank you either,
but,
um,
they don't,

190
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:08.230
you know,
they don't necessarily love you.
Like they don't,

191
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.470
they don't give you the hugs and kisses and all this stuff that makes it easier

192
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.490
to,
to do.
And so when I was thinking about that,
I thought,
Huh,
I wonder,

193
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.540
I was thinking that how vilified step moms are in so many fairytales.

194
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.680
And then I thought,

195
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.680
I wonder if those grew out of this intrinsically difficult relationship and that

196
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.620
behind these tales are just ordinary,

197
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.240
flawed human beings trying to get along and trying to have a relationship.

198
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.440
Um,
and that's where Agnes was born,
right.

199
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.690
Balance of describing agonises perspective from Cinderella because there were so

200
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:52.231
many roads throughout the book where you could see the commonalities between the

201
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:57.210
fairy tale and Agnes,
his version of the reality of her tail.

202
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.150
How did you find that right balance?
Um,

203
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.350
so I really wanted it to feel like a real family,
you know,

204
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:08.380
like real people who are struggling with these issues.

205
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.270
And so I have the most challenging thing about the book was trying to thread the

206
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:18.271
needle between making the stepmother legitimately eval because she couldn't be

207
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.550
this wonderful person or there'd be no story there.
Right.

208
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.640
So she had to actually conform to the fairytale she had to be a pretty

209
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:26.440
suboptimal parent to Cinderella.

210
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.550
But at the same time I wanted the reader to have developed an empathy for that

211
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:34.540
character that they could actually see how she got to this place.

212
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.063
Um,

213
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.190
and so one of the ways in which I tried to do that was I would say I was

214
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:46.610
inspired by a story that a colleague told me a long time ago.
Um,

215
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.720
she was telling me about how her child has obsessive compulsive disorder and her

216
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:53.650
husband does as well.

217
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.980
And she was saying that it's so difficult for her to parent the child relative

218
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:03.430
to her husband because she doesn't intrinsically understand,
um,

219
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.700
the ways in which his OCD affects how he absorbs everything around him,

220
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.520
about the world.
So she said,
you know,
the family goes to the zoo,

221
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.860
he steps in a puddle,
gets a wet sock,

222
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.020
and then he has to go home and change a sock.

223
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:21.100
And she'll try to talk him out of it and say,
you know,
the whole family is here,

224
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:25.690
can't we just,
you know,
go without a shoe and a sock.
And her husband will say,

225
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.030
oh,
what SOC is intolerable?

226
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.380
Of course we have to go home and change your sock because he just has a much

227
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:36.940
more visceral understanding of how the child is experiencing that wet sock that

228
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:40.420
she not having OCD herself couldn't really understand.

229
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.970
So this was a story she told me.
And um,

230
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:44.590
I've thought about that a lot as a parent,

231
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:49.420
how you understand some of your children more easily than others because you

232
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.980
have traits in common with.
Um,

233
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.680
and so I tried to build this relationship where,
you know,

234
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.300
the stepmother's not a horrible person or a good person.

235
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:01.310
Cinderella is not a horrible person or a good person,

236
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:02.890
but they have this disconnect.
They,

237
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.420
the way that they are in the world is very different.

238
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.410
And the way Cinderella has been brought up is very different from how Agnes has

239
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:13.070
been brought up.
And so she doesn't,
she really doesn't understand the girl

240
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.830
in the beginning of the novel,
Agnes says,
and I love this line,

241
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.000
compelling fiction often obscures the humble truth.

242
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.420
How do you think very tales and folklore influence our expectations and

243
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:33.800
experiences in the real world?
I think that,

244
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.940
um,

245
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.940
I think fairy tales are so appealing because they're really morally ambiguous.

246
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.530
Just like marvel movies or you know,

247
00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:49.790
a lot of the stories that we absorb as children,

248
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.220
we know who the good guys are.
None of the bad guys are,

249
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.400
we know who to root for and we're going to be happy when the good guy wins.

250
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.080
And we really don't care when the bad guy gets blown up or has her eyes pecked

251
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:04.070
out by birds in the case of the stepsisters or because we know they're bad.

252
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.460
And so we don't have to waste a single moment feeling bad for them.

253
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.670
We can just clap your hands and say that was a great story.
Um,

254
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.080
I think that for children there are things that they can learn from fairy tales

255
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:19.220
about how to be generous,
how to be good,
how to be loyal and brave and so on.

256
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.790
So there are,
I think,
some good lessons to be learned from fairytales.

257
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.260
But I also think that our,
our natural tendency,

258
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:30.650
especially in the western world,
to put everything in categories,

259
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.890
this has been a way of thinking that has been very adaptive for Western society.

260
00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:39.380
You know,
from Greek logic on,
it's given us the enlightenment,

261
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.000
giving us computers,
you know,

262
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.990
the ability to put things in category and say if this then not that,
you know,

263
00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:46.880
this person is good,
this person is bad.

264
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:49.760
Sort of things that categories that are exclusive,

265
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.310
but those don't apply while the humans.

266
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.200
And I think that we have a tendency to want to use that same way of thinking,
um,

267
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.230
as applies to humans.
And it's very satisfying in a fairytale.

268
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:05.000
But in real life I think it really can trip us up because of course people

269
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:07.730
aren't good or bad,
you know,
he'd say I'm a good person.
Like,

270
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.380
well good relative to what,
like who are the bad people I'm comparing myself to.

271
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.240
Um,
and I think that gets us into these ways of thinking about,
you know,

272
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.660
people in jail.
It must be bad people because they're in jail.

273
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.310
And so therefore we can let us ourselves off the hook about sort of caring what

274
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:29.360
happens.
And we get into a tizzy when people we think are good people.
You know,

275
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:34.220
Comedians who made us laugh growing up who seemed like good people do terrible

276
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.530
things and then we don't know,

277
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.830
like our heads explode cause we don't know how to hold that in our head.

278
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:40.461
That wow,

279
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:44.990
this person who I had slotted in the category of good person is now having these

280
00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:48.980
behaviors that are,
that are bad.
And so,
um,

281
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.310
in this way,
the novel really is looking at the backstory.

282
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:57.900
So what if those categories that we put people in really don't exist?

283
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.550
And what if they're just people,

284
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.100
which feels so timely right now.
Not only in teams,

285
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:06.660
we work with our families,

286
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:11.661
but our society right now in our country right now where it's so divided and

287
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:16.791
just having moments of trying to see different perspectives is challenging but

288
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:21.120
so critical.
Yeah.

289
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.300
It's something that really stuck with me after reading this book.

290
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:29.130
Maybe I actually do spend some time with my father talking about politics.

291
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.310
Maybe.
Maybe understanding and backstory is is good.
Yeah.

292
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.440
But the time and these categories though,
there's the aesthetic part of it too.

293
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.620
And Danielle and I,
when we have been talking about the book before,

294
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.850
it was interesting because we shared an experience of the original Cinderella

295
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.220
fairytale or when we read this book,

296
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.750
it's really so lovely and beautiful and blonde with this teeny tiny little
waist.

297
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:58.590
And Danielle and I'm,
when we were growing up were like,
well,
you know,

298
00:18:58.591 --> 00:18:59.281
that's great,

299
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:02.400
but like we don't have long hair and like we don't fit that profile.

300
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.810
How that her figure is drawn.

301
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.770
So we felt really resonated more with his stepsisters.

302
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.511
And I'm just wondering,

303
00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:13.980
what do you think that does to people long term when you don't fit the idealized

304
00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:14.814
version of,

305
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.740
of the characters like Cinderella and you are,

306
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:25.250
you resonate with stepsisters who are seen as more evil and ugly and terrible

307
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.210
and all the things you don't want to be.
Yeah,
I thought about that a lot.

308
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.700
Writing the book and I think it's,
it's complicated.

309
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.620
It messed with my mind a bit when I was a kid,
right?
Cause I was this tall,

310
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:42.330
lanky,
dark haired person.
I didn't have like the blonde curls are the tiny feet.

311
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:44.050
And so when I would play games with my friends,

312
00:19:44.051 --> 00:19:45.960
so we played make believe I'd always have to be one of the boys,

313
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:49.330
have to be a man,
I'd have to be the villain often.
Um,

314
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.700
because I was much more manly.
And so,
uh,

315
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.880
I longed to be that delicate little thing.
You know,

316
00:19:56.881 --> 00:20:01.620
I longed to be that ideal of feminine beauty with the tiny feet and,
and so on.

317
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.550
But I also feel in some ways it was actually really good for me not to have

318
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:12.360
grown up feeling that I could be the Cinderella character because I think it

319
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:15.500
caused me to put all of that aside of like,
Nope,
I'm just,

320
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.700
I'm not going to be that pretty feminine,
a little thing.

321
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:21.150
So I may as well just ignore that.
I'll be aspirations,

322
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.110
the central aspiration that I think can be quite harmful for children.
You know,

323
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:27.480
this leaning in for the brass ring,

324
00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:29.860
the marriage that that's going to transform you.

325
00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:33.270
You're going to go through this portal and you'll be someone else coming out the

326
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:36.780
other side.
I didn't grow up with thinking any of that.

327
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.670
And I actually think that that turned out to be a good thing.

328
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.893
Um,

329
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.680
I also think it's really interesting because of course you can be beautiful and

330
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:51.300
not to society's expectations of what's beautiful.
And so with the step sisters,

331
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.880
I played with that a little bit.
So one of them is beautiful,

332
00:20:55.090 --> 00:21:00.070
but because fairness,
hair,
skin fair,
which means beautiful,

333
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:05.140
also means Pale.
And that was very much the sort of fetish in the Middle Ages.

334
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:07.690
Would you be pale,
pale,
pale,
as Pale as you possibly can be.

335
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.200
So one of them is dark skinned and doesn't,
you know,

336
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.850
fit that ideal of beauty even though she's beautiful.
Um,

337
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.170
but then the other sister is disfigured and does not,
you know,

338
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.040
even her mother doesn't think she's beautiful and um,

339
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.220
that's a really hard thing for her and that society,

340
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:30.400
especially in a society where people,
you know,

341
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:33.160
people still believed back then,
what was it called?

342
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.810
Physionomy the science that says that what you look like actually tells of your

343
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:38.644
character.

344
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.180
So I can tell by how broad your forehead is or how small your noses,

345
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:46.660
whether you're a mean person or a smart person.

346
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.210
So they actually in the Middle Age ages believed this.

347
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.820
So it was very hard for them to not conform to that beauty.
But the city,

348
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.620
the sister who is disfigured,

349
00:21:56.621 --> 00:22:00.280
who has no chance of anyone ever thinking she's beautiful,

350
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.830
it's actually very freed by that,
you know,

351
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:05.430
she doesn't give a fig what anyone thinks of her.

352
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.700
Like she's just been sort of released from so much of society's expectations

353
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:14.701
because she just has to put aside this idea that she could ever be that ideal of

354
00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:17.980
feminine beauty,
like her,
her stepsister,

355
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.740
and she becomes such an interesting character.

356
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:24.040
Like she does so much that it gives her this other kind of beauty.

357
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.990
But she's the one who we've met for

358
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:32.530
Agnes goes through so many challenges through the book.
So much upheaval,

359
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.170
so much he has to fight for.

360
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.370
You have the title is all the ever afters where,
where is that title comes up?

361
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.180
So it has kind of a double meaning.

362
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.800
One of the meanings is that threat our life and Agnes is very typical of this.

363
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.860
I think that we,
there are these,
um,

364
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.980
it's like climbing a mountain where you have these sort of false peaks and you

365
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:55.450
think,
oh,
I just get up there,

366
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.830
then I'm going to be totally happy if I just get into this university.

367
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.230
If I just get this job that I want,

368
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.090
if I just get this spouse or I've only,

369
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:11.230
I could become a parent or you know,
all of these things that you think,
okay,

370
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.690
when I get to that place,
when I win this award,

371
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:15.760
when I get this grant and then I'm going to be happy.

372
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.170
And of course we get to that place and it is happy.
It's not bad,

373
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.230
but it's never the ever after.
You know,
then life goes on after that and it's,

374
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.400
you're never at the pinnacle.

375
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:31.840
And so I think of life as a series of happily ever after is Cinderella,

376
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:34.540
get married.
But her life doesn't end there.
You know,
she's happy,

377
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:35.470
she gets married to prince,

378
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.830
but it goes on and Agnes is life is this sort of series of events good and bad

379
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.710
and none of them are ever after until the very end.
Um,

380
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.620
the other meaning,
one of the things I find really fascinating about stories,

381
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:56.621
cause I think that we really look at life through a narrative lens is,

382
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.420
um,
when a story has a happy ending.
Like,

383
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.280
if you and I are in competing in a spelling bee and you win,
I would,

384
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.080
I doubt that would happen.
But okay.
But then you get your happily ever after,

385
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:12.380
right?
Like that man.
But the story includes me too.

386
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.220
And so your story is the happy and mine as the,
Oh,
I'm so sad,
you know,

387
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.170
because my dreams are crushed.

388
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.250
And so that's the other meaning of all the ever afters.

389
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:22.940
This is not just about one person,
you know,

390
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:26.900
it's not just about Cinderella is about Cinderella's stepmother and her dad,

391
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:28.700
her stepsisters,
you know,

392
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:31.960
it's about everybody's rafters.

393
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.340
So Ela is described throughout your novel is somewhat of a spoiled child,

394
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.900
incredibly different from the idolized Cinderella's that we all know.

395
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.150
Yet she's far more dimensional,
dimensional,
and realized.

396
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.920
How did you design that character?
So,

397
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.440
uh,
so getting back to,

398
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.020
I wanted there to be this disconnect between the stepmother and her
stepdaughter.

399
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.410
And I thought about what is Cinderella like from the fairy tale that we hear?

400
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:10.880
She's sweet,
she's kind,
she's very quiet,

401
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.610
she's obese.
She always follows the rules.

402
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.590
She's maybe friends with animals and the Disney version.

403
00:25:16.591 --> 00:25:20.300
And actually in the Grimm brothers first version as well.
And,
um,

404
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.690
so I wanted to create a character where she could be like a real,

405
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.420
cause that doesn't sound like a real,
I mean as a parent you think,

406
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:31.200
but that's pretty one dimensional.
Again,

407
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.700
I can't imagine a child who's on Lido things.
Um,

408
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.970
but I thought that people who are not neurotypical often have some of this

409
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:45.770
traits like,
you know,
being more rule following and so on.

410
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:51.100
And I'm surrounded by people like that in Palo Alto and in my family.

411
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.850
And I just thought,
I just said,
you know,

412
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.450
like I could see that disconnect between somebody who grew up in a,

413
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:02.300
in a very rough and tumble world,

414
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.400
living with this girl who had many privileges,
who sort of,

415
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:09.470
hasn't learned the same life lessons,

416
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.610
but who also just has a very different way of seeing the world.
You know,

417
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:17.720
she's so much quieter.
She just isn't,
she doesn't have the same.
Um,

418
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:19.811
uh,
Agnes,

419
00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:24.080
his daughters are very like physical and someone and she's much more like,

420
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.040
I think she describes her at one point like,
um,
uh,

421
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.620
like sun sparkling on the water.
You know,
it's just,

422
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.180
there's something about her that's a bit more dreamy,
that's a bit more interior.

423
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.613
And uh,

424
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.540
so I wanted to make it so that the Cinderella character wouldn't be spoiled.

425
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.170
Like I,
I didn't intend for to come across that way.
And I,

426
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:48.750
I think one of the things that's a real challenge is the story is told in the

427
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:52.800
first person.
So you really only get Agnes,
his view of everybody.

428
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.120
And so I had to show that she's feeling disconnected from this child and,

429
00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:00.780
but I tried to have other characters in the story come in and show how much they

430
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:03.090
love the Cinderella character.
You know,

431
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:07.770
how much they think she's this wonderful tiles,
which she is,
she's just,
you know,

432
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:10.350
from Agnes perspective,
they just have this disconnect.

433
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:12.540
So that was what I was trying to go for with,

434
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:17.040
so that you can understand how Agnes was not the best step parents or her,

435
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.250
but you could also see that it's not Cinderella's vaults.
You know,

436
00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:23.640
that other people adore her and think she's the best.

437
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.620
But I think she's also described at some point as almost a vessel for anyone

438
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:34.620
that she comes in contact with because she is maybe less three dimensional than

439
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:40.320
one might imagine that people could put their own desires of who she should be

440
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.670
upon her.
Yeah.
Although that was more a commentary on celebrity.

441
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.840
So what I was thinking of there is how we admire,

442
00:27:47.841 --> 00:27:52.410
they do these gorgeous human beings in Hollywood or elsewhere or like Princess

443
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.260
Diana.
Um,
when I was a kid,
you know,

444
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.170
people got up in the middle of the night to watch the royal wedding and it was

445
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.920
such a big deal and we all got our hair cut like that and we all wear the little

446
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.110
really corny.
Sure.
Different.

447
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.560
So we all wanted to dress like her,
but we didn't know anything about her.

448
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:13.860
I mean she was a celebrity.
She was an unknown.

449
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:17.710
She was a blank parchment and she was that person that we all have your

450
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.350
belongings.

451
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.350
They sort of [inaudible] longings that we projected at her or at movie stars.

452
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.290
Um,
but it's not about who they are as people.

453
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:31.740
It's really about our own desires and our own longings.

454
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:37.380
So who I loved most in the book is our main character,
Agnes.
She's so strong.

455
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:38.430
She's so resilient.

456
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.620
She fights so hard for what she believes in and for the people that she loves,

457
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.980
she says at one point in the book to her two daughters,

458
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.660
every woman's serves a master via an overlord or a husband.

459
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:56.040
And she's fortunate if he does not beat her or treat her cruelly.

460
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.750
Everything you have I got for you,
either through marriage or hard work,

461
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.250
there is no alternative.

462
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:08.270
The men in his novel are often hairless and even cool while the women show

463
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:14.930
resilience and care.
Can you talk about your choice of a writer?

464
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:22.790
So I'm not sure there's such a stark line between the men and the women,

465
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.990
but certainly Cinderella is a story about women and women's lives.
And you know,

466
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.480
throughout the world and over history,

467
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:34.890
women have often been treated much more like possessions than like real people.

468
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:39.390
So I wanted to show,
even though the women lived within a very narrow sphere,

469
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:44.380
I wanted to show the full sort of richness of their lives and their,

470
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:49.330
their characters.
Um,
but I mean they're not all great people.

471
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:53.950
In fact,
some of the people who torture Agnes the most,
there's her boss,

472
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:58.750
the nurse when she,
a kid who's pretty evil and toward her.
And then,

473
00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.411
um,
you know,

474
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:04.390
much of her disappointment comes from the Abas who she at first admire so much.

475
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.260
And so,

476
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:10.180
so the women are certainly not perfect characters and I think that the men are,

477
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.840
they are a little bit more side characters because it is a story about women.
Um,

478
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.630
but I think that they're also very,
very complicated.

479
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:21.631
And part of why I think we see them as a more negative is again,

480
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:26.710
because we're seeing them through Agnes as eyes and she's a very complicated

481
00:30:26.711 --> 00:30:31.711
relationship with men because she lives in a society where it's impossible for

482
00:30:31.751 --> 00:30:34.130
her to have a relationship of equals with a man.

483
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.760
It's just not set up that way and she knows it.

484
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.350
And she really resents the fact that they have so much more freedom that and so

485
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:43.120
many more entitlements than she has,

486
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.900
but at the same time she needs them to be able to survive,

487
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:49.300
to be able to get ahead and do what she wants in her life.

488
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:54.990
And so she's got this complex relationship where when she feels any sort of

489
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:58.840
tenderness toward a man,
it feels to her a little bit like weakness.

490
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.680
And so I don't know if maybe it was hard to pick up in the book,

491
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:03.850
but I was trying to get at,

492
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:08.851
especially with her husband when she marries Cinderella's father that he's

493
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:11.980
completely besotted with her.
Like he really loves her,

494
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.660
but she can't admit that to herself because it's just too complicated.
You know,

495
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:19.810
she,
she needs to like hold that at arm's length because,

496
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.830
and sort of stick with I need to take care of me and you take care of my kids.

497
00:31:23.831 --> 00:31:28.510
Like this is,
I can't let myself get too soft.

498
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.813
Right?
Yeah.

499
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.480
When mentoring women is definitely something I think a lot of us think about and

500
00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:39.400
certainly something that I think about a lot and I've benefited from and I try

501
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:43.210
to actively make time to help with.

502
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.610
It's definitely a theme in the book,

503
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.870
both in really beautiful and powerful positive ways,

504
00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:54.520
but also in hurtful,
tragic ways.

505
00:31:55.690 --> 00:32:00.400
Can you talk about that and a little bit?
Sure.
Um,
so,

506
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.960
uh,
so Cinderella,
Cinderella,
Agnes,
the stepmother is a barn,

507
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:09.390
a peasant.
And so she of course is completely,
she had no access to education.
Um,

508
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.560
but she,
she wants to read when she's a servant,
when this elderly,

509
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.430
very wealthy,

510
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.980
very powerful countess who maybe it's somewhat eccentric for the times.

511
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:20.670
She,

512
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:25.480
she believes in girls potential and so she teaches her to read.

513
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.433
Um,

514
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.560
and it's not a coincidence that the daughter of this countess is the very

515
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:37.170
powerful Abas who is the fairy godmother,
not magical,

516
00:32:37.171 --> 00:32:39.860
just that she's the godmother figure in the story.

517
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.840
And young Agnes when she's a teenager has,
uh,

518
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:50.050
she's really drawn to this very smart and charismatic woman who is one of the

519
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:55.700
most powerful people in a very religious country at the time.

520
00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.410
And so she wants to follow her,
like her heart just goes to this woman and,

521
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.780
um,
she decides that she wants to join the church and to sort of follow in her

522
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:10.340
footsteps.
Um,
but what she can't see,
I mean,
there's,

523
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.650
there's a class division,

524
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.260
so she doesn't quite understand the way in which being of such low birth means

525
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.820
there was never any chance at this.

526
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.180
But also I wanted for the Abas to be a character who has achieved great things,

527
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:27.420
but then kind of pulled up the ladder after herself.
You know,
when I was,
um,

528
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.310
when I was in medical school back in the early nineties,

529
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.510
there were some of the women doctors I really admired,

530
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.000
especially in the fields that were very male dominated at the time,

531
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:42.660
like surgery and cardiology,
who were really neat.

532
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.030
Um,
and at the time we,

533
00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.170
we've said of the my fellow female students than I,

534
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:53.000
that if they had to be that way in order to make it in such a tough field at

535
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:53.751
such a tough time,

536
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:58.220
like if they hadn't had that sort of personality or that like rough exterior

537
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.550
that they would not have been able to make it.

538
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.350
And I think that the Abas is one of those sorts of people.

539
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.280
But as I've gotten older,
I've also felt like,
oh,

540
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.370
it a little bit to the women who came behind them not to pull up the ladder

541
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:15.920
quite so hard behind them.
And I,

542
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.280
I wondered how much being a powerful woman in a male dominated world makes you

543
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.580
feel even better about yourself than if there were a lot of other successful

544
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:29.720
women.
Because maybe that makes you even more special,
that you're the only one,

545
00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:34.550
you know,
you're the only one who could make it.
So that's,
that's character.

546
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.670
She fulfills a bit of that.
That's where that role

547
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.660
and it's so true too.
There is really a truth in that.
Um,

548
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.230
I want to open this up to folks here have,
have questions for,
and Danielle,

549
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:51.920
I didn't want to dominate her completely,
although I have plenty more to ask her.

550
00:34:51.921 --> 00:34:53.460
But um,
yes,

551
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.240
sure.
So I started,
um,

552
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.890
working on this book when I was still working full time as a physician,

553
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:19.130
but then I later quit and the hemo full time writer.

554
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.060
So at first I was mostly working on airplanes flying back and forth across the

555
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:27.590
country because I was working in Boston and living in California if it is kind

556
00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:28.250
of nuts.

557
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.940
And so I read a lot of books about the middle ages to try to get some of those

558
00:35:31.941 --> 00:35:35.750
details right.
Um,
and then when I started writing full time,
uh,

559
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.530
I really tried to it like a job,
just like when I had to go into my workplace.

560
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.770
So I have the luxury of being able to start later in the morning.

561
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:46.890
I get to go exercise first thing in the morning and I don't have to,

562
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.730
nobody's paying attention to when I actually get onto my computer.

563
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.920
But I really try to sort of set aside those hours from sort of mid morning until

564
00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.360
time to start making dinner and just,
and just work through.
And it's not,

565
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.800
at least for me,

566
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:06.830
it's not possible to be productive and creative through that entire period.

567
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.860
But I,
I try when I'm feel like I'm running out of steam,

568
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.390
I try to spend time doing other things like research for other projects or for

569
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:19.560
that project or sort of like reading and background,
um,

570
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.520
other ways to,
so that it's still part of my,
my work day.

571
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.960
Cause I think it's really easy as a writer to just procrastinate and for things

572
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:30.210
to go year after year without getting done.

573
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:35.190
So the book was set in a medieval setting.
So you did quite a bit of research.

574
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.110
I'm imagining for this book.

575
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:40.650
I know you've visited castle hearing about some of your trips.

576
00:36:40.651 --> 00:36:44.710
Can you talk a little bit about that part of the process?
Yeah,

577
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:45.930
so mostly I,

578
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.290
I read books in the beginning just about what medieval villages where,

579
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:52.260
like with medieval castle for like that sort of thing to get a sense of,

580
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.950
of the life.
But a lot of it was on Google and youtube.

581
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.770
It's amazing how much you can find out.
You know,

582
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:03.240
there are people who are hobbyists who brew beer in a medieval style.

583
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.350
You can actually go on youtube and watch somebody making medieval beer.

584
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:11.790
And so I learned so much by people who've done this research for their own

585
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:16.530
amusement.
Um,
so that,
yeah,
so that was a big part of it.
And you know,

586
00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:20.100
one of the things I discovered when I was doing the research is that there's not

587
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:22.590
much known about the poor people from the Middle Ages.

588
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.780
So the rich people who could read and write,

589
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.050
we have a fairly good records at least of who married who,

590
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:30.810
and then the kid was home and all that sort of stuff.
But,
um,

591
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.680
for the illiterate poor,
nobody was writing anything about them.

592
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:39.681
And so we actually know very little what we do know is mostly from having exempt

593
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:43.410
bones from graveyards and looking at what ages children died and trying to

594
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:46.240
figure out what children died from.
And um,
the,

595
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.590
the few tax records that existed at the time.
Tell us a little bit about the,

596
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.680
the villages and so on,
like you know,

597
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:57.330
who had to pay taxes on how many oxygen.
Um,
and that's kind of it,

598
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.750
which actually it was very comforting to me because I was really worried about

599
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:03.390
getting historical details wrong and then I realized,

600
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:06.880
well even the historians are arguing about what actually happened.

601
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.060
So I felt a little more laxed after that.

602
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.170
Do other folks have have questions for Danielle?

603
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.930
I have one I was wondering about in thinking about this discussion,

604
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.720
so you have children and stepchildren.

605
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.020
If they were to write a book

606
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.990
with you included,

607
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:32.700
what do you think the title would be of my book about me written from your

608
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:37.350
children?
It would be
what's for dinner?

609
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.280
<v 0>I'm serious.
I mean that's how kids are,
right?</v>

610
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:45.090
Like they don't really see their parents as people.

611
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:49.600
<v 1>Oh,
there it is.
Like,
this is,
the story would go like this.
There's this nice,</v>

612
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.290
once upon a time there was this nice lady,
she cooked really good food.

613
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:58.510
I love her.
Okay.
That's kind of,

614
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:02.590
I think that's,
it should be,
you know.
Okay.
They've got their own stuff going on.

615
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:08.130
So what are you working on now?
Okay,
so right now I'm working on then,
you know,

616
00:39:08.131 --> 00:39:11.110
I mentioned I had this mobile in the back of my mind for 10 years.
Well,

617
00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:14.390
so I finally got around to,
I'm writing that.
MMM.

618
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.820
So it's not historical fiction.
That's actually,

619
00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:21.821
is that in 2003 which isn't that historical and it takes place in Canada,

620
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.710
in Toronto during,

621
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:26.920
there was a big blackout in the northeast of the United States and a big chunk

622
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:31.110
of Canada in August of 2003.
And,
um,

623
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.430
the inspiration for the story was the poem,

624
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.590
the love Song of jail for Prufrock by Tsl yet,

625
00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.830
which is one of my very favorite poems.
Okay.
MMM.

626
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.730
And if you're not familiar with it,
it's,
uh,

627
00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:47.800
it's narrated by a character who is approaching or in middle age.
Okay.

628
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:52.060
Who has a big okay decision.
A challenging decision to make.
Yeah.

629
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:56.360
It sounds like it's a of a romantic nature that we never find out what exactly

630
00:39:56.361 --> 00:39:58.480
what this choices.
Yeah.
Okay.

631
00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:03.150
But what's so tragic about the poem is that he knows even before he made the

632
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:05.770
choice did he doesn't have the guts to do it.
Yeah.

633
00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.480
And the reason is that he lives in such a comfortable life.

634
00:40:08.481 --> 00:40:11.330
He's got this very upper middle class comfortable life.

635
00:40:11.331 --> 00:40:13.640
Like I have measured out my days with coffee spoons,
you know,

636
00:40:13.641 --> 00:40:16.140
the women come and go.
Speaking of Michelangelo,

637
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.190
all this lines that talk about the sprinklers on the streets and just,

638
00:40:20.191 --> 00:40:23.720
it's just this beautiful comfortable life and he just cannot smash that all to

639
00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:28.460
bits to do this.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Which is,
he might have,
yeah.

640
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.370
The courage to do.
And so in my story,
the,
um,

641
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:38.240
the prefect character is a woman in her sixties who's planning the birthday

642
00:40:38.241 --> 00:40:40.690
party of her mother.
And Ah,

643
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.090
there's the other main character is her daughter in law and we sort of watch

644
00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:48.800
their parallel lives even though they're 25,
30 years apart in age.

645
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:49.460
Um,

646
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:54.460
they have very similar trajectories of their lives and they come together at a

647
00:40:55.171 --> 00:40:57.480
certain point and then they take berry different paths.

648
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.350
So the older woman is the one who didn't have the courage to take a chance.

649
00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:07.300
And the younger woman,
um,
sort of smashes everything apart by she yeah.

650
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.730
Leaves her husband for a woman she's falling in love with at work and just,

651
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.410
you know,
right.
Creates havoc.

652
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.080
And it sort of follows both of them through the blackout where they each have

653
00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:22.680
their sort of separate epiphany's about their choices and okay.
No,

654
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.480
yeah.
Done in the world.

655
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.440
And the reason I chose to set it during the blackout is that my brothers were

656
00:41:28.441 --> 00:41:29.830
both living in Toronto at the time.

657
00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:34.831
And they told me about how it was when all the lights went out,

658
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.140
that people actually came out of their houses and onto their stoops and they

659
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:41.780
talk to their neighbors and people had barbecues,

660
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:46.010
they had block parties basically because that was the only way you can eat with,

661
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:51.130
okay.
Grill your food.
And so I think in a black hat can go different,

662
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:52.160
have very different ways.
I mean,

663
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:54.740
there could have been rioting and looting and it could have been horrible,

664
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:58.440
but it turned out that it was,
people volunteered to go direct traffic.

665
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.500
It was just this very,
it really brought the city together.

666
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:05.860
And so I think for the jail,
for Prufrock characters,

667
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.670
she has lived her life in fear and then she sees that humanity does have this

668
00:42:09.671 --> 00:42:10.504
goodness.

669
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:14.070
And I think that that really sort of causes her to realize that maybe the fierce

670
00:42:14.071 --> 00:42:17.290
has been living under business place.
Oh,
sounds so good.

671
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.830
When is it going to come out?
I'm going to get it done.

672
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.650
We'll look forward to that.
So unless,

673
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:26.450
unless folks have have other thoughts or questions.
Yes.

674
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.570
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
uh,
yes.

675
00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:35.720
I can repeat the question for you.
MMM.

676
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.470
If you were to write about another fairy tale and take on a different

677
00:42:40.471 --> 00:42:44.670
perspective,
what would that be?
Okay,
yeah.
Yeah.

678
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.560
So that's a really great question.
Um,
I have thought about it.
I haven't thought,

679
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.890
I haven't come up with a great answer.

680
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:54.040
One of my favorite fairy tales is a beauty and the beast.

681
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.670
I really liked that bell has a little more agency than Cinderella.
You know,

682
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:03.550
she's,
she,
she,
and she's really making choices for other people in her life.
MMM.

683
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:08.010
So I liked that fairytale.
Yeah.
Yes.
The twist I haven't really come up with,

684
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.770
I really like that the,
um,
so the original fairytale,

685
00:43:11.771 --> 00:43:16.620
some people think is based MMM.
A man who had,

686
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.100
um,

687
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:22.100
hypertrichosis so he had this very rare genetic disease where he was basically

688
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:24.850
covered in hair.
People with this condition,

689
00:43:24.851 --> 00:43:26.710
they can grow hair all over their bodies.
And so he,

690
00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:31.570
his face was all covered my hair and he married this beautiful woman.
MMM.

691
00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:35.410
He was upperclass in France and married a beautiful woman.

692
00:43:35.411 --> 00:43:38.580
And so I love that story because,
okay.

693
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.500
What I don't like about beauty and the beast is that he turns into,
uh,
prints.

694
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:46.360
Literally,
he has to turn into this vein for her to like really be like,
okay,

695
00:43:46.361 --> 00:43:47.194
now I'll marry you.

696
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.640
But I really liked the idea that he becomes beautiful in her eyes because she

697
00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:54.820
falls in love with him.
So I've been playing with that.

698
00:43:54.821 --> 00:43:58.320
I haven't quite come up with the right sort of take on it,
but I,

699
00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.200
if I were to do a twist,
it would be that he doesn't turn beautiful.

700
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.350
She just sees him as beautiful because she loves him so much.

701
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.360
Yeah,
you should write that one too.

702
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.920
All right.
Well thank you so much and thanks everybody for joining us.

703
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.360
<v 0>Thanks.</v>
