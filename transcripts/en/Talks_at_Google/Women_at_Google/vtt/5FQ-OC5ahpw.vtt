1
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.470
Thank you guys for coming to watch me make cupcakes.

2
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.500
I was like love for this to be interactive and really laid back.

3
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.670
So if anybody has any questions or wants me to talk about something specific,

4
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.670
like you could blurt it out or you could like,
hey,

5
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.600
hey or whatever.
Are you the microphone?
Um,

6
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.870
we're going to do two things together today.

7
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:38.070
First I'm going to make three of our seven limited edition Valentine's Day

8
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.580
flavors would you have here,
which I highly recommend getting.

9
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:45.360
Obviously I'm Melissa from baked by Melissa and I want you to purchase our

10
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.550
product that I worked so hard to create,

11
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:52.551
but also our Valentine's Day collection are some of the best flavors we've ever

12
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:57.771
had before and it's our busiest time of year and I'm just like most proud of

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.700
these so I highly recommend them.
Also the packaging is beautiful.

14
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.710
Have this love letter,
gift box.
I'm sorry I have to,
I'm so proud.

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.300
It's like it's my child.

16
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.170
Just a little fun fact is that I used to work at Deutsch advertising,

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.440
which had its office on the 14th floor and my cubicle was like there and I was

18
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:23.940
fired from my job there and that's ultimately what got me baking.

19
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.550
Or I was baking,
but like starting baked by Melissa.

20
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.870
So this is super cool and full circle and I'm very honored to be here.

21
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.850
<v 1>MMM.
And I'm</v>

22
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.200
<v 0>pregnant.
It's not cupcakes.</v>

23
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.530
Okay.
Anyway,
so I'm going to be three flavors.

24
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:48.390
The first flavor is my absolute favorite flavor.
It's our dark chocolate cupcake.

25
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.620
I love dark chocolate.

26
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:52.380
I eat a piece of dark chocolate every night before I go to sleep.

27
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.330
Now I'm just going to pop one of these.

28
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.200
It's so weird that we've never done this before cause it's so simple.

29
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.310
And if you've ever been curious as to how we make the cupcakes now you'll see

30
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.380
and you could totally apply this at home.

31
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.060
If you feel like stuffing your own cupcakes.
Oh,
probably be a little bit bigger.

32
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.450
And we start selling the pan.
But in order to stuff a cupcake,

33
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:17.370
all you have to do is put your icing or filling in a pastry bag and puncture the

34
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:22.170
cupcake and just like squeeze.
It's so simple.

35
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.860
I actually used to,
um,
when we first started the company,

36
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.640
I'm not like opera.
I mean now I'm pretty operational,
but um,

37
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.690
I used to use a knife to cut a hole in every cupcake and then stuff it and then,

38
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.200
um,
a few years ago I realize you could just do this,
you know,

39
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.720
they sell like those things that like the course for the crab cakes.

40
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.670
This is a dark chocolate ganache and this is our each dark chocolate icing.

41
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.800
If you happen to have cakes by Melissa my cookbook or get wine,

42
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.300
there was a chocolate icing recipe.

43
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:02.110
If you switch out the Hershey's cocoa powder for the Hershey's dark cocoa

44
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:05.950
powder,
you'll get a dark chocolate icing.

45
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:10.930
And it's so good.
Have you guys tried this one?
It was the ones,

46
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.060
uh,
topped with mini chocolate chips in the pink and red nonpareils.

47
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.700
Really good.
It's so good.
Um,

48
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.990
and then after we do these three flavors,

49
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.690
the next flavor is going to be cookies in milk,

50
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.060
which is like a vanilla version of cookie dough.

51
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.220
And it's also made with a chips Ahoy cookie icing.
Um,

52
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.490
because like I just really liked dessert and snacks and that's kind of how I

53
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.710
create.
So when I was thinking about doing a cookies and milk flavor,

54
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.650
I knew that needed to have chips or the cookies because when I was drawing up,

55
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.740
like that's the could use in load means to me,
you know,
dipping the chips,

56
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.790
like cookie in the milk and then like letting bubbles come up and still got

57
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.724
soggy.

58
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.290
<v 2>Oh my God,
I'm lying.
I'm not drink milk.</v>

59
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.470
<v 0>I'm doing,
um,
salted Caramel Pretzel,</v>

60
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:18.730
which I think we call white chocolate white chocolate pretzel.

61
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.250
So this one's good too.

62
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.643
<v 2>MMM.</v>

63
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.170
<v 0>It's all dates alleged,
Jay.
And the icing is actually okay.
But like here,</v>

64
00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:30.610
it's a perfect example.
The icing is a pretzel ice.

65
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.000
So I wanted,
uh,
to figure out a way to do like a salty,

66
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:40.001
sweet type of cupcake without just doing something basic like salted caramel.

67
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.530
And so I decided to put pretzels in the icing and the brittle.

68
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:54.020
So this is like white chocolate mixed with ground pretzels.

69
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.460
And then you tried it.
I hope you liked it,
but it's salty and sweet.

70
00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:02.750
And to me it tastes like pretzels and caramel and it's amazing.

71
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.300
So I'm just gonna Finish icing these and top them and then we'll do the last

72
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:10.191
flavor.

73
00:05:10.191 --> 00:05:15.191
And then after that I am going to make a layer cake for you guys.

74
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.780
Can you talk about,

75
00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:22.130
do you still come up with all the new flavors yourself or do you have a team or

76
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.460
how involved are you still in that?
Awesome.
That's a great question.

77
00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:27.470
I'm very much involved in that process.

78
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.920
I create and conceptualize every new flavor and products that we create.

79
00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:36.930
I'm sorry,
I like,
I'm a little add.
I get out of breath randomly.

80
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.370
Sometimes it's like new.
I think it's because of that.

81
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.200
<v 2>Um,
but I saw,
I apologize.</v>

82
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.450
Um,
okay.

83
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.420
<v 0>What happens is I,
so I actually,</v>

84
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.700
I met my husband the day we opened our very first store.
It's a great,

85
00:05:55.701 --> 00:05:56.930
crazy story of how we started the,

86
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.790
he is part of it and they wound up hiring him and the two of us used to ice

87
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.130
every single cupcake together.
Uh,

88
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.020
like the first two years that we were in business.

89
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:11.021
And then now he works in the bakery and I'm in corporate and my role is

90
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:14.960
president and chief product officer.

91
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:18.350
So I create and conceptualize everything,

92
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:22.100
but then he brings it to production.
So we kind of worked together.

93
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.540
So like I'll be like make a pretzel icing and he'll be like,

94
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.150
or this brittle for example,

95
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.210
like you have to be able to produce it to make thousands of them.

96
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.410
So sometimes in my requests are a little silly,
but he always figures that way,

97
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.230
ways to make them work.
Um,

98
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.630
and sometimes even takes what I've either created once or I'm asking for.

99
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:47.720
It makes it even better.
It's a very fortunate partnership.

100
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.580
The last of the three flavors that I am making is chocolate cookie dough.

101
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.950
So cookie dough and cookies,

102
00:06:56.951 --> 00:07:01.951
flavors in general are like a very popular thing for us.

103
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:03.710
Like everyone loves them.

104
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.430
So this is like a chocolate version of cookie dough.

105
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.530
It is chocolate cake.

106
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.120
The stuffing is a chocolate version of cookie dough,

107
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:18.440
so it has like cocoa in it and it's like salty and sweet and delicious.

108
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.570
It's ice and vanilla icing and it's topped with um,

109
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.910
cookie dough chocolate cookie dough that is here.

110
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.390
It kind of looks like the poop Emoji,
but there's,

111
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.410
there's a picture as well that we print on top to make it look like it.

112
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.380
It works.
It's crazy.
Um,
but my pink chocolate did it melt so well.

113
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.420
So you're just going to get the,

114
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.540
the cookie topic.

115
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.230
And those are three of the Valentine's safe flavors.

116
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.630
I don't know where my blogs are all here.

117
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.640
So then you literally just like,
I would have put gloves on.

118
00:08:03.641 --> 00:08:06.250
It's just like neater and easily,
but it's not big deal.

119
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.560
And that's the chocolate cookie cupcake.
It gets confusing.

120
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:14.830
We have cookies and cream.
We have cookie dough,
we have chocolate cookie dough.

121
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.460
If you have a double cookie flavor,
which is coming back soon.

122
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.210
But like these are so good and cookies or cake or even more of music.

123
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.690
Okay.
Does anybody want a freshly cupcake baked by Melissa.

124
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.630
Okay,
so that's part one.
That's just like,
you know why I'm here.

125
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.890
Bite sized cupcakes.
They're really amazing.
I love,

126
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:50.090
I could ice cupcakes all day long.
I used to for like two years,

127
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:52.760
that's all I did was ice and bake cupcakes

128
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.730
and I couldn't have happier.
But we grew the business though.
No,

129
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.940
I do a lot of things.

130
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.250
So in October I came out with a book that I wrote,

131
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.170
it's called cakes by Melissa.

132
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.030
And the reason that I felt like I needed to write a book was because I had all

133
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:15.090
of these recipes if my head that I've been using for baked by Melissa all the

134
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:19.500
time.
And even though you can't like make bite sized cupcakes,

135
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:24.501
I really wanted the reader to be able to like think the way I think and like get

136
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.700
creative the way I create.

137
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.390
So I think it achieved that and it kind of takes you through my creative process

138
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:38.730
of like coming up with these legs,
random flavor profiles,

139
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:43.680
starting with a very base like vanilla cake as an example.

140
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.820
And then adding one or two ingredients and that the op like that you can make

141
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:48.291
anything.

142
00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:53.291
If you take your vanilla cake base and replaced the liquid,

143
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:55.620
which is whole milk with strawberry puree,

144
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:57.840
you get this like balm strawberry cake.

145
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:01.110
And it's crazy and it's super simple and people always think that baking is like

146
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:05.040
crazy and really complicated.
But I don't think it is.

147
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.060
So the cake that I'm going to make for you guys today is the tie dye cake

148
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.330
because that's why we're here.
But like we don't have a ton of time together.

149
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:22.200
So the cake is already made and my husband made it,

150
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.980
he sent it to us,
but so it's big.

151
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:30.100
So it sounded like one of our sheet pants from the bakery.
Um,

152
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.410
and I like to make my layer cakes this way because

153
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.530
I don't like the crust.
And like obviously if you in the,

154
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:45.070
in the book the recipe is for like,
uh,
like a quarter.
She,

155
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.400
um,
because that's normal,
but you know,

156
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.520
we got this one so we,

157
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.660
you wouldn't have as much scrap as I'm going to have.
So don't judge.

158
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.300
And I used the scrap to decorate the cake too,

159
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:04.470
but you take like six inch or however big you want your cake to be.

160
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:05.670
Amazon is amazing.

161
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:09.360
You could get like anything you need on Amazon and you don't have to be a baker.

162
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.770
You could Google recipes,

163
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:15.420
you could get cakes by Melissa and use those recipes

164
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.010
and order everything you need and then just have a lot of fun.

165
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:24.210
So I actually didn't know that these things existed until I searched on Amazon

166
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:28.980
because I wanted to be able to make cakes of all sizes when I was recipe
testing.

167
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.650
So I like to punch out my layers because then it's like the whole cake is

168
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:36.640
delicious,
you know,

169
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.090
layer one got my vanilla icing.

170
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.330
She's anyone know the three ingredients in vanilla icing,

171
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.100
sugar.
Great,
but sugar,
but I'll extract.

172
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.210
It's not,
it's like so easy.

173
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.510
I actually added a little bit of whole milk to this because when I'm spreading

174
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.691
on cake,

175
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:06.580
you know how it can get really messy if this just makes it like a much

176
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.180
<v 2>like smoother consistency and it's much to see.
It's like so easy</v>

177
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.210
<v 0>sell little icing between each layer.</v>

178
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.780
And I like it.
So before I really,
again,

179
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:27.400
like I wanted to write a book but I wasn't sure how I would get like the bite

180
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:30.730
sized cupcakes through and this like book that I knew,

181
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:34.660
I couldn't like give you recipes for me cause it's impossible to bake them.

182
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.150
And that's when I learned how to make cakes.

183
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.150
Like I had obviously made cakes before,

184
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:42.580
but I had like never really put together a layer cake.

185
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.390
So I'm telling you like I'm not just saying this like obviously yes,

186
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.670
I work with my hands for a living and I made cupcakes.

187
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:51.280
But like if I could put together these cakes,

188
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:55.690
I'm like not the neatest person in the world then anyone can.

189
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.730
So that's layer two.
It's like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

190
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:07.270
and then more of an owl I think.
Does anyone have any other questions?

191
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.710
Like what do you want me to talk about?

192
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.590
So you mentioned that people really go crazy for the cookie flavors.

193
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.750
And so I was just curious what,
um,

194
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.530
things like metrics like that have to do with your flavor development.

195
00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:24.531
Like do you kind of use those metrics to figure out next laborers and how do you

196
00:13:25.081 --> 00:13:27.630
do that but also keep to like what you want your tastes to be?

197
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.200
That's a great question.
So luckily I've found that like,

198
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.730
for the most part,
I mean I'm not a vanilla person.
It's like,

199
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.150
believe it or are the tie dye cupcake is our number one seller.

200
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:43.390
Like thank goodness it is our signature flavor.
It makes complete sense.

201
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:47.530
It's great for our brand,
but it's like not by like go to,
it's my daughter's,

202
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:52.180
she loves it.
Um,
but with that said,

203
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.520
like for the most part,
like I know when a flavor is going to be amazing.

204
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.890
So like the dark chocolate,

205
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:04.891
like as soon as I tasted and did a happy dance and it's like selling so well

206
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:06.710
right now.
Um,

207
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.640
we obviously like look at the data every week.

208
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:14.390
Actually Mondays are dedicated to that sales meetings to go over the previous

209
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:14.391
week.

210
00:14:14.391 --> 00:14:18.650
And one of the reports we look at is the cupcakes and how they sold all cart

211
00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:22.400
because that's super helpful for me and product development.

212
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And I know that the baked by Melissa customer loves like Vanilla and chocolate

213
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:35.480
and cookies
and like stoner type like you know,

214
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.930
it's like whole baked by Melissa.

215
00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:40.580
It's like the double cookies like Oreo cookie dough chocolate,

216
00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:44.810
like it's so good.
Um,
and that's like what I like,

217
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.620
so it works,
but I'm always looking to see like what sells the bash.

218
00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.060
Like sugar cookie dough.

219
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.600
I like the sugar cookie dough recipe that I kind of just like googled and fell

220
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:58.550
in love with and like,
you know,
maybe like change a little,

221
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:02.630
but like really it's just like the standard sugar cookie dough recipe that I was

222
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:05.150
making for my whole office and they loved it.
I was like,
oh my God,

223
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.980
how can I get this in a cupcake?

224
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.690
And then I developed a sugar cookie dough icing,
which a sugar cookie dough,

225
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:15.590
but like with an icing consistency.
And everyone freaked out over that.

226
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:18.920
And I kind of knew that they would because it's like vanilla,
but cookie.

227
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.190
So I get you guys,
you know

228
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.440
<v 3>your sleep sleeper,</v>

229
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.240
that surprised you cells as well as it does that you did expect.

230
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.740
<v 0>I guess I,
I like things that are like,</v>

231
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.980
I like double cookie.

232
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.680
So I guess like I was pleasantly surprised to see the tie dye tie dye is going

233
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:45.101
strong.

234
00:15:45.101 --> 00:15:50.101
Tie Dye has been our most popular flavor for like since we started the company.

235
00:15:50.411 --> 00:15:55.240
And then when the book watched we um,
I created an electric tie dye,

236
00:15:55.241 --> 00:15:59.920
which is like,
just like brighter color tie dye and the two are neck and neck.

237
00:15:59.921 --> 00:16:03.370
And like every week I'm sitting in the conference room and I look at the report,

238
00:16:03.371 --> 00:16:07.270
I'm like,
yeah,
like I kind of root for electric tie dye.
I don't know why.

239
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.200
Like the newer one,
I like the colors,
it's super bright.

240
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.280
So I get that surprise me cause like vanilla.
But like I get it people like

241
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.910
who likes vanilla here?
Like over chocolate,

242
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.850
like chocolate.
So it's like surprising,

243
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:28.181
right?

244
00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:32.410
But it's also very colorful and I've learned that people eat with their eyes.

245
00:16:32.411 --> 00:16:35.980
So like in order for a flavor of anything to be successful,

246
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:38.260
it has to be equally as beautiful as delicious.

247
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:42.060
And it sounds like it's not rocket science,
but like,
you know,

248
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.180
when I look at other products out there or when I go into a bakery or
restaurant,

249
00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:46.840
whenever like you,

250
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.490
you really have to sell with the way it looks and then the taste is like the

251
00:16:51.491 --> 00:16:56.320
other half.
Okay.
So I stacked the cake.

252
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.770
Three layers is what I recommend.
Um,

253
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.890
otherwise it gets very difficult.

254
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.330
A spinny thing is super helpful and like you see like it's not super straight,

255
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.290
no promises but the,

256
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.590
but because you have this spinny thing,

257
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:20.140
it helps because you could like spin it and then I dunno,
it's crazy.

258
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.320
So there's this thing that we refer to as a crumb coat and so yeah,

259
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:31.930
this is the crumb coat.
So you do like this thin layer of icing around.

260
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:33.640
Okay.

261
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.640
You do a thin layer of icing around the cakes burst and that kind of just like

262
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.350
keeps everything neat and together.

263
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:43.900
And then you go back and you ice it again and you're really supposed to like pop

264
00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:47.050
it in the fridge and let the icing harden and then do another layer.

265
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.070
But I also like to complicate things so

266
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.910
<v 2>I'm going to put glaze on here.
So like,
and it's really pretty,</v>

267
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.430
you know like the little crumbs because they're colorful.

268
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.250
So um,

269
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.650
but you could like just do a chrome coat on a tie dye cake and leave it if it's

270
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.070
looks like Funfetti.

271
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.310
So Kate's been was that came out in October and I did all of this press and I

272
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:10.350
work with my husband and you know,

273
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:13.950
we have this weird competitive nature but it like really works and that's kind

274
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:17.460
of how we come out with such amazing flavors for baked by Melissa.

275
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.390
And I did like a ton of live segments,
so like,
like this,

276
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:26.391
but like for CIVC where like you have like a five minute segment and like 30

277
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:29.280
seconds ice the cake.
And One night we were laying in bed and he was like,

278
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:31.590
you know,
when you do the cakes on live TV,

279
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.800
you should probably make them look like really symmetrical and nice.

280
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.110
<v 4>I was like,
you try doing that.
It's so hard.
So I'm trying,</v>

281
00:18:41.111 --> 00:18:46.111
I'm going to try and make this really magical and nice for my husband.

282
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.390
<v 2>It's an area where we're laying in bed.
I'm going to tell him,
but I mean like,</v>

283
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.880
and I like,
I appreciate it.
I appreciate all feedback.

284
00:18:57.881 --> 00:18:59.290
I think it's super important.

285
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.930
<v 4>Um,
along those lots he look,
but like it's,
it's,
it's pretty nice so far.</v>

286
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.590
<v 2>Right?
You just gotta like don't overthink it.</v>

287
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.200
You know,
you're baking to enjoy.
Even I,
that's why I bait.

288
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.440
That's why we're all here because I love to bake.

289
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.950
So when you're baking at home,

290
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.800
she didn't enjoy it and like,
you know,

291
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.830
I associate Valentine's Day with baked goods because

292
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.920
if you don't want to buy cupcakes would just totally cool.
I get it.

293
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.110
You should make something and think of me.

294
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.623
<v 4>Oh Man,</v>

295
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.880
<v 2>fun.
I think you'll have a great time.</v>

296
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:45.750
Do it with your friends or like whomever your kid,

297
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.390
you're okay.
So far so good.
Right?

298
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:56.510
I think you're actually technically I follow a lot of cake makers on Instagram.

299
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.420
They usually start with the top and every time I watched it I'm like,

300
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.240
oh I should start on the top.
And then I forget.
So

301
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.100
one question that people ask me all the time,
it's like,

302
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.600
like how he started baked by Melissa of course.

303
00:20:11.601 --> 00:20:14.630
And like what did you do differently?
All this stuff.

304
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:19.400
And like I think one thing that's super important to anyone who wants to be

305
00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:23.460
successful at anything,
can you see the prettiness of like,

306
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.050
there's like little specks of the colors inside.

307
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.890
There's a certain attitude that I think is necessary for success in anything,

308
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.120
especially in starting your own business.
And it's a positive attitude.

309
00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:39.830
And I know that sounds crazy,

310
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.690
but my attitude when I was fired from my job,

311
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.750
so I was literally sitting at this thing

312
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.720
<v 4>yeah.</v>

313
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.720
<v 2>In my cube a call and I was called to HR and I thought I was getting a</v>

314
00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:57.900
promotion.
I was fired and I was

315
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.140
<v 4>true.
Yeah,</v>

316
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.230
<v 0>I saw that guy.
I really,
whatever,
it doesn't matter.
But like I,</v>

317
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.910
I was like,
anyone who got fired,

318
00:21:10.911 --> 00:21:14.390
I like thought it wasn't my fault and I wanted to like,

319
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.840
<v 2>yeah,
whatever retaliate.</v>

320
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.050
I said I thought I was through with so unjust.

321
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:25.100
I went right to my brother's office crying and he said,

322
00:21:25.101 --> 00:21:27.770
go home and start your business.
It's go home bigger cupcakes,

323
00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:28.880
we'll start a business out of it.

324
00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.650
And it's not crazy because I love to bake and at the time I,

325
00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.653
<v 4>okay,</v>

326
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.740
<v 0>I don't have a lot of time left,
but I am going to,</v>

327
00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:44.080
I'm going to finish the story too,
but while I'm doing that,
I'm,

328
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.780
I'm gonna make glaze.
This is the best part of this cake.

329
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.440
I take things too far.
If I mess something up,

330
00:21:51.441 --> 00:21:55.620
I'll like put glaze on it and it'll cover it up.
So I didn't mess this one up,

331
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.640
but I'm going to put glaze on it because it's so fun and glazes.

332
00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:01.370
Very complicated.
This is powdered

333
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:06.490
<v 2>sugar and I'm going to add whole mill and that's late and I'm going to use a</v>

334
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.840
spoon.
Okay.

335
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.890
So my brother is an entrepreneur,
like,

336
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.350
like a mad scientist entrepreneur,

337
00:22:18.351 --> 00:22:21.170
like always had new business ideas all the time.

338
00:22:21.171 --> 00:22:24.320
And I love to bake and I always wanted to go into business with him,

339
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.120
start a business with him.

340
00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.460
So when he said go home and bake your cupcakes,
I was like great.

341
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.620
Like it's a great idea because I'm really upset and I like to do that and it'll

342
00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:37.454
make me happy.

343
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.410
And at the time I was begging my tie dyed cupcakes

344
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.680
for like everyone and anyone.

345
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:50.200
If it was your birthday and I loved you and I love a ton of people.

346
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:53.680
I begged you tie that cupcakes.
And the reason that I did that was a,

347
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:58.681
because I love to bake be because has anyone ever big something delicious and

348
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:03.901
giving it to somebody that's feeling like truly that's why I did it.

349
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:05.050
It was totally thought fish.

350
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:08.920
I love to bake for people cause it made me feel good and I did it all the time

351
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.860
and I had been known for my tie dye cupcakes.

352
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.500
<v 0>So when he said to do,
and I was like,
great idea.</v>

353
00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:19.850
I begged for batches of cupcakes the night I was fired,
my tie dye,

354
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.400
cookie dough smores

355
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.920
<v 2>and peanut butter cup.</v>

356
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.890
I would say those are my four favorite flavors.

357
00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.480
And I ran them sending them into work with my best friend's little sister who

358
00:23:32.481 --> 00:23:36.240
was interning at Alyson broad PR.
Anyone heard of Alice?

359
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.380
And she was like a celebrity to me.

360
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.370
I'm not needed in the kitchen.
Um,

361
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.670
a female who started her business,
she was,

362
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.400
I like all women work there,
whatever.

363
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.830
I hope that she would like try the cupcakes herself,

364
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:55.210
but I didn't even know if she like went to work every day.
And

365
00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.320
I mean,
I just need to know,
you know,
but like in the back of my mind,

366
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:03.140
I was hoping that Alison would see the cupcakes and something amazing could

367
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.690
happen and would,
you know,
that's exactly what happened.

368
00:24:06.691 --> 00:24:10.280
So I sent all these cupcakes into work with Carly

369
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:16.340
who was interning there.
I'm out of breath again,
I'm sorry.
And um,

370
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.930
pals and saw them.
She had her caterer in the office,

371
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:24.470
luckily at the time and she was like,
Ben,
look,

372
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:27.410
these kinds of thinks they're amazing.
You should reach out to her.
So he did.

373
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.770
So I got a call from Alison broad's caterer.

374
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.330
Like the day after I was fired from my job.

375
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.210
He wants it to bring me into his office,
which was his apartment,

376
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.840
his little shady.
Then
I went with it,

377
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.440
uh,
for a tasting.
So I ran back to my brother's office and I was like,

378
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:45.891
Holy Shit,

379
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:49.970
I just got a tasting with Alison broad's caterer and he had his own business

380
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:53.580
like building websites for people.
So it was kind of perfect.
Um,

381
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.070
I said like we have to go and they were like,

382
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:57.110
we have a business already and he could be a part of it.

383
00:24:57.111 --> 00:25:01.370
I'm splitting it up into two bowls and I'm going to die each one pink and blue

384
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.070
because those are my favorite colors.
Um,

385
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.870
and cause they look beautiful when they combine.
So we were like,
okay,

386
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.640
we need a name and a logo.

387
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.570
I wanted to go in there like I had a business already and he could be a part of

388
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:15.410
it.
Otherwise,

389
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.900
like what would come from the opportunity that was like my mindset and they have

390
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.170
Brian and Matt were like totally cool with it.
They're like a spoon,

391
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.820
like,
like a soup spoon.
Great.

392
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:34.580
Aha.
Perfect.
Thank you.
So you don't need complicated stuff.

393
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.353
Um,

394
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.670
so my brother's business partner at the time for music box,

395
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:44.000
which was the web development company and it was like literally just the two of

396
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:47.960
them in this little tiny office on 38th and eighth was also our childhood friend

397
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:49.520
Matt.
So like he knew me very well.

398
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.060
So my brother insisted that the name of the company had a personal tie.

399
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.840
So we liked baked by Melissa.
I really wanted the company to be called baked,

400
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.280
but he insisted that my name was in it,
which I'm sort of thankful about.

401
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.420
And Matt created the logo and it's the same exact liberally head today.

402
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:11.480
I think I cried when I saw it cause it's like so perfect.

403
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.710
It's so who I am and who our brand is now.

404
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.510
And I mocked up bakery boxes with our logo.

405
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.590
I got like flat pastry boxes from the Clover Deli on 34th and second,

406
00:26:24.591 --> 00:26:27.050
which was right across the street from my apartment at the time.

407
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:32.210
And I went to the caterer for a tasting.
He loved the cupcakes.

408
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.810
And I did my first event with him less than a week after I was fired.

409
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.100
We made business cards that had my name and my home address and my cell phone

410
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:44.370
number.
But they were also brands at baked by Melissa.
So they look so legit.

411
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.570
My parents were like,
what is happening?

412
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.350
Like people are just gonna be like knocking on your apartment door.

413
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:57.950
Literally like suite 27 g I was apartment 27 j um,

414
00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.431
and yeah,

415
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:03.300
so people came and they saw these unbelievable bite sized cupcakes that were so

416
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:06.030
beautiful and also delicious.
Everyone knew cupcakes,

417
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:08.550
but they had never seen them bite size,
which is so cute.

418
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.140
And they would take a cupcake,

419
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:13.770
then they would take a business card and then you would go to big by melissa.com

420
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.420
which Brian and Matt obviously helped me create.

421
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.460
And we founded the company together.

422
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.930
So the three of us worked our butts off to get to where we are today.

423
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.510
Um,
we shot the whole website on my ikea coffee table

424
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.690
with a white bed sheet,

425
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.470
which made the table and the cupcakes using my canon point and shoot camera.

426
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.260
And when people saw the cupcakes,

427
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:44.160
they went to bake five months that you could purchase a hundred cupcakes or more

428
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:47.040
to be delivered by me from my apartment using the subway.

429
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:51.060
I'd like put a big mammals a sticker on a white pizza box.

430
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.670
And that's how we started baked by Melissa.
I did a fence,

431
00:27:56.671 --> 00:28:00.720
I called called caterers.
I took advantage of every opportunity that came my way.

432
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.260
Okay,
please time.
This is just really fun.

433
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:06.390
So I like tie dye and bright colors,

434
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:09.180
therefore that the cake is going to be very much like that.

435
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.780
So while we were shooting the book,

436
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:16.440
I realized that if you alternate colors and glaze

437
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:24.080
<v 4>on a cake,
it makes like a tie dye effect</v>

438
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.480
<v 2>and a beautiful shade of purple.</v>

439
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.710
So that was like 10 years ago,
which is crazy.

440
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.090
So since then we've opened 14 retail locations.

441
00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.310
We ship our product nationwide.

442
00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:47.311
So you can send these to anyone baked by melissa.com we'll go la,

443
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.420
<v 4>can you see the top?
I just want to like,
okay.
Anyway.</v>

444
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.460
<v 2>And then this is an offset spatula.</v>

445
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.130
This is a baby one and it gives it the hot.
So Freddy,

446
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.990
it'll like start to trip and you could totally control all this stuff based on

447
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.840
how much liquid you put in the glaze.

448
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.640
If you want it to drink more than you put more liquid and you want to cover the

449
00:29:14.641 --> 00:29:18.060
whole cake,
he could do that too.
I just like to have fun with it.

450
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:20.280
Glaze dries really quickly.
So

451
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.170
<v 4>we kind of have the
correct,</v>

452
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.300
it's just so pretty.
Okay.
Watch this.
Ready.

453
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.773
And you could

454
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.930
you get,
you get like tie dye?
Yeah,

455
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:47.400
it's fancy.
I'm very air.

456
00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.840
We go,
I guess I could probably make it look prettier.

457
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.833
You know what,

458
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.500
<v 2>I make little smudges.
Let's see.
Like this is how I create things.</v>

459
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.000
Um,

460
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
I just kind of go with it and like the end result is always beautiful no matter

461
00:30:10.191 --> 00:30:15.170
what.
Um,
does anybody have any questions for me while I,

462
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.610
how do you,
how do you mass produce something that seems so individualized?

463
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.830
It's a great question.
So when the book came out,
I see,
oh,

464
00:30:24.831 --> 00:30:29.770
and I who is like,
my CEO is probably my favorite person in the world.
Um,

465
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.270
we were like,
shit,
are people going to want to buy cakes?

466
00:30:32.271 --> 00:30:36.140
Now we're just coming out with a book called cakes by Melissa.

467
00:30:36.141 --> 00:30:38.300
Are they going to like assume that we saw cakes?

468
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.430
So we kind of had to figure that out.
Then you know how to mass produce cakes.

469
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.750
So what we do is we make these sheets,
um,
my husband does,

470
00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:53.860
he makes all of these sheets of tie Dye k and then we have one person who

471
00:30:54.891 --> 00:30:59.450
assembled them.
And like I took a really long,
like it's pretty quick.
Um,

472
00:30:59.451 --> 00:31:03.180
we do sell the tires.
I cake just like this,
um,

473
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.060
at baked by melissa.com you can preorder it.

474
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.280
Uh,
we say four days in advance,

475
00:31:10.281 --> 00:31:14.510
but of course we make suggest a exceptions and ah,
wow.
It's so pretty.

476
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.293
Um,

477
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:21.170
you can preorder it and then pick up in store only.

478
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:26.090
Um,
it's funny cause Allison brought has been ordering a ton of these cakes and I

479
00:31:26.091 --> 00:31:29.180
just love her so much.
I would do anything for her.
Um,

480
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.480
so I actually hand write happy birthday to him,
whoever she wants,

481
00:31:32.481 --> 00:31:35.980
which we do not do but,
but Al's,

482
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.880
whatever Allison watts Allison gets.

483
00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:42.650
So I do that for her and they are,
they're actually ice.

484
00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:46.580
Like this cake is,
I did this for the first time when we were shooting the book.

485
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.100
Like I didn't plan.
I kind of just do,

486
00:31:49.101 --> 00:31:52.340
I could have never told you about this cake was going to look like before I made

487
00:31:52.341 --> 00:31:53.020
it.
Um,

488
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.470
but the cake that I made while we were shooting the book inspired the cake that

489
00:31:57.471 --> 00:32:02.471
we now sell and it's so beautiful and so delicious and so moist.

490
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.220
Sorry.
Voice.
Sorry.

491
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

492
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.770
<v 2>What do you guys think about that word?</v>

493
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.420
<v 4>You think it's gross.</v>

494
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.000
<v 2>I mean for baking it makes sense,</v>

495
00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:20.900
but we believe we have like conversations about that word a lot in my line of

496
00:32:20.901 --> 00:32:21.734
work,

497
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.540
like meaning at baked by Melissa.
Like what?
We don't use it in our marketing,

498
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.070
although I kind of fight for it
because it,

499
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.340
because it is our product and then I sprinkle blend and there

500
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.810
there's my tie dye.

501
00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:54.030
<v 4>A few boxes of cupcakes to give away for anybody who has questions</v>

503
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.110
<v 2>back then.
Everyone should just grab a fork.
Okay,
good.</v>

504
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.150
That's what I would do.
That's not true.

505
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.930
It's like an arts and crafts project that you can eat.

506
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.290
So did you always make like mini cupcakes?

507
00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:25.170
If you ever picked the larger ones are going to beat you.

508
00:33:25.171 --> 00:33:29.070
Decide to that specific.
That's a Greg.

509
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.670
I always banked large cupcakes.
I really love cupcakes.

510
00:33:32.671 --> 00:33:35.250
So I wanted the big ones.

511
00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:40.140
But I also would eat two large cupcakes a day and I knew that if I was starting

512
00:33:40.141 --> 00:33:43.560
a business with a product,
it had to be unique and different in some way.

513
00:33:43.561 --> 00:33:45.760
So we decided to make them just a bite.

514
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.730
This way you could try every flavor without the post dessert filled Chin and

515
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:53.820
everything's under 50 calories.
But we have like,
it's all like real,

516
00:33:53.821 --> 00:33:57.570
like the best butter,
sugar,
Hershey's,
cocoa,
Hershey's chocolate,

517
00:33:57.571 --> 00:34:00.480
like chips ahoy cookies,
Oreos.

518
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.780
But it's just 50 calories less than that because it's just the bike.

519
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:09.030
It's like clever.
Brilliant.
Yeah.
Or Ige crumb.

520
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.120
I love all cupcakes.

521
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.330
<v 1>I have a few questions,
but all of that out of wanting all cupcakes,</v>

522
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.330
living in New York.

523
00:34:18.331 --> 00:34:22.680
Do you have any other besides around any other favorite stops around the city?

524
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.020
<v 2>I love sprinkles.</v>

525
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:26.310
<v 4>Okay.</v>

526
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:31.210
<v 2>I do.
I love their strawberry.
Hey,
I really,</v>

527
00:34:31.211 --> 00:34:35.110
I just love it all.
I love all cafes.
I even like Crohn's cupcakes.

528
00:34:35.111 --> 00:34:35.944
There is that it,

529
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.800
I used to get to crumb cupcakes every day from the clover deli.

530
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.340
They didn't say they were problems,

531
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.360
but I know that they were or they were like made by the same people who,

532
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.880
yeah.
Any other questions either mom working out?

533
00:34:55.881 --> 00:35:00.620
Are you talking about
when I first had my daughter,

534
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:04.140
so she's two now.
I was like,
Oh,
you know,
I just work hard and everything.
Give,

535
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:08.960
give my all,
which is true.
I do.
And it's hard.
So it's just really hard.

536
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.910
Um,
but I really,
I think it's important to like love what you do every day.

537
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.770
So I'm like,
I love going home to my daughter,
but I also love working.

538
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:22.580
Like I don't think being a stay at home mom would be for me.

539
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.690
I'm tired a lot and of being pregnant and stuff,

540
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:30.740
but I'm really happy that I am going to be an example for her.

541
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.930
I'm like,
we can do it.

542
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:39.410
Anyone can do anything and like women can do and I'm happy to embody that.

543
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.073
<v 4>And it's hard.</v>

544
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.510
Your husband the first day.
Yes,

545
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.753
sure.

546
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.940
<v 2>Um,
so it was opening day five,</v>

547
00:35:54.941 --> 00:35:57.880
our very first retail location.
Um,

548
00:35:57.881 --> 00:36:01.210
for those of you who like know the Soho area,
well,

549
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.920
the corner of Broadway and spring street before it was Nike town was a cafe

550
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.880
called cafe bakery and Cafe Barry had this little pickup window that was

551
00:36:09.881 --> 00:36:14.800
attached to it and that was our first retail location,
a bite sides if you will,

552
00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:19.510
pick up window on spring street and the corner of Broadway and it was part of

553
00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:22.090
Cafe Bari.
So opening day,

554
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.760
I'm like freaking out thinking who's going to stop at this hole in the wall?

555
00:36:24.761 --> 00:36:27.700
Buy cupcakes they've never heard of before.
I'm 24 years old.

556
00:36:27.701 --> 00:36:30.820
Literally like got fired from my job seven months prior.

557
00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:34.870
It was just like hustling to like bake cupcakes and try and do it.

558
00:36:34.871 --> 00:36:38.230
I love every day and now we're opening a store.
So I was kind of freaking out.

559
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.090
I didn't have the experience or the competence.
I today I'm sitting at the bar,

560
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.213
um,

561
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.830
we had gotten somebody to work the booth for opening day so I could like chill.

562
00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:49.090
I had baked enough cupcakes.

563
00:36:49.091 --> 00:36:53.230
It was like the first moment I was sitting down in months and David Zee was

564
00:36:53.231 --> 00:36:56.410
sitting next to me at the bar and David z used to have all these shoe stores

565
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.890
named David z throughout Manhattan.
Uh,
his death.

566
00:36:59.891 --> 00:37:03.160
He was Ronnie [inaudible] who founded KIPP.
So like that whole,

567
00:37:03.161 --> 00:37:05.740
like Ronnie used to work for him,
whatever.

568
00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:09.040
And like David was a regular cafe berry.

569
00:37:09.041 --> 00:37:11.980
He came every morning for his coffee and he was there that morning for his

570
00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:16.450
coffee and he's like a cat.
He's like an old,
he's like my dad's age.

571
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.550
And he was like a character,

572
00:37:18.551 --> 00:37:21.280
like takes it too far sometimes though I'd never met him before,

573
00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:26.000
but I knew who he was because he was like well known to me.
And um,

574
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.830
he looks at the bartender who I had also never met before and he says a d who

575
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:30.820
was this beautiful girl?

576
00:37:30.821 --> 00:37:33.490
And the bartender looked me up and down and he said that's my wife.

577
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.900
And I felt like he was such a jerk,
but that time that my husband

578
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.193
<v 4>okay.</v>

579
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.710
<v 2>And then I like hired he,
and they're like,
he's Israeli.</v>

580
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.990
So like he was looking at me and he's like foreign eyes.

581
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:51.990
Like I'm the most beautiful girl in the world and I totally worked.

582
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:00.363
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

583
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.870
<v 2>Yeah.
I'm just Washington.
Okay.</v>

584
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.590
<v 5>How did you guys come up with like the pricing model for politics are no</v>

585
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:10.270
insurance a dollar.
Like I obviously buy your product and I spend that,
but this,

586
00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:12.670
some people say that's too much,
too little.
Like how did you talk to at all?

587
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.521
<v 2>I'm telling you,</v>

588
00:38:13.521 --> 00:38:18.521
it's definitely not too much because there is so much that goes into every

589
00:38:18.891 --> 00:38:20.330
single one of these cupcakes.
You know,

590
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:24.170
our cupcakes have been a dollar since the day we started the company,
um,

591
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.930
which is pretty crazy.
Um,

592
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.910
and I don't think as much thought went into it as you would imagine or probably

593
00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:36.340
as should,
we should have,
but in bed,
but they're dollar,
it's very clean.

594
00:38:36.341 --> 00:38:40.300
I think it's nice to be able to just like,
hey,
you know,

595
00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:45.010
$3 for three cupcakes.
And,
um,
that was our pricing model

596
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.130
at the time we started the company at the end of the recession too.
So,
you know,

597
00:38:51.131 --> 00:38:54.400
it was a time when people weren't like going and spending a ton of money on

598
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:55.200
things.

599
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.620
It's like for $1 you could get something that tastes delicious,

600
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.200
brings you back to your child's head and makes you happy.

601
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:05.950
Instead of like going and buying jeans and yes,
I'm going to eat it.

602
00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.610
<v 4>You a little awesome,
low sepsis,</v>

603
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.630
believe [inaudible] peanuts.

604
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.120
<v 2>I would have had more confidence in myself probably.
Um,</v>

605
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:26.200
because my experience,
I've learned that you can do anything.
Like,

606
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.360
I can do anything.
You can do anything.

607
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:32.260
It's like a certain attitude and mindset and work ethic and like being

608
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:34.330
persistent and positive and all that stuff.

609
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.800
That's so cliche and totally true and I wish I knew that the way I know that

610
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:41.140
today because maybe I would have even I,

611
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.890
you know now like if I set my mind to something,
I know I'm going to achieve it,

612
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:46.743
which is nice.

613
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.120
<v 0>Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you.</v>

614
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.350
My question is what is your favorite memory?

615
00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:59.460
<v 2>Oh,
I have so many.</v>

616
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.630
<v 0>We've been been been around for 10 years.</v>

617
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.490
I took over Instagram recently,

618
00:40:07.491 --> 00:40:12.140
like in October.
Uh,
like during the launch of the book,

619
00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:16.340
this was another,
you can do anything thing like rod the bug in three months,

620
00:40:16.341 --> 00:40:17.240
which was crazy,

621
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:22.330
but like I really wanted it to watch for holiday 2017 because that's a great

622
00:40:22.401 --> 00:40:23.330
opportunity for us.

623
00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.860
It's like have things to talk about from a brand perspective and I told our CEO

624
00:40:27.861 --> 00:40:28.160
like,

625
00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.670
I'm going to take over Instagram and that the only way the launch of the bulb

626
00:40:31.671 --> 00:40:34.430
will be successful is if I do that and I'm going to figure it out and make it

627
00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:37.040
happen.
He's like,
you are like,
I know you are now.

628
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.860
And I was very persistent with like the people,

629
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:44.890
the one person who I knew there and I wound up taking over Instagram's account,

630
00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:48.800
which is like 270 million followers.

631
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.200
I did an Instagram story and a post on the feed on national dessert guy

632
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:55.943
<v 6>and</v>

633
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.040
<v 0>I'm not one to say something's going to happen before it happens,</v>

634
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.820
but like we had gotten confirmation and like we created the concept beforehand

635
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:05.350
and I was so excited.

636
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.400
So I like told everybody and they said they're going to post it for,

637
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:12.780
they're like on the other side of the country and like she's like waiting like,

638
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.260
like you know wasting time.

639
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:17.860
We were in Bloomingdale's after an event and like it wasn't happening.

640
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:18.940
I was like freaking out.

641
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:23.941
And then I was like on the subway underground going to another event in Brooklyn

642
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:27.460
and then we got out of the subway and I thought that I could cry.

643
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.913
<v 4>Okay.</v>

644
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.540
<v 0>Yeah.
It's just like,
that's what it's about.
Like we work,
so I view,</v>

645
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:37.460
we like,
we work so hard.

646
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.900
So like enjoying those like moments and that was a big moment,

647
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:45.020
but like all the little moments too,
that's like totally necessary.

648
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.810
<v 7>We'll get one more question over there.
All right.
Thank you.
Um,
did you ever,</v>

649
00:41:49.811 --> 00:41:50.980
were you,
when you were starting up,

650
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.030
do you ever worry about competition and what did you want being finalists to be?

651
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:54.873
No,

652
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.480
<v 0>you give me so much credit.</v>

653
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:04.320
All I knew is that I had the chance to do what I love every day,

654
00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:07.620
which was bake cupcakes and the in turn eat them.

655
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.470
But that focused,
I was focused on doing,

656
00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.400
I took advantage of every opportunity that came my way.

657
00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:16.860
Somebody wants to try the cupcakes,
they got cupcakes.

658
00:42:16.861 --> 00:42:19.920
I would go deliver them no matter I called called catering companies.

659
00:42:19.921 --> 00:42:23.260
I just did all of my,
my,

660
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:28.340
my mind power was focused on doing everything I could to do what I love every

661
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:32.760
day because I knew that if I didn't and it didn't happen,

662
00:42:32.761 --> 00:42:36.000
then one day I would look back and think,
Coulda,
woulda,
Shoulda,
and I can,

663
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.440
you just can't live my life that way.
So have the rest of the subway.
I didn't,

664
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:44.290
I didn't have time to think about.
Awesome.
Thank you.
So

665
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.830
<v 1>cause they used to show me.</v>
