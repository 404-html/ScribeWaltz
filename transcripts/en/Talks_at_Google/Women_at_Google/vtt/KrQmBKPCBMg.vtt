1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.770
So good morning.
I'm very,

2
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:10.771
very pleased to have Marlee Matlin here and I'm very pleased to introduce her

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.860
and have her come up here and tell us her story and,

4
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.340
and tell us about some of the causes that she's committed to.

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.013
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

6
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.710
<v 2>Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you Susan.</v>

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.510
And speaking of not everyone knowing who I am,
it's true,
there isn't,

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.590
I don't know if any of you,
well I have to admit this,
but I was a huge,

9
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.170
I actually had a huge weakness,
uh,

10
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:45.040
when I have the time to watch a little television because I have four kids and

11
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:49.570
it's difficult to watch and I have one teenage girl was 14 and she's a huge fan

12
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:50.890
of the bachelor.
Okay.

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.920
You all know they show the bachelor and it just so happened that on dancing with

14
00:00:56.081 --> 00:01:01.000
the stars when I was there,
I happened to meet the,
what's his name?
Jake.

15
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.890
Oh,
actually met Vienna.

16
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:07.891
Who is the woman who grabbed Jake or who Jake chose on this years of bachelor.

17
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:11.080
And she came up to me and she said,
are you an actress?

18
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.400
And of course clearly it proves that not everybody knows who I am.

19
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.633
Anyway,

20
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.790
I am so happy to be here today at the coolest place,

21
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.870
the Mecca of the Internet world.
Google.
Google is a sign.

22
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.390
What's the sign for Google?
This is the same Google headquarters.

23
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.430
It's like that moment when Darth Vader says,
Luke,
I am your father.

24
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.890
And everyone gasped and said,
no way.

25
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.390
I can't believe it's happening.
It's the ultimate cool to be here today.

26
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.590
And there's free food too.
I mean you guys have free red bull,
you have free food.

27
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:52.300
I can't believe it.
It's really great.

28
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.700
So is there a resume that I need to give you?
If I want to apply for a job here,

29
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.470
maybe I could play pool all day.
I don't know.
Anyway,
thank you.

30
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:04.960
It's a fun place to be here and it's fun and thank you to have you here,

31
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:07.180
but barn partly being here with you,

32
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:12.181
I can finally see some of the faces behind the news and the entertainment and

33
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:16.270
the information that the world has come to rely upon.

34
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.130
And now that I see you,

35
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:22.060
I want to say thank you for all that you are doing.

36
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:26.170
You are fantastic.
Thank you very much.
Well,

37
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.730
I know that you're anxious to have me talk about my book,

38
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.650
that book that is called,

39
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.240
I'll scream later and some of you may wonder where that title came from.
Well,

40
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.760
I have to admit that if you didn't know already,

41
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.930
I am a recovering drug addict and today it's been 23 years,

42
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.150
two months and 20 days.
And just

43
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.843
<v 1>thank you.</v>

44
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.540
<v 2>And just after I won the Golden Globe for best actress in children of a Lesser</v>

45
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.980
God,
I checked myself into Rehab at the Betty Ford Clinic.

46
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.981
Unlike today where my entire journey would have been covered by TMZ and Perez

47
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.580
Hilton back then.
Way back then,
there was no such thing as uh,

48
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.590
being able to w there was no such thing as those things.

49
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.230
So I was able to check it in secret.
And while I was there,

50
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.670
I was nominated for an academy award for best actress.
So if you can imagine,

51
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.300
I must be the only person to get that.
Congratulations.

52
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:33.040
You've been nominated call while working on my sobriety at the Betty Ford
Clinic.

53
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.500
So anyway,
when the phone call came in from Jack here,
uh,

54
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.660
who by the way,
this is Jack.
Jason,
my interpreter.

55
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.570
If I didn't introduce them already,
sorry,

56
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.400
I don't have a male voice.
I just wanted to let you know that.

57
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.900
Well maybe after a couple of cigarettes.
No.
Anyway,
anyway,
um,

58
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.760
he asked me for a reaction or a statement which wasn't going to be staying

59
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:05.020
sober.
No,
thank you for the nomination,
but I'm staying sober.
I'm keeping sober.

60
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.590
No,
I didn't want to say that.
So instead I said,

61
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.050
tell them I'll scream later.

62
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.280
And that phrase stuck with me ever since.

63
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.580
And I think it strikes the right tone of humor and irony coming from this death

64
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.180
gal because as you'll see in my book,
I may be death,

65
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.160
but I'm probably one of the loudest people you'll ever meet.

66
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.280
My good friend and mentor,

67
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:35.281
Henry Winkler put it perfectly when he told me if you will,

68
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.900
it,
it is not a dream for me if you will.
It,

69
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.680
it is not a dream.
It's about intention.

70
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.030
And for me,
even though I was different than everyone else,

71
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.300
I had the will and the desire to make something happen for myself and everything

72
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:59.770
else just followed.
But Times have changed though.

73
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:04.771
Today I'm an actress and a film producer as well as an advocate for children's

74
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:10.831
and disability related causes and most recently a dancer on dancing with the

75
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:13.780
stars.
I hope you voted for me.
Did you vote okay.

76
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.830
I'm also a mother of four and as a result I'm a cook and a car pool driver and a

77
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:27.001
room mother and a conflict mediator and a closet organizer and a pretend math

78
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.810
wiz.
Seriously,
life is good.

79
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.620
It's been 23 years since critics said that I won my academy award out of pity

80
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.770
and that I would never work in Hollywood again,

81
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.340
simply because I was deaf and I'm still here.

82
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.660
The barriers that many had predicted would stop my career dead in its tracks

83
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.010
have virtually vanished.

84
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.510
Thanks to many working actors like me who are deaf or differently abled

85
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.230
attitudes have changed now.

86
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.120
Most of the barriers I face are more humorous than they are distressing and here

87
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:12.380
are a couple of examples because once when I was working on a television show

88
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.810
with Mark Harmon called reasonable doubts,

89
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.010
many of you are probably too young to even know this program was on the air.

90
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.930
But anyway,
once I'll work in the program,

91
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.460
an NBC executive came to visit the studio when we were shooting the show and

92
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.400
after watching me work for a little while he said to the executive producer of

93
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.070
the show,
you know that Marlee Matlin is great,
she's great.

94
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.870
Is she going to be death for the whole show?

95
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.613
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

96
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.970
<v 2>it's okay.
I'm over it.</v>

97
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.320
And once while I was ready to appear live on CNN in front of millions of

98
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:50.970
viewers,
as you know,
CNN has,

99
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.060
the director was counting down the seconds before we were live on the air and I

100
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:54.811
was getting my makeup,

101
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:57.840
my last looks and Jack was sitting with the reporter on the other side of the

102
00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:00.870
camera.
As we were counting down with just three seconds,

103
00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:02.760
she leaned over to Jack and said,

104
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.090
could you tell Marley that my dog is death just like her?

105
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.230
And suddenly I was live on television and I'm thinking,
what does she want me to,

106
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:15.080
did you want to throw me a bone?
Does she want me to say Wolf?
I Dunno.
Okay.

107
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.670
And this thing doesn't only happen in Hollywood,

108
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.060
it happened to me a couple of times.
I don't know about you,

109
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.720
those people who are deaf,
but I'm on a plane ready for the plane to take off.

110
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:32.410
I'm set my seatbelt design and Jack and I are signing to each other.

111
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.490
The flight attendant comes over,
sees me signing waves,
gives me a menu.

112
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.410
As soon as she sees me signing,

113
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.950
she grabs him and you out of my hand goes to the Galley and returns back with a

114
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:43.000
new menu in Braille.

115
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.623
<v 1>Yup.</v>

116
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.880
<v 2>Actually they have to think about it for a moment too.
And she's like,
yeah,</v>

117
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:59.240
so what's wrong?
I mean,
you don't,
you need the Braille.
And I'm like,
uh,
no,

118
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.930
I'm def not blind.
And then she realizes it.

119
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.240
And then I never see it for the rest of the flight.

120
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.680
I use these stories not to trivialize the barriers facing people like myself

121
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:19.441
because every day there is still discrimination against differently abled people

122
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.040
and people who are deaf and whether being in front of the camera,

123
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:29.430
out and about being a mom or working on behalf of some of my favorite charities.

124
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.940
My message has always been the same and one that I got from my parents that no

125
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:41.620
matter what abilities we possess,
all of us not only deserve respect,

126
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.750
we deserve to be heard.

127
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.151
In my book,

128
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:52.151
I chronicle that it wasn't always easy that sometimes I was made fun of out

129
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:56.640
there and sometimes I fell,
but it was all a part of growing up.

130
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.650
Just because I was deaf,

131
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.690
my parents felt that I should not live a sheltered life.

132
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.400
And far from it,

133
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.120
they believed that it was important for me to embrace life,

134
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.830
both the good and the bad.

135
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:20.270
So even though I danced in front of 25 million people each week on dancing with

136
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:26.211
the stars or stood my ground as strong characters who just happened to be deaf

137
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:31.350
on shows like the l word and on the West Wing,

138
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.270
I still have days when I feel like I'm going out that front door of my parents'

139
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:41.271
house for the first time to prove that I can do anything except here and

140
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.720
oftentimes I still find myself explaining that yes,

141
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.780
I do drive a car and yes I can have children and yes,

142
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.660
I am a working actress.
Well,

143
00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.080
fortunately with your commitment here today to creating greater accessibility,

144
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.980
you at Google have demonstrated that you get it,

145
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.243
you get it.

146
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:14.090
Because what you're doing here today with youtube and automatic captioning is

147
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:16.470
nothing short of extraordinary.

148
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.471
I cannot tell you how much I've come to rely on the Internet for my

149
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:26.070
communication needs
and many others out there.

150
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.600
Many millions of others out there.

151
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.250
I'm sure you've probably heard of the irony of the invention of the telephone,

152
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.890
that when Alexander Graham Bell,

153
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:40.190
who had a deaf wife and a deaf mother wanted to find a way to help them

154
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:43.110
communicate.
He thought of the television,
excuse me,

155
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:45.510
the telephone as a tool that would help them,

156
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.370
but little did he realize that the telephone would be one of the greatest

157
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.400
barriers when it came to communication between the deaf and the hearing world.

158
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.263
Right there.

159
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.840
20 years ago I lobbied and I succeeded in getting the film,

160
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.950
which inspired me to be an actress,
the wizard of Oz,

161
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.060
to be closed captioned for the first time because captioning was crucial in

162
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:21.701
bringing the words that you all take for granted to my world.

163
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:28.110
And the following year in 1990 I took it one step further and I went to Capitol

164
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.930
Hill to lobby on behalf of the legislation that all televisions 13 inches or

165
00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:40.310
larger,
she'd be equipped with closed captioning technology

166
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.840
like the critics who doubted my ability to be an actor because in their eyes,

167
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:51.830
my deafness put me on a level below my peers.

168
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.460
TV and programmers thought that millions of Americans who are deaf or hard of

169
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:01.630
hearing didn't deserve equal access through closed captioning.

170
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.660
But with the hard work and determination we were successful in getting the

171
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.870
decoder act.

172
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:13.050
Bill passed six years later and legislation was passed that required that all

173
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.580
broadcast television be 100% closed captioned.

174
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.230
But like the irony of the invention of the telephone,

175
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.380
the Internet eventually became a bigger barrier than one could ever imagine when

176
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:33.370
it came to closed captioning content on broadband.

177
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.120
Here's a good example.
Just last October,

178
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.100
the wizard of Oz celebrated a wonderful minds,
a milestone,

179
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.940
the 75th anniversary of its initial release,

180
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.040
and for the first time in broadcast history,

181
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.280
it was going to be streamed live to every single American who had access to a

182
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:57.580
computer for free.
So free,
free,
absolutely free.

183
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.990
So I was eager to share the film with my children,

184
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.360
particularly my then five year old daughter,

185
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.990
in whose eyes I saw the same sense of wonderment and excitement that I had when

186
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:15.670
I was seven watching the film for the first time about the young girl with the

187
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:19.540
Ruby slippers,
who dreamt of someplace over the rainbow.

188
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.130
But when I opened up my laptop and hit the play button,

189
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.580
I was horrified to find that the film that I had lobbied to get closed captioned

190
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.220
20 years earlier was shown without captions.

191
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:42.300
I was told that the technology was not out there and that I had to be patient

192
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.810
and to wait.
Well,
as I said,

193
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.970
I like to make noise.

194
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:58.350
So I tweeted like crazy to the thousands of followers that I had on Twitter and

195
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:05.611
I made sure that my friends like Ashton Kutcher and Alyssa Milano knew what was

196
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:06.724
going on

197
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.800
and what was going on with closed captioning on the Internet and I encourage

198
00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:15.940
them to retweet and they did.

199
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.780
Then I found out there was actually no problem with the technology and in fact

200
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:27.670
the technology is out there to stream content with closed captions.

201
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:34.060
When it came down to the same issue,
a lack of understanding,

202
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.360
it was a lack of understanding at that a large percentage of manufacturers said

203
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:43.360
that we've said that you need to provide access for the millions of viewers who

204
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:44.410
are deaf or hard of hearing,

205
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.570
so by providing close caption they can get access.
More importantly,

206
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.660
they fail to understand that original programming had captions,

207
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.640
but that the Internet had to have the captions as well.

208
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.090
Eventually the frustration increased so much because I had to fight to make 20

209
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.150
to do what I did 20 years ago all over again.

210
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:15.250
The ultimate irony came during the unveiling of the celebration of Helen

211
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.850
Keller's life.

212
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:21.440
There was a statue being unveiled in the Capitol Rotunda and it was streamed

213
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.050
live without captions.

214
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.690
Here we're celebrating and honoring a woman who fought for equality and

215
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:34.520
accessibility over a hundred years ago and who I looked up to as a role model

216
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:38.090
and I wasn't even able to share the celebration of her life.

217
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.420
It was simply unacceptable,
unacceptable,

218
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.240
but you at Google,

219
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.660
you changed all that just as you did when you pioneered the search engine.

220
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.330
You are helping to ensure the commitment and standards and legislation that we

221
00:15:56.781 --> 00:16:01.781
worked for accessing broadcast TV are continuing here with your efforts and

222
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:06.740
getting hundreds and thousands of videos on youtube broadcasts with closed

223
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:07.574
captions.

224
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.480
So today I am proud to premiere the pilot episode of a show that I produced,

225
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.780
which I hope will become a series,
either a network or web.

226
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:26.020
It's called my deaf family and the show chronicles a family from right here in

227
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:32.120
the San Francisco Bay area that is made up of both deaf and hearing family

228
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:32.870
members.

229
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.870
It's told from the perspective of 15 year old Jared fertile who is hearing

230
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.440
Jareds parents are deaf and they work nearby here at the California School for

231
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:50.630
the deaf in Fremont and Jared also has three siblings,

232
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.090
two of whom are deaf and one who is hearing.

233
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.800
I like to think of it as a diversion of a little people,

234
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:02.801
big world and I even pitched it to Tlc in the hopes of creating the first

235
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:08.501
reality show of its kind ever showing what life is like for millions of

236
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:13.460
Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing.
Unfortunately,

237
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.450
TLC seemed more interested in doing a show about killing um,

238
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:23.060
Moose with Sarah Pailin.
So fine.
That's okay.
That's all right.

239
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.270
If TLC won't have me,
I figured I'll do it.

240
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:29.780
My words and using miss [inaudible] words,

241
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:34.781
I'm going to go rogue and broadcast it on Youtube where I can call the shots and

242
00:17:37.761 --> 00:17:42.761
where I can get guaranteed that the show will be broadcast with captions.

243
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.070
Thank you Google for making this happen.

244
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.870
I also wanted to say that though I may be deaf,

245
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.200
silence is the last thing the world will ever hear from me.

246
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.670
And that the real handicap of deafness does not lie in the ear.

247
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.780
It lies in the mind.

248
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.330
Thank you for your commitment to breaking through the barriers and providing

249
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:09.960
access to youtube through automatic captioning.

250
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.910
Through your example,

251
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:17.270
you're helping to open the minds of those who choose to handicap millions of

252
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:22.851
people like myself who are deaf or hard of hearing and who don't provide closed

253
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:27.330
captioning content through broadband.
Your efforts today,

254
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:32.331
we'll guarantee the hard fought victory we won so many years ago can move

255
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:36.690
forward into the 21st century.

256
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.440
So without any delay,

257
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.040
please enjoy the premiere of my deaf family on Youtube.

258
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.220
But before I say this,
hold on one second.

259
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.250
I want to introduce to you one of the stars of my deaf family of this program.

260
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.970
Bruschetta born fertile is here with us today.
Could you please stand up?

261
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:02.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

262
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.740
<v 2>Thank you for coming out.
Taking time out of your busy schedule to be with that.</v>

263
00:19:08.741 --> 00:19:12.730
So I want to thank the children and the students from the California School for

264
00:19:12.731 --> 00:19:15.070
the deaf where we are with us today,
who came out today with us.

265
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.533
<v 1>So,</v>

266
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.030
<v 2>uh,
just two things.
Enjoy the show.
Uh,</v>

267
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.210
and I'm going to think about where to find my glasses so I can read it some
more.

268
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.870
Okay,
let's go.

269
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.940
<v 3>My name is Jared and I'm 15 and I have a family of six.
My Dad's name is Leslie.</v>

270
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.890
The mom's name's Projeta have younger brother.
His name is gay.

271
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.650
I have a little sister named Sabrina.
Youngest brother is alive

272
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.370
and this is my deaf family.

273
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.570
<v 2>So there you go.
There you go.</v>

274
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:07.020
This was something that we had been hoping for a long time and now we have the

275
00:20:08.021 --> 00:20:09.280
opportunity to put it there on Youtube.

276
00:20:09.281 --> 00:20:12.640
And we hope that millions of people worldwide,
we have the chance to see this.

277
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.110
And this makes it even bigger than just the pilot.

278
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.340
And thank you.
Brigida.

279
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.090
Thank you Virginia for letting us come into your home for letting us into your

280
00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:29.020
home.
And this was shot Justin.
One and a half days.
That's all we had.

281
00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:33.040
Just one and a half days to shoot.
And Eh,
you know,

282
00:20:33.041 --> 00:20:36.820
it's almost unheard of in the reality programming business to make a pilot that

283
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:39.040
only covers one and a half days of a family's life.

284
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.010
But I'm very proud of it and I hope that you all enjoyed it.

285
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.810
And I think that we also might be having some.
Um,

286
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.360
do I need to give you the microphone?
We have question and answers or what?

287
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.680
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
um,</v>

288
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.990
I'm going to ask a few questions and then I'd really like to open it up to the

289
00:20:54.991 --> 00:20:59.991
audience and I'll just start by saying that you're such an inspiration and that

290
00:21:00.081 --> 00:21:04.350
your story is fantastic and wonderful and thank you for coming and sharing.
And,

291
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.640
um,
again,

292
00:21:05.641 --> 00:21:10.050
it really is a commitment of ours as a company to make information accessible.

293
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:13.320
So I'm so pleased that you can be here and we can share that common goal.

294
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.840
Thank you.
Um,
so I'll start with,

295
00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:20.030
given that we have people in the company here who are,
um,

296
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.810
probably engineers,

297
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.930
probably sales people across the company and they're all people who can work on

298
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.950
some of the accessibility,

299
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.870
what are some of the things that you would like to see us doing on the Internet?

300
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.930
Um,
and how can we make the captioning even better?

301
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.660
<v 2>Well,
uh,
I mean,
first of all,</v>

302
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.080
if you could make all the captions purple with the Yellow Background.
No,

303
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:48.220
I'm just joking.
I'm just joking.
Or a different font.

304
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:51.280
Perhaps we could go to Helvetica or something and whatever.
No.
Do they have that?

305
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.830
Yeah.
Do you have the ability to change the font?
You do.

306
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.190
You can't change the font.
Oh,
Ooh,
I like that.

307
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.730
That answered my question right away.
Um,
listen,
you're doing it.

308
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:02.830
You are doing it already.
You're,
you're doing it all.

309
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:05.050
I applaud you all for what you've done so far.

310
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.930
I don't think there's really any move.
I don't know what more I could ask for.

311
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.020
I know that you can't do it immediately,

312
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:13.120
perfectly in terms of automatic captioning,
so that it,

313
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:18.070
the voice recognition works,
uh,
you know,
100% and there might be some confusion.

314
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.870
It takes time.
It certainly takes time,
but you're putting it out there and,

315
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.700
and you know,
we'll,
there's room to make it perfect.
I'll be patient.

316
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.930
<v 0>Great.
Well,
we'll definitely be working on it.
Um,</v>

317
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.860
I looked at some last night and I'm like,

318
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:33.020
I noticed that sometimes when people put them on manually,

319
00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:37.160
you can't always tell who is speaking.
Um,
for example,
that like,

320
00:22:37.161 --> 00:22:41.570
I like watched your interview on Larry King and I didn't know when it was,

321
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.650
like if I didn't hear it,

322
00:22:42.651 --> 00:22:45.740
it wouldn't have been always possible to know when you are speaking versus when

323
00:22:45.741 --> 00:22:48.470
your Larry King or the interviewer was speaking.

324
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.220
So I thought like that would be one example is that we actually always have

325
00:22:52.221 --> 00:22:56.600
connotation of who is the speaker.
Um,
for example,

326
00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:01.140
<v 2>well,
you know,
listen,
when,
when captions first came out,
um,</v>

327
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.660
on television,
uh,
it,
you know,

328
00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:05.820
it was like three's company was the first show that had captions.

329
00:23:05.821 --> 00:23:10.110
I was just fascinated with the fact that there were words on the screen.
I mean,

330
00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:11.250
it was a dream that we had.
I mean,

331
00:23:11.251 --> 00:23:14.580
it would be great to think about having words way back then and now it's a

332
00:23:14.581 --> 00:23:18.100
reality.
But when they first came out,
um,
it took a little bit of,

333
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.310
of getting used to and adjustment to know who was talking and to be able to

334
00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:25.800
understand,
but then eventually,
um,

335
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.090
they made adjustments so that they had one person speaking on one side of the

336
00:23:30.091 --> 00:23:32.520
screen and one person speaking on the other side of the screen with the
captions.

337
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.440
So it's just a matter of time,
it's,

338
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.150
I wouldn't like it if they put two different colors on there as they do in some

339
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:42.570
countries with captions.
I think it's too confusing,
I think gets too confusing.

340
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.970
I mean,
I personally don't care for that kind of of,

341
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.410
<v 0>so.
Okay.
Great.
Um,</v>

342
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.480
so last one more question and then I'd love to hear from the audience here.
Um,

343
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.330
but what kind of,
is there any legislation or any,
um,

344
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.370
ways that we could work with policy?
Um,
meaning Google the company,

345
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.420
<v 2>there's a,
there's a law called HR three one oh one,
excuse me,</v>

346
00:24:04.421 --> 00:24:07.900
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Um,
but,
uh,
she knows,

347
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.810
so HR 301 is out there up on the hill that we want it to get past.

348
00:24:12.811 --> 00:24:15.490
So that would allow for that accessibility in the Internet as we were talking

349
00:24:15.491 --> 00:24:17.560
about today.
It's just not been passed yet.

350
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.490
<v 0>Okay.
Can you say a little bit about what it is?
Just so everyone here knows?</v>

351
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.880
<v 2>Well,
Jack Jack could do that better than I did.
Um,
uh,</v>

352
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.490
it's basically yes,
it's basically,
um,

353
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.590
as Marlys said in back in 1990 and then again in 1994,

354
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.820
legislation was passed that required broadcasters to close caption because they

355
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:40.910
wouldn't do it themselves.
Now with everything moving to the Internet,

356
00:24:40.911 --> 00:24:44.750
it seems that the information that's there captioned isn't moving with captions

357
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:46.640
and they're still not captioning it there.

358
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.820
So HR 301 is intended to force internet providers to caption what's already been

359
00:24:54.561 --> 00:24:54.981
captured.

360
00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:59.210
So it's applying that law to the Internet and there's a lot of complaints.
Well,

361
00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:02.900
a lot of it is user generated.
We can't caption that.

362
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.350
How are you going to force us to do that?
I mean,
a lot of stuff on youtube is,

363
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.280
is made by people who go to youtube while you guys solve that problem with

364
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:13.130
automatic captions.
Now it's time for the other people to do that.

365
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.620
So that's what HR three,
one one is intended to do.

366
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:19.040
And we're waiting for the vote or at least to be even brought up.

367
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:20.930
I'm not familiar with the legislative process,

368
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.690
but we're waiting for sponsors and the health care bill took up a lot of,

369
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.850
of attention and everybody was focused on that.

370
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.880
So now hopefully we can move to this.

371
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:36.881
And I've been working very closely with the National Association of the deaf and

372
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.150
hoping that their efforts,
I mean in their terms,

373
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:45.020
I'm their spokesperson when it comes for closed captioning and hopefully we can

374
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:47.570
work together to make sure that this legislation pass.

375
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.140
<v 0>Great.
Well what questions people want to come to the audience.</v>

376
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.160
I come to the other hand that the mic over.

377
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:56.450
<v 4>Um,</v>

378
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.070
a special question for you by colleague is actually blind and we've just watched

379
00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:06.071
your reality TV and there are certain points where the texts appeared,

380
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.070
but there was no audio so she couldn't actually hear what was going on.

381
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:12.410
So it'd be really cool if you could find a way to make that happen.

382
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.970
<v 2>Well I understand and I believe that they're working on that audio description</v>

383
00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:21.530
technology for people who have low vision or visually impaired.
Um,

384
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.670
people who can hear their sure.
Certainly needs to have some sort of,
uh,

385
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:28.280
of description,
audio description on the screen.
Um,

386
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:32.360
I believe that they're working on that here and I'll bring up a Naomi to explain

387
00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:33.194
that

388
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.950
<v 0>this is the perfect opportunity for me to put in a plug for the access Enj team.</v>

389
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.060
We have a headcount in our team and if you would like to come and help us work

390
00:26:42.061 --> 00:26:42.781
on these problems,

391
00:26:42.781 --> 00:26:46.140
we have a list of really interesting problems we're working on right now.
Um,

392
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.810
there are ways of doing audio description in youtube right now.

393
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:52.670
You do it by mixing in the audio,
so it's called open audio.
And um,

394
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.660
if anybody is curious,
I uh,

395
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.930
I can send out an email maybe through the author's team list that includes some

396
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:01.430
lists,
some links to videos that have that.
Um,
so,
uh,

397
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.080
I'm going to hand this back to somebody before I babble too much.

398
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.190
<v 2>No,
no,
absolutely.
Naomi,
it's important.</v>

399
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.250
<v 1>Great.</v>

400
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:14.170
<v 0>Other other questions?
Sure.
You guys can also stand up at the mic there.</v>

401
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.720
<v 5>Hi.
A couple of comments and no question,
uh,
first,
uh,</v>

402
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:23.670
for making the captioning technologies that Google,
uh,
become a possibility.

403
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.811
Uh,
we,

404
00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:28.560
there is one person I would like to recognize that my good friend Ken Harris

405
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:30.090
thing sitting right there,

406
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.890
<v 2>I was planning to do that.
Yes,
Ken heroin scene.</v>

407
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.410
<v 1>It,</v>

408
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.790
<v 5>he has been pushing tirelessly for this to happen in the past few years and he</v>

409
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:46.440
happened to be my first office made when he joined Google seven years in two

410
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:49.670
weeks ago.
And my other office may was Greg badge.

411
00:27:49.671 --> 00:27:52.500
I was who it was harder hearing and I was designing servers.

412
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:57.300
I had this big loud machines in my room and I had the perfect roommates.

413
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:03.570
They didn't remind.
So,
and uh,

414
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.560
uh,
piece of question is a,
I'm an engineer.

415
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:12.120
So I was curious like,
why are we hearing people in a room,

416
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.250
one to attract attention?
We usually use the glass or some seem to make a noise.

417
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:21.980
So everybody took a track.
Everyone's attention.
Uh,
I wonder if,
uh,

418
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.960
for people who don't hear,
uh,
how do you do that already?

419
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.570
But

420
00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.160
<v 2>no,
we actually,
we flashed the lights.
We just flick the lights off and on.
Okay.</v>

421
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.020
Or we wave.
But that's it because that's very visible.
I mean,

422
00:28:35.021 --> 00:28:37.930
I could see it because my peripheral vision is very good.
I mean,

423
00:28:37.931 --> 00:28:41.230
my eyes are the means of which I depend on to use.

424
00:28:41.231 --> 00:28:44.110
Just as you depend on your ears to hear and you can hear anything.

425
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.130
So I'm very visual and if you do this or if you do this,
um,

426
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.200
like when there's Paparazzi for example,
here's a good example.

427
00:28:50.201 --> 00:28:52.080
When I go to Paparazzi,
they're very smart.
You know,

428
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.030
at first when I came into the business,
they would scout my name,
Marley,
Marley,

429
00:28:55.031 --> 00:28:57.370
Marley,
Marlene.
Of course,
I would just stand there like,
what are they,
you know,

430
00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.670
will be Goldberg,
said,
hey guys,
she's deaf.
You can't yell at a deaf woman.

431
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.400
And then of course then they came up with something.
They do this,

432
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.110
they just make up,
they do pretend sign language.

433
00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:08.440
And then I would look and then they take my picture and they do some more

434
00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:11.770
pretend sign language and then you look and it take my picture and then they've

435
00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:14.650
learned this.
They still do this to this day.
It works.
It works for me.

436
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.820
So I mean for you to get the attention of someone who's deaf and who can't hear

437
00:29:18.821 --> 00:29:22.810
you just do this or are you just tap their shoulder or I mean anything that

438
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.470
involves hand movement or flashing the life off and on from across the room that

439
00:29:26.471 --> 00:29:28.450
usually works or throw something.

440
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:34.590
<v 5>Okay,
well,
you know,
spit,
spit ball that way.
Then one suggestion,</v>

441
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.640
and this is more for can actually,
uh,
you're talking about like,
oh,

442
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.600
when you have caching captions,
you sometimes you can read a tale who,

443
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.290
which one on scoring is talking and it seems we have this automatic captioning

444
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:50.620
technology mostly related to a voice recognition.

445
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.310
We can probably also recognize the tone in the voice,

446
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.840
like the pitch in a voice to tell whether it's male or female or other,
uh,

447
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.450
traits,
all the,
the actors.
Then,
uh,
as we say it,
you say,

448
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:07.540
I already a weekend fund,
we can put different,
I'd be really,

449
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:08.590
really curious to see that.

450
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:11.080
I'd be really curious to see how we can use the softer foam.

451
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.510
Quaintly it's a softer voice and use a square.

452
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:16.090
Found the way it's a strong voice for example.

453
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.933
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

454
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.040
<v 2>Go for it.
What are you waiting for?</v>

455
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.280
<v 1>Okay,</v>

456
00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.230
<v 2>great.
Thank you.
Thank you for your comments.</v>

457
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:28.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.900
<v 5>Um,
uh,
I'm uh,</v>

459
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:34.960
I'm a father of five years old,
blind son.

460
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.410
So if you were actually back to five years or oh,

461
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:43.450
what do you want to ask your parents?

462
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.130
What do you want from them?
Mostly or,

463
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.290
I'm sorry,
English is my second language,
so I

464
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.663
<v 2>mine too.</v>

465
00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:02.240
I mean I think if if I were in your child's shoes.
Yep.

466
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.580
A five years old,
back five years old,
if you are,
um,

467
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.850
what I would want from my parents.
Yes.

468
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.140
I would say or ask for that.

469
00:31:15.141 --> 00:31:17.210
You take good care of me,

470
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.900
that you don't deny me anything and that you let me be who I am.

471
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.040
Don't try to restrain me from any experiences in life.

472
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:32.870
Let me go out there,
explore the world.
Let me feel,

473
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.300
let me touch,
let me meet.

474
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.980
Treat me as if I could see.
Okay.

475
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.930
<v 5>Thank you.
Actually the caption is very helpful for me to understand the English,</v>

476
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.993
so

477
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:49.740
<v 2>I'm kind of saying it.
You go thank you very much for your comment.
Thank you.</v>

478
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.550
<v 6>Hi.
Thank you very much for coming here.
Um,</v>

479
00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:01.850
one of the things I find challenging about using video and audio content is how

480
00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:05.820
long it takes to get the information from it compared with reading written

481
00:32:05.821 --> 00:32:06.654
content.

482
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.830
And I was wondering whether there's anything that you've been thinking about or

483
00:32:10.831 --> 00:32:15.831
working for to enable basically the faster playing of captions or uh,

484
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.370
foster getting them information from video content

485
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.380
<v 2>and audio content.</v>

486
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.950
I'm going to give your question to can because he's more adept at answering that

487
00:32:24.951 --> 00:32:25.850
question perhaps.

488
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:28.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

489
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.840
<v 2>He said the answer is yes.
The answer is yes.</v>

490
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.960
We are working on it.
We've got that going now for businesses.

491
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.580
Google video,
Google Biz

492
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.480
<v 0>video for business.
Do you want to explain some Naomi?</v>

493
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

494
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.710
<v 0>So if you guys look at our internal videos on Google video for business,</v>

495
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.590
you can see now there's a little slider that has a rabbit and a turtle on it.

496
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.030
And if you slide it up to the rabbit and it goes faster.
And um,

497
00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.440
this is actually worked on by Daniel Steinberg is pretty amazing.
If,
uh,

498
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.040
if you just speed it up audio,
normally it would eat,

499
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.950
the pitch would be really high.

500
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:05.780
It sounded like the lecture was being given by chipmunks.

501
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:09.030
So we actually changed the pitch.
So it sounds sort of kind of normal.

502
00:33:09.031 --> 00:33:12.510
And I turned that off because it annoys me.
Even though we changed the pitch,

503
00:33:12.511 --> 00:33:15.550
I just watched the caption.
So if you look at our internal videos,
um,

504
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.890
from like our all hands meetings,

505
00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:19.440
you can see those with captions and you can watch them at two and a half times

506
00:33:19.441 --> 00:33:22.270
the speed.
And this isn't just an internal Google thing.
Um,

507
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.040
anybody who has Google apps has access to this technology.
If they turn it on,

508
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:33.170
<v 2>well,
that is so out of my world,
I can,
so I'm amazed.
I'm still amazed,</v>

509
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.030
but I'm learning.
I'm learning.

510
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.570
<v 1>So we have one comment here.
Uh,</v>

511
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.770
Jaxa you wanted to just come in

512
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.480
of the light setup.

513
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.860
<v 7>So just to give a background,
I'm blind myself.
Um,</v>

514
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.660
I mean just to add to that,

515
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:58.661
one thing I would definitely like to tell you is don't treat your kid any

516
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:02.960
different.
Trust me,
if you let it,
let him or her go,

517
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.380
they will reach the extreme staff will surprise you.

518
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.250
Don't treat them any,
any,
any different at all.

519
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:15.490
Because as I see a disability is everybody has,

520
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.660
every human being has a limitation.

521
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.460
A blind person just has a limitation of not being,
not being able to see,

522
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.750
but trust me,
they can use the other senses to reach the sky.

523
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.210
So just let them go.

524
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:34.310
Let them achieve anything and everything that they want that is going to be the

525
00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:37.460
most,
most important thing for them in their life.

526
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.490
<v 2>Thank you.
Uh,</v>

527
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.650
just just following up to your comment,
thank you very much for your kind of,

528
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:48.680
by the way,
just as you said,
um,
you know,

529
00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:52.430
all a blind person can't do is to see and all a deaf person can't do is here,

530
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.550
but otherwise it's all there available.
Um,

531
00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.350
I need to ask one question before you do.
Well,
you don't,
you know,
go ahead.

532
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.200
Go ahead with your question first.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Actually,

533
00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:05.380
I have a question just from a deaf person's perspective here,

534
00:35:05.381 --> 00:35:07.810
who's working at Google?
Um,
you know,

535
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.320
I been here,
you know,

536
00:35:11.321 --> 00:35:15.400
starting as a young person and even now I've seen many challenges and seen how

537
00:35:15.401 --> 00:35:19.600
things have changed over the years with captions on Youtube now and with your

538
00:35:19.601 --> 00:35:20.920
present to date Taishan today,

539
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:24.670
I'm wondering if you want to see more captions for deaf people,
um,

540
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.720
like in the future,
in 10 or so or so years from now,

541
00:35:30.721 --> 00:35:34.320
what is it that you're looking for and ways that we can help deaf people more?

542
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.280
Oh,
I get this question every day because it's an actor.
I mean,
in reality,

543
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.440
and I speak on behalf of all actors.
I mean,
only 3% of actors work.

544
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.340
You know,
people who were in the actor's union,
only three,
three of 3% of us work.

545
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.720
And it's hard to find jobs,
uh,
regardless of whether one is deaf or hearing.

546
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.360
But if you're talking specifically about deaf actors,

547
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:59.100
I think it's probably harder.
I still struggle myself,
believe it or not,

548
00:35:59.101 --> 00:36:02.430
I still struggle as I stand here today.

549
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:05.700
I had to put up my video in order to sell it,

550
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.670
in order to get people to pay attention to it,
to see how it would go.

551
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.170
A lot of deaf children come up to me and say,
I want to be an actor like you.

552
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.430
How is it that I can do it like you did it?
Or how is it?
And I say,
look,

553
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:21.210
first of all,
you need to finish school.
If you want to go to college,

554
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:25.950
go to college.
And it will certainly do you wealth in terms of your future.

555
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

556
00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.070
<v 2>And then see what it leads you to wherever you want to be.</v>

557
00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.580
I'm not the president of the deaf world,

558
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.990
I'm just an actor who just wants to do movies.

559
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.050
And I'm a person who also happens to advocate on,
uh,

560
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.150
on behalf of a number of charities,
charities that I believe in,

561
00:36:49.151 --> 00:36:51.760
charities that I believe need assistance or attention.

562
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.240
And I struggle.
Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I fail.
But you know what?

563
00:36:57.241 --> 00:37:01.770
I get back up on my feet again and I try and I do what I can to find work.

564
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.910
And it's just a matter,
I mean,
there are wonderful deaf theaters out there,

565
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:09.810
for example,
in Los Angeles as well,
as well as the national theater of the deaf,

566
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:10.800
wherever you are in the country,

567
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.010
there are places where deaf people can go to school colleges.

568
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.870
There are so many choices out there.

569
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.120
And as much as I would love to be able to own a studio like Warner brothers,

570
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:24.690
to make sure that everything is captured and say anybody can,
can have access,

571
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:28.350
it doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work that way.
So,
uh,
oh,
by the way,

572
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:32.830
my name sign is this.
There you go.
All right.

573
00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.630
I guess that's it.
How about last comment?

574
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.001
<v 5>Uh,
yeah,</v>

575
00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:44.001
just one story that I remember hearing when I was younger was I went to go hear
