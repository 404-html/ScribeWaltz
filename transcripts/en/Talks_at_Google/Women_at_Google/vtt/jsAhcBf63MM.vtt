1
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.620
Hi everybody.
Thank you for being here with me today.

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.980
I'm so pleased to be here and have a chance to introduce our guest speaker

3
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:23.290
today.
May Ms. Lee,
she's uh,

4
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.180
the father of runners.

5
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.240
She has to be in one of the proponents of this program for the kids and she also

6
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.480
just a fascinating person and please join me

7
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.300
in welcoming Mary viscerally.

8
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.423
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

9
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.160
Hi everybody.
Alright,
so,
um,
let's see.

10
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.660
Oh,
what am I got talking about today?
So,
um,
first of all,

11
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.690
number one is it's really good to see you and I think the food here is the best

12
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:05.690
I've ever seen in a corporate cafeteria.

13
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.960
It's just fantastic and thank you for all the excess who that you give food

14
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.250
runners.

15
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.250
We are picking up masses of food every day and taking it directly to the

16
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:23.471
shelters where it is either serve that night or chilled and serve the next day.

17
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.490
So it really,
really means a lot to the shelters in San Francisco.

18
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.680
Um,
what's the story about Mary Risley?
Mary Risley was a,

19
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.100
a young woman who drove across the Trans Canada highway and a blue Mustang 50

20
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:41.510
years ago.

21
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.610
And came down to San Francisco in the summer of love when everybody was sharing,

22
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.310
they were sharing sex,
apartments,
marijuana.
And uh,

23
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.100
it was a major influence to me,
the the summer of love.

24
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.260
And um,
and uh,
uh,
uh,
by the way,

25
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:05.000
I still have the Blue Mustang.
And um,

26
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.390
that was 50 years ago.
I tried,
uh,

27
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.310
for five years to be a secretary and were patty hose and golf and,

28
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.910
and apart and go up on a bus and a corporate office and,

29
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:21.860
and tried to get the men to think they want to marry me and none of it worked.

30
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.510
And so after five years,
I said,
fuck this.
And somebody said,

31
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.490
what have you always wanted to do?
And I said,

32
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:30.440
I've always wanted to be a cooking teacher.

33
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600
So I started teaching cooking in a ratty Leavenworth Street apartment.

34
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.120
I hand wrote the recipes.

35
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.240
I walked down to a bank at California and Montgomery,

36
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.590
somebody copied them on a xerox machine for free.

37
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.670
And I went home and taught everybody what I'd learned in mastering the art of

38
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:53.180
French cooking by Julia Child.
So I'm a big fraud.

39
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.480
That was in 1973 and 1979 I started a fulltime culinary school,

40
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.290
Tom Murray's.

41
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.060
And if you Google Mary Grisly,

42
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.400
um,
you will see my video.
How many people have already done that?

43
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.580
Uh,
the video I made five years ago,

44
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.620
which is timely now is,
uh,
just put the fucking Turkey in an oven,

45
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.690
have a glass of wine,
take a walk and don't worry about it.
Thank you.

46
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.700
Thank you.
Youtube.
Thank you Google.
So,

47
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.980
um,
if you go to food,
if you go to [inaudible] dot com my,
my,
uh,

48
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.170
website,
um,

49
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200
you will see there are 350 recipes on how to cook and 32 youtube videos on how

50
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.130
to cook.

51
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.910
And of course now I'm out of date because people are putting videos on other

52
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.900
things and,
and things like that.
But,
um,
uh,

53
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.890
I'm a very lucky girl that I've been able to support myself as a cooking teacher

54
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:04.690
for the last 45 years.
The next thing I am I,

55
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.720
okay.
And then the picture up there,
do I look okay?
Yes.

56
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:12.360
I look skinny and beautiful.
Um,

57
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.800
the,
uh,
what is food runners?

58
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.801
Food runners was started in 1987 with me and a group of women.

59
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.300
And,
uh,
what,

60
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:26.301
what we do is we provide any business in San Francisco with the free service,

61
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:32.770
High Free Service of picking their leftover up,

62
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:37.771
picking up their leftover perishable and prepared foods and taking it to the

63
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.870
shelters,
taking it to the,
what I call the shelters.

64
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:45.760
It's really the neighborhood feeding programs.
And so what happens is,

65
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.590
um,
uh,

66
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.620
we have currently 200 volunteers in their own car,

67
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.700
one paid truck driver,
a man running around in a van,

68
00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:02.680
his own van who's paid and two bike couriers.

69
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.920
And what those people are doing is picking up leftover perishable and prepared

70
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:12.310
foods and taking it right from the donor to the person,
uh,

71
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.960
to the people that they're going to serve it that night for dinner.

72
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.310
The,
we do have a slide show to go with a,

73
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:25.870
a PowerPoint presentation.
And so,
um,
if,

74
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.340
if we have it up,
we could,
uh,
we could talk a little bit about,
uh,

75
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.640
my pp.
It's called a PPP.

76
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:36.280
I understand a PowerPoint presentation,

77
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.380
no idea how to use something like that myself.
Um,
so,

78
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.950
so,
uh,
so what happened?
I talked about a little bit earlier,

79
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:49.951
I talked about my coming to San Francisco 50 years in the summer of love.

80
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.790
And that was a time when we were all,
uh,
when people were sharing it was a,

81
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.010
it was also time when it was cheap to live San Francisco,

82
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.310
but if you could believe the hat.
And,
uh,

83
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.520
so what we do is we provide,
uh,

84
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.130
businesses in San Francisco with this free service of picking up their leftover

85
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:14.630
food.
And,
um,
so what you might have heard of the San Francisco Food Bank.

86
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.820
The food bank is a huge building down in Indiana street,

87
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:24.170
which is a warehouse of non perishable foods.

88
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.940
So people that are,
um,
people that are,

89
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.800
uh,
that,
uh,
like Kellogg's and Delmonte,
uh,

90
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.240
he can donate,
um,
you know,

91
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.230
green beans that have the wrong label on them or,
or,
or,
or,
or,

92
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.330
or cereals or stuff like that.
So there are,
we,
we,

93
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.450
food runners takes to over 300 different neighborhood feeding programs,

94
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.270
but those programs can go to the San Francisco Food Bank and buy food.

95
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.870
Um,
you know,
like in a shopping cart for 18 cents a pound,

96
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:04.700
it's donated food.
The 18 cents goes to pay for,
you know,
the,

97
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.180
uh,
operating costs.
But what do you,

98
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.240
what do you do with the trays of lentils with mushrooms at trays of,

99
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.110
uh,
of noodles with pork that,
um,
that,

100
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.080
that can't go to a big warehouse down on Indiana Street?

101
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.210
So that's why food runners started 30 years ago to supplement what the food bank

102
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:30.890
can't do.
And,
uh,
currently we're,
so this is,
uh,

103
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.500
so we could,
we could,
uh,
uh,
currently we're delivering food,
um,

104
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.550
directly to places around town.
As I said earlier,
that can be,
um,

105
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.900
that can serve it that night or the next day.
So,
um,

106
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.080
what is food waste?
Food waste is a,
um,
it,

107
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.870
no,
let's go back to that previous one.
Let's go back to the previous,
uh,

108
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:59.110
who's doing that?
Who's clicking?
You are?
Oh,
Shit.

109
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.800
So wait a minute.
I saw John Stewart last night.

110
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:08.660
He was hiding behind something like this.
Wait,

111
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:13.460
I can do it.
Let me do it.
Show me how to do it.
Yes.
Oh yeah.

112
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.690
I can't do it.
Okay,
here we go.
I want to do one.
And then the other.

113
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.960
Okay.
So,
um,
so look at this.
40% of the,
so,

114
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.640
uh,
these,
this is the statistics.

115
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.820
So the estimate a 40% of the food and the country is discarded and um,

116
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.980
20% of the food that is bought and taken home is discarded.
And,

117
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:40.670
um,
and as you know,
uh,
one the,

118
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.380
there are so very,
very many people that are going to bed hungry.
And I,

119
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:50.120
one of the big problems in this con in the city,
I think is that you have,

120
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.770
if people have an apartment and,
and a two or three kids,

121
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.990
I mean,
they can usually pay rent,
but they don't have enough for food.

122
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.780
So there's a lot of hungry people.
You've seen it,
all that,

123
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.490
have you seen it all down here?
Right?
You see it all the time.
So,
um,

124
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.300
when we're talking about,
um,

125
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.920
rescuing a perishable and prepared foods,
um,

126
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.190
the first thing that comes to everybody's mind is,
oh,
no,

127
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:22.710
first when you go into a store or go into a business,

128
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.980
do you ever throw food away?
They say,
oh,
no,
we never throw food away.
Well,

129
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:30.720
here's our card,
here's the phone number,
here's our,
uh,
website.

130
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.730
And uh,
and then they will say,
oh,
oh,
it's not the company policy.

131
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.840
Well,
who do I talk to to change the policy?
Okay.

132
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.940
And then we're worried about liability.
Well,
the bottom line is it in San Fran,

133
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.460
in the country,
in the United States,

134
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.230
nobody has ever sued after receiving donated food.

135
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.000
There is.
And the,

136
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.090
and the donor has been protected by laws since the 80s in California.

137
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.020
And the Good Samaritan,

138
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:05.820
what's commonly called the Good Samaritan Act in the night nineties by that Bill

139
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.770
Clinton sign.
So there is no need.
There's no need to,
um,

140
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.720
okay,
here I'm going to try it.
Do,
do to do,
didn't work.

141
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.570
So there's no need to fear liability.
And so list of,
of this,
uh,

142
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:26.490
so where does food,
renters pickup food?

143
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.720
We've been picking up at whole foods at Franklin and California ever since they

144
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:34.320
started.
We pick up at every trader Joe's in the city,

145
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.990
every trader Joe's in the city.
Um,

146
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.070
listen to trader Joe's doesn't want a publicity about it.

147
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:46.071
They just do it out of the goodness of their heart and they give us milk.

148
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.280
Next one please.

149
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.720
They give us milk,
uh,
meet,

150
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.940
uh,

151
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.940
dairy flowers that have all gone by their expiration date.

152
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.700
Expiration dates doesn't mean a fucking thing.

153
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.690
What happens is it is something that was created by it.

154
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.020
It's,
it's a Ma,

155
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.930
it's at the manufacturer's discretion to put on the expiration date,

156
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.570
you know,
by,
by,
by expires after blah,
blah,
blah.
No nothing.

157
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.010
There's nothing.
I myself have kept a uh,

158
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.830
chicken,

159
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.830
a cooked chicken and eating it three weeks after I roasted it.

160
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.870
I see a cook,
I've cooked with eggs six weeks after I bought them.

161
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.130
And you know,

162
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.280
I've got cream in my fridge that has an expiration date of injury of October 26.

163
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.630
I opened it up,
smell it and use it,
you know,
you know that,

164
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.130
I mean we all that it's a,

165
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.880
don't throw it out until it starts to smell.

166
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.810
When I was a cooking school in France and 150 years ago,
the,

167
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.300
the,
the chefs used to break the egg and open it up and smell it to see if it was

168
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.470
bad.
Can you imagine that?
We don't get bad eggs,

169
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.060
so we're what's,
where does food waste come from?
Where does food waste come from?

170
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.880
The bottom line is,
the first place that it comes from is,
um,

171
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.540
the,
the,
the,

172
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.870
the farmer doesn't want to pay to have somebody go through and pick the

173
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.810
strawberries again.
So if the strawberries are,

174
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:36.730
the peppers weren't ripe when he hires the migrant workers,
he,

175
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:37.564
he,
he doesn't,

176
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.250
he doesn't want to pay to have somebody go back and get it again.
So that,

177
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.490
so nowadays there's groups called gleaners that are trying to go and get the,

178
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:51.100
get the produce from the farms after the pickers have gone through.

179
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.460
The next thing that happens as you know,

180
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.910
is that the guys sorting the apples at the,
at the,

181
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:02.020
at the distribution center is,
is this one,
he can sell this when he can't.

182
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:05.890
This is when he can sell this,
when he can.
So the ones that he can't sell,

183
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.570
we used to be discarded.
It wasn't,
it wasn't worth his while to,
uh,

184
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.450
but now there's a group here that's,
that's uh,

185
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.580
we'll go and get what they call imperfect food.
So that's a good one.
The,
um,

186
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:23.581
the huge place for sources food that we just talked about is grocery stores and,

187
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:28.120
uh,
also whenever,
so they're all,
so as we pick up at whole foods,

188
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:32.860
trader Joe's Gusset,
we pick up all over town,
uh,
the food that,

189
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:37.480
uh,
uh,
the grocery guy doesn't want to put out and,
or the,

190
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:42.370
or the food that,
um,
are the food that doesn't sell and is a little too old.
So,

191
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.710
uh,
that's what food runners for.
And then another big thing is,
as you know,

192
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:52.270
we just talked about 20% of the food taken home is discarded.

193
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.760
And I have to say the other day I threw out five carrots that have been in the,

194
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.520
in the bottom of my fridge for ever.

195
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.830
They were just pretty bad looking wilted carrots.
Uh,

196
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:06.340
they actually looked like something that,
um,

197
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.610
Dominique Crenn would cook.
She likes it.

198
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.770
She likes the roast carrots for 54 hours or so many.
Uh,

199
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.110
but anyway,
the reason I put my website up there,

200
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:23.590
the Fr Murray website is there.
There are,
as I said,

201
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:26.760
there are 350 recipes on there.
And you know what?

202
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.620
So there we have a group of young,
I say that,
uh,

203
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.980
in order to get young enrich,
you have to have blonde hair and San Francisco.

204
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:38.710
And then you have to have drive a SUV,

205
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:44.070
land rover or BMW or a Porsche poor Alfa Romeos coming out with an Siv SUV for,

206
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.300
and then you have to have blonde dogs and blonde kids.

207
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.620
But those blondes afraid of leftovers.

208
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:55.470
So they,

209
00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:00.440
they go and they buy their meal and then they throw the leftovers away.

210
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.910
You don't have to row leftovers away.
You could,
you could it turn,

211
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:09.350
you could turn your leftovers from uh,
uh,

212
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.760
leftover spaghetti,
uh,
and,

213
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.910
and you can keep it in the fridge for up to a week.

214
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.600
And if it doesn't have meat juices in it and,
uh,

215
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.330
you can spread it out in a pan,

216
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.190
a buttered pan and beat up some eggs and throw it in and make a Frittata out of

217
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:32.330
leftover spaghetti,
you can make it into something else.
He said,

218
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:36.170
that's what good cooks.
Don't know.
Gus.
What people don't know is that they say,

219
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.471
oh,

220
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:40.670
we don't like leftovers but good cooks know that you can take leftovers and turn

221
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:45.350
it into something else.
What is salad?
Niece was leftover green beans,

222
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:49.290
leftover potatoes,
the throw a can of tuna fish.
Ah,

223
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.390
am I right?
So anyway,
um,

224
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.580
the uh,
so what,

225
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.540
what the sources of food waste are,
are,

226
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.170
are the farm,
the distribution center,

227
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.460
the grocery store and the home.
And,
uh,
so,

228
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.490
so if we can try and pick up at those places and teach people how to reuse their

229
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:18.131
leftovers and not by too much that they don't need and don't worry about

230
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:22.010
expiration dates,
then we can help to avoid food waste.

231
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.530
What can we do about people here?

232
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:29.531
So I'm a 70 fucking six years old and I'm at the age where if I go to a

233
00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:34.220
restaurant,
I don't eat all the food.

234
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.520
So what's happening from my generation is a lot of people will eat half the,

235
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:44.840
their portion of chicken or fish or whatever it is,

236
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.280
and then ask for a little box to take the rest home in and then they eat,

237
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:53.810
then eat it cold for lunch the next day.
That's what older women do.
Um,

238
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.100
but w,
uh,

239
00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.400
how can you teach Googlers not to take so much on their plate and then,

240
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.040
and then they,
they think,
oh,
well it's being composted.
Well,

241
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.730
it's still,
you don't need to take so much food if you're not going to eat it.

242
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.830
And so that,
that's,
uh,
uh,
uh,
how you teach people not to do that.
I don't know.

243
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.960
Um,
you,
you tell them about the 76 year old lady that has a little box,

244
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.000
um,
to take home and eat it cold the next day.
But,
um,

245
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.980
the next,
okay.
Next.
Um,
so,

246
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.330
uh,
what,
what,

247
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:37.390
you know is that what we all know is that if I take a plate of,

248
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.160
um,
today I had delicious lentils and,
and uh,
uh,

249
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.950
noodles here for lunch.
If I,

250
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:50.580
if I take too much food on my plate,
I can it in a little box and take it home.

251
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.950
But the food that was all out on the buffet that is not reusable,

252
00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:01.110
uh,
for another day,
all can be packaged and donated.

253
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.720
And,
um,
so,
uh,
that's uh,

254
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.930
that's why we are,
uh,
oh,

255
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:13.070
we have so much tins of food from businesses like yours that we pick up and take

256
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:18.420
to the shelters.
Um,
so what I thought I'd,

257
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.480
this is a list of the five places that your food is donated to five days a week.

258
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.530
So,
um,
you don't have to hang out there.
Come on,
stand up,

259
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.660
come on,
stand up.
And [inaudible] were the Christmas girls green and red.

260
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.570
So,
um,
the,
the,
the,
the,

261
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.520
the last place that the place Derek Silva,

262
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.030
it's a 68 units of affordable housing.

263
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.710
It is for people living with HIV AIDS.

264
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.430
And so,
so the,
the food that your,

265
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:02.030
the Google is donating to through food runners every day has been taking to

266
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:04.800
those five places.
A,
uh,

267
00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:09.801
agency serving a hot meal to anybody that comes to the door,

268
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.220
a mental health treatment program for a ex cons,

269
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.930
a church for the,
uh,
serving meals to the homeless,
uh,
cannon,

270
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:23.040
Kipp as an elderly and Derek silver's HIV.

271
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.520
So those people are totally spoiled by your food.

272
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.360
And could we take more from Google?
The answer is yes.

273
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.360
We can take the yogurt that's over there.
We can take the,
the uh,

274
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.780
fruit that's in the cafes.

275
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.990
We can take everything that has not been served on a plate to somebody sitting

276
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:49.260
there spitting on it and putting their fingers in it.
Okay.
So,

277
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.180
so be sure,
uh,
for instance,
those Po,
I'll take those pumpkin's when I leave,

278
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:58.080
I'll put those,
I'll put those in my purse.

279
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.740
All buffet food is donated will where we pick up at the Hilton.

280
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:04.711
Uh,

281
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:09.711
today we're picking up at the Ritz Carlton today from the Ritz Carlton.

282
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:11.214
It's taken,

283
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.130
it's taken from the Ritz Carlton is taken about a,
uh,

284
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.200
nine months were first we got there leftover banquet food and now we're getting

285
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.440
the leftover food from the takeout places.

286
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.330
But it's just amazing the misinformation that people have.

287
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.550
I heard once about somebody,

288
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.970
it was actually bone appetit and bon appetit company and down in the peninsula

289
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.270
bone appetit is the food provider.
And they,

290
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.170
and they throw out the,

291
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.880
they put out yogurt in an ice bath and when the ice melts,

292
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.120
they throw the yogurt out.
I mean,
that's ridiculous.

293
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.330
Yogurt is bacteria.
Yogurt keeps running,

294
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.550
so no food needs to be thrown away.

295
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.470
You can donate it.
It this,

296
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.670
put it in the package and call food runners.
Um,

297
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.840
so can I have the next to the next one's probably a photo.

298
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.140
So what is food waste?
Food waste.

299
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.020
It has many sources and,

300
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:21.790
but I think it's kind of uneducated people that don't know that they,
they,
they,

301
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.740
uh,
or,
or it's people that don't care one more,
um,

302
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.430
and,
or they're in,
they're in the habit of throwing food away,
you know,
the,
the,

303
00:21:31.431 --> 00:21:35.980
the,
the,
the people.
Uh,
so it takes a long time too.

304
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.820
Um,

305
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.320
it takes a long time to get people to change their habits.

306
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.280
And I'm,
so the habits are,
uh,

307
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.660
eight only what you take only what you think you can eat,

308
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.040
save the rest for,
um,
uh,

309
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.180
to donate and,
um,
uh,

310
00:21:58.181 --> 00:22:03.181
see that a responsible organization like food runners picks it up and takes it

311
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:07.900
where it can best be used.
The next thing that,
um,

312
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.140
I was going to that I think that you,

313
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.020
what you can help food runners with is,
first of all,

314
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:18.610
maybe we could pass these out to everybody and pass these out to everybody.

315
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.180
So the,

316
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.220
the deal is that because I'm an old secretary,

317
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.360
I,
uh,

318
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.240
do things with cards and brochures and,
uh,

319
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.350
but hold onto these.

320
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:39.730
And so we're still kind of in the process at food runners were kind of in the

321
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:42.700
process.
That's Canadian for process.

322
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.110
We're kind of in the process of,
uh,

323
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.340
trying to get more into the new technology.
For instance,

324
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:55.390
we are,
um,
uh,
uh,
we are,
uh,

325
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.460
working on an app where P uh,

326
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.630
but currently people can donate through the website or the APP.
Uh,

327
00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:06.631
we still have a phone with an answering service so people can call and leave a

328
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:11.920
message on an answering service.
I mean an answer,
uh,
answering a voicemail.

329
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.430
But,
um,
what,
what I think you,

330
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.280
how you can help as Googlers,

331
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.310
as San Franciscans and as concerned people is tell,

332
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.910
tell first of all,
tell your friends,
tell your friends,
uh,
the best,

333
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.630
the best.
Don't uh,
volunteers.
For us,

334
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.740
we had our people who are in between jobs,

335
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.470
people who were in between jobs.
That's fine.

336
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.680
People are in between jobs or recently retired.

337
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.680
Make really good volunteers because they're used to getting up and going

338
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:49.520
somewhere.
So if you know anybody that's recently retired or,

339
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:54.020
um,
or between jobs,
tell them that this is,
and they have their own vehicle,

340
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:58.530
this is a really good place to,
to volunteers with food runners.
Um,

341
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.080
we also could use help through social media,
um,
by letting,

342
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:07.090
by letting people,
by taking pictures of the food you're donating and,
and,

343
00:24:07.091 --> 00:24:08.840
and to saying,
this is going to food,

344
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.430
this is going to neighborhood shelters through food runners.
So we can,
we can,

345
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.900
we could use to help with social media.
We can use help with,
um,

346
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.920
telling everybody,
you know,
with food we can use.
Um,

347
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.910
and what else can we use help with?
We,
um,
uh,

348
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.510
if you know anybody with a car for one.
Uh,

349
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.730
so I want to tell you a little bit more about some of the people that are

350
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.770
volunteers for us.

351
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.690
There's a man who came here,
actually,
I shouldn't say this,

352
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.770
but he came here also came here in the 50s and earned his living as a drug

353
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:46.630
dealer.
And then he went into the,
um,
uh,

354
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:51.320
waterproofing and painting business.
And this guy is,

355
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.820
um,
has been picking up at the ferry plaza farmer's market,

356
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.720
all the leftover food from the farmers.
Um,

357
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.700
every Saturday whenever he's in San Francisco.
And he could walk though,

358
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.040
you'll see his,
he goes and gets the truck.

359
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.750
We use a truck for large donations,
it goes and gets the truck and he's,

360
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.250
he's a Brit so you can see him at one 30,
1231 o'clock in the,

361
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:19.760
at the ferry building going food runners,

362
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:23.030
food runners,
bring out your food.

363
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:28.450
So it takes him four hours every day to deliver all the food that the farmers

364
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:32.800
bring him because he has a relationship with them and they,

365
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.920
the farmers at the ferry and then the farmers at the ferry bill bring him all,

366
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.040
even extra food on Saturdays.

367
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.140
There is a nother guy kind of who I would call a trust fund baby.
He's at,

368
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.920
uh,
well,

369
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.920
well to do man who lives out on Washington street in Pacific heights and he has

370
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:56.681
a 17 year old daughter and he and his daughter go on food runs every Saturday.

371
00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:02.000
They,
uh,
the US,
uh,
Sunday.
Every Sunday.
He goes,

372
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.260
he does Saturday at carers,
cupcakes on Steiner Street,

373
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.140
no Scott Street.
And he takes a,

374
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.820
takes bread and pastries out to the veterans home out on,
uh,

375
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.290
on Presidio.
And then,
um,
on,
on Saturday,
on Sunday,

376
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:22.910
he goes to the farmer's market at Fort Mason and picks up all their leftover

377
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:27.770
foods and takes it to a place called Walden House on with what I call Walden

378
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:32.270
House on Hayes and Fillmore.
And,
um,
so,
uh,

379
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:37.250
so what it,
and then there's a guy called Sam Haskins,
Sam Haskins.

380
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:37.940
Uh,

381
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.940
we'll go today at about three 30 to a restaurant called Cook Cari who makes a

382
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:48.890
foil trays of food for him.
And,
uh,
he's a retired,
um,

383
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.160
he's a lawyer who writes books.
Um,

384
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.290
we also have women doing deliveries too.
We have,
um,

385
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.570
but they're there.

386
00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.650
So they're of the volunteers for food runners and some of them have been

387
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:04.690
volunteers for 30 years.
They,
uh,

388
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.740
some people like to know that they're going to go every Friday at four o'clock

389
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:13.440
in the afternoon to pick up the leftover food at the William Sonoma corporate

390
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:16.830
office.
And,
and some people like to know that,

391
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.730
that they're going to go to,
oh,
there's a brand new place,

392
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.320
I don't know if you've been to it,

393
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.570
it's called Breck Makati Makati.
It's a,

394
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.600
a society deli on post between Larkin and hide that just opened two weeks ago,

395
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.260
a guy called Stanley Gaddy was,

396
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:41.730
is the owner and he brought in the New York a bunch of New York hot shots and

397
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:46.040
they,
they put all this Kabuto and Sauerkraut and tea,
uh,

398
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:51.060
Chia seeds and all is trendy food in there.
And,
um,

399
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.720
and so they have,
and you go,
what,
what,

400
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:58.280
what are they doing on post between Larkin and hide?
It's kind of like renters,

401
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.940
you know,
neighborhood.

402
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.440
But they've got all the society people coming in their limos and,

403
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:07.920
and they send their chauffeurs the pickup food.
But um,
that,

404
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:12.921
that New Delhi on Post Street is giving up all their leftover food every,

405
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.240
every.
I went and picked that myself every night at nine o'clock.

406
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.290
The first week they were open and now they save the food and the cooler.

407
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:26.750
And we picked up the next day.
But have you been there?
No,
I was just thinking of,

408
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.810
it might be
spot that's on southern.

409
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.280
This is a post.
It's a kind of crappy building.
Yeah.

410
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.290
So I got to tell more jokes or he got a phone call.
Huh.

411
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.650
So,
so anyway,
so,
so we,
we're,
we're,
we pick up at bakeries,

412
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.620
grocery stores,
um,
um,
Deli's like this place,
uh,

413
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.350
Molly stones.
So listen to this.
So I am,
uh,

414
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.460
in Molly stones all the time because,
uh,
on California and Franklin,

415
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.850
and it's taken me 10 years to get the Molly stones to donate their leftover

416
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:08.430
food.
And,
um,
and the,

417
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:11.490
and what changed their mind was I named my dog Molly stone.

418
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:13.810
I got a new dog last year and called it Molly stone.

419
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.490
But,
you know,
it's,
it's hard to convince people that,
as I said,

420
00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:25.300
to change their habits.
But we have w we have 200 volunteers in their own,

421
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.010
uh,
one,
uh,
uh,

422
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:32.030
we were picking up five o 500 times a week with a van,

423
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.650
a truck,
and our volunteers with regular runs.
And then,
uh,

424
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.430
other people that are on calls,
some people just like to be on call,

425
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:46.690
getting their car and go.
And,
uh,
we also pick up,
I said,

426
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.410
I talked about the Ritz Carlton and,
um,
the Hilton,

427
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.370
we also pick up from caterers.
Uh,
there's a big cater,

428
00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.260
a called Dan Mccall who has a commissary kitchen on 17th street.

429
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.880
He will take back his leftover food to the commissary kitchen,

430
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:06.820
will come the next day and pick it up.
Um,

431
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.320
there is another caterer called Paula Duke out of Emeryville.
She will,
uh,

432
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:13.450
so she doesn't take it back to Emeryville.

433
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.370
She calls us and we pick it up at one 30 at night.
And,
uh,

434
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.910
so somebody suggested recently that maybe we should have Uber drivers,

435
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:26.150
we should have Uber because of their bad reputation,
uh,
uh,

436
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.030
sponsor,
uh,
uh,
cars going around and picking up food for us.

437
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.170
Um,
and you go,
ah,
I don't know,
cause they might get,

438
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.690
they might get a cream chicken all over the back of their car.

439
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.330
So anyway,
um,
the regular people,

440
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.860
we have 500 people,
uh,
no,

441
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.830
150 people.
A truck driver,
a van,

442
00:30:50.831 --> 00:30:55.660
and a couple of cargo bikes going around and picking up food either as regular

443
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:57.400
runners or volunteers.

444
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.410
And I still need that last thing about the call to action,
the call to action.

445
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.190
Uh,
what can you do to help?
You can help us with social media.

446
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.600
You can help us with spreading the word to food businesses.
You can help us with,

447
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.800
uh,
letting anybody who might want to be a volunteer.
No.

448
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.860
And then the fourth way,
I,
I can't remember.

449
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.110
So we'll have to get back to that.
Uh,
we'll get back to spread the word,

450
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:25.350
tell your friends and uh,

451
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.660
and get and help us get more food to those in need in San Francisco.

452
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.100
Before I open it up for questions,

453
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:36.040
I want to tell you a little bit more about the,
uh,
well,

454
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:40.270
this place that I like to take food to Wa oh yes.
Listen to this.

455
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.780
So the other day I got,
uh,
somebody,

456
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:48.610
somebody donated three garbage bags full of these,

457
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.470
uh,
paper containers that you might take soup Homan and so I took him to a Walden

458
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:56.440
House,
but I want to tell you about Walden House.

459
00:31:56.441 --> 00:32:01.441
Walden house is a now called healthright three 60 and it's a,

460
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:06.871
they recruit men and women coming out of jail who've had repeated,

461
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:09.940
you know,
who,
who have keep going back to being,

462
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.560
having drugs and getting into trouble.
And uh,
they,
they,
they,

463
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:18.490
they housed them for six months.
And so it's a rehab center.

464
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:20.860
They have eight locations in San Francisco.

465
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.700
And what has happened is that because of the food we eat,

466
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:29.260
the cause of the food that we bring them from people like you,

467
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.370
um,

468
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:35.370
that has saved them $2 million a year that they would otherwise have to spend

469
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:38.800
on,
on by making food for them.

470
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.740
So thank you Google for all your food.

471
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.370
Thank you for Youtube.
Where I got my fame.

472
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.470
And what kind of questions do you have for me about food rescue,

473
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:55.560
food waste and food runners?
Actually,

474
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.930
I got two questions from Kevin.
First year.

475
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.920
So he has two questions for you.
So,
um,

476
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:10.120
what policies should we be trying to pass the lower barriers to sharing food and

477
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.450
what policies?
Yes.
Should we pass?
Yes.

478
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.680
To low to lower barriers to sharing food.

479
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.750
There are no policies.
Just pick up the fucking food.
Okay.

480
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:28.610
The second one,
should we,

481
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.020
should we more actively pushed people to be rigid to giving that covet?

482
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.550
So should we push people to be vegetarians?
Um,

483
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.590
I don't think that has anything to do with rescuing food.
Uh,

484
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.900
I mean we do listen to this in San Francisco.
There are,

485
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.800
uh,
but it's well known that the,
uh,

486
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:57.020
the homeless people are the pickiest eaters.

487
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.760
So if you were to go serve food at glide or say to Anthony or Martin de Porres,

488
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:06.140
you do have people going through the line saying,
does that have sugar in it?

489
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:11.210
Does that have gluten?
So there are,
there are,

490
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.450
uh,
even in Sanford,
even the homeless,
the hungry are,

491
00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:17.180
are picky eaters here,

492
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.050
but I think vegetarianism is a personal choice.

493
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.560
Yes,
sweetheart.
Hello.

494
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.120
Hello.
Hello.
Testing.
Testing.
Um,
I would just curious like what

495
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:37.070
<v 3>inspired the inspiration for the initial,
do you hear you were,</v>

496
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:39.920
you were running a cookie school,
um,

497
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:43.850
and then you decided to start this food runner sometime later.
You said 1987.

498
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:46.940
What was the,
what was happening at that moment?
What did you see?
What,

499
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:47.774
what did what

500
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.000
<v 0>quite frankly,
I used to,
um,</v>

501
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.870
stop in my red Alpha male at the corner of,
uh,

502
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.250
every day I crossed the corner of chestnut and Columbus.

503
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:02.870
And you see people going through the garbage looking for food.
And,
um,
so I,

504
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.950
what I did,
I had an n w at one time that my cooking school,

505
00:35:06.951 --> 00:35:10.820
we did a two day wedding cake workshop.
And I,

506
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:15.620
so at the end of the two days I had,
we,
we cut into them,
we taste it,

507
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:19.820
but I had seven wedding cakes.
Do I drive them to glide?

508
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:25.190
Do I,
um,
give them to the staff or do I,

509
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.660
do I throw them in the garbage?
And so I thought,
well,

510
00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:34.661
there must be other people in the food business that have that same question.

511
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:39.390
And the truth is,
I still have that too.
And um,

512
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.410
I still have buttercream all over the steering wheel because I drove it to
glide.

513
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:48.690
I drove those wedding cakes to glide in 1986.
I approached the,

514
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:53.340
the mayor's office,
Diane Feinstein was the mayor then and said,

515
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:56.400
I have food connections.
Can,
can I,
can we help?

516
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.410
And she introduced me to a woman in Berkeley who was kind of a whole,
whole,

517
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:06.440
um,
mother earth time of woman.
And she taught me how to do this.
Uh,

518
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.530
and so we started with a small group of people,
food runners saying,

519
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:13.740
we're going to provide this free service to any business in San Francisco.

520
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.840
And what do we do?
If,
so,

521
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:20.070
what do you do if you have a party in your home?

522
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.020
And then not everybody comes.
And,
uh,
so what you can do,

523
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:30.050
what you can do as a home cook is packaged to the food and,

524
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:35.590
and you can look on food runners.org the a website and it'll tell you where your

525
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:39.840
neighborhood place that you can take food too.
If you live in north beach,

526
00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:43.710
you can take it to north beach citizens.
If you live in out my,
the,
you know,

527
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:46.890
there's a place called Edgewood out by the zoo,
things like that.

528
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.780
So we can't pick up in homes but,

529
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.880
but home food can be taken and um,
and there are,

530
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.670
I have a oh,
okay.
What it's that answer your question.
Yes.

531
00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.980
And one more quick question.

532
00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.390
Have you seen that documentary wasted and what do you think of Anthony fucking

533
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:06.360
board?
Dan?
Uh,

534
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.480
I haven't seen the documentary.
They asked me if I would be in it and he,
uh,

535
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.610
he's a definitely a newcomer to the whole thing,
you know.

536
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.960
Have you seen the documentary?
Was it any good?
It was actually pretty good.
Yeah,

537
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.790
I bet.
So Tony Bourdain,
as you know,
as made his reputation as a bad boy,

538
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:28.320
throwing cigarette butts and melted butter and restaurants where he worked in

539
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.260
grand central station.
But he's,

540
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:35.670
he has great writers and great producers and so,

541
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.980
so if they're helping the food movement,
God bless them.

542
00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.040
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

543
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.850
<v 5>Hello?
Hello?
Hi.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.</v>

544
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.590
I was introduced to your company about 10 years ago,
working in grocery,

545
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:52.590
working on whole foods,
you know,

546
00:37:52.591 --> 00:37:56.940
and so it was a very interesting moment of just like the idea of food waste and

547
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:57.870
how it's being acknowledged.

548
00:37:57.871 --> 00:38:00.900
And it seems like perhaps like you guys could have been like a kind of like

549
00:38:00.901 --> 00:38:02.380
setting an industry standard for a sledge.

550
00:38:02.381 --> 00:38:06.930
And I'm curious if like other cities or other cities.

551
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.630
<v 0>Yeah,
so what happens is there is now a,
uh,
a,</v>

552
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.750
uh,
kind of a food,
food waste.
Uh,

553
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:20.300
I mean the food recovery group in Sonoma county that I trained,

554
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.560
there's one in Marin county that I helped train.

555
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:25.890
There's one in the peninsula I help train.
There's one in Wilksbear,

556
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:30.750
Pennsylvania that I helped work with,
this one in northwest Connecticut.
So,
um,

557
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.590
and there's a great one in Toronto that I didn't have anything to do with,
but,

558
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.600
um,
uh,
food waste is becoming a huge topic.
And,
uh,

559
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.960
I even saw it on the,
a side of a moving van.

560
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.840
I can't remember the name of the moving company,

561
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.190
but it had a big sign on it saying move,

562
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:56.550
move for hunger.org and it appears at the moving company,

563
00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:01.630
this getting all your uh,
furniture and taking it to somewhere.

564
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.470
We'll also take all your food from your cupboards and donated.

565
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:10.750
So food waste is becoming a really good topic and it's great that,
uh,

566
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.120
everybody's becoming involved in it.

567
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.383
<v 4>Okay.</v>

568
00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.020
<v 0>Any other questions?</v>

569
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:25.760
So the other thing that I'm going to finish with is,
um,
uh,

570
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.100
I know that you all are,

571
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.700
most of you are trained professionals in food and um,

572
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.370
I want to,
I want to tell you a story about,

573
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:41.700
so w w w we had a truck donated to us 20 years ago from ups and it was a

574
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.220
refrigerated truck.

575
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:50.250
And so I went to a party and that the middle of the night put my,

576
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.420
um,
all the donated food in it took it to,
it was being part,
it was,

577
00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:59.890
um,
we used a parking space at Royal Hawaiian seafood and,

578
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.810
and plugged it in.
I plugged in,

579
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.160
but it turned the next day I went back to get the truck to deliver the food to

580
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:11.110
the shelters.
And,
um,
uh,
and,
and the,

581
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.430
it was clear that the refrigeration didn't work.
And so what,

582
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.490
so I had big bags of carrots and celery bread and,

583
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:24.430
uh,
bags of chuck cooked chicken and I,

584
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.060
and so what I did was I took the,

585
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:32.070
I drove the truck to fifth and Bryant to the shelter at fifth and Bryant and I a

586
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:39.060
w taking the bags of bread inside,
taking the carrots inside.
And I,

587
00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.690
and I tried to put the chicken into the dumpster and the homeless guys started

588
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.990
that were waiting to get in the shelter,
started climbing in the dumpster,

589
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:47.824
and Paul and I'm like,

590
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.970
<v 6>oh,
no,
no,
you can make you sick.</v>

591
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.610
<v 0>And they go,
lady,
we're hungry.
You know,
the it,
there's,</v>

592
00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:00.400
there's no need to fear liability.
And we,

593
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:05.270
I don't care what the health department says in San Francisco or Wilkes Barre,

594
00:41:05.271 --> 00:41:07.730
Pennsylvania or a Truckee,
California,

595
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:13.040
it's [inaudible].
If you let the health department,

596
00:41:13.041 --> 00:41:17.030
I mean,
of course you have to obey their rules when you're in the food business,

597
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.960
but,
um,
they will try and tell you,
oh,

598
00:41:20.961 --> 00:41:24.950
it has to be chilled at this temperature and rain and take the 10 fucking

599
00:41:24.951 --> 00:41:29.770
temperature.
No,
it's food and they're hungry people there.

600
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.650
They're not going to follow you out the door to find out where the s the salad

601
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:37.540
is going.
I just,
you know,
uh,
I'm an old hippie from the,

602
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.140
from the 60s.
Um,
it,
it,
eh,

603
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.350
we can't,
uh,

604
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:50.720
W W W we can't be run by rules and regulations when they're hungry people.

605
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.870
And we have to,
as civilized human beings,

606
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.220
we have to take care of our fellow human beings.
As far as I know,

607
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.710
we're the only animal in the world that,

608
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.720
that cook that he heats food and makes it a taste good.
And,
um,

609
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.450
uh,
you know,
we,
we don't,

610
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:13.451
we aren't like deer or raccoons gone around the Presidio picking up food and,

611
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.440
and,
uh,
and as,
as far as ad,

612
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.780
and we have to take care of our fellow human beings and,

613
00:42:20.781 --> 00:42:25.781
and with one out of every four people going to bed hungry in San Francisco,

614
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.580
we need to do everything we can to help them.
Thank you.
