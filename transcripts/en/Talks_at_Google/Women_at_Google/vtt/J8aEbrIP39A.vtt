1
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.990
I'm Charlotte Rally,
uh,
as Tara said,
I,
um,

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.500
lead our women's initiative at Mckinsey.

3
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:15.370
And this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart and I assume pretty timely

4
00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:19.810
and a topic right now for all of you.
Um,
I'm going to share some of our,

5
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:24.070
the insights from our women in the workplace research that we do together with

6
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:24.461
lean in.

7
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:28.820
We're in our second year of doing a survey of approximately about 130 companies

8
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:32.410
were participated,
about 34,000 participants.

9
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:36.100
And those companies represent about almost five or four and a half thousand for

10
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.060
four and a half million employees.
Uh,

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.280
so a lot of great insights that we've been able to get out of the data.
Um,

12
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.970
and as I mentioned,
this is a topic that's really near and dear to my heart.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.780
So as in addition to spending a lot of time on women's issues that Mckinsey,

14
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:53.620
I'm a mother of,
I have a daughter and you know,
I'm,
I'm always thinking about a,

15
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.040
you know,

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.820
how is this world going to be different when she is in the workplace and how can

17
00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:58.960
we make that happen together?

18
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.790
So before I get into the research,

19
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.900
I wanted to lay a little bit of the groundwork for why this is a topic that

20
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:11.620
people should care about.
Um,
other than a lot of the obvious reasons.

21
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.330
The economic case is real.

22
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.660
So we did research and our power of parity research,
uh,

23
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.610
where we looked at different regions across the globe and estimated what the

24
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:24.130
impact would be if women achieved parity.

25
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.970
And that's impact is about 28 trillion.
If we close the gap,
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.520
recognizing that slightly unreasonable,
uh,
we also said,
well,

27
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:36.400
what if each company within its region where,
sorry,

28
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.780
each country within its region,

29
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.820
we're able to reach parody at the or the pace of change of the fastest changing

30
00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:47.080
countries in the region.
And that's how it has an impact of about 12 trillion.

31
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.580
So this is a huge number obviously,
and something that we all need to care about

32
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.200
in the u s this impact is about two point 1 trillion.

33
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.090
So this is bigger than the GDP of Texas.
Um,
and there's three main gaps,

34
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.830
uh,
to close in order to get parity.
One is participation.

35
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:08.710
So in the U S it's about 40% of the GOP is participation,

36
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.100
30% from moving people from part time to full time and then 30% productivity.

37
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:15.190
And that's,

38
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.190
that's essentially people in lower wage or lower productive jobs or sectors.

39
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.300
Um,
and with pay gaps.
So if those things closed,
we would see,
um,

40
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.160
two point 1 trillion.
So at the company level,
what's the case for change?

41
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.450
We typically look at it in four lenses.
So one is the more obvious,

42
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.250
most eyes or values,
right?
The second one is around talent.

43
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.900
Third is performance.
There's actual link to performance and gender diversity.

44
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.250
And finally the customer,

45
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:48.820
how are we actually relate more to our customer base that's making decisions?

46
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.760
Primarily,
there are a lot of women making the decisions in the household.

47
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.290
So first if you think about values,
um,

48
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.960
women make up a huge of the,
the,
the workplace,

49
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.650
right?
Um,
but if you look at their pay gap,

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.970
women are making about 80 or 20% less than men.
And furthermore,

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.770
there's actually a differential in what happens when the performer,

52
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.840
there's positive versus negative performance.
So in positive,

53
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.620
in times of positive performance,
women tend to get less of a bump.
Um,

54
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.970
Sharon less of the upside and actually get penalized more when there's negative

55
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.450
performance.
So the meritocracy,
while it's important,

56
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:33.370
and it's something that we all talk about,
it's not there yet.
Talent.

57
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.450
So winning the war for talent,
needless to say means getting more women.

58
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.730
Today,
college graduates,
women that are college graduates represent 58%,

59
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.170
um,
of the,
of the college of graduate population.
And so if you want it,

60
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.080
if you want to get talent,
you need to get talent.

61
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.520
Women both right out of college,
but also at every stage in the pipeline

62
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.100
performance.

63
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.880
There've been many studies and I know you've done a lot of study studies at,

64
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.420
at Google on the power of diverse teams and diversity of thought.

65
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.870
The research that we've done shows that gender diverse companies outperform by

66
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:12.340
15% and ethnically diverse companies outperform by 35%.

67
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.080
So there's a real case for,
for performance in diversity,

68
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.410
uh,
and finally the customer.

69
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:23.350
So women are making a lot of the decisions at the household.

70
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:25.600
This is obviously in the BTC world.
Um,

71
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.260
but if you think about that actually having a diverse organization that's

72
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.720
serving those households is quite important.

73
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.480
So now let's turn to the women in the workplace.
Uh,
research for starters.

74
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.530
Um,
the,
uh,
we've been benchmarking this for about 10 years.

75
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.500
We've been benchmarking and studying women in the workplace,
the pipeline,

76
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.300
the data forever,
for about 10 years.

77
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.140
Over the past few years we've also started expanding to two.

78
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.610
Also benchmark and look at the experiences and attitudes of men and women as

79
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:57.490
well.
So we'll get into that.
Um,
but when you look at the trends,

80
00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:00.490
the data trends of the pipeline,
it's going to take,

81
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.220
given how the glacial pace at which we're moving,

82
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.940
it's going to take about a hundred years to reach gender parity in the sea suite

83
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.050
a hundred years.

84
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.860
So I'm personally hoping that we can speed that up a little bit because I'd like

85
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:15.640
my daughter to be able to have a better chance and not have to wait till my

86
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:17.650
great granddaughter to see Parity.

87
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.330
So what does the corporate pipeline look like?
And this is us data by the way.

88
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:25.180
But when we look at the European data,
it's relatively similar.

89
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.880
The corporate pipeline is not looking great.

90
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.990
So our results from this year reaffirm what we keep seeing over the past.

91
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.910
We've seen over the past 10 years,
we chose,

92
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.830
women are represented at every level in the pipeline,
in the organization,

93
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.560
and the numbers aren't changing much year after year.

94
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.560
We're going to come back to this one.
But despite a misperception,

95
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:46.750
this is not due to attrition,
right?

96
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:49.540
This is actually due to promotion and some and other factors.

97
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:53.650
And so we'll come back to that.
If you look at women of color,
it's even worse,

98
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:58.640
right?
It's even more stark.
So at the SeeSuite instead of 17%,

99
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.500
you see 3% for example.

100
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.510
And if you look at some of the wallstreet journal research on the ambition of
um,

101
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.690
women of color,
black,

102
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:10.691
Hispanic and Asian women are 48% of them said they aspire to be a top executive

103
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.250
compared with 37% of white women.

104
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.700
So there's not a lack of ambition on the part of,
of women of color.

105
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.470
So now going back to it to attrition,
it is not the driving factor.

106
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:23.330
And this is a very common misperception.

107
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:26.600
And clearly this is a mythbusting piece of data.

108
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:31.460
But if you look at this is attrition by tenure and men actually attrite faster

109
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:35.390
than women,
which means it's not that women are leaving,
right?
And often,
look,

110
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:39.440
the one caveat to this is this doesn't necessarily say where the men are going.

111
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.630
So they might actually be going into another,
uh,

112
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.550
a position similar to another organization.
But still,
um,
if you look at this,

113
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.190
it's not saying that the reason why we're not we're,

114
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.890
we're losing women at Seymour senior levels is because they're leaving.

115
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.270
So let's talk about the challenge.

116
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.300
The challenge starts early at the very first milestone for every 100 women

117
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:08.331
promoted about 130 men are promoted at the first promotion.

118
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.820
So this is from the entry level position to manage our,
for example.

119
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.620
And then we also see discrepancy and hiring throughout the pipeline.

120
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.020
So what that means is it just keeps getting worse.
So,

121
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:23.460
not only are we promoting men at a faster rate at the earlier stages,

122
00:07:23.461 --> 00:07:27.000
but then we're also bringing in more men throughout the the funnel.
Uh,

123
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.760
and furthermore,
we're promoting women at a slower rate.

124
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.240
So all of these things are contributing to the state of the pipeline.

125
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.040
So now let's turn for a moment to the second part of what I had originally

126
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:43.280
mentioned,
which is not just the pipeline data but the experience data.

127
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.540
So what are the attitudes of men and women in the workplace and how does that

128
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:48.740
explain some of the data?

129
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.560
So I'm going to start by getting a little bit of involvement from you in the

130
00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:57.340
room.
So first question,
raise your hand if yes.

131
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.510
Has Your gender been a disadvantage as you've climbed the corporate ladder?

132
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.100
Yes,
it has.
Raise your hand if it's yes.

133
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

134
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.250
<v 0>Okay.
First of all,
it's great that a lot of you have not had that issue,</v>

135
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:14.180
but I do see if I look around the room,
probably more women raising their hands,

136
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.170
uh,
which is consistent with the data.
So if you look at the data,

137
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:24.520
women perceive more disadvantages based on their gender and the gap keeps

138
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:26.530
getting wider as you go more senior.

139
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.570
And when we look at the actual qualitative data behind the survey,

140
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.980
women consistently report feeling that their comp contributions are often valued

141
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:37.360
less than men,
um,

142
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.830
that they're being turned to less than men for important decisions,
uh,

143
00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:44.680
that they're participating less meaningfully and meetings.

144
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:48.070
And often there were receiving fewer challenging assignments than men.

145
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.150
Other research that we've done often shows that men get stretch assignments and

146
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.770
are promoted based on potential,

147
00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:56.970
whereas often women are promoted on performance and the history of their

148
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:00.690
performance.
And one other factoid on millennials,

149
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.910
which is you'd hope that this is changing for millennials,

150
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.180
but actually millennials have answered these questions in very similar ways,
um,

151
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.520
to the rest of the workforce.

152
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.670
So another question,
raise your hand if yes.

153
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.780
Do you have meaningful access to senior leadership?
Yes.

154
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.470
Okay.
All right.
Better.
Better.

155
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.490
So men and women also report having different access to senior leaders and

156
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.383
networks.

157
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.460
So this is also another case where the gap grows and particularly at more senior

158
00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:39.020
levels where access to senior leadership is especially important for sponsorship

159
00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:41.120
and for promotion,
it gets worse.

160
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.120
And what are the reasons behind this also has to do with networks.

161
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.130
So women tend to have networks.
This is our research shows that are 50,
50 women,

162
00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:53.330
men and in men tend to have networks that are primarily male.

163
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.290
So if you then think about within my network,
just if you do the math,

164
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.180
it has to be true,
right?
That women just had smaller networks.
If that's the case,

165
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.780
because we know that there are so many more men in senior ranks or they have

166
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:08.750
smaller networks of senior leaders.
And so what does that mean?

167
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.490
Obviously we need to get more women in senior positions,
but we also need to,

168
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.570
uh,
make sure that men are mentoring women.
That's a big,
big gap.

169
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.490
We'll come back to that one.

170
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:23.980
But often people tend to mentor others that are very similar to themselves.
Um,

171
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.640
they don't feel as comfortable.

172
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.880
Men might not feel comfortable taking a woman out to drinks if that's the way

173
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:31.220
that mentorship relationship begins and things like that.

174
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:33.890
So how do you actually start becoming very,

175
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:35.870
and this is a call to action for the men in the room,

176
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.790
how can you get really purposeful about thinking about who you want to mentor

177
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:42.770
and sponsor within your organization?

178
00:10:42.771 --> 00:10:44.300
Which women you're going to really take under your wing?

179
00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:48.940
Cause that makes a huge difference.
So how about this?

180
00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:53.620
Do you re do you feel that you've received as much feedback as your peers?

181
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.500
Raise your hand if yes.
Okay.

182
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:01.320
A little bit of a mix,
a little bit of the next.
Um,

183
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.940
so our research shows that women receive less feedback than men,
um,

184
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.590
mass and more specifically the,
the tough developmental messages.

185
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.960
Okay.
So,
so what does that mean?

186
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.070
Especially as you get more senior hearing the tough messages that help you

187
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:21.240
develop is extremely important to developing and progressing.

188
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.040
And not only women,
men,
but women actually have a heart.

189
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.880
I have a harder time given that giving the hard telling the hard messages to

190
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:30.714
other women.

191
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.090
So both men and women worry that they're going to create an emotional response

192
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.110
or that they are going to be perceived as mean or hurtful.
I mean,

193
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:44.730
this goes back to a lot with unconscious bias,
but by giving a woman feedback,

194
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:48.090
and if you think about that,
I mean that's doing a tremendous disservice,

195
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.410
tremendous disservice because we know that people grow through developmental

196
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:56.800
feedback.
And so how can we all ask ourselves,
are we doing that right?

197
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:01.210
Are you giving the hard but important messages to women in the same way that

198
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:05.050
you're getting to men?
And if you're not,
how might you shift your mindset to say,

199
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.680
you know,
this is my intention is to help this person grow.

200
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.560
And so being mean or hurtful is not the issue.

201
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:14.770
It's about using the intention of the positive intent.

202
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.483
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

203
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.300
<v 0>So have you ever been called aggressive,
intimidating,</v>

204
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.560
demanding or bossy?
Oh,
okay.

205
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.590
This is a great culture.
I'm with you.
I'm raising my hand too,

206
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:37.260
by the way.
Um,
so the good news is,
this is we,

207
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.280
we looked at this from the following angle.
We said,

208
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.250
how many people are more likely to negotiate,

209
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.140
whether it's for higher pay or I'm a promotion or something else.

210
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.760
Are you willing to negotiate?

211
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.880
And the good news is that women aren't negotiating at the same rate as men.

212
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.810
So we're,
we're doing it.

213
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.060
But the bad news is that women get unduly penalized,

214
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.710
right,
for being bossy and aggressive.
So what that means is that,
um,

215
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.573
when,

216
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.310
what that means is that the percentage of women and men that were called Bossy,

217
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:12.580
aggressive or intimidating is much higher for those,
that Nigga,

218
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.940
for the women that negotiated versus the men.
And,
and by the way,

219
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.830
19% of the women who didn't even say they negotiated feel like they're being

220
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:25.790
called those things a lot of the time.
So how do we change the game?

221
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.890
Let's talk about changing the game.

222
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.210
Three things we've seen in companies that are the best.
And so first of all,

223
00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:36.740
I'm going to start by saying this is a,
we are,
as,
as we saw in the data,

224
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.130
we are in far from where we need to be.
Um,

225
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.210
and no one company has cracked the code.

226
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.140
So there's nobody that's figuring it out and doing it tremendously well.

227
00:13:45.141 --> 00:13:48.950
Lots of companies are trying different things and having success in different

228
00:13:48.951 --> 00:13:51.650
ways,
but nobody is,
has cracked the code.

229
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.670
But we looked at some of the companies that had over 30% women in the CSUITE,

230
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.430
right?
So those that were doing the best on this dimension.
And we said,

231
00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:00.560
what are three,
what are some of the things that are common?

232
00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:05.330
So three things and we'll dive into them in a minute.
So one is,
um,
persistence.

233
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.920
Many of these companies,
including Mckinsey,
has been at this for,

234
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.340
for 10 years or more,
right?
We've been talking about it,

235
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.300
we've been looking at the data,
we've been trying different things and you know,

236
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.970
it takes time.
It takes time and commitment.

237
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.880
The second one is the CEO commitment.
So this is not a social,
you know,

238
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.740
nice to have thing on the side.

239
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.580
This is a true priority from the CEO and this is commitment that cascades all

240
00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:34.340
the way down the organization and the way that any business initiative would.

241
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:39.620
That's number two.
And then number three is holistic change programs.
So the,

242
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.680
again,
it's not about a bunch of policies or programs on the side,

243
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:46.220
but it's the holistic change programs that engage people throughout the

244
00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:50.300
organization that include all the metrics and the data and monitoring the way

245
00:14:50.301 --> 00:14:53.540
you'd run any major holistic change,
transformation.

246
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.130
All of those elements are true.
So let's dive into that last one for a moment.

247
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.820
<v 0>The first part of that is really making a compelling case change for case for</v>

249
00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:10.590
diversity.
It's not just about saying it.
So if you look at this,
right,

250
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.990
almost 80% of companies claim that gender diversity as a priority,
but the,

251
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.910
but the employees don't really buy it.

252
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

253
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.110
<v 0>So this is the percentage of people in different labs.</v>

254
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.540
The percentage of people that say,
my manager,

255
00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:29.240
our sales leaders or my senior leaders or my CEO consider this a priority.

256
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:31.880
They don't,
they don't buy.
The companies are actually making it a priority.

257
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.270
And why is that?
Well,
we looked at some of these organizations and,

258
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.070
and even companies that look great on paper,
they've got amazing policies.

259
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:42.800
They've got work from home,
they've got flexible work style,

260
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:44.540
they've got parental leave.

261
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:48.600
They have lots of community events and effort.
Um,

262
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.260
but if they're not walking the walk,
if it doesn't,

263
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:55.280
if it's not clear to the organization that it's actually okay to take advantage

264
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:58.910
of those programs and that it's championed that you're a part of those things,

265
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.150
people don't do them,
they might exist.
People don't do them.
They think,
you know,

266
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.590
going on a longer maternity leave is a kiss of death.

267
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:10.370
That's my walk down the path of the,
the,
the,
um,

268
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.440
the downward cycle.

269
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.250
So companies also therefore need to be talking about it,
right?

270
00:16:20.251 --> 00:16:23.250
There's lots of companies that are talking about it.
I think you're probably,

271
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.110
you're,

272
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.300
you are all talking about it a lot right now and we can continue to talk about

273
00:16:27.301 --> 00:16:27.750
it,

274
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.750
but how do the CEOs need to be very clear that this is a priority,

275
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.910
that there's a business case behind it,
that we're making it happen.

276
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:40.350
And so here's just a couple of examples of organizations like P and g and JP

277
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.850
Morgan that are really putting muscle behind,

278
00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:44.910
making this a priority for the organization and talking about it a lot.

279
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.700
So secondly,
this is about policy.
And procedure,

280
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.840
the way in which you do hiring,
reviews,
promotions,

281
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.230
um,
making sure that there's real equity there,

282
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:03.720
there's real gender discrepancies in how people perceive fairness at work.

283
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.380
So people really feel that,

284
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:12.230
that it is not quite as fair as the companies say it is right.

285
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.460
That I'm in,
particularly women feel that,
you know,

286
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:20.600
promotions and um,
and getting opportunities,

287
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.650
they are at a disadvantage.
We've talked about that before within the data.
Um,

288
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.370
but how do you have to change that?
So there are a few things,

289
00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:33.930
right?
If you look at just how do you do it in the different stages of talent

290
00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:38.850
management.
So hiring reviews and promotions,
a big thing,

291
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.750
particularly with hiring but also within reviews and promotions is unconscious

292
00:17:42.751 --> 00:17:44.070
bias.
Um,

293
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.810
so how do you really figure out ways to remove unconscious bias?
So there's,

294
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.720
um,
that have,

295
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.890
that are doing blind resume screening that are bringing in,
you know,

296
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:59.040
new games and ways of applying to the,
to the,
um,

297
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.930
to the organization that don't,
um,
that don't require,
you know,

298
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:04.980
seeing somebody face to face,

299
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:08.400
but it's rather looking at their work or looking at or listening to their music

300
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:11.260
or what have you before there's a face to face interaction.

301
00:18:11.261 --> 00:18:12.690
So there's absolutely no bias.

302
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:16.470
And those organizations that have done that type of blind screening actually

303
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.920
find much more parity in their hiring practices.

304
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.680
Um,
you know,
vmware for example,
this is in the,
in,
in,
in the,
um,

305
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.240
uh,
reviews,

306
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:32.220
they actually train managers right before they were right over view to,

307
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.410
um,
to,
to,
to remove unconscious bias.
So they remind people about gender biases.

308
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.130
They remind people about potentially loaded phrases like women,
you know,

309
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:45.980
needing to have more presence,
things like that.
Um,
and,
uh,
and,

310
00:18:45.981 --> 00:18:46.621
and they write it,

311
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:49.710
they have a memo and every manager is required to read and write before they

312
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:50.970
write their performance reviews.

313
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.500
So putting it top of mind in people right at the moment of,
of writing review.

314
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.810
Um,
similarly on promotions,
I'm often,
there is a,
you know,

315
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.130
some organizations are requiring that slates for promotions always have a

316
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:07.260
certain percentage of women on them.

317
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.700
That's not to say that the women are getting promoted.
It's not a quota,

318
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.230
it's not a quota for promotion.

319
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.430
It's not meant to steer the actual promotion itself.
It's just meant to say,

320
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:22.050
often what happens is the slate doesn't have enough women on it and so it ends

321
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:24.900
up going to a man.
So if you actually just make sure the slate has it,

322
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.020
that ends up having impact.
And again,

323
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.830
keeping in mind that the promotion itself is based on,
on meritocracy,

324
00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:35.220
but that it's just the slate that has been sort of forced to,

325
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.590
to really make sure that people are removing their bias and putting,

326
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.740
putting different,
different profiles on it.

327
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:46.410
So the third is accountability and results.

328
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:50.190
So focusing on accountability and results.
And we've talked about this,
uh,

329
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.630
you know,
a bit and the idea that um,
if you don't measure it,
it doesn't happen.

330
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.840
Right?
Like,
if you can't see it,
if you don't measure it,
if you don't call it out,

331
00:19:57.841 --> 00:20:01.500
if people are not accountable to these,
um,
metrics,

332
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:04.650
then it's not going to do anything.
Right.
And so if you look at this,

333
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:09.120
I mean 40% of companies are saying they hold their leaders accountable for

334
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:10.710
performance against gender diversity.

335
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.860
Going back to 80% of the companies say it's a priority,

336
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:17.390
but only 40% are holding leaders accountable.
Um,

337
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.880
and a very small percentage of employees agree that the progress is actually

338
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:23.370
being measured and gender diversity is being measured.

339
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.730
So some of the things that we're seeing here are how can you literally just,

340
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.570
um,
how are different organizations publicizing their pipeline,

341
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.620
their funnel,
um,
how,
how different managers are doing.
Um,

342
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.260
oftentimes managers don't even realize what they're doing.

343
00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:42.610
So by actually giving them the data,
um,

344
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.780
this is how many people you interviewed last last year and this is the

345
00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:49.240
percentage of them that were women.
And this is your promotion rate of women.

346
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:51.240
And this is the way in which you've been.
And you know,

347
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.230
if you go through and look at all your performance reviews,

348
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:56.590
these are the types of comments you have on women versus men really starting to

349
00:20:56.591 --> 00:21:01.070
bring to light.
What's happening is a way to create a lot of uh,

350
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.790
a lot of visibility and opportunity.

351
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

352
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.350
<v 0>You know,
for example,
Ikea has made achieving a 50,
50 gender split.</v>

353
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.110
One of the key metrics that managers are evaluated on,

354
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.230
<v 2>okay.</v>

355
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.610
<v 0>Salesforce publishes diversity numbers as we all know,
right?
In 2015,</v>

356
00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:20.870
Mark Benioff said that he had the goal to employ an equal number of women and

357
00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:23.720
men and thinks that this is absolutely doable and is on the,

358
00:21:23.721 --> 00:21:24.620
on the path to doing that.

359
00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.150
So how do you start to set those goals and measure them empowering employees to

360
00:21:29.151 --> 00:21:30.110
lead the change?

361
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.500
So one of the things always we've also found is paired with the whole numbers

362
00:21:35.871 --> 00:21:38.960
game and really making sure that you're getting diverse numbers and you're

363
00:21:38.961 --> 00:21:42.530
tracking of etc is inclusion.
So how do you,

364
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.680
how do you get more inclusion?
And that's something that has been,
I know nick,

365
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.350
probably a very big part of how you all operate,
right?

366
00:21:48.351 --> 00:21:52.580
With the focus on diverse teams and diversity of thought.
That's,
that's,

367
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.770
that's exactly what we're talking about it how do you actually create a,
um,

368
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.590
environment that feels inclusive for,
um,

369
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.000
individuals of all different types of backgrounds.

370
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.870
And that's a way to help him create inclusivity for women.
Um,

371
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.470
and that's about culture and culture change happens all the way down the

372
00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:13.640
organization with every last person and engaging change agents and engaging

373
00:22:13.641 --> 00:22:17.180
people in different pockets of the organization to really drive this cultural

374
00:22:17.181 --> 00:22:18.014
change.

375
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:27.400
So lastly,
of course,
educating people,
right?
Right.
Now,

376
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.230
most,
most employees don't know how to promote gender diversity,
right?

377
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.000
There's a lot of people that say we want to do it,

378
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.040
but there's not a lot of people that know how to do it.

379
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.860
And whether that's telling your middle managers that,
hey,

380
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:40.900
if you just literally chew,

381
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:44.680
if every man in the middle management chose to mentor a sponsor,

382
00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:48.250
one or two more women,
how much impact that could have?

383
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

384
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.360
<v 0>Um,
if senior leaders chose to sponsor another woman,</v>

385
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:56.530
if Jude senior leaders chose to speak out and make this a priority and really

386
00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:59.410
cascade this down the organization,
the way in which that can move the needle.

387
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.240
And even at the entry level,

388
00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:06.241
it's how can you really promote inclusive practices from day one so it doesn't

389
00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:09.460
feel like a frat or you know,

390
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:13.930
a certain type of environment that is not welcoming to women or other types of,

391
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.410
um,
uh,
or,
or,
or other diverse backgrounds.

392
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

393
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.750
<v 0>And then role modeling,
and this is part of it as well.</v>

394
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.150
So actually calling it out,

395
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.040
I mean this is how women and men answered whether or not people managers are

396
00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:35.810
calling out gender biased language or behavior.
It is not,
okay.

397
00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:39.470
If you hear someone say something that's offensive,
you just call it out.
I mean,

398
00:23:39.471 --> 00:23:42.110
imagine if everybody called that out.
It just wasn't tolerated.

399
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:47.000
That makes a huge difference,
right?
Embracing different leadership styles.

400
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:50.940
I think that this is better than calling out,
you know,
styles that are or,

401
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.080
or activities or language that is negative,

402
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:57.950
but being able to embrace,
there's lots of different styles.

403
00:23:57.951 --> 00:23:59.990
And there's lots of different ways to be successful here.

404
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.530
And we're going to role model those different ways and,
and,

405
00:24:02.531 --> 00:24:04.160
and celebrate different profiles.

406
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.410
So building this generation of diversity champions,
training them,

407
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.700
celebrating them,
modeling that,
modeling it,
right?
Let's,
how,
you know,

408
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.530
how can you celebrate people that are diversity champions?
We,

409
00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:20.660
you know,
even at Mckinsey,
we're starting to do that,
right?

410
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:23.780
How do we celebrate people that are doing,
making a real difference?

411
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.370
And that's a huge honor to those people and things like that really start to get

412
00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:32.330
people excited and motivated,
training them as we talked about before.

413
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:34.550
But what do they need to know?
How do they need to behave differently?

414
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:35.630
How can they make a difference?

415
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.560
And making sure that your modeling and role modeling what you want to see.

416
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.180
So what can you do today?
These are a few things.

417
00:24:44.181 --> 00:24:48.140
I'd love to actually even open it up and hear from you what you all think you

418
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:49.680
can do.
Um,

419
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.750
but some of the things just to start the conversation around talking about why

420
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:57.770
gender diversity matters to you both up and down.

421
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.160
I'm calling out the biases,
as we mentioned,

422
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.900
not tolerating any behavior that is,

423
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.120
but is demonstrates bias,
um,

424
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.710
creating scorecards and measuring and monitoring,
changing your language,

425
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:17.030
just reminding yourself to use that,
remind yourself to think about it.

426
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.900
Sometimes it's just as simple as that.
Committing to sponsor women,
um,

427
00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:24.770
and sharing in success stories of women's celebrating women that had done

428
00:25:24.771 --> 00:25:28.550
amazing things.
So what are some of the,
what are,
what are some other things?

429
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:30.410
And by the way,
I'm also open to take questions,

430
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:33.000
but I figured I'd start with a question to you,
um,

431
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.780
which is what are some of the things that you're doing about it or that you're,

432
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:38.240
you think Google should be doing about it?

433
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.453
<v 2>Okay.</v>

434
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.580
<v 3>Um,
well my manager who's sitting two minute,
two rows behind me and with my team,</v>

435
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.260
uh,
Yep.
Uh,
made the suggestion that we use a regular,

436
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.300
regularly scheduled kind of tech talk session where we,
uh,
you know,

437
00:25:55.301 --> 00:25:58.410
watch youtube videos about technical things are non technical things,
uh,

438
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.870
as a group and discuss them and come here instead.
And I think that's a great,

439
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.960
a great way to improve gender diversity.
And,
and,
uh,

440
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.320
get us talking about it more.
Admittedly,

441
00:26:08.321 --> 00:26:12.050
we've been talking about it a lot in the last week,
but,
um,
this is a,
you know,

442
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.490
it's a great way for a manager to have an impact on their team and,

443
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:16.540
and spread that knowledge.

444
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.813
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

445
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.483
Nice job.

446
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.150
<v 0>So first of all,
thanks for coming today in presenting this to us.</v>

447
00:26:27.151 --> 00:26:31.690
The research and metric driven approach really hits it home for me.
Um,

448
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.350
I love data and this really is,
it really calls it out very clearly.
Um,

449
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.040
focusing on that data but also tying in people's perceptions.
Um,

450
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:45.450
question for you.
You mentioned out bias when you see it,
it only takes one voice.

451
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.630
So I've had experiences where someone will say something and it takes me like a

452
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.270
few seconds to like process what they've actually said and then I'm like,
wait,

453
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:56.370
what?
And then I'm like,
should I say something now?

454
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.620
Like five seconds of already gotten,
now it's 10 seconds.
And it's like,
so I'm,

455
00:27:00.621 --> 00:27:05.621
I'm wondering if you have any like tips for calling that out because it

456
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:08.940
sometimes does take a little bit of time for me to process and then I'm like 20

457
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:11.670
seconds has gone by.
What do I do?
Kind of a thing.

458
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.860
Or if anyone else has any tips as well,
I'd,
I'd love to hear them.
So I,

459
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.420
I'm happy to answer that.
I feel like it's never too late.
Yeah,
just say it.

460
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:23.880
You could say,
hey,
you know,
it took me a minute because I was,

461
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.240
I felt like that was really inappropriate what you said and I just want you to

462
00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:29.670
know and you could also go at it with the intent.

463
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.980
I mean I think another thing is always about intent.

464
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.400
So always assume positive intent from the other person and then you can have a

465
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:40.050
much greater impact in the,
in the,
in the feedback that you're giving.
So,
Hey,

466
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:42.990
I know you,
you might not have meant it to come across it this way,

467
00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:45.420
but let me tell you how it made me feel and hey,

468
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:49.350
maybe you might want to consider not doing that next time.
Awesome.
Thank you.

469
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.060
<v 4>So I'm a father,
I have four kids and I'm,</v>

470
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.620
one of them is a girl and she runs the runs the house.
But um,

471
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.290
I feel like a lot of the,

472
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.530
or I believe that a lot of these things are a lot deeper than the workplace.

473
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:07.890
They're foundational in the way that we raise our kids and their promote values

474
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:12.750
and unintentionally by pink things for my daughter and blues things for my son's

475
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:17.400
and like what things can we do as parents and as you know,

476
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:17.791
in a,

477
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:22.050
in a sort of a grass roots since and as communities as we're raising our kids,

478
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.003
you know,
to help with this.

479
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.720
<v 0>I mean,
that I don't even get me started with,</v>

480
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:34.010
um,
I think there's a tremendous amount we can do as we're raising our kids.

481
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.770
I mean,
I can tell you just personally what I do.
Um,

482
00:28:36.771 --> 00:28:40.390
so I have a daughter and a son.
And as much as I,

483
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.400
I mean I try to congratulate them for the same types of things.

484
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.880
So a lot of times parents will tell the girl they're really pretty and they

485
00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:48.830
don't even mean it.
Or other people in the,
in,
you know,

486
00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:51.230
in their environment will tell the girl they're really pretty.
And the guy,

487
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:54.020
he did really well on that problem.
Right?

488
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.440
And so I try to congratulate my daughter for problem solving and tell my son he

489
00:28:57.441 --> 00:29:02.230
looks really cute,
but no,
no,
seriously.
And,

490
00:29:02.231 --> 00:29:02.961
and,
and,
and,

491
00:29:02.961 --> 00:29:06.080
and just really thinking about the language that you're using because that's

492
00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:08.340
where it's,
that is where it starts.
Like when you get,
what,

493
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.860
what are you getting praised for?
How are people demonstrating love?
Are you,

494
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.270
you know,
telling your daughter that she's being too bossy?
Like too early on?
Um,

495
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.340
if there's an,
if you see two children playing,

496
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:22.130
because even if no matter what you do in your household,

497
00:29:22.131 --> 00:29:24.680
you're not gonna be able to change what's happening in other people's
households.

498
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.300
But talking about it,
right?
And even in recognizing like,
hey,
so and so said this,

499
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:32.080
but in our family,
this is what we believe and this is how,
how,

500
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.210
how we conduct ourselves.
So I don't know,

501
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.620
you probably all have lots of ideas as well.
If anyone else wants to share

502
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.730
the question was given we know that lots of executive,
um,

503
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:56.850
promotions or higher co actually come x or external hires versus just internal

504
00:29:56.851 --> 00:29:57.684
promotions,

505
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.960
how do executive search firms and other players that might be helping find the

506
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:09.020
slate of candidates for senior positions contribute to or detract from the goal

507
00:30:09.721 --> 00:30:10.410
at hand,

508
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.230
which is to increase the number of women in these senior executive positions?

509
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.780
I'll tell you,
so we haven't specifically looked at biases for example,

510
00:30:18.781 --> 00:30:22.610
in executive recruiting practices.
What,
um,
and,

511
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.690
and actually I think in general,

512
00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:27.690
most people when they're talking to executive recruiters are pretty specific.

513
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.400
Say they want to see women candidates.

514
00:30:29.401 --> 00:30:33.170
It's actually because it's a priority for a lot of senior leaders.
Um,
I,

515
00:30:33.171 --> 00:30:33.961
I will say though,

516
00:30:33.961 --> 00:30:38.940
in the end what it does happen is that more men are hired in,
at,

517
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.570
um,
at senior levels and laterally than women.

518
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.660
So in addition to different promotion,
um,

519
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.470
women getting promoted less frequently,
men are coming,

520
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:54.600
more men are coming in at more senior levels.
Um,
and so for that,

521
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.520
um,
you know,
we have an action it so I can,
I can hypothesize,

522
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.820
um,
I don't want to speak for the data cause I don't know,

523
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.510
we don't actually have the data underlying that,

524
00:31:03.511 --> 00:31:08.511
but my sense is that is driven in large part by a lot of the same biases that

525
00:31:08.731 --> 00:31:12.900
might take place in the recruiting and selection process,
uh,

526
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.450
for any role.
Right.
That um,
you know,

527
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.890
the way in which the rest of the way in which the a job Spec is written is often

528
00:31:19.891 --> 00:31:22.500
much more tailored to a man and a man's background.

529
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.400
Often in the selection process,
there's a bias towards men.

530
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.900
People tend to look at men and see you.
Pr,
as I mentioned before,

531
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.570
see a potential.
Whereas women,

532
00:31:33.571 --> 00:31:36.390
they look for performance and so the bar tends to be higher for women.

533
00:31:36.391 --> 00:31:39.860
There's a lot of biases that take place in,
in that process.
And I think that's,

534
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.410
that,
that that's probably where it's coming from.
I'm not sure.
It's purely,

535
00:31:43.411 --> 00:31:47.070
you know,
based on what's happening at the executive recruiting side of things.

536
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.740
Hey,
uh,
thanks for sharing all this with us.

537
00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:54.050
It's a really just great to see like practical applications of things.
Um,
so I,

538
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.750
one thing to share that I feel like has been super personally helpful for me on

539
00:31:57.751 --> 00:32:00.950
the changing your own language that uh,
things.
Um,

540
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.560
so a lot of us participate at time in both hiring,
so writing,
you know,

541
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:09.420
reviews are people who are coming in as candidates and also in the sort of

542
00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:12.750
performance review process when you write peer reviews for all the people who

543
00:32:12.751 --> 00:32:15.580
are going up for promotion or just generating feedback,
um,

544
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.830
and taking out gender pronouns entirely from feedback that you write,

545
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.280
I feel like has both a big impact on the way that I write.

546
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.430
But also for people who are going to just be reading feedback,
right?

547
00:32:26.431 --> 00:32:27.420
This is going to committee,

548
00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:31.020
it's going to hiring committee or performance review committee for promotions.

549
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.690
Um,
not having gender pronouns.

550
00:32:33.691 --> 00:32:36.660
Like it does change the way that you have to write and the way that you use

551
00:32:36.661 --> 00:32:40.570
adjectives.
And the way that people will interpret you're writing.
Um,

552
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.810
and it's made a big difference for me and just my personal like capabilities of

553
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:47.330
writing,
I think useful feedback about people.

554
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.850
So I would say for people who are doing that,
you know,

555
00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:52.490
on their own or if you are working with other people,

556
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:56.210
even out of your emails when you're writing about what someone else had said or

557
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.440
recap from a meeting,

558
00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:01.970
like trying not to rely on those actually pushes you a little bit further and

559
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:06.350
like giving useful descriptions of someone or their projects or what has

560
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:08.210
happened in a given scenario.
Um,

561
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:12.410
and it's like a really small change that you can make and that's very aligned to

562
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:14.180
a lot of the resume screen,

563
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.740
a blind resume screening tests that have been done where literally there have

564
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:23.150
been tests that have shown the minute that any understanding of what the gender

565
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:27.800
is of the applicant is taken away,
that all of a sudden the hiring becomes,

566
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:32.450
goes to parody.
It's amazing.
Right?
So exactly like the,
if you can take that away,

567
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.670
how much of a difference I can make.

568
00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:40.000
<v 4>So I'm a white Anglo Saxon,
Protestant male,</v>

569
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.570
identify as straight a manager,
so on and so forth.

570
00:33:43.571 --> 00:33:48.130
So like the Bingo of being part of the privileged class was to speak.

571
00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.550
Um,
so I'm wondering from your research,
looking at many different companies,

572
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.080
like how do you go straight at that majority to affect change at scale?

573
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.090
How do you,
sorry,
what,
how do you,

574
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:03.150
how have you seen or how do you go at people like me at scale and organizations

575
00:34:03.551 --> 00:34:07.180
to make them part of the change and not rely on the underrepresented groups to

576
00:34:07.181 --> 00:34:08.500
stand up to make that change?

577
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.000
<v 0>Well,
it's literally engaging you in part of the process,
right?</v>

578
00:34:12.001 --> 00:34:16.990
It's engaging you and being a champion of change in signing up to mentor,

579
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:22.010
sponsor a set of women and driving specific initiatives within the organization.

580
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.160
In fact,

581
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.390
it's really important and we've found that it's really important that men lead a

582
00:34:27.391 --> 00:34:31.470
lot of these initiatives that is not all women led.
So I think the,

583
00:34:31.471 --> 00:34:36.300
the real important thing is to get people like you to actually own and do and

584
00:34:36.301 --> 00:34:38.880
lead some of this and sign up for this.

585
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.700
One of the things that I've done as a manager is if I see somebody doing things

586
00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:49.230
that I know will be negative towards them.
So if they use language of,

587
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:52.920
I'm sorry or I,
that's the one that always gets me is the,

588
00:34:52.921 --> 00:34:56.760
I'm sorry or I'm bothering you.
Or things like that to literally tell them,

589
00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:01.470
don't say that.
Say it this way.
You know,
and this is why.

590
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.150
So call out those small things.

591
00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:05.940
Cause I think sometimes when people hear the word mentorship they think,
oh,

592
00:35:05.941 --> 00:35:08.970
I've got to take them to lunch and I've got to do this and I've got to do that.

593
00:35:08.971 --> 00:35:12.990
It's,
it's the simple,
you're walking back from the meeting to your desk and say,

594
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:15.770
Hey,
I heard you say this and it,
you know,

595
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.210
negated what you were saying because of this reason.

596
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.620
Because it's grounding need to hear that like immediately and repeatedly.

597
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:27.240
And it took me a long time to learn those things.
Well yeah.

598
00:35:27.241 --> 00:35:29.220
And that goes back to one of the real drivers,

599
00:35:29.221 --> 00:35:33.750
which is getting developmental feedback and hard messages and people tend to not

600
00:35:33.751 --> 00:35:37.470
do that for women.
And so telling the person,
don't go sit on the side the room,

601
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:41.730
sit at the table when you walk in,
take them the main seat at the table,

602
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.630
speak up in the meeting.
I want to hear your voice.
Don't use like,

603
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:47.670
and sorry and don't caveat what you're saying.

604
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:50.250
Be Assertive and forceful if if you need to and not meeting.

605
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.240
Like I think giving that coaching and that feedback is quite valuable.

606
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:59.000
Now of course not,
not,
not necessarily trying to um,

607
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.550
only promote one kind of leadership style,
right?

608
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:05.640
You also want to recognize different leadership styles and some people have more

609
00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.730
assertive leadership styles and some people have more quiet leadership styles

610
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:09.750
and all that's fine.

611
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.570
But definitely giving feedback where people are taking away from their own

612
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:16.830
credibility or not stepping up and owning leadership opportunities the way they

613
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:18.380
can.
I think that's really,
really important.

614
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.581
<v 5>Hi,</v>

615
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:25.110
thank you for reinforcing much of what we tried to do here at Google with lots

616
00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:27.750
of external data that's always necessary.
Um,

617
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.840
first I'd like to say that was Matt and he's actually one of my mentors.

618
00:36:30.841 --> 00:36:33.270
So he's sort of practicing what he preaches already.

619
00:36:33.271 --> 00:36:38.040
And I'm like the opposite of everything he just said.
So Kudos to him.

620
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.080
My question is,
do you have data around or a POV on,

621
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.363
um,

622
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.570
this idea that by focusing on women's empowerment,

623
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.670
um,
gender parody,

624
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.120
elevating women in the workforce that that is discriminatory against men?

625
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:04.070
<v 0>Um,
I don't think so.
Okay.
Um,
or that,
I mean,</v>

626
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.190
so I mean,

627
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.170
we're so far from being discriminatory against men right now that I think it's

628
00:37:10.171 --> 00:37:12.290
sort of,
you know,
it's,

629
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.440
it's cleaning up some of the issues rather than trying to put in place quotas or

630
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.200
you know,
things like that.
And so I think,
you know,

631
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.800
if anything is perceived as discriminatory against men or if there is something

632
00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:26.260
like a quota that can be perceived in that way,
um,

633
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.400
that can be damaging to the whole cause.
Right.
Ah,

634
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.340
but so all of the things and the data that we've shown here has been about

635
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:33.660
things that are cleaning up.

636
00:37:33.661 --> 00:37:37.110
The issue's not swinging the pendulum the other way around.
I would say.

637
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.130
I agree with you.
Just,
I'm always playing devil's advocate,
so thank you.

638
00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:43.760
Thank you for that.
And I appreciate that.
Hi.

639
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:48.710
I have question in regards to both gender diversity but also age diversity.

640
00:37:48.711 --> 00:37:52.130
So I was speaking with one of my Google mentors the other day.

641
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.880
We were talking about,
you know,
the job postings,
even on the Google side,

642
00:37:55.881 --> 00:37:57.290
I don't know if you guys have seen,

643
00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:02.150
but obviously it shows x amount of years of experience.
And he was saying,

644
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.190
do you read a study that even though,

645
00:38:04.191 --> 00:38:08.390
so it says four years of experience required and some men they'll look at that

646
00:38:08.391 --> 00:38:09.680
and they only have to not be like,

647
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:14.000
I'm going to go fry where girls are like I three but I'll hold back until I had

648
00:38:14.001 --> 00:38:18.170
that forward before I can go for that position and so on.
I mean that's,

649
00:38:18.171 --> 00:38:19.590
sometimes I have an urge and I'm like,
you know,

650
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:22.910
when I read the qualifications and like I could totally go for that.

651
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.450
But I see the level of experience I'm like obviously,

652
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.780
and being out of college and things like that,
you don't have that.

653
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.120
But in with technology nowadays,
it's,

654
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.090
those years of experience are really relevant to you know what's,

655
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.540
so I want him to get your opinion on those postings.
It's a really good point.

656
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:42.070
And there's two sides to that coin.

657
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.910
So one is the way in which the job posting is being written and should you write

658
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.040
it?
Well actually,
let me take a step back.

659
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:53.610
It is very much proven over and over that women tend to like to hold a higher

660
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:55.390
bar for themselves.

661
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.050
A man and a woman will go into the exact same review and the woman will come out

662
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:00.580
and say,
oh my God,
I did like,

663
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:03.430
here are the 700 things I did terribly in the mental that I rocked it.

664
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.530
Literally the same language.
Um,
and similarly,
exactly as you're saying,

665
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:12.040
men will be like,
ah,
four years experience.
I was in college for four years.

666
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.450
Um,
you know,
and a woman will be like,
oh no,
I,
well I had four,

667
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:19.810
I have six years of experience with four of the two of them weren't exactly

668
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:24.020
right.
And bubba like,
it is,
it is,
it is just human nature.
Um,

669
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.090
and a lot of studies have shown that.
So there's two things to do about that.

670
00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:33.070
One is to educate women on,
um,
self advocacy and like,
how do I,

671
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.090
how do you start to think about yourself and actually reach for reach higher,

672
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.990
reach harder and be okay with taking more risks and things like that.
Um,

673
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:43.570
and I think that is actually an important part of it.
And we,
for example,

674
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.950
Mckinsey do a lot around that,

675
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:48.430
which is like how can you raise your hand and ask for more opportunities and be

676
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:49.730
more,
you know,
if,
if,

677
00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:52.840
if your male counterpart is going and asking all these other people for

678
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:57.310
promotions,
you sh,
you know,
you can do the same.
Um,
and then secondly,

679
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:59.950
I think there's also the part about the writing of the job posting.

680
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:01.900
So if we know that women read it that way,

681
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.510
maybe trying to shift the language a little bit so it doesn't say,
you know,
it,

682
00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.220
it's,

683
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.840
it seems that the four years of experience is more of a nice to have.

684
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:14.950
Or you can write it in such a way that it does.
You're not playing to that,
that,

685
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.550
that bias.
I think it's a really good point.
One.
Okay.

686
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.400
Um,
you were talking a lot about,
thank you for being here.
Firstly.
So this study,

687
00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:25.370
super interesting.
Uh,

688
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.900
you were talking a lot about self advocacy but early in the study we'd be hood

689
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:31.420
about how women want to get a lot for themselves.

690
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:34.780
I perceive to be aggressive or bossy.
How do you manage that,

691
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.740
those two perceptions?
So that's a really good question.
Um,

692
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:43.510
I think that it's about managing a way,
the bossy issue.

693
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.590
Like I,
I think the answer is not to let women not to tell women,
okay,

694
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:51.430
well then just operate within that bias and so we have to change the bias.

695
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.350
So you're right.
I mean I think there's,

696
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.930
when we get called it's a double edge sword,
right?

697
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.320
I mean it's sort of like the damned if you do damned if you don't wear,

698
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.800
where do we stand?
But I think you just,
I mean w self advocacy,

699
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.390
I think that the bar,
the,
the barrier between how women self advocate or the,

700
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:10.140
sorry the gap between how women self advocate versus men is,

701
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.430
is even bigger than the bear.

702
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.000
The gap between how women are perceived as bossy versus not.

703
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.430
So I would just sort of,
even though they are linked,

704
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.250
I would separate the two and address them each equally because I think they're

705
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:24.610
both very important and it's better to be called Bossy and still get the

706
00:41:24.611 --> 00:41:27.660
promotion,
you know,

707
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.710
then to like not get it at all.

708
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.920
Thank you so much this awesome.
Uh,

709
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.270
<v 6>and thanks to all of you.</v>

710
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.540
It was really great Charlotte and you gave some fantastic advice.

711
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:47.600
The other thing that struck me as I was listening was just the awesome advice

712
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:48.440
that you gave each other.

713
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.490
And so I hope that each of you takes away at least one nugget from this

714
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:53.151
conversation,

715
00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:56.510
whether from Charlotte and Mckinsey or from what some of your colleagues shared.

716
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.870
And I passionately believe the way we addressed this over time is really the

717
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:03.350
continuity of the conversation.
So many of the things that we talked about,

718
00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:08.060
if we're able to sort of quickly and easily that back and forth what we heard,

719
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:11.300
what we saw,
what the impact was,
we will consistently get better.

720
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:13.880
So please keep the conversation going both in these settings,

721
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:17.210
but also in the hallways and continue to look to each other and,

722
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.930
and to all of us for tips to move this forward.
Thank you guys so much.
