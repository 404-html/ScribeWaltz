1
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.720
All right,
let's get started.
Thank you guys so much for coming.

2
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.650
I'm so excited.

3
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:17.730
It's definitely my honor and privilege to introduce our two guests today.

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.301
Catherine,

5
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:22.440
Dr Birndorf of the Motherhood Center and chief content officer of Goop,

6
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:25.740
Elisa Lemon.
Uh,
I am Amy Seamus.

7
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.800
I'm on the events and experiences here,
team here at Google.

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.970
I've been at Google almost almost seven years,
um,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.360
but with two maternity leaves back to back so it feels long,

10
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.080
but there was a chunk sort of kind of missing.
Um,

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.420
as I started my other career I was a mom,
uh,

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.450
but we're here today because I actually saw Elise interview doctor Birndorf at

13
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.750
the end dupe health summit in January in New York City and she was on a panel

14
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.800
and I was sitting in the audience.

15
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:55.380
My son was seven and a half months old at the time.

16
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.840
And everything you were saying resonated with me,

17
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:01.320
which I'm sure a lot of you here,
same as we'll be hearing more from you.

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.890
And then I thought I ran up to a lease at the end of the summit.
I said,

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.300
we've got to do something,
a Google.

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.110
And then life got in the way and it took me a while,
but we,
uh,

21
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.140
you had your podcast and it was the third ever goop crowdcast and you deep dove

22
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:17.640
on this conversation of postpartum anxiety,

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.120
postpartum depression and what you're calling the motherhood shift,
which I love.

24
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.690
And that was it.
That was a sign for me.
I said,
let's get these ladies to Google.

25
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.220
A lot of people will want to hear from you and talk about this,
these issues.

26
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.000
Um,

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680
we're very fortunate at Google because we have a wonderful benefits team and a

28
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.860
great paid maternal and paternal leave.

29
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
But that's not to say that Google isn't a very exhausting and demanding place to

30
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:44.940
work as it should be.
We are Google,

31
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.180
but there is a lot to be learned when we are in this post baby postpartum phase,

32
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.030
which is why I thought that not only myself would love to learn more.

33
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:58.040
And you know,
as I already said to you guys,
become your best friends forever.
Um,

34
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.260
but that everyone else would learn a lot about this particular issue and how we

35
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:08.220
can work through these changes while we're at work.
Um,

36
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.470
and I would of course be were missed by,

37
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.700
didn't mention that may is mental health month.

38
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:16.701
So Google is hosting a series of talks throughout the month of May to dive

39
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.110
deeper into specific parts of mental health.

40
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.840
I know we're going to address it a little bit in our conversation today.
Um,

41
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.660
but you know,
just know that mental health has a wide variety of looks and feels.

42
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.280
Um,
and you know,
one in five people suffer from some version of it.

43
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.070
So if there is anything,
you know,

44
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.640
you're feeling you need more out of Google and from our benefits team,
you know,

45
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:42.780
be sure to look things up this month on go mental health and look out for

46
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.460
different talks throughout the rest of the month.
Um,
so with all of that sense,

47
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.770
um,
let's get to going.
So again,
um,
I have two young boys.

48
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.850
I've only been back from my second maternity leave for seven and a half months,

49
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.540
which feels so short yet,
so long.
And,
um,

50
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.980
navigating being a working mom is difficult.

51
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.470
And,
um,
it was so wonderful what I was hearing that not only anecdotally is it

52
00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:14.260
difficult,
but scientifically and biologically it is in fact difficult.

53
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.520
So while I had very high functioning pregnancies and postpartum experiences,

54
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.470
that was not the case,
certainly for all of my mommy friends.
And,
um,

55
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.740
so I wanna just start today with asking what is postpartum anxiety?

56
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.620
What is postpartum depression,
what's the difference?
And then also,

57
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:34.420
I know you're kind of coining a new term,
um,
in that sphere.
So starting,

58
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.930
they're starting their,
okay.
And that'll be the whole hour.

59
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.120
Can you chart?
Yeah.

60
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.820
<v 2>Um,
well I think postpartum is just after birth,
right?</v>

61
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:48.490
And so everybody is postpartum once they have a kid and there's a normal range

62
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:52.240
of adjustment.
Right?
So we were just talking about this.
Everybody has something,

63
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.540
it doesn't have to go all the way to a disorder.
Right?

64
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.860
So what you're referring to is what we're calling perinatal mood and anxiety

65
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.130
disorders.
P m a d p mats.

66
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.050
And that is the new phrase for PPD,
which people are starting,
thankfully,

67
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:09.970
to recognize postpartum depression,

68
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.090
that sort of the catchall phrase or postpartum people say,

69
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.050
did you have postpartum?
Yeah.
And that's that.

70
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.280
And that sort of whisper that's like beyond the adjustment,

71
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.970
beyond the normal adjustment,
but it doesn't capture it.
All right?

72
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:26.650
So people are missed because they think postpartum depression,
I'm not depressed,

73
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.100
so they get confused.
And so that's why when you guys,

74
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.640
when goop wanted to talk about anxiety,
I thought it was great.
It's not mail,

75
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.410
it just wasn't discussed.
Okay.
So,
um,
there can be normal,

76
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:41.830
like when you have a kid,
everyone gets,
you know,
things change.
And I think we,
uh,

77
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.660
are very adaptive,
thankfully.

78
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:47.110
And so everyone's a little bit anxious because you're taking care of this

79
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.160
totally dependent creature.
You may not know how,

80
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:54.390
you probably don't know how and you have to figure it out.
Um,

81
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.600
and so everyone's a bit anxious.

82
00:04:55.601 --> 00:05:00.010
But when it goes beyond just anxiety that you can get to work,

83
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:04.270
do your things,
do your normal daily routines,
then we're getting into trouble.

84
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.480
And that may be in the anxious realm or in a depressive realm.

85
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.170
I can blather on forever about those things.
But so just know it's all,

86
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:14.230
it's normal to have a little bit of an adjustment.
How could you not?

87
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:19.120
It's like the most profound identity shift imaginable.
Yeah,

88
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.170
I remember,
this isn't all too intimate story,
I'm sure,
but yeah,

89
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.730
<v 1>it's my poor husband sitting in the audience.</v>

90
00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:30.650
But I was I think three or four weeks postpartum with my oldest son and I was so

91
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:35.120
happy and I ran up to him,
just hysterical sobs hugging him,

92
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:37.250
saying it was the happiest I've ever been,

93
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.840
but yet I was crying and I even said,
well,

94
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:43.310
if they lose the baby weight and this will be the best.

95
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.100
And I mean I look back on it now like what was going on there,
but,

96
00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:50.630
and again,
I was so happy.

97
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:55.340
So it wasn't anything to be concerned about at the time.
But it is,

98
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.130
the emotions are certainly there and so

99
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.320
<v 2>intense.
That's the blues.
Right.
And that's almost everybody I say to,</v>

100
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.170
to patients and to friends,
you're the unusual person who doesn't have that.

101
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.370
You described it perfectly,
happy,
sad.
We call it emotional lability,

102
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.420
sort of the ups and downs.

103
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.780
It's super intense and you feel like you're losing your mind for that moment or

104
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.030
for that,
those few minutes that you're not.

105
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.010
That's the hormonal fluctuation that that is happening after delivery and

106
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:26.510
completely normal,
just holding biologically what happens.
Absolute.
Just again,

107
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.810
what is so wonderful to hear,
and I normal's not the right word,

108
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.010
but to know that happens to almost everybody.
Yeah.

109
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.310
So talk about the Motherhood Center,
which opened in New York City.
How long ago?

110
00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:43.040
Just over a year.
A year ago,
hopefully to be opening offices all over.
Um,

111
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.340
and just to note for people,
I know a bunch of you who had emailed me,

112
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.130
it's not just for people who are currently pregnant,
which was you are,

113
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:52.700
congratulations.
Um,
or if you just had a baby.

114
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:56.480
But if you are thinking about having a baby,
so talk about the Motherhood Center,

115
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:59.030
what it is and how it helps.

116
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.380
So we opened this place called the Motherhood Center,
um,

117
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.530
which is trying to help women who are and families trying to conceive,

118
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:10.820
thinking about conceiving.
So fertility issues,

119
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.760
those who are pregnant and then those in the postpartum.

120
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.480
So it's really the Perry needle experience.
That's what that timeframe is.
Right.

121
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.020
And,
um,
I know we're called the motherhood center,

122
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:24.320
but as I see men out there and I know who are dads,
I think like we really do,

123
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.380
we also address,
it's really a family issue.
And I think maybe that's,

124
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:31.460
we'll talk some of that later.
Um,
that it's not just about the mom,

125
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.680
but we really wanted a place where we could,

126
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:36.350
we've sort of turned ourselves into the mothering center.

127
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.920
So really helping women,
um,

128
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.710
go through the adjustment and the transition into motherhood.

129
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.930
And the dads come on.
Fridays are the partners and we have a group for just them.

130
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.650
And we also bring them into different kinds of family groups so that they can

131
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:55.010
talk about their experience in this transition.
But we go from,

132
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:57.590
just to tell you a bit,
it's a comprehensive treatment center.

133
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.320
Nothing like this exists in the country.
Um,

134
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:05.321
so we're trying to create this pilot program that we hope we can nail so that we

135
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:07.210
can make it a,
um,

136
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.960
a place that could be in other areas of the country helping women adjust to

137
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:12.531
motherhood.

138
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:16.490
But it's not just those who are well and having the normal adjustment.

139
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:20.270
We are also dealing with women who are just shy of going into the hospital,

140
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.630
right.
So who are really needing a comprehensive day program.
They,

141
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:26.210
they're just not making it out there.
They're,

142
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.090
they're not getting out of the house.
They're not getting to prenatal care.

143
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.960
They're not going to their pediatricians afterwards or just not able to function

144
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:33.890
as well as they should.

145
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:38.891
And these are high functioning women who just are so down or so anxious.

146
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:44.180
We see a lot of postpartum OCD,
that was one of the postpartum anxiety disorders.

147
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.300
We see all kinds of things and they're just not,
they're not making it.

148
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:51.440
And so they come in for therapies from group therapies from nine 45 to two 45

149
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.790
and we have an onsite nursery.

150
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.550
So they bring the babies and we help them kind of figure out how to be with the

151
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:00.300
baby or the two attached.
Are they not,
are they too detached?

152
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.380
So different iterations of,
of bonding and attachment we address,
um,

153
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.060
with the new moms.
It's so amazing.
Yeah.
How's it going?
It's going really well.

154
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.590
It's,
it's like,

155
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.680
it's so much fun and I think those of us who have come together so passionate

156
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:18.660
about this time period and,
and treatment that is so lacking,

157
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.510
there's a dearth of this kind of treatment in the country.
Um,

158
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.540
and I think that to see women go from struggling so much and feeling like

159
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:29.590
they're never going to be able to be the mother,
they want to be yeah.

160
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.970
To within two to four to six weeks walking out of there confident and feeling

161
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:36.960
like they got this,
you know,

162
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:40.260
we have graduates come back and talk to the moms who are newly coming in and it

163
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:42.420
is like goosebumps.
Yeah.

164
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.010
<v 1>Hmm.
And you said it,
certainly the passion is there.
Once you,</v>

165
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.670
even in just meetings at Google,
once you identify that somebody else's,
a mom,

166
00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:50.504
it is,

167
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.050
there's an immediate switch and connection and people are so passionate about

168
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:59.051
this topic and feeling so feeling empowered is difficult during the postpartum

169
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.900
timeframe.
So,
um,
so at least to you also a mom of two boys.

170
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.890
Yeah.
Boy,
moms.
Moms are great,
everything's all good.
Babies are all good,

171
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.850
but you are the chief content officer of goop.

172
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.330
You have to see so much come across your desk.
Okay.

173
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.740
So how did you sift out Catherine and the Motherhood Center and say this is

174
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:26.630
something that we need to promote?
This is so brand,
right.
The synergies.
So great.

175
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.790
Um,
what was it that struck you about this that's different than everything else?

176
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:33.060
I'm sure you,
you see,

177
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.820
<v 3>so,
um,</v>

178
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.530
before actually I wish I had met Catherine when I was,

179
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.170
had my first child.
I'm sad that I didn't,

180
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.840
I was not like everyone.
I don't want anyone who well equipped for parenthood.

181
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.630
Um,
definitely not well equipped.

182
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.560
And after I had my first child,
um,

183
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.680
I felt really bad.

184
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:02.300
It was probably a year after and I was talking to a doctor and this doctor

185
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.950
Alejandro younger,
and I was like,
what's wrong with me?
Like I don't feel good.

186
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:07.784
I'm,

187
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.550
I'm tired of being told that it's because I have a child because I was getting

188
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:14.300
really good sleep.
Um,
and he put me on this clean program.
He was like,

189
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:16.070
let's get you more vitamin D.
He's just like,

190
00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:19.670
we're just gonna like I'm just going to put something based on what I think is

191
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:23.690
probably going on.
Um,
vitamin B clean program.
I felt incredible.

192
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.500
I felt dramatically better six weeks later.
Um,

193
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.530
and in that process he introduced me to this doctor and the Australian Bush,

194
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.810
his name's Oscar,
Sarah lack,

195
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.440
and he was working on this concept called postnatal depletion.
And he was like,

196
00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:41.840
there's just no,
nothing in literature about this.

197
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.700
But he was observing it sort of in this family clinic and rural Australia,

198
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.311
these women,

199
00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:50.710
he would have multiple children and every time they would present it was there

200
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:54.910
were more depleted more.
And,
um,
he was like,

201
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:58.690
this is a weird,
there's,
there's stuff on postpartum depression,
not enough.

202
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.990
And then there's nothing about depletion.

203
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.380
And I did a story with him and it was incredibly,

204
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.640
like the response was insane.

205
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.150
Women were just tons of emails because essentially he's like,

206
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.250
he believes for seven to 10 years.

207
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.450
Like it can take seven to 10 years to recover with women start in a sort of

208
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:22.120
depleted state already.
They,

209
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.700
even if you have the best intention to eat perfectly,

210
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:29.700
like I don't know anyone who does,
like,
and our food is not amazing.
And um,

211
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.700
you sort of start behind the starting block.
You have a child,

212
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.960
they take everything that they need from you,
all the fat in your brain

213
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.400
and you end up worse off.

214
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.470
And we all know from having a baby that you go to the doctor a lot and then as

215
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:50.560
soon as you have the baby,
no one cares about you.

216
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.010
You have like one checkup where they're like,
looks fine.

217
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.630
I think your abs aren't separated.
You cannot have sex with your husband.

218
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.340
See you in a year.
Yeah.
And,
um,
anyway,
so did story.
People were like,

219
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.880
this is me,
this is like describing the last decade of my life.
Um,

220
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.610
this like profound resonance.
And we were like,
wow,

221
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:16.330
we really need to talk more about what's happening because I think there's like

222
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:20.260
a world of mom blogs and there's this perception issue of people being like,

223
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:25.261
this is me and my perfectly swaddled clothed child and I'm doing great.

224
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.160
And the reality of that women everywhere are struggling.

225
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:32.560
And then the whole,

226
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.580
the psychological part came in through Birndorf and the spectrum.

227
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:37.960
Um,

228
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.850
and we had a mom at goop who was really struggling,

229
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.860
just,
she wouldn't mind me sharing that,
but just like extreme panic attacks.

230
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.200
She had had anxiety before,
she was great at,

231
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.290
during her pregnancy and then was not postpartum depression,

232
00:13:55.421 --> 00:14:00.130
but like OCD,
anxiety to the extent that she was like,
I'm certifiable.

233
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:04.690
Like I need the hospital.
I need like function could not function.

234
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:08.830
And so Birndorf quarterbacked her to function,

235
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.140
say she's doing great,
doing great.
So that's sort of the lungs.
It was just like,

236
00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:17.890
this needs to be something that we talk about truly filling a void.

237
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.280
There isn't anything else.
There's nothing that's incredible.

238
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.880
<v 2>There is,
there are individuals out there,</v>

239
00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:27.090
I have colleagues across the country who are doing this kind of work who are

240
00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:27.924
amazing,

241
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:33.030
who are in the field of reproductive and perinatal psychiatry,
psychology.

242
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.710
But they're all sort of individuals.

243
00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:39.140
I mean they tend to be in big cities like my good friends in La and Chicago and

244
00:14:39.141 --> 00:14:39.870
New York,

245
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.250
but they're not there that we wanted to create a center community where this,
um,

246
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.810
where we could really be the experts in this and try to figure it out.

247
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.810
I mean,
we have a lot of creative space to do.
We're a startup so we really,

248
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.171
you know,

249
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:57.440
we were a group of passionate clinicians who came together or trying to fill a

250
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.060
need,
you know,
sort of what,

251
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:03.110
solve for something that is missing because we weren't getting it done in the

252
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.200
eye.
You don't,
I come from the academic world.
The ivory tower can't even,

253
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.520
people will say to me,
you know,

254
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:10.700
my phone number on the Internet is still from when I was a resident for an hour.

255
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.890
So it's like ridiculous.
You can't even get into the,
you know,
so it's,
it's hard.

256
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:19.190
It's a very fort trust world out there.
Medicine at,
you know,
you know from it,

257
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:21.650
from your family.
But like if you don't know someone in the field,

258
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.950
it's very hard to break in.
Yeah.
And then you get to mental health,

259
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:27.710
forget physical health,
hard enough mental health.

260
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.370
And that's why may this month is so important to talk about it.
I mean,

261
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:34.460
nobody wants to talk about this.
The fact that you'll even say like,

262
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:39.190
you had this hard time postpartum is novel.
Yes.

263
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.860
Celebrities are coming out.
They're talking about it.
Um,
which I think is great.

264
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.740
It's definitely,
the word on the street is,
it's out there.
But again,

265
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:48.340
it's getting mistaken as,
oh,
it was,
I didn't have depression.

266
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.800
I didn't have that postpartum depression.
It used to be,
I would say five,

267
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:53.540
10 years ago when I would get calls,

268
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:57.430
it would be like somebody killed their child.
Right?
Right.
So,

269
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.160
and everyone thought that was postpartum depression.
That's not,
that's not,

270
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.110
that is postpartum psychosis.

271
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.350
When you lose touch with reality and you have these thoughts that like you're

272
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:13.190
saving your child if you kill them because you're so bad.
These are delusions.

273
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.030
This is a person who is out of touch with reality because I always say no mother

274
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:21.380
in their right mind would hurt their child.
Right?
That's not so,

275
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:24.880
so no one talks about it because they're like,
oh,
if I tell anyone,
I mean,

276
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:29.330
there was a Sacramento story not long ago where a woman told her,
uh,
I,
you know,

277
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:34.010
someone in the pediatrician's officer obese office and they called the cops and

278
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:37.220
then the car,
then it became a,
you know,
or acs comes in,
you know,

279
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:38.420
adult child services.

280
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.930
No one knows what's going to happen if they admit that they're struggling,

281
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.300
they think they're going to think I'm a bad mom.

282
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.300
They're going to think I'm a bad person,
that I might try and hurt my kid.

283
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:50.110
Like those horrible sensationalized news stories I've heard about it.

284
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.340
So the fact that we're having just a,
you know,

285
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.110
a conversation about routine stuff that I cannot,
you know,

286
00:16:57.111 --> 00:17:01.700
one in five women struggle.
So and,
and dads too.

287
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:04.580
It has to be under reporting.
I total it.
Well the numbers one in seven,

288
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:06.850
I go with one and five cause for sure.
Yeah.

289
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.730
It's underreported underdiagnosed undertreated,
yeah.
And dads too.
Yeah.

290
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.160
<v 1>I think it's amazing.
And this is,
um,
moving a bit away from other hoods center,</v>

291
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:20.880
but obviously tangentially tied to it and somebody else that was on goop and the

292
00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:23.460
clarity cleanse.
So wonderful book.
You haven't read it.

293
00:17:23.461 --> 00:17:28.230
I forget the author's name.
Yeah.
And he was actually at the first goop summit.

294
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.470
I'm a good fan.
I can tell.
Um,

295
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.440
next summit is in three weeks to ninth be there La.
Uh,

296
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.400
but he talks about actually that mental health and physical health are the same

297
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:39.150
thing.
Yeah.

298
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:43.050
And so while we're still working to get there and de stigmatize that mental

299
00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:48.000
health.
Yep.
All of that is so closely tied to everything inside your body.

300
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.700
And so if you're on to something from the past,

301
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:55.200
mentally there will be a physical manifestation of it at some point.

302
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.750
There's a great book by,
um,
a trauma expert.

303
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.780
Bessel van der Kolk called the body keeps the score.
Yeah.

304
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.560
I just love the title because I feel like it says it all right.

305
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:09.030
You don't escape your past and you don't escape your mind,
your body,

306
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.081
your trauma.

307
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:15.081
Everyone's got something that lives in the body and it will come to the panel or

308
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:20.470
other favorite parenting experts.
Robin Berman.
Yeah.
Um,

309
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.940
parenting becoming a parent creates a crisis.
Do you,

310
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:27.240
because it like forces every,

311
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:30.000
the way you were parented to the surface and suddenly it's like,

312
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:33.090
what kind of mother am I going to be?
What kind of othering did I not get?

313
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:37.830
Like just a total and yeah,
it's a crisis.
I don't,

314
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:41.520
and I don't think people are necessarily when they're not conscious of that.
No.

315
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.420
Sometimes you are,
I mean,
I think we with permission to pair,

316
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.680
which is a wonderful book if you haven't read it.
Um,

317
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.300
and you just happened to be the other's best friend.
And she's adorable.
Uh,

318
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.790
you know,
my husband,
I talk about this often with,

319
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:56.700
we try to create for our boys the opposite of what we had.

320
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.410
But as we're in the midst of seeing all of our friends also become parents,

321
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:04.410
it's very interesting because some of them just directly wants a copy that,

322
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:08.940
because they had such wonderful,
so they see him,
idyllic childhoods.
But it is,

323
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.990
it is an act of becoming a parent and you chose it the minute you got pregnant.

324
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.100
But it isn't something that is fully fleshed out in your brain until you start

325
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:19.260
seeing these little things run around.

326
00:19:19.261 --> 00:19:21.800
And then there's this idea that it's all supposed to be natural,
right?

327
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.800
Like there is no act and you're supposed to know how to breastfeed.

328
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.110
And I mean,
these things that are not natural,
I'm sorry,
but the like,

329
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.350
um,
and,
and what's a natural birth?

330
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.440
And that conversation drives me nuts too.
Um,

331
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.850
it starts like the judgment starts.
Oh,
I mean,

332
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.710
what kind of birds are you going to have?
What I mean not to just,

333
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.540
I'm not in a complaint.
It's uh,
it's complicated.
And I also think too,

334
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.660
that's another thing about going back to once you're,
when you're pregnant,

335
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:54.420
you are the princess and once you have the baby or the peasant,

336
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.800
even with when you were had the lactation consultant come,
I remember,

337
00:19:58.801 --> 00:20:00.500
I thought this was for me because I was,

338
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:04.080
it was so painful and so hard the first time.
And they're like,
nope,
nope.

339
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.770
All about the baby.
And like,
but what,

340
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.260
how do I know I can I get some help over here?
Literally they missed the boat,

341
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.360
missed the boat.
And again,

342
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:16.050
that's why what we're finding when these women leave the mother had senator is

343
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:19.080
they are repleted to go back to that depleted word.

344
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.930
They feel cared for,
nourished.
We do not do that for mom.

345
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:28.020
Now it's all about the baby.
You know,
you're celebrated when you're pregnant.

346
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.640
Right?
But the minute that kid out all eyes on the baby and great,

347
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.710
but what about the mom?
Yeah.
And I hope there is a shift.
I mean,
at least,
again,

348
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.460
in my small circle,
we always do when,
when a baby's born,

349
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:45.390
it's not about holding that new baby.
It's where's your laundry and where,

350
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.920
what can I do for you?
Because I will marry Poppins this because,
right.

351
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.150
That's selfishly would I would like to have.
Right.
So,
but it is you,

352
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.680
you don't know until you know,
and it's,
but how do we educate,

353
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:57.910
so obviously motherhood center,

354
00:20:57.911 --> 00:21:01.540
but at least what other opportunities are out there,
I guess opportunities,

355
00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.021
the wrong word,

356
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:07.021
but what other things are in place for women to go to and get this sort of

357
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:10.480
resource?
Obviously,
you know,
if we can't all be in New York City,

358
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:11.500
which has Googlers,

359
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:15.370
we're lucky because we potentially do work in New York and we can visit and we

360
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:19.510
will.
But you know,
for those of us who can't,
you know,

361
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.770
digitals key right now.
So what,
what,
what,
what resources are out there?

362
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.340
Well,
I think it,
of course,
other than games and

363
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.630
<v 3>hopefully more motherhood centers,
um,
to,
I mean they're,
I,</v>

364
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.630
I wouldn't,
it's hard to say.
I mean,

365
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:39.520
I'd say it's piecing together things that work for you.
It's an a lot of it.

366
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:42.010
It's like the metal.
It can learn a lot from the airline industry.

367
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:46.270
Like you have to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before you help other

368
00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:49.360
people.
And I think it's,
it's a familial conversation.

369
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:52.570
I think it's a forced conversation with partners too,
of like,

370
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.460
I need to be a priority,
I need to be as prioritized as my child.

371
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.540
Um,
and that needs to be a social conversation.

372
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.190
That needs to be like cultural conversation.
Um,
of,

373
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.640
you know,
we were talking about this before.
I'm married to a really lovely man.

374
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.350
Um,
he's great.
He is far less stressful career and he's a,
he's a really good dad.

375
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.130
I still do 60% of the work.
Um,

376
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.900
and he is applauded.

377
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:24.400
Like he's celebrated as an amazing dad cause sometimes he drops her kid off at

378
00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:28.390
preschool and you know,
he puts on that bad.
Yeah.

379
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.250
And like I am not celebrated.
I'm an absent mom.
Um,

380
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.130
even though I do more of the work.
And so it's,

381
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.540
it's even just bringing awareness to that.

382
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.690
And then I think in order for things to change,

383
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.720
it's connecting with women who are not yet mothers because nobody knows.

384
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:50.120
Like I just was shocked.
I was,
it was before it was like cute.

385
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:55.120
But when I had my first child and I was eight months pregnant and I went to the

386
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:59.770
benefits office for my midterm and I was like,
oh,
so I'll be on maternity leave.

387
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:02.500
And she's like,
okay,
so you're going to beat,
you'll be,
and this was bad.

388
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.230
This is far better than the vast majority of Americans.
Like what?

389
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.570
We're going to pay for six weeks and then you go on disability.
I was like,

390
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.570
I can't survive on disability.
Like what are you talking about?

391
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.080
Like I thought I had a 12 week leave and I think,
you know,

392
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:23.210
a 27% of women are back at work two weeks after having a baby because they have

393
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:28.440
no family leave.
And then you start this whole cycle.
Yeah.
Oh,

394
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.660
pernicious cycle.
And I was furious.
Yeah.

395
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.020
I was so mad.
Not only at my company,

396
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:38.770
but also at the culture.
Um,

397
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.770
and like,
that's not a good way to start.

398
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.920
That's not a good way to become a mom either.
No,
it's not good for anyone.

399
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.570
<v 1>It's funny,
I was a resident when I had my first kid who's now 19,</v>

400
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.940
and I didn't know what I got either.
And I'm like,

401
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.620
I didn't even know if there's maternity leave.

402
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:58.010
I was one of the few residents to get pregnant during residency in those years.

403
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.890
And I went in and I'm like,
what are like,
what's the deal?

404
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:05.120
And they said six weeks and if you have a c section,
you'll get the,

405
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.740
this is at a hospital,
right?
I mean,
it's so ironic,
you know,

406
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.620
it was dismal.
Well,
I will say to Google's credit,

407
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.550
you guys,
when we do it right,

408
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:21.551
you have an incredible maternal maternity and paternity leave policy.

409
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.320
Um,
and for those of you thinking about getting pregnant and thinking,

410
00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:27.200
I don't need all that.
You need it all.
Take it all.
There's never a day.

411
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:31.550
You'll wish you didn't do that.
Um,
but we also,

412
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:32.660
when I said when I opened this talk,

413
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:37.661
we have the expectation when you're working here is incredibly high and it is so

414
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.580
difficult to be a mom and have all those expectations.

415
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:45.320
So I agree with you that it starts with women who haven't had children.

416
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:49.400
And I,
you know,
I have a lovely manager and he's so responsive to my needs.

417
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.090
I forced it because I always have these conversations with him,

418
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.590
but not everyone is like that.
Um,

419
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.820
but I find it to be a little trickier with peers who don't have children.

420
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.880
So what,
I mean,
I'm sure you've seen New York City,

421
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:07.940
you've got to have some high powered ladies coming in there with,

422
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:11.540
so what is some advice to help,
you know,

423
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:16.730
moms in high power jobs deal with women that don't have kids who may want to and

424
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:18.140
it's no one's fault,

425
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.700
but it is an interesting place to navigate,
um,

426
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.100
with when you get that call yesterday and my son,

427
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:28.610
we had to take him to the doctor unexpectedly,
a 2:30 PM.

428
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.720
And so I had to work from home and you know,
you get some,
it's very difficult.

429
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.860
Well,
it's a,
it's a systemic issue.
Yes.

430
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.330
And we look at it as the mother's problem.
Yeah.
Um,

431
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.710
I'm not sure if dads are running home or you know,

432
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:46.940
as much or partners are running home,
but the primary caretaker,
whoever that is,

433
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.960
typically the mom is really disadvantaged,

434
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.020
which should not be the case.
This is a fan.
I mean,

435
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:56.570
do we want to populate this country?
But you know,

436
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.700
but so isn't this everyone's issue?
Isn't it a natural thing?

437
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:06.550
So why it's considered,
um,
a problem,
you know,
when everyone's hide,
you know,

438
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.330
can you cover for me while I run out?
It's like what?
Yeah.
So again,

439
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.130
it's hard,
but I think that,
um,
it has to be a community of familial,

440
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.090
but you have to,
it it's,
it's a,
it's a cultural systemic issue.
And you're right.

441
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:22.490
Even yesterday,
I kind of coward when I said,
well,

442
00:26:22.491 --> 00:26:25.880
I've got to take him to the doctor because he might have bronchitis

443
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.750
or your partner should be able to go that shit.
That's normal.
Yeah.
Normal.

444
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.280
Where we're using that word.
But I,
and you're right.
I mean,

445
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.730
but it is difficult for people,

446
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:41.720
but I think the verbiage around it is so important.
Well,
I think,

447
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:44.070
and I think it honestly,
it's an issue that needs

448
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.490
<v 3>to start with like with men.
I think to start that one,</v>

449
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:49.680
they have like when you look at the research,

450
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.310
they have the power to advocate change and I think they feel shy about it.

451
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.590
Like it's a woman's issue and it's not really my place,
but they're the,
it's,

452
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.130
it's sadly going to be the most,
well there they can,
it's a numbers game.

453
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.210
It's a numbers game.

454
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.350
Like women and minorities when they advocate for themselves are,
it's not,

455
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.930
it doesn't always go well.
Um,

456
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.550
men when they advocate are seen as like big hearted.
It's positive.

457
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.960
So men need to start advocating for it.

458
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.210
Um,
they need to make sure that there are women in the room.
Um,

459
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:29.270
they need to model it and make sure that the environment is one that is sort of

460
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.460
ideally,
and this is,
this is it only works at places like you'd been Google,

461
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.730
but that they're setting reasonable work hours and not inundating people on the

462
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:44.640
weekends and letting w mothers in particular do their work when they can do

463
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:47.130
their work.
I mean if you want something done,
ask a mom.

464
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.760
I don't know anyone who falls down on that,

465
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.740
but it has to start,
it has to be that sort of conversation.

466
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.030
Do the men take it?

467
00:27:57.031 --> 00:28:00.660
I'm wondering at Goop and I googled do they take maternity or paternity?

468
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:04.250
Cause I think that that's another issue is that there,
oh,

469
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.570
they'll take a week or two.
And again,
I don't mean to stereotype,

470
00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:09.060
but are they modeling it?

471
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.800
Are they taking it or are they seen as somehow weak or if they actually do

472
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.510
<v 1>music?
So I don't know the stats on that.
I'm sure we can get it.
Um,</v>

473
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.750
but I do know that my,
my husband,

474
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:26.010
you works for a different Tech Company and he did take his two paternity leaves.

475
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.750
Thank you very much.
That's a gift.
Will certainly never want to give back.

476
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.340
And um,

477
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.940
I know my brother in law works at Google and he'll be taking his paternity
leave.

478
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:40.010
So it's certainly is becoming encourage.
It's certainly in the,

479
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.500
or encourage you guys are cutting edge.
You are leading the way.

480
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.010
But even for us and I,
I'm much more,
I'm glass half full,

481
00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:48.570
so I see us as being,

482
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.170
it's such a wonderful experience and the amount of time we get off.
But even,

483
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.980
you know,
two weeks ago when my son was two turned one,
um,

484
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:59.460
there was a gal in Canada who I was chatting with and her son also just turn one

485
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:02.100
and she just got back from maternity leave and she too works at Google.

486
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.230
So it is very interesting.
Um,
and I certainly am so happy to have what we have,

487
00:29:07.231 --> 00:29:09.930
but it,
it isn't perfect.

488
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.520
And what is the right amount of time for a woman to have off is obviously

489
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:18.350
different per woman,
but should we should have a larger spectrum.
Yeah,

490
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:24.090
<v 3>that's the thing.
I mean,
I'm in some ways not maybe a good representative,</v>

491
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:27.680
but when I had my second child,
it was,
this'll,

492
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.170
this'll probably drive you crazy.
Um,
it was,

493
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.860
it was an incredibly busy time and I just brought him to work.

494
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.750
I stayed home for six weeks and then I just brought my baby to work for eight

495
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:44.350
weeks,
I think.
And it was awesome.
Okay.
Medicaid?
No,
everyone loved it.
I mean,

496
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:47.800
he just was like the office baby.
He'd be napping and everyone's arms.

497
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.930
I nursed him at work.
Yeah.
Um,
and sure.

498
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:56.080
Like if it hasn't been a different time,
I would have stayed away for longer.

499
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.910
But that worked for me.
And that would also works for me is I don't,
I,

500
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.890
if I need to go to the doctor,
I go to the doctor without guilt.
Okay.
Or I,
I work,

501
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.180
uh,
he goes to a co op nursery school,
so I work at the school one day a month,

502
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.860
et Cetera,
at like,

503
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:15.610
that's what I need is prolonged and constant flexibility.

504
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.510
That's the word.
Yeah.
And I get,
I definitely get my job done,

505
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:24.200
but it has to be within the confines of the flexible.
And I,

506
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.010
I'm fine with that for my whole team,
many of whom are not moms.
I'm like,

507
00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:31.740
I don't care if you are in Alaska and your work is done like

508
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.340
<v 1>fine.
Yeah.
More power to Ya.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Flexibility is certainly key.</v>

509
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.960
So before I open it up to Q and a,

510
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:40.750
because I'm sure a lot of people have questions and we have some questions

511
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:42.070
that'll be coming from online.

512
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:47.700
My one of my last questions is how do we de stigmatize or normalize,

513
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.030
you know,
postpartum anxiety or postpartum depression,
how,

514
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.820
how can we make it a more welcome environment for women to talk about it not

515
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:56.710
only at a center or you know,

516
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.310
behind closed doors with their managers or girlfriends.
Um,

517
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.610
is it simply just talking about it?
Is it men talking about it?

518
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.210
Is it women without children talking about it because they've seen it?
Yeah.

519
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.061
<v 2>Talking,
talking,</v>

520
00:31:08.061 --> 00:31:13.061
talking cannot talk enough about it to start to help people feel to normalize

521
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.230
the,
uh,
the transition.

522
00:31:15.231 --> 00:31:19.190
But it's hard to validate their varied experiences.

523
00:31:19.191 --> 00:31:23.020
It's different for everyone,
but talking is key.
And,
and,
and,

524
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:27.260
and in a nonjudgmental way,
right.
There's no judgment,
right.

525
00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:32.150
Whether you work outside the home or work inside that,
wherever it is,
you can't,

526
00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:36.560
people are different and we want to respect their different experiences.
Visa,
VI,

527
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.880
Motherhood,
parenthood.
And so just in a way,
just being curious,

528
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.170
asking like,
how's it going for you?
I always say,
um,
you know,

529
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.200
doctors don't like to not know answers and they'll say,
well,
I don't,

530
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:52.370
I don't ask women about postpartum anxiety or depression because I don't treat

531
00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:55.610
it like I'm not the expert.
Like you,
I don't know what to do.
And I said,
Oh God,

532
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:56.970
we have a long way to go.
Yeah.

533
00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.020
But you don't have to know what skills to what questions to ask.

534
00:32:00.021 --> 00:32:03.290
Just look them in the eye,
hold their gaze and say,

535
00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:07.300
how are you and don't move.
Yeah.
And look at them.
Yeah.

536
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.750
And often people burst into tears.
No one's asked how I am.
Yeah.
Right.

537
00:32:11.751 --> 00:32:14.150
It's all about this cute little baby.
Yeah.
Right.

538
00:32:14.151 --> 00:32:17.960
But you gotta just look someone in the eye,
just have a real conversation,

539
00:32:17.961 --> 00:32:20.630
not like,
hey,
how you doing?
Oh,
it's great.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.

540
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.920
Just like have the conversation,
just have a real conversation.

541
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.250
<v 1>I absolutely love that.</v>

542
00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:30.420
And I was talking to a teammate of mine about something very similar with just

543
00:32:30.421 --> 00:32:33.070
ask,
you might feel uncomfortable,
you might know what know what to ask,

544
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.420
but just do exactly what you said.
Yeah.
I,
um,

545
00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.160
a few months ago I was listening to the Oprah Winfrey podcast and she was

546
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:43.580
interviewing Cheryl Sandberg and this is,
she was talking about,
you know,

547
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:46.160
obviously your husband died and people were,
you know,
you know,

548
00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:50.270
it's trepidation circling the issue.
And she said,
I'm always thinking about it,

549
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.490
right.
So you can always ask me.

550
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.060
And while this being coming a mother's that much happier thing,

551
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:59.870
but you can always ask me how I'm doing because I'm always thinking about my

552
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:03.710
children and you know what to say.
That's fine.
You can even say,

553
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.990
I don't really know how to ask you this,
but,
um,
I know you're a cop.
Like,
yeah.

554
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.520
How you doing?
Yeah.
And you don't have to know the answer,

555
00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:10.580
you're going to Google it.
Yeah.

556
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.490
<v 3>Um,
on occasion for meetings where we run,</v>

557
00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:18.900
we just quickly go around the room when people say either personal and work or

558
00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:21.810
combination or however you want to do it.
Are you red,
yellow,
green,

559
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.650
and it's very helpful just to one.

560
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.140
And people can explain or they don't have to explain.

561
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.660
But I think it also in any contact,

562
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.590
it gives greater context to any interaction of just like,

563
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:39.450
I might be red because maybe I was up all night with a sick kid and then I might

564
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.610
not be in a great mood and it's not you.
But I think it also creates like a,

565
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.780
it's,
it's important,
you know what happens at home and yeah.

566
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.670
The two are so intermingled now.

567
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:55.460
<v 1>Yeah.
And also at home when you get home.
Yeah.
With asking your partner.
Yeah.</v>

568
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.170
You're going to be red,
yellow or green.
Um,
okay.
Any questions

569
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:04.060
<v 2>and the audience.
Okay.
Too Shy.
We've got some on the door.</v>

570
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.510
He just answered everyone's,
I know we have lots of coming,
so,
okay.

571
00:34:08.511 --> 00:34:09.410
First one on here.

572
00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:12.860
What can husbands do to support their spouse when they're suffering from

573
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:16.850
postpartum depression even later when my wife seems to have come out of it but

574
00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:18.590
isn't 100% of her earlier self.

575
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:22.700
Can I do anything to make her feel better outside of the medical help she is and

576
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:27.530
was getting?
Great question.
Awesome question.
Um,
I think you can ask.
I,

577
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.280
I,
you know,
people don't often or won't volunteer what they need,

578
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:36.590
but I'll often say,
you know,
we're not mind readers ask like,
how can I help you?

579
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.880
What can I do for you?
And observe,
see what she's struggling with.

580
00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:44.470
Where are areas in which you can be helpful?
But you know,
um,

581
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.970
you may not know,
you know,
the love languages,
you know,
you may not know what her,

582
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:54.620
what would feel cared for for her and vice versa.
So you asking,

583
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.940
so what can I do to help you?
You don't seem entirely yourself.
What am I missing?

584
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.090
What are we not doing here?
Are you getting,
you know,
are you,

585
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.450
are there ways in which you can help her get to the help she needs?

586
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:09.950
Is she getting mental health help,
you know,
um,
you know,

587
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.520
is that being,
are the or the needs being met?
Because you know,

588
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:18.220
you can feel with,
with,
with proper treatments,
um,

589
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.280
everyone feels better and everyone gets well and a lot of times women will say,

590
00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:25.190
I feel even better than I ever felt because maybe they were,

591
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.250
they had a simmering depression or they've always been sort of chronically

592
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:32.720
anxious and it didn't come to light until they were postpartum and then it just

593
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:33.554
blew up.

594
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:38.440
So I think sometimes with proper treatment you really can be the better.
So if,

595
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.930
if that's not the case and continue to persist,
don't ever give up.

596
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.520
If you feel like,
um,
your wife's come out of it,
but it's not quite that,
just,

597
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.910
just don't give up,
keep pushing until you get to a place that feels right,

598
00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:55.200
feels comfortable.
Hmm.
Great question.
Okay.

599
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.890
Uh,
coming back to work with postpartum depression is very hard,

600
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:01.530
but oftentimes colleagues don't know what they can do.

601
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.520
What would you recommend for manager colleagues to do to help?

602
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.780
That's a really good questions.
I wish I could ask that.
Pr,
you know,

603
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.700
I don't know if they can hear me or,
wow,
okay.
Um,
um,

604
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.000
do people know,

605
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.050
I mean that's the thing or are are you who's asking this question,
you know,

606
00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:23.330
willing to share.
Again,
I don't,
you know,
we're sharers up here clearly.

607
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.340
Um,
but,
and I don't know that you have to give all the details,

608
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:27.570
but I think if you're willing,
again,

609
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.290
this is part of what brings it out is to say,
you know,
I struggled to put,

610
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:35.730
you don't have to give it,
I struggled or I'm struggling and then your manager,

611
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.480
you know,
and then you can think about ways to assist your manager helping you.

612
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:41.940
It would be great if you could help me with,

613
00:36:41.941 --> 00:36:45.360
or if I could run out to a pediatrician or appointment or,
you know,
what,

614
00:36:45.361 --> 00:36:48.030
I'm actually getting treatment for my blank.

615
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.080
Would it be okay with you if I left for these appointments?
Right.

616
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.830
You have to ask,
you have to ask.
Um,
and you have to teach.

617
00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.540
You have to help people help you.
So I think that,
um,
if you're willing to share,

618
00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:05.370
and again,
you don't have to go down to the,
the TMI rabbit hole of every detail,

619
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:09.150
but just,
um,
I,
I've been struggling,
so,
um,
you know,

620
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:14.040
would it be okay if right at anyone who says no to that?
I mean,

621
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.420
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Great question.
Um,

622
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.460
could you recommend lifestyle best practices,
specifically diet,
nutrition,

623
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.190
supplements,
exercise,
et Cetera,
to help replenish mom?
That's you.

624
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.710
You're the clean of that.

625
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:32.110
<v 1>I know.
I have the doctor on that lifestyle.
Yeah.</v>

626
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.200
<v 3>Um,
so generally,
um,</v>

627
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:40.210
my advice would be to ask,
get your doctor or go,
what's it called?

628
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.890
<v 1>One O one medical here.
Um,
you know,
again,
fortunately for us,</v>

629
00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:48.300
Google has amazing benefits and one medical is now our wellness centers,

630
00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:52.200
so I'm sure you're going to say get your panel testing at your panel testing and

631
00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:52.730
you can do,

632
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.940
<v 3>yeah.
So most likely,
I mean omega,</v>

633
00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.470
so like really good fish oil.
You can't really take too much of that.
Vitamin D,

634
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.300
vitamin B,
magnesium,
iron.
I'm like,

635
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.930
that's probably baseline.
And then you have,
Yep.
Get,

636
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:13.980
get your hormones checked,
make sure your thyroid is functioning,
um,

637
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.300
and you'll want to work with your doctor to address it or tinker with it if it's

638
00:38:17.301 --> 00:38:18.080
not.

639
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.080
Cause that can a lot of autoimmune disease flares up postnatally for women.

640
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:27.980
Um,
and you want to,
you want to curb it.

641
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.250
There's sort of this autoimmune spectrum that a lot of doctors are starting to

642
00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:31.791
talk about.

643
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:35.380
Like you don't get that diagnosis of Hashimoto's until you've essentially your

644
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:39.700
thyroid.
But there are a lot of things you can do in the interim to help.

645
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.270
Um,
exercise.
It's really hard.

646
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.500
Exercise is really hard for new moms.
Like you're nursing,

647
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:51.400
you're leaking your incontinent.
Um,

648
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.390
it's so awesome.
And um,

649
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.440
I'd say I would try to find someone who can really help you with your pelvic

650
00:38:59.441 --> 00:39:01.390
floor.
I am from goop guys.

651
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.260
<v 1>Um,
and,</v>

652
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.470
<v 3>and Europe,
it's like mandated.
You get an APP,
you are,
um,</v>

653
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.380
they are getting your pelvic floor back into shape.

654
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.200
But I would definitely focus on that cause it can,

655
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.190
you don't want like a prolapsed uterus or bladder later in life and you

656
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:23.140
definitely want to be able to hold your pee.
Um,
you can jump on a rebounder too.

657
00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:24.220
That's really helpful.

658
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.320
But there are a lot of physical therapists who will work on your pelvic floor.

659
00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:33.370
Um,
and also help you like for me,

660
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.130
because I came to cube after I became a mom,
like a year out,

661
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.450
I went to work with this woman,

662
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:41.050
Lauren Roxborough does a lot of foam rolling content with us and I was still

663
00:39:41.051 --> 00:39:43.630
holding myself like I was pregnant,
which is very common,

664
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:48.920
but just this like I looked pregnant and so she,
I,

665
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.740
she got me back into alignment,

666
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:54.340
which you can do through [inaudible] or physical therapy.
Um,

667
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:59.370
but your organs are all back and stuff and your body will come back but you can

668
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:02.020
help.
There are a lot of things that you can do to help.

669
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.000
<v 1>I am by no means the expert,
but do read a lot of content.
And I would say,</v>

670
00:40:06.001 --> 00:40:07.590
you mentioned Alejandro Hunger,

671
00:40:07.591 --> 00:40:10.770
who eight years ago significantly changed my life.

672
00:40:10.771 --> 00:40:12.030
My mom has an autoimmune disease,

673
00:40:12.031 --> 00:40:14.580
which is what brought me to this whole wellness thing.

674
00:40:14.581 --> 00:40:18.480
And I'm doing the clean every year I think is so important.

675
00:40:18.481 --> 00:40:21.060
And I know it's so hard to get your mind over not being able to,

676
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.910
for me drink alcohol,
I'll just wind,
but you know,

677
00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:27.600
drink a little bit of wine and have a piece of pizza,
but it's 21 days.

678
00:40:27.601 --> 00:40:31.590
You can certainly do it.
So you have given birth,
you can do a 21 day cleanse

679
00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.160
<v 3>two and it's nourishing.</v>

680
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:36.730
It's not about deprivation is not a calorie thing at all.

681
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:41.200
You can shove as much stuff into your smoothies,
you can snack if you're hungry,

682
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.880
but it's that filling.

683
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.710
It's all about eliminating potential things that might be aggravating you.

684
00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:49.720
So it's also really good if you need to know,
like,

685
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:53.380
am I tolerant of gluten and my tolerant of dairy?
Um,
but,

686
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.220
and there are supplements that go with it for after my first one,
it was,

687
00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.510
it profoundly shifted me and it reset.
I didn't lose,

688
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.850
I lost like two pounds when I did it 21 days.

689
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:07.630
And then after I just dropped all my weight,
it was weird.

690
00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:11.950
It just reset me.
Um,
but I agree it's also,
it's two shakes,

691
00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.670
breakfast and dinner and it's actually really nice not to have to make dinner

692
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.563
for 21.
Yeah.

693
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.260
<v 1>And yeah,
he's just wonderful.
He has a lot of different resources out there too.</v>

694
00:41:22.261 --> 00:41:26.870
So for Diet I would,
I would strongly recommend his stuff.
Yeah.

695
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:28.830
Um,
and then for exercise too,

696
00:41:28.831 --> 00:41:33.170
what I found after my second w especially right away was it was very hard to get

697
00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:35.750
out,
especially finding classes.
I'm a class person,

698
00:41:35.751 --> 00:41:38.640
I love orange theory and Barre method and [inaudible],

699
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.450
but how do I get there if he's supposed to be nursing at that time and they're

700
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:45.370
preset.
So I'm a big bar method fan and if you like bar,
um,

701
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.530
I really,
really believe in it during pregnancy.
Um,

702
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:52.040
it just keeps everything tight and nice and it's not too strenuous on you,

703
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:56.600
but it,
um,
they have on online classes and they're just as good.
I swear it,

704
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:58.490
I'm not the type of person who can work out at home.

705
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:00.680
And this has really changed for me,

706
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:03.270
especially because I travel for work and glow.
I think you guys have

707
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.280
<v 2>program with them.
They're good.
There are a lot of good streaming.</v>

708
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.360
It's a good idea.
Yoga glow.
Tracy Anderson.
Yeah.
Forest and it's good.

709
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:11.740
So I just say walking.

710
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

711
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.070
I mean I live in New York City.

712
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.680
<v 2>You can walk to a door and you know,
just like locking,</v>

713
00:42:20.681 --> 00:42:23.650
like get those 10,000 steps.
I'm so basic.
I can't

714
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.760
shut that baby on.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,

715
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.990
I had significant postpartum depression and took short term disability leave

716
00:42:34.991 --> 00:42:36.190
after my maternity leave.

717
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.460
Do you have advice for sharing or not sharing with colleagues?
Why?

718
00:42:39.461 --> 00:42:40.600
I was on leave for so long.

719
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.410
My colleagues assume I extended my maternity leave and was lucky quote unquote

720
00:42:44.411 --> 00:42:48.220
when my experience terrible to some,
fight them to stay home with the baby.

721
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.570
<v 3>[inaudible] the best scenario.
Yeah.</v>

722
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.830
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
you know,
I think that's very personal.</v>

723
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.730
I think you have to decide how much you're willing to put yourself out there.

724
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:03.650
And again,
I don't think you have to give all the information,
but um,
you know,

725
00:43:03.651 --> 00:43:08.270
if you're sensing that people feel kind of um,
are looking at you kind of like,

726
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.070
ah,
you know,
you will be extra maternity leave,
you know,
you,
you might,

727
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.670
if you have the opportunity or maybe you make the opportunity to address it and

728
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:18.870
say,
you know,
I had a really difficult time.
I,

729
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.460
my extra leave really had to do with kind of a medical issue.
Again,

730
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.840
postpartum depression is a mental illness is medical.

731
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:32.030
So this is a medical problem and when I write notes,
I do a lot of,
uh,

732
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.350
you know,
letters for disability.
Um,
I may be a psychiatrist but I,

733
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.120
these are medical problems and it has to be addressed as such and considered as

734
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:45.050
such.
And I think sharing that you had a medical problem,
you know,

735
00:43:45.051 --> 00:43:47.630
which was why you were out.
You don't have to go into the details.
You don't,

736
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.180
again,
you,
you can choose how much you want to share.

737
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.620
But I think reconceptualizing this as a medical issue is important because I

738
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:59.600
think that lets us off the hook.
Like,
I'm not just weak or,
um,
defective,

739
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.160
but this is really,

740
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.690
it's a real thing and you can say as much or as little,

741
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.350
but I think that's up to,
to how much you're willing to share and yeah,

742
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:13.670
it's so hard not to be ashamed by it though.
Shame is,
I know.

743
00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:17.960
How do we get rid of that conversation we're doing and brave that bull.

744
00:44:17.961 --> 00:44:22.460
I think stepping up and saying this happened to me and like,

745
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.240
let's talk about it.
Um,
you know,

746
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:27.950
I know celebrities are doing it.
Yeah.

747
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.970
I think the more we bring it into general conversation,
the better.
Um,

748
00:44:31.971 --> 00:44:35.160
and recognize that it's,
that it's a difficult time for anybody.

749
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.680
It's not love at first sight.
I mean,
sometimes it is,

750
00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:41.520
but a lot of times it takes a while before you kind of fall in love with the kid

751
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:46.410
or know what to do or feel comfortable.
I mean,
do you have like postpartum?

752
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:51.150
Like are there support groups here?
I don't know.
Yeah.

753
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.560
Ooh,
excellent.

754
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.540
Not what do we have a go link for that or sorry,

755
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:02.040
getting the benefits.
Okay.

756
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:06.820
Momma mom support group.
It's so important to find a cohort.
And I think that,
um,

757
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.530
it's very validating and then the shame level goes down because you're like,

758
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.070
you had that,
you feel this way.
I mean,
because you know,

759
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.240
it's hard to do and it's hard to be in the part.
I always say women in the park,

760
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.750
they don't mean to lie,
but,
or Instagram,
whatever,
everyone looks good.

761
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.780
So it's hard to sort of break through that veneer of,

762
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:28.140
of what you think you think everybody else has it easier,
better,

763
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:33.380
they know what to do and they're just as terrified and unsure and um,

764
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.460
how tired and how you get the conversation going.
So when you have a mom's group,

765
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.683
um,

766
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:44.580
hopefully it's a group where there's honesty and authenticity where you can

767
00:45:44.581 --> 00:45:48.510
really share and validate each other so that you can say,
yeah,
it's really hard.

768
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.820
[inaudible]
you know,
I think too,

769
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:55.821
I'm look very vocal and out what I like about my experience as a mom and,

770
00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:00.030
and I feel like people need to talk about it so that two people who are pregnant

771
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:01.830
or thinking about it and being like,
there's just so,

772
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:06.270
I mean like I was so mad at my friends when I had the beat my baby and I was

773
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:09.090
like,
why didn't no one telling me this?
Like any of this you want to scare you?

774
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.530
Moraines and oh like just you're like heads up.

775
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.470
Like I could have yeah.
Like sorry.

776
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:23.250
But that goes for the emotional amen.
No one talks about it.

777
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:27.360
And so you are left again and shame.
Yeah.

778
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.950
I always say I give the Tux Bolt.

779
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:33.010
We'll do,

780
00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:37.440
see even Chrissy Tiegen just posted right after she had the second baby.
Um,

781
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.880
Asian pear underwear.

782
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:42.540
So the Little Mesh netting sometimes you see on pears should picture of herself

783
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:47.670
with the hospital underwear on.
And I mean the comments on it,
we're just,

784
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:51.080
yeah,
that's actually,
I'm,

785
00:46:51.081 --> 00:46:55.770
I have a coauthor and I are writing a new book.
How come?
No one told me.

786
00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:59.730
Because that's the reframe.
Yeah.
Um,
and it has,

787
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.230
it's the emotional side of pregnancy and postpartum and because no one talks

788
00:47:04.231 --> 00:47:05.700
about it.
So the idea is let's,

789
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:09.010
all these questions are actually answered in the book.
We talk about beef,

790
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:09.780
you know,

791
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.510
from the minute you're pregnant and sort of like what you don't know and what

792
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:14.940
you need to know.
It's like the need to know stuff,

793
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:19.740
what to expect did for the physical we want to do for the emotional.
Um,

794
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:23.140
and that comes out in a year.
Next Mother's Day.
That's right.

795
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:28.110
Everybody get planning on that.
I always say I,
I'm certainly,
you know,

796
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:30.100
somebody that folks come to when they're about

797
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.510
<v 1>to get pregnant or they did give,
you know,</v>

798
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.080
and I've got the whole email and everything.
I tailor it to every single person.

799
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:39.940
But I always started off with saying,
oh,
it's the best.
It's the worst,

800
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.080
but it's the best.

801
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.130
And that's the pendulum swing some days really quickly in between those two

802
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:51.970
things and sometimes stays for longer and the euphoria.
But it is,

803
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:54.760
and the people care to ask.
I will say,
you're right.
It's the best.

804
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:55.960
And here's why it's the worst,
but

805
00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.570
<v 3>oftentimes people don't always want to know</v>

806
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.420
<v 2>well,
and can they retain it?
That's the other thing.</v>

807
00:48:01.421 --> 00:48:05.050
I always wonder because when I used to go give lectures to the new parents
group,

808
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.260
I would,
I had to bust my way in in the hospital.
I would say like,

809
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:10.940
can I come and just give a little preview of what postpartum might be like?

810
00:48:10.941 --> 00:48:13.660
And they're like,
no,
because we don't want to scare those people.

811
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.330
Really tell people what it,

812
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.290
what it could be like and not think of that as,
you know,

813
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.210
like I felt like the grim reaper as opposed to just like this.
Just information.

814
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.020
Yeah.
Just being honest.
Yeah.

815
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:29.160
<v 3>Okay.
Um,
at almost nine months postpartum,</v>

816
00:48:29.161 --> 00:48:33.000
I still feel a loss of time with my hello little one,

817
00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:35.550
little one off.
When I'm at work,

818
00:48:35.551 --> 00:48:39.060
what can I do to feel better about being at work?
Trying to rationalize it.

819
00:48:39.061 --> 00:48:40.380
I need to work for my family,

820
00:48:40.381 --> 00:48:43.470
but it's not helping with the sadness of lost opportunity.

821
00:48:43.471 --> 00:48:47.940
Costs time with my baby.
I know.
Sense.

822
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:53.070
Yeah.
It's hard.
It's,
I mean,

823
00:48:53.071 --> 00:48:57.000
but it's also,
I'll just talk about how I think about it there myself,

824
00:48:57.001 --> 00:49:01.350
which I also definitely need to work.
And I do love to work one I like,

825
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.460
I'm like the universe has created enough of a support network for me to be able

826
00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:08.520
to work and I'm going to lean into that.
Like I love my nanny.

827
00:49:08.521 --> 00:49:12.330
She is like my mother,
everyone's mother.
Um,

828
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.320
and so that makes me feel better that my child is surrounded by love,

829
00:49:16.321 --> 00:49:18.150
but also I'm like,
I need to model,

830
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.860
like I'm going to model for my boys what it is to have a mom who works.

831
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.780
Like I,
I feel on some like spiritual karmic.
They chose me,
they get it.

832
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:31.560
Um,
and this might not be true of view,

833
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.940
but I am not,
like,
I'm not,
wasn't put here.

834
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:39.930
I'm not like a on the floor playing mom.

835
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:44.940
I've given my,
I've let myself off the hook for that,
but also,
um,

836
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.220
like I'm,
I'm good at work and I'm a good mom and it's not perfect.

837
00:49:50.221 --> 00:49:53.230
It doesn't look perfect.
Um,

838
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.280
but I think it's like allowing for the messiness and allow like I have to let

839
00:49:58.861 --> 00:50:02.490
yourself off the hook.
Um,
it's not lost opportunity.

840
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.890
It's like you are also having a life.

841
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.120
You're showing your kids that there's more outside of the world than them too,

842
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:11.550
which is important.
And I would add

843
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:17.500
<v 2>quality over quantity,
which is cliche,
but very true.
Um,</v>

844
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:19.990
or at least I tell myself that.
And it sounds like,
you know,

845
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:24.520
I mean it's important that when you're with,
when you're with them,
look,

846
00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:28.880
if you're with them and you're lamenting the loss of time or you're having

847
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:32.510
regret when you're with them or you're so guilty when you're with them,

848
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.870
then there's a different problem,
then you got to address that.
Right?

849
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.960
You're not able to put it aside and be with them.
So when you're there,

850
00:50:38.961 --> 00:50:43.130
be there and when you're at work be at work and you can still be,
you know,

851
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:43.961
checking in,
but you,

852
00:50:43.961 --> 00:50:47.420
you have to be present where you are and then when you're home with them,

853
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:52.130
be with them.
But if that's really,
um,
if that's hard,

854
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:56.600
then you have to kind of work through this because most people aren't home with

855
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:59.450
her kids.
You know what I mean?
This is in our country.

856
00:50:59.451 --> 00:51:02.830
We two working families is the norm and um,

857
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:07.360
I don't think kids are any worse off because of it.
I think to your point,

858
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:12.230
modeling and showing them,
I remember so distinctly when I was,
um,

859
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.820
when my older daughter was four,
she was in the bathtub,

860
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:20.150
I was running to the hospital,
I was on call and I said,
ah,
I have to go to work.

861
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.080
I'm so sorry to leave you.
When she looked at me and said,

862
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:28.730
why do you say that you like your job,
you like it.
And I thought,
oh my God,

863
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.550
she just left me out.
She let me off the hog and I thought,

864
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:34.820
don't do this to my kids.
Don't make that like she's right.

865
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:39.350
I love what I do and I love to work and I love my kids and I love to be at home

866
00:51:39.351 --> 00:51:43.520
when I'm at home.
But I would not be a good stay at home mom.
I'd be a disaster.

867
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.140
I hardest job,
the hardest job.

868
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:48.860
I have such admiration and the women who stay home and do this and want to do it

869
00:51:48.861 --> 00:51:51.440
and love doing it.
Great.
It's just complicated.

870
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:55.730
You have to figure out the whatever the formula is for yourself and there's no

871
00:51:55.731 --> 00:51:57.350
right,
wrong or perfection.

872
00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.670
It's just you got to figure out what works for you and you are in your family

873
00:52:01.671 --> 00:52:05.060
context.
Yeah.
But the guilt enough,
the regret,
the shame.

874
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.070
It's so wasteful.

875
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.990
<v 3>There's a,
I went to this um,
moms group after I had my first and um,</v>

876
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:14.860
she said something that was I really needed to hear and she was like,

877
00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:18.010
think about your childhood and like your happiest memories.

878
00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:23.490
And my happiest memories were like running wild in the woods with my brother and

879
00:52:23.681 --> 00:52:25.630
I grew up in Montana and she was like,

880
00:52:25.631 --> 00:52:29.440
how many of your happiest memories were your parents in attendance for?

881
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.730
And not that many.
Like,
I have amazing parents and there are present,

882
00:52:33.731 --> 00:52:36.940
but like she's like your child unfortunately like,

883
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:40.720
like you are at the center of their world right now but like their life extend

884
00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:45.460
far beyond you and you don't need to put yourself in the center of their story

885
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:50.710
constantly,
which like there have their own lives,
which is difficult.

886
00:52:50.711 --> 00:52:53.740
It's coming kind of broke my heart,
but I needed to hear it.
And,

887
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.330
and I will say that we do have resources.
Um,

888
00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:02.340
so if you are feeling still really down about it and missing your child's,

889
00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:03.610
um,
you know,

890
00:53:03.611 --> 00:53:06.490
to talk to your manager and talk about a flexible schedule if that's possible.

891
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.340
<v 1>I agree with you.
We live in Barrie or in New York,
La to working,
you know,
to uh,</v>

892
00:53:11.341 --> 00:53:14.750
a double working household is very common and yet the culture hasn't kept up

893
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:16.490
with it.
I always say school ends at two,

894
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.360
but he's going to pick like pumps it into two.
What is this all about?
So,

895
00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:23.660
you know,
as we,
as the things hopefully shift and change,
but you know,

896
00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:26.160
there is flexibility at Google.
So hopefully you can

897
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.750
<v 2>talk to your manager about it.</v>

898
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:32.460
Let's do one more and then we can close things out.

899
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.830
Um,
so I know I want to do two more cause the next one looks really good.
Okay.

900
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:41.820
Can you speak more to how physical health and lifestyle behaviors impact mental

901
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:45.760
health?
No.
So intertwined.
Um,

902
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:50.300
I think that it's probably false that we separate.
Yeah,
absolutely.

903
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.610
And that's what the clarity cleanse is about.
So great question.

904
00:53:53.611 --> 00:53:58.130
I would certainly read it.
Um,
but yeah,
no,
I think B,

905
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.690
vitamin B,
vitamin B,
right?
I think you want to be physically well,

906
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.800
so,
um,
and not so stressed.
You want to minimize stress,

907
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.400
maximize self care,
taking care of yourself.
It's not selfish.

908
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:15.690
It is self preserving,
self nourishing,
like the oxygen mask.

909
00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:17.760
You're no good to anybody else if you're not okay,

910
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.750
but you're no good to yourself if you're not physically well enough.

911
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.400
And I think that helps you be as mentally well enough.
Um,
again,

912
00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:28.800
you don't have to be perfect.
Everything doesn't have to be exact,

913
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:33.890
but I think that,
um,
they're just so intertwined that,
um,
that,

914
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.430
that you have to address both.

915
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:38.460
And I think that that becomes a problem because people,
you know,

916
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.880
everyone knows to work out,
go to the gym,
I'll be walking.

917
00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:44.550
Everyone else would be in the gym,
but,
but,
um,
but,

918
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.830
but mental health has to also be addressed.

919
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:49.620
It's kind of like I said to someone the other day who said,
wait,

920
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:53.440
is therapy like Jim for your mind?
It's like going to the gym for your mind.
Yeah.

921
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.430
It's like brushing your teeth,
right?
So,
okay.

922
00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:00.620
Not everyone's going to go to therapy though.
I kind of think they should.
Um,

923
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:05.550
I think almost anyone can use it because we all have passed.
We all have baggage.

924
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:09.060
We all have things to work out so that we don't revisit them on our children as

925
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:12.090
we're talking about.
Um,
and I think that,

926
00:55:12.091 --> 00:55:16.140
that you want to be as well emotionally,
mentally as you can,

927
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:17.690
and that will help your physical health.
They,

928
00:55:17.691 --> 00:55:22.691
they work in concert and to ignore one or to only focus on the other is

929
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:28.570
shortsighted.
Yeah.
And again,
with Google we have,
um,
look up,
oh,

930
00:55:28.571 --> 00:55:32.890
go to Moma and look up concern.
We have programs that we can certainly,
um,

931
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.030
get therapy sessions and it's really helpful.

932
00:55:36.031 --> 00:55:40.110
I personally use it and talk about it openly because I think it's so important.

933
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:40.710
And I,

934
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:43.110
there have been many times when I've been talking to my husband and like I'm on

935
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:44.970
my way to therapy.
I've nothing to say.
And then I leave.

936
00:55:44.971 --> 00:55:49.680
Like this session I've ever had
just put a plugin for that.

937
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:54.540
It's not about the content,
it's about everything else.
So anyway,

938
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.300
so great question though.
And then last,
um,

939
00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.400
you mentioned that this can affect dads too.

940
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:01.260
My husband has had severe depression,

941
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.990
severe depression and anxiety since the birth of our twins,

942
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:07.050
despite medication and therapy,
he feels very isolated.

943
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:10.770
What resources are available for dads and what can I do to help,

944
00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:15.120
especially if I'm,
when I'm struggling myself.
Awesome.

945
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:17.310
Quick question.
Um,

946
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.840
one of my fellow board members at Postpartum Support International,

947
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.050
Danny singly,
this is his thing,
he's in,
um,
San Diego I think,

948
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:30.430
but he's Mr Postpartum Dad.
He's a great guy.

949
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.140
And he writes a ton about this.

950
00:56:32.141 --> 00:56:34.990
And we also have somebody at the motherhood center,
Chuck Shaffer,

951
00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:39.100
who works with the dads.
Um,
it's really important.
Again,

952
00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.740
the dads who are struggling need a cohort,

953
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.540
they need other dads or other partners who are struggling and um,

954
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:49.540
they,
uh,
you know,
need the validation,
need the treatment.

955
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.780
It sounds like he's getting some treatment,
but,
but you need the resources.

956
00:56:52.781 --> 00:56:57.040
So I'd say going back to that,
um,
postpartum.net,
the,

957
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:01.780
that's the website for postpartum support.
International dads are big part of it.

958
00:57:01.781 --> 00:57:05.320
Families.
It's,
it's,
it's,
again,
it's about and started about moms,

959
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.750
but it's really families and now we've really,

960
00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:11.230
we're big into dad's right now and to helping dads find the resources they need.

961
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:15.910
There's a,
um,
I think it's a weekly chat for dads online.
So you can be anywhere.

962
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:20.200
There's,
they're just great resources on the website.
So postpartum.net,
um,

963
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.350
Danny singly chuck Shea for,

964
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.450
these are some of the guys who are writing about it out there nationally and

965
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:27.370
there are others who do it.
But again,

966
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:32.440
search for your community and you can to the mom,
you know,

967
00:57:32.441 --> 00:57:33.820
who's,
who's also struggling.

968
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:37.150
This is easy cause sometimes you can't even get online to look for it if you're

969
00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:40.060
so down and out.
But so if you can find those resources,

970
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.630
just help him get to the resources.
Um,

971
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.640
a place like postpartum support international,
we'll take it from there.

972
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.510
We'll help you remember.
I think it's sleep deprivation as a,
as a,

973
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.200
essentially a mental illness.
Um,

974
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:57.460
and I think it's like puts everything in a different content.

975
00:57:57.461 --> 00:58:00.040
I mean it creates crisis too and there's nothing,

976
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:02.770
it's sucks cause there's nothing to really do about it when you're trying,

977
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.150
when you have kids,
you don't sleep.

978
00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:08.590
But I think even just remembering that in the back of your mind,
not permanent,

979
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:12.670
um,
that it's not permanent,
but that it is pernicious,
um,

980
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.840
helps in terms of like understanding what also might be going on.

981
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:21.670
Thank you.
All the people on the dory for asking these very personal questions.

982
00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.600
Um,
I'm realizing why baby people in person didn't want to ask them questions.

983
00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:27.890
<v 1>He's number one is not as open as I am.
Just talking about all this stuff,</v>

984
00:58:27.891 --> 00:58:32.891
but a huge thank you to you guys for coming from La and from New York.

985
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:35.450
Every Thursday,
goop has a podcast.

986
00:58:35.451 --> 00:58:37.610
Elise is usually hosting unless it's going to herself.

987
00:58:37.611 --> 00:58:41.450
So I'm sure you have a lot of interesting guests coming up and there are some

988
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:46.330
other great podcasts that are in relationship to being a parent and um,

989
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:48.740
hormones and whatnot.
So please check those out if you haven't.

990
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.330
And then obviously,
Katherine,

991
00:58:50.331 --> 00:58:52.970
thank you so much for coming and when I'm in New York,

992
00:58:52.971 --> 00:58:55.250
I certainly am coming to the motherhood center no matter what.

993
00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.940
And I would encourage other people into our New York Googlers who are listening

994
00:58:58.941 --> 00:59:00.920
to go visit as well.
Yeah.
Um,

995
00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:05.000
and is the best way to do that just to visit your website and is there an email

996
00:59:05.001 --> 00:59:06.190
alias or pick up the phone.
Okay.

997
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.170
<v 2>Yup.
Um,
you can call,</v>

998
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:11.950
we have an info site and you'll get to a page Bambam who's our program director,

999
00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.190
who will be happy to have you come and see.
Great.

1000
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:19.660
<v 1>And then a new book in next year.
A year.
Thank you guys.</v>

1001
00:59:19.661 --> 00:59:20.520
Thanks everyone for coming.
