00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.510
Hello.
How's it going?

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.480
It's Friday.
And we're all here together.
I promise this hours,

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.790
I'm going to call it a power hour.
It'll be a little less than an hour.

4
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.670
Cause I know you're on your lunch break and you guys are like in the middle of

5
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:22.504
the workday.

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.680
But I am here to Jesuit and really inspire you because I've been on my own

7
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:29.860
personal journey,
which turned into a book called the Self Love Experiment.

8
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.690
So as we get started,

9
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:35.470
I want to ask you a question and just think about this for a moment and I will

10
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:38.890
ask you to share with the person next to you.
So you know that's kind of fun,

11
00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:42.640
right?
Get Cozy.
Think about someone who really inspires you.

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.420
It could be a mentor or a boss,
a teacher,
a best friend.

13
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.230
Maybe it's someone you don't know,
a public figure and author.

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.640
Just kidding.
Most of you probably don't at me.
So,
but no,

15
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:58.840
think about someone who inspires you and what are the qualities of an empowered

16
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.130
person?
Okay.

17
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.940
So just take a quick moment workshop with each other

18
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.310
so you can say who it is and what,
why they inspire you.

19
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.920
Okay,
so we'll come back to the group.
Does anyone want to share just all I,

20
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.510
all I want to hear is just maybe qualities of the inspiring person.

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.373
Just shout them out.

22
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.490
Self-Empowered just qualities of that empire in,

23
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.010
in Po empowered person.
Determined,
empowering other people.

24
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:37.390
Yes.
Confidence.
Passionate.
Yes.

25
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:41.230
These are great words.
Anyone else?
Qualities of the empowered person.

26
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.390
Happy,
driven.
All of these honest,
these are amazing.

27
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.870
So these qualities are also qualities of self love.

28
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.320
These qualities are also qualities of an empowered person.

29
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.640
Someone who is standing in their truth.
And today I'm going to help you.
Yes,

30
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.450
I'll be talking about my experiment in my experience in writing my book.

31
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:06.400
But I'm here to help you stand in your truth.

32
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.570
Because my ultimate goal is that when people ask that question,
you say,

33
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.650
I empower me.

34
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.210
I'm empowered and inspired by me because I've worked really hard to get to where

35
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:20.110
I am in my life and I'm super excited where I'm going to go.

36
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.580
So that's where we're going today.
And so when you first hear the word self love,

37
00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.320
what are some of the things you guys think of?

38
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.210
We're here today at a lunch break to talk about self love.
Anybody kind of think,

39
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:34.690
maybe it's selfish,
you don't have to raise your hand,
but I hear that a lot.

40
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.540
Narcissistic,
little bit selfish a little bit.
Uh,
right.

41
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.990
I used to think that.
I used to think that for many,
many years.
In fact,

42
00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:48.190
it was at war with myself for almost three decades.
I hated myself.

43
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.660
I hated my body.

44
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.260
I blamed my body for everything I didn't make the dance team in high school was

45
00:02:55.841 --> 00:03:00.100
my body's fault.
I Amanda and call me back whenever,
didn't call me back.

46
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:01.720
It was always me,
my body to blame.

47
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.160
And it didn't matter what size my body was because I used to be a triathlete.

48
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.460
I would run half marathons every other weekend.

49
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:12.490
I would participate in half iron man triathlons.

50
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.600
So I looked really healthy on the outside.
I looked really fit,

51
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.960
looked like I had it together.
I haven't always been an author.

52
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.980
I haven't always been talking to people and writing books.
In fact,

53
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.650
several years ago,
all through my twenties I was in corporate,

54
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.320
I was in advertising.
Anybody have friends in advertising,
especially here.
Right?

55
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.830
And I was climbing the corporate ladder,
living in Chicago,

56
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.450
and it looks like I had it all together.

57
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.020
I was dating a man who wanted to marry me and I was making a lot of money,

58
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:47.530
so much money.
I didn't even know what to do with it yet.
I was in a lot of debt,

59
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.800
so much debt,
wipe my sweat here.

60
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.690
And I got to a point where I said something's got to give.

61
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.170
Because on the outside it looked like I had everything.

62
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.310
But on the inside of his crying myself to sleep every single night I was

63
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.750
suffering from eating disorders.

64
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.660
And my doctor diagnosed me with clinical depression.

65
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.070
So it was actually a point in my life where we can't look and judge people and

66
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.440
say buy on the outside how they look,

67
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.530
because everyone's having their own internal experience.

68
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.790
And so I got to a place where I said,
you know what?
Something has to change.

69
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.530
And my inner voice.
I said,
depression,
why are you here?

70
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.650
What could you possibly teach me?
And my depression said,
follow your heart.

71
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.320
You're sad because you're not being true to yourself.

72
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.360
So I got up the courage to follow my heart,
which meant leaving advertising,

73
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.610
leaving Chicago and moving back to Portland,
Oregon,

74
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:50.611
where I grew up and finding my passion for writing and speaking and leading

75
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:51.694
retreats.

76
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.110
And through this process I started to write books and I found the most joyous

77
00:04:58.361 --> 00:04:59.500
activity in the world.

78
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:03.670
They found my life passion through writing and when I was promoting my first

79
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.820
book called find your happy,
which talks about how to be happy.

80
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.650
I was going on tour and I was getting ready to go on the morning television show

81
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:12.520
in Seattle.

82
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.840
And the night before I was in the hotel room and I was looking in the mirror and

83
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:23.710
I was crying because here I was going to go on TV and I was going to talk to

84
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:26.830
people about how to be happy because I had been much happier than I was.

85
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.190
I had worked through the addictions.
I had overcome the depression.

86
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.260
Here I was living my dream job,

87
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.310
but I couldn't say one good thing about myself.

88
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.340
I hated myself.
I said,

89
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.490
how happy can you be if you don't love yourself?

90
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.150
And that's where the self love experiment was born.

91
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.430
So this was several years ago.

92
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.940
But through the process I started to do research and excuse me,

93
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.270
what I discovered is that 90 of women hate their bodies,
ladies,

94
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.100
90% of us.

95
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.240
And I discovered that 95% of people absolutely want to change something about

96
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.050
themselves.
So just take a look at the room.
Almost all of us,

97
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.930
we have something we dislike and it gets worse.

98
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.931
Six out of 10 people actually opt out of important activities because of a flaw

99
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.790
or insecurity.
So this is actually controlling our life.

100
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.110
Okay?
So an insecurity blocks us from showing up.

101
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.280
And that's when I realized the self love experiment has to happen to save my

102
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:36.620
life because I was not living my life.

103
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.720
I was letting my insecurities hold me back and I was preventing myself from

104
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:42.920
living my potential.

105
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.840
And that's what I offer to you today to think about what is that problem,

106
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.771
the flaw,

107
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:53.771
the insecurity that you feel has been stopping you from moving forward.

108
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.840
Just take a moment.
I call it the almost paradise syndrome.

109
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.030
It's the,
when I lose the weight,
I'll be happier when I get the promotion,

110
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.650
when I moved to the city I really want to be in.
When I get that x,

111
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.150
Y,
Z,
then maybe my life can start.
But guess what?

112
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.310
Most of the time when we get that we realize we're still not happy.

113
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.860
I lost all the weight.
I still wasn't happy.
I got that dream job.

114
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.180
Something was missing.

115
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.840
And so at the core of every single thing we want in our life is empowerment,

116
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.350
self love.
So we chase it and we look for it outside of ourselves,

117
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.870
but really it's inside inside of ourselves.

118
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:40.880
So today I have a process I'm going to take you through,

119
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.300
but I first want to talk a little bit about what the self love experiment

120
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.440
actually is and how I got to learning how to love myself fully.

121
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.530
Because truly I stand her up here in front of you,
loving myself,

122
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:54.770
every fiber of my body.
Even though I sweat in front of people all the time,

123
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.660
it doesn't matter.
I'm sitting on the couch and I sweat.

124
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.340
And so it really becomes about showing up as you are,

125
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.030
no matter where you are and letting yourself be seen.

126
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.800
Let yourself be who you are.
So what is the self love experiment?

127
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:14.300
It had three goals.
Number one,
I wanted to lighten up.

128
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.620
How many of us want to lighten up right spiritually,
emotionally,
physically,

129
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:22.280
mentally.
I was taking life so serious.

130
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.970
I would go out to dinner or lunch with friends and I couldn't be present because

131
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:30.560
I was so focused on how the next bite I took would put me over my calorie limit.

132
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.030
My best friend called me and said,
I'm getting married.

133
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.150
I want you to be in the wedding.
And my first thought,

134
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.130
this is before the self love experiment was not,
I'm so excited for you.
Yes,

135
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:45.620
I can't wait to be in the wedding.
It was holy crap.

136
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:49.310
Do I have enough time to lose the weight?
And I wasn't overweight at all.
Then.

137
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.660
So we have these things about ourselves and really the war that's happening is

138
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:58.110
inside our head.
The inner critic is driving us and that's why this book is out.

139
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:00.030
And that's why I did the self love experiment.

140
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.460
So just as I take you through the process,

141
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.730
think about where your insecurities have been blocking you.

142
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.140
What flaw do you wake up in the morning and focus on because this process,

143
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:10.920
we'll reverse it.

144
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.810
This process we'll let you be who you are in a world that tries to tell you to

145
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:20.250
change because the world is going to keep saying be smarter,
richer,
prettier,

146
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:23.250
thinner,
go chase,
whatever.

147
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.200
But the real magic of the self love experiment and also being alive is to say,

148
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:29.034
guess what?

149
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.270
I'm not going to subscribe to that anymore because that's where our anxiety

150
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:36.540
comes from.
It's where the depression and the addictions come from.

151
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.520
I was able to heal my depression and my eating disorders and find my life

152
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:44.550
purpose and passion by discovering self love.

153
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.960
So the second part and the second goal of myself I've experiment was to say only

154
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:53.820
nice things about myself.
Can I look in the mirror and say kind things?

155
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.710
Yes,
it's possible.
What do you say to yourself when you look in the mirror?

156
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.560
Let's turn it into a kind conversation.
And then the third,

157
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.020
the third goal was to see myself the way my dog does.
Any dog lovers,

158
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.520
animal lovers,
cats.

159
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.780
Do you ever notice how they see you and you're the most amazing thing in the

160
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.600
world?
I want it to be the coolest,
most beautiful,

161
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:21.780
awesome person in the world because they don't judge you,

162
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.940
they love you no matter what.

163
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.510
That's really the ultimate expression of the self love experiment.

164
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:32.400
And those goals are realized through the process.
So you have to,

165
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:36.060
and I had to realize that I have to treat it like an experiment.

166
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.250
So like a scientist,
right?
You go into it,
you have some type of goal.

167
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:44.970
But really it's the process.
Each experiment that you do,

168
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.100
each thing you try is going to move you one step closer to possibly what it is

169
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:54.030
you want.
So instead of putting the expectation on each thing you do,
you say,

170
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:57.030
guess what?
I learned from this.
Now I'm going to try something else.

171
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.950
So the experiment is actually what I think we should try to do for our life.

172
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.910
What if we looked at our life as an experiment and we took off the expectations

173
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.350
and we stopped saying,
I have to do this to get here.
I should do this.

174
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.210
So much pressure we put on ourselves.

175
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.740
So the experiment is super important and I encourage you guys to look at how you

176
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:19.020
can take,
take your weekend going into the weekend and say,

177
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:20.370
I'm going to make this an experiment.

178
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.460
What am I going to do that's going to be more fun,
more playful,

179
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.620
and I'll be in the process.
So about three months into my self love experiment,

180
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.090
I started to say,
okay,
this is working.
I'm feeling good about myself.

181
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.360
But not all the time.
It was kind of fleeting,
right?

182
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.610
So I was at my mom's house and you guys know the coloring books where you can

183
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:45.840
color,
they were really popular a few years ago.
They might still be popular.

184
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.760
And mine had a mantra on it that said everything happens for a reason and had

185
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:54.820
butterflies and flowers and I didn't know that that was a universal sign right

186
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:58.750
there.
But I was coloring and I was talking in my mom and I,

187
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.180
one of my best friends talking about our dreams and goals.

188
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.260
About three months into myself,
love experiment I,

189
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.860
and she started to bring up conversation about some friends of ours that were

190
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.930
getting married and it triggered something in me.

191
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.610
It didn't even matter who they were.

192
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.920
I started to cry a woman in her mid thirties very successful in her career.

193
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.140
It looks again like she has happiness,

194
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.540
which I was happy to talk about that in a second,

195
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.970
how to not chase the happiness and I was crying and she said,

196
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:32.530
why are you crying?
What's the matter?
She put her pencil down and I said,
mom,

197
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.760
do you think anyone can love me the way that I am?

198
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.860
And that was right there.
The core of my biggest limiting belief,

199
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.810
I felt unlovable.

200
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.890
What I was really asking and I didn't know at the time was,

201
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:51.010
do you think I can love myself the way that I am?

202
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.320
And of course she put her pencil down right away and she said,

203
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:54.970
she it don't ever say that about yourself.

204
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:58.330
Of course the mother would never want to hear that

205
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.080
in the next thing she said is was the most important thing that really kicked in

206
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:09.520
the self love experiment and change my life forever.
She said,
Shannon,

207
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:15.210
the most important thing is that you're happy and if you're not happy at this

208
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:19.170
body size,
then maybe this isn't the size for you.
Now,

209
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.620
she meant this with so much love and compassion and this is what we hear a lot.

210
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.450
I grew up with this,
but in that moment I rejected that because I said,

211
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:29.320
no,

212
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.210
that's not the answer because for my whole life I've tried to change myself to

213
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:35.050
be happy.

214
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.220
Whether it was 40 pounds underweight or 60 70 pounds overweight,

215
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.980
the problem is not outside of me.

216
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.990
So in her saying that I decided I'm going to stop asking everyone else and I'm

217
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:49.210
going to go inward and start to trust myself.

218
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.270
And that was the most revolutionary thing that I could do.

219
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:53.260
Because I was also saying,

220
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:57.370
guess what society that says I should be smaller or I can't be happy until I

221
00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.930
have this amount of money in the bank.
Or I'm with my soul mate,

222
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.650
a woman who was single in her mid thirties what's wrong with her?

223
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:07.060
All these things we say to ourselves.
But in that moment I said,
nope.

224
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.020
The goal is for me to learn how to love myself as I am.

225
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.810
And that is what the self love experiment is.

226
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.900
Because we all have things we want to change about ourselves.

227
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.740
But learning how to love yourself does not have to mean you have to change

228
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:24.140
yourself from a place of self hate.
It means you can take pro,

229
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.930
take steps to move forward and be more kind and compassionate with yourself from

230
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:31.840
a loving place.
So that was really the key.

231
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.680
And so it is not outside of ourselves.
The answer is really on the inside.

232
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.460
And so how did I get to hear today from crying on my mom's living room and

233
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:46.780
crying in the bathroom,

234
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.890
I did a self love experiment and it was the most glorious thing I've ever done

235
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.660
as a writer.
It turned into a book.

236
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.090
I didn't know it was going to be a book when I started at,

237
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.020
but this book healed me because I found self love.

238
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.050
I stand up here loving every single fiber of my body and showing up as I am.

239
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:09.230
And that is the key for all of you to show up through your insecurities,

240
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.740
to show up through the things you think you need to change because you are

241
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:15.710
enough as you are.
So I have a process,

242
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:18.980
three things that I'm going to share with you and then we'll kind of do a Q and

243
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:23.330
a and a that's,
that's how we'll go.
So there's actually,

244
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:28.010
the book is actually divided in different layers because there's layers to self

245
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:32.990
love.
So I take people through a process.
The first layer is self care.

246
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.300
Okay?
When you guys hear self care,

247
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:39.980
a lot of times in the wellness industry especially we hear drink your green

248
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.820
juice,
doing your yoga,
go to soul cycle,
which is really fun by the way.

249
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:44.654
I just did it.

250
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:50.030
So we get so wrapped up in having to be,

251
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:52.400
and do we stay in this box,
right?

252
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.150
The wellness community and just being taking care of yourself.

253
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.540
I got to a point where I realized I am sick of Yoga.

254
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.780
I don't want any more 30 day hot challenge yoga challenges.
I'm done with it.

255
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.130
I don't want any more Kale Salad.
And I said,

256
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:11.570
what does self care really mean?
And I discovered it's about joy.

257
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.820
What brings you joy?

258
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.410
And that is why also when I said a lot of us are chasing happiness,

259
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.550
we never really get there because happiness isn't is a feeling.

260
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.900
It's something that we'll elude us.
Whereas joy is an experience.

261
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.110
It's a PR,
it's a process,
but it's a way of living.

262
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.600
So I truly believe that joy is the best barometer for success in any layer,

263
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:39.290
in any level of your life.
Whether it's a relationship,
whether it's a career,

264
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:43.400
whether it's trying to reach your goal of losing weight or going on your dream

265
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:44.990
vacation,
joy.

266
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.590
So how can you put more joy into your life right now?

267
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.250
So I started to do that and I realized I wanted more nature walks with my dog.

268
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.420
I wanted to join a spinning studio instead of to do in the yoga.

269
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.900
And so I started to fill myself up.
I started to cook more,

270
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:04.370
I started to do things that felt good and made me feel alive.
So ask yourself,

271
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:06.560
what makes you feel alive?

272
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.510
That's the most caring thing you can do for yourself.
If you love camping,

273
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:14.990
get out and go camping.
If you love animals,
go adopt a pet.

274
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.940
You know there's things we can do to bring more joy into our life right now.

275
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.300
So that's one part of the process.

276
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:27.050
But I'm going to share three of the principals that really stand out that I

277
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:29.060
think can help you guys in your own life as well.

278
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.270
And at the back of the book there's 15 principals.

279
00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:33.800
So I'm pulling out the highlighted ones.

280
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.930
So I think we have to first ask ourselves,

281
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.330
how do you know when you're lacking self love?

282
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.080
Because I didn't know that I didn't love myself.

283
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.290
I just knew that my experience of life was difficult.

284
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.400
A lot of times we don't walk around saying I don't love myself.

285
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.330
It's in our actions.
It's in our behavior.
It's in the way.

286
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:56.880
We're always trying for something more than what is.

287
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.590
And so anybody wonder like throw out.
Why do you think,

288
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.590
what would be an example of when we don't love ourselves?

289
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.260
Rejection.
Yeah.
When we feel rejection.
So good.

290
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.280
One of the main ones is when we compare ourselves to other people

291
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.940
and I get,
I bet if we get really honest with ourselves,

292
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:24.180
we've probably compared ourselves to someone else within the past three or four

293
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:27.000
days.
Right?
Especially at work.

294
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.900
And then also when we compare ourselves to our self.

295
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.990
You may have had a different version of you five years ago,

296
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:36.660
a skinny are you one who was in a different job or when,

297
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:38.820
who was in a different relationship.
And like,
man,

298
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:41.640
if only I could go back or maybe not go back,
but what happened?

299
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.540
Or we look to the future part of us and we're like,
gosh,
that person out there,

300
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:50.280
I'm not there yet.
And not in the body I want or the career,
whatever it may be.

301
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.710
So we compare ourselves to other people,

302
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:55.500
but we also compare ourselves to ourselves.
And this is detrimental,

303
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.230
but it's part of being human.
You cannot get out of it.

304
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.160
And so I'm going to share a process with you to help you if you fall into

305
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:06.960
comparison because judgment and comparison keeps us from love.

306
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.600
Judging is a form of fear.

307
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:15.350
It's a form of lack that I'm not enough and what that person has is better and

308
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:17.460
they're deserving and I'm not.

309
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:19.980
And we go into this cycle where we spin out of control.

310
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.490
Now the trick and the goal with the self love experiment is to give you guys

311
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:27.270
tools,
lots of tools to help you feel empowered in your life.

312
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.970
And one of the tools is to work through judgements.

313
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.270
And I actually have a three part process that I'll share with you right now.

314
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:36.930
Number one is to recognize when you're comparing yourself to other people,

315
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.060
they are just showing you what is possible.
So for example,
I'm a book author,

316
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.340
I have a book,
obviously that just came out,

317
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.210
but in September there's amazing books coming out too from some of my favorite

318
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:50.910
authors who have been writing for much longer,

319
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.460
meet amazing people and their books are already like number one and then they

320
00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:00.360
haven't even come out.
So my mind is like,
oh my gosh,

321
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:03.330
I just read this book and these people have a book coming out in a month.

322
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:06.450
What's happening?
They're doing better.
And I fall into,
oh no,

323
00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:07.800
before my self love experiment,

324
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.510
I would have carried that energy all through my tour.
I would have,
you know,

325
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:16.350
showed up and been like gone to bed each night feeling not enough.
Right.

326
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.940
But the self love experiment gave me the process of saying,
Oh yes,

327
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.580
they're showing me what's possible.
Thank you.

328
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.240
I can have that because if we didn't compare ourselves,

329
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.300
there's so many things going on in the world.

330
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.740
We don't compare ourselves to everyone.

331
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.800
The ones we compare ourselves to are usually the ones that show us something

332
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:38.940
within us that we want,
which means it's already within us to have.

333
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.560
It's just about becoming who you need to be to get to where you to to receive

334
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:47.590
that and so to recognize,
thank you.
You're showing me what's possible.

335
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.200
I see this can be an option for my life if I want it.

336
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.470
And then number two is to immediately go into appreciation,

337
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.830
appreciation for your own life.

338
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.250
So I turned my attention right away too.
Oh my gosh.
I just,

339
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.910
I wrote a book and I get to go travel all over the country and I get to just

340
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:05.740
celebrate self love.
How awesome.

341
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.640
Also celebrate the people who are showing up for you.

342
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.940
Appreciate the things that are going well in your life because if we keep

343
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:17.440
focusing on what's not going well,
we stay stuck.
We stay in lack.

344
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.850
So I want you to take a moment right now to just think about what you are

345
00:21:21.851 --> 00:21:24.940
appreciative of and give thanks just for a moment.

346
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.680
I won't ask you to share this time.

347
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

348
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:40.350
<v 1>So this practice of appreciation is one of the best and fastest ways to move</v>

349
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.254
forward.

350
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:46.530
I helped heal my depression when I was in corporate hating my job,

351
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.830
hating my life by first very first step,
turning to appreciation.

352
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.690
So if we ever felt trapped by life,
circumstances and victimized by the world,

353
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.660
then we can go to what can I be appreciative?
I have?

354
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:00.310
What can I be thankful for right now?

355
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.200
And then from that place you can step forward.
It's a much more loving energy.

356
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.470
So I did the same thing with the things I hated about myself.

357
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.360
How can I appreciate my overweight belly or my chin or with all of the things

358
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:16.870
that we say we don't like about ourselves?
And if you can't get there,

359
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.300
then focus on the things you do appreciate about yourself.

360
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.690
You might love your nose or your hair or the way your positive and happy or the

361
00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:29.710
way you're trying to be positive and show up for yourself one step at a time.

362
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.850
So it's about one step at a time,
which is the process and they experiment.

363
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.570
And then the third,
if you're in comparison,

364
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.090
is to stand by you.

365
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.520
And what I mean by this is to give yourself what it is you really need and want.

366
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.940
So in this experience of comparing myself to other authors,

367
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:52.990
I recognized what I really wanted,
which was appreciation.

368
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.070
I had a book come out,
I wanted recognition,
I wanted love.

369
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.240
So the magic is to give that to yourself.

370
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.330
Here I was right before I started my book tour,

371
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.810
seeing all these other authors trending all over on the New York Times list,

372
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:10.390
all this stuff.
And I said,
wow,

373
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.300
I haven't even given myself appreciation.

374
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.010
I haven't even shown myself love because I've been so busy the past couple of

375
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.740
weeks.
So give yourself what it is you need.

376
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.840
And all of a sudden you will feel more empowered.
What I needed was recognition.

377
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:30.250
So I said,
Shannon,
you wrote a book.
I hadn't told myself that at all.

378
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.620
So what can you recognize yourself for?

379
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.090
What can you celebrate yourself for?
What can you lift yourself up for?

380
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.350
One step at a time?

381
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.450
Starts up here and then the very next day my agent talked to me and I looked at

382
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:48.110
the numbers and I saw that my book,

383
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:51.680
the self over experiment was trending on Amazon.
Number one in self esteem.

384
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.220
And I say this only because I believe this process works.

385
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.210
When you show up for yourself and get out of what's going on out there and

386
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:03.140
returned to inside your an empowered person moving forward,

387
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:08.410
you have the power to control the outcome by being in the space of love and

388
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.700
compassion for yourself.
And so the second one,

389
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.760
actually there's a principal I'll share with you for this,
the it's number one,

390
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:19.460
the principle number one is to accept where you are.

391
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.270
It's just a point in your journey and everything about the,

392
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.710
everything about it offers possibility for growth and expansion.

393
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.130
So when it looks like comparing yourself to others,

394
00:24:31.131 --> 00:24:35.810
recognize where you are accepted and then from that place you can move forward

395
00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:38.000
in that place,
you'll feel more charged up.

396
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.910
So what can you accept in your life right now?

397
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.480
There's that famous Chinese proverb except what you can't change.

398
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:45.860
Change what you can accept.

399
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.890
It really does start with acceptance.
Okay,

400
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.250
so the second one I'll share with you today.
This is the barrier that blocks us.

401
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:56.960
And when we know we're out of self love,

402
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:02.410
it's when we feel hopeless or we feel like self love is selfish or we feel like,

403
00:25:03.471 --> 00:25:06.590
how dare I care about myself?
So here's the thing,

404
00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:11.480
there's so much going on in the world right now.
Disasters,
political uproar,

405
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.670
there's a lot of fear.

406
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.730
Terrorists like it's crazy out there.

407
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:22.570
And we can easily fall into feeling depressed and feeling hopeless.

408
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:26.360
And I did this about two months before my book was coming out.
There was so much,

409
00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:29.750
I was watching the news every day,
which I suggest you don't do.
It was crazy.

410
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.170
I know we're in New York,
but like,
ah,
it was crazy.
And I said,
how?

411
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:39.350
Who am I to go talk about self love.
I have a book about loving yourself,
how,

412
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.730
how dare anyone focus on them when there's the world that needs saving.

413
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:49.100
And I caught myself right away because I said something that actually helped me

414
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:54.101
in my own self love experiment is that suddenly it made sense to stop hating

415
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:59.870
myself is to raise the vibration on the planet,

416
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.510
to stop being negative to myself is to actually do my part,

417
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:09.710
to uplift the entire world.
Because that's one less person hurting.

418
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:14.390
That's one less person in pain and that's one less person stuck in negativity.

419
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.200
So we owe it to ourselves to show up for ourselves because from that place we

420
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:24.020
can do so much more good.
We can give more time,
more energy,

421
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:28.700
more love to those who need it.
And that was a revolutionary change for me.

422
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.940
And it turned into a principal in the self love experiment,

423
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.620
which is when you heal yourself,
you help to heal the world,

424
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.760
you can make the most profound difference in the world by focusing on yourself

425
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:45.750
first,
to forgive yourself,

426
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.170
to honor yourself and love yourself from that place.

427
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.930
You make really empowered choices.
Guess what?

428
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.480
Hurt people hurt people.

429
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.910
People who are in pain affect other people.
When I was depressed,

430
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:01.230
I wanted to help people.

431
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.910
I'm starting my life coaching practice and it's hard to show up fully when

432
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:08.640
you're stuck in your stuckness.
You just can't.

433
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.270
We do it because we have big hearts.
All of us in here have huge hearts.

434
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:15.240
You wouldn't be in a self love experiment lunch if you didn't have a big heart.

435
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:20.370
And so we show up and we say,
you know what?
I want to be even more empowered.

436
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:24.030
And we do that by first being kind and compassionate to ourselves.

437
00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:26.280
So I want to invite you guys to ask yourself,

438
00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:30.960
where have you been blowing yourself off?
Where have you been saying this?

439
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.080
This deserves more attention.
I'm not going to show up for me,

440
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.880
this is more important.
I will skip that thing.
That is really important to me.

441
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.010
My dreams don't matter.
I'll just wait.

442
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.660
Just ask yourself and maybe go into the weekend thinking about how can I show up

443
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:46.590
for myself more?

444
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.980
How can I be more present in my life and put more love into the equation right

445
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:56.220
now.
So I'm gonna move into the third reason.

446
00:27:56.221 --> 00:28:00.900
A lot of us actually do not feel self love without even realizing it.

447
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.610
Anyone want to guess?

448
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.070
No guesses.
I'll just share self doubt and fear,
right?

449
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.440
When we're in self doubt and what this looks like is we believe our insecurities

450
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.250
are real.

451
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.590
We believe the problems about us are actually the problems.

452
00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:25.110
So Tony Robbins,
you guys know Tony Robbins,
America's life coach,

453
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:30.090
huge motivational speaker.
That's what he calls himself.
He says,

454
00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:34.170
problems need energy to grow.
If you do not give your problems energy,

455
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.550
then guess what?
They won't.

456
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.150
They won't manifest bigger and take up so much time and space in our life.

457
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.760
What problem are you focusing on?
Now?

458
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:45.360
There's a difference between a problem that you look for the solution,
right?

459
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:47.400
And your work,
especially with what you guys do here.

460
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.840
There's a part of showing up,

461
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.700
but going immediately to the solution is the key instead of festering in the

462
00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:55.530
problem and letting it overcome you.

463
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:01.260
So the problems that we have in our life,
the insecurities we have,

464
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:04.680
the fears we have often look like self doubt.

465
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.590
I don't feel good enough.
I don't feel worthy enough for me.

466
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:10.470
I didn't feel lovable.
And so ask yourself,

467
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:14.070
what self doubt in your life is blocking you from moving forward?

468
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.830
So self doubt.
Here's the thing about it,
it shows up in every layer of our life.

469
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:23.850
So I am up here and I truly do love myself and I'm excited about the

470
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:25.980
possibilities.
But self doubt,

471
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:30.960
a couple of weeks ago before I left for my tour came roaring in a lot of what

472
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:34.680
was going on in the world,
right?
And I sat there for a moment,
I said,

473
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.700
what's going on?
This is like crippling self doubt.

474
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.060
And for a couple minutes I sat there before myself.
Love experiment.

475
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:45.010
I would have let it control my outcome.

476
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.180
I may have even been canceled some events I may have just like hindered in my

477
00:29:49.181 --> 00:29:51.370
bed and cover it up or eaten lots ice cream.

478
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.240
Like all these things we do over work,
over spend,
overeat over,

479
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:58.060
exercise we over the situation.

480
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.600
I invite you guys to feel what comes up.

481
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.620
So I sat there with my self doubt and I'm gonna invite you guys to do this,

482
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:09.490
to put your hand on your heart.
If you want the right hand,

483
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:14.140
anytime you feel self doubt,
just return to yourself in the moment.

484
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.730
Put your hand here and you say hello.
Hello you right.

485
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:23.350
And you can say,
what do you here to show me the same.

486
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.140
The same way that I asked my depression,
what are you here to show me?

487
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.030
And myself doubt came through and it said,
are you sure?

488
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.720
Are you sure you don't want to stay small?

489
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:40.650
Because self doubt wants us to stay small fear and our negative voice wants us

490
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:45.220
to retreat back to what is comfortable and what we know.
It's predictable,

491
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:48.100
it's manageable,
it's something we know.

492
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.190
Whereas anytime you're growing,

493
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.870
anytime you're dreaming and anytime you're stepping into the next level of your

494
00:30:55.871 --> 00:30:58.480
life,
your self doubt,
we'll get louder.

495
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:04.180
And I said in that moment with my hand on my heart quickly and it said,

496
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:09.040
are you sure you want to stay small?
And my heart roared through and said,

497
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:11.920
are you kidding?
You were born for this.

498
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.810
Every single one of you was born for this,

499
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.970
to work through that self doubt,

500
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:23.350
to step forward and be empowered and choose you.

501
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.620
Your life is your masterpiece.
We've hear this,
right?

502
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:34.450
We hear this,
but I want you to really feel this.
Anytime you fall into fear,

503
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.680
insecurity,
self,
lack of self worth,
or I'm not good enough,
or gosh,

504
00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:41.650
that person has what I want returned to right here.

505
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.100
Put your hand on your heart.
Say I love me,

506
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.360
or I'm doing the best I can each day and that is enough.

507
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.030
One step at a time we can get there.

508
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.810
And so what I offered to you guys with this principle,

509
00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.360
the self love experiment,
principle number three is we get what we focus on.

510
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.690
So are you focusing on how it's not going to work?

511
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.720
How everything you've tried before is not moving forward?

512
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.810
Then that's going to keep creating what we want.

513
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.450
Are you focusing on the problem it's growing?

514
00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:18.120
Take your attention off of it and focus on what you truly want.
Love,
empowerment,

515
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.640
acceptance.
And you'll start to see the results in your life much more clear.

516
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:26.500
So I'm going to offer to you guys as we close out the little speech here,

517
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.570
my wish for you is that next time someone asks you,
who empowers you,

518
00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:33.280
you immediately say,
you know what?

519
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.630
I'm empowered by me and I'm,

520
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.750
I'm not shy from that and I'm not unapologetic because you guys are amazing.

521
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:46.160
You work really hard and you show up every day and you're doing the best you
can.

522
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.050
So start telling yourself that.

523
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.470
Start to really feel that because that's how we can move and help and change the

524
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:54.800
world.
I believe that.

525
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:58.370
So I welcome you and invite you to dive into the self love experiment.

526
00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.183
<v 3>That's it.</v>

527
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.550
<v 4>I like it.
She's like,
ah,</v>

528
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.350
<v 3>that was fantastic.
Shannon,
thank you so much for being here.</v>

529
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.520
Like what a great speech.
What a great book by the way,

530
00:33:12.521 --> 00:33:16.240
if you guys haven't read it to yourself a favor.
Um,

531
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.520
we talked a lot about the inner critic.
Um,
I think that we can all relay,

532
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.730
especially being here.
Um,

533
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.570
we're very much sometimes under a lot of pressure and there's a lot of,
um,

534
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.440
a lot of production I think that needs to happen.
Um,

535
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.270
and you also talk a little bit about how in her,
in her credit,

536
00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:39.040
especially for you led to a lot of self sabotage and,
and,
and so on and sober.

537
00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:39.311
How,

538
00:33:39.311 --> 00:33:44.311
how do you think that we just in general as a culture or even yourself lead or

539
00:33:44.801 --> 00:33:46.870
just sort of,
uh,

540
00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:50.350
experienced self sabotage and how does that coming through in our lives?

541
00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.530
<v 1>I think,
yeah.
So self sabotage happens in so many ways,
right?</v>

542
00:33:55.531 --> 00:33:59.520
It happens by us shying away from what we really want.
Right?
Like,

543
00:33:59.521 --> 00:34:02.610
like I've mentioned a couple of times,
I'm just a sweaty person.
Like I could not,

544
00:34:02.611 --> 00:34:05.970
I could have chosen not to be a public speaker,
right?

545
00:34:05.971 --> 00:34:09.180
But I'm so passionate about my message that I let that I,
it just,

546
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.170
it is what it is.

547
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.390
So you get to a point where you accept what is and when we shy away from what it

548
00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:20.070
is we really want because of a part of us that we feel isn't good enough,

549
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:23.670
it's really us not honoring our living,
our potential.

550
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:27.900
And so it also looks like overspending,
like I said,
over eating over,

551
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.711
over anything.

552
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:31.500
Because a lot of times we're afraid to feel that what's really there.

553
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.650
So I would ask also sometimes when we wake up in the morning,

554
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.020
what do you say to yourself about yourself?

555
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.440
If you don't do as good in the meeting or if you don't,
you know,

556
00:34:40.441 --> 00:34:44.400
you go home and you didn't get everything on your list on how are you talking to

557
00:34:44.401 --> 00:34:44.790
yourself?

558
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:49.790
So I think it does come back to being a friend to yourself first and foremost,

559
00:34:49.861 --> 00:34:50.640
and that's how we can stop

560
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.600
<v 3>forward.
Excellent.
Yeah,
you stay,</v>

561
00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.460
and I'm going to read a quote from the book.

562
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.010
Learning how to love me has been the most difficult thing I've ever had to do.
A,

563
00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.980
not because loving yourself as particular harbor because I had to unlearn all

564
00:35:04.981 --> 00:35:07.620
the things I was conditioned to believe about self love.

565
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.790
I think it goes back to what you were saying earlier about narcissism or sort

566
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.820
that be able sometimes when you think that self love is sort of is a little self

567
00:35:15.841 --> 00:35:20.720
righteous.
How are those green,
uh,
how those beliefs sort of ingrained,
uh,

568
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.790
and,
and how does that reflect on what self love or self,

569
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:26.130
what self care means for us?
Right.
Yeah.

570
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.720
<v 1>And I think that's key.
Um,</v>

571
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:32.610
it's like so many of us are kind of like chasing the,

572
00:35:32.611 --> 00:35:36.650
let me see that this one,
right?
Yeah.
So in the we're,

573
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.560
we're this feeling,
right?
And that's really what I was talking about in the book.

574
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.630
Learning how to love myself was hard because if your parents didn't love

575
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:48.120
yourself,
they did the best they could.
Right.

576
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.080
If society and the media is always telling us to change ourselves,

577
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.570
everyone's just doing what they know how to do.

578
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:59.070
But I had to unlearn all of that from a very young age.
We're taught,

579
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:02.220
we have to look a certain way,
be a certain way,
talk a certain way,
right.

580
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:03.660
In our family or in society.

581
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.080
And so self love is often about being who you are as you are.

582
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.690
And that is the most self love is freedom.

583
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.860
Well we're chasing what we really want is freedom in that happiness,

584
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:21.210
in that paradise,
in that job,
in that more money,
in that soul mate relationship.

585
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:25.710
What we really want is to be seen for who we are.
So for me personally,

586
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:30.600
I was just so much of my life I was trying to be seen.
I was like looking,

587
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:34.200
I was like,
you know,
comparing myself,
see me,
see me,
but I wasn't seeing myself.

588
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.880
And so I think we have to really allow ourselves to be honest about who we are

589
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:39.930
and celebrate who we are.

590
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.853
<v 5>Excellent.</v>

591
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.760
<v 1>Um,
do you regret your earlier life of a drug addiction or eating disorders or</v>

592
00:36:46.761 --> 00:36:49.310
depression?
That's a good question.
It's a heavy question,

593
00:36:49.311 --> 00:36:52.710
but your question for work environment,
but you know,
uh,

594
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.720
I don't regret any phase of my life at all.
In fact,
I'm so thankful for it.

595
00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.230
While I was in it,
it was very hard and very depressing and dark.

596
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.980
But I think we all have phases in our life that are hard,
depressing,
and dark.

597
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.760
And when we can be aware while we're in it say that this is part of maybe

598
00:37:07.761 --> 00:37:09.800
something bigger is looking back,

599
00:37:09.801 --> 00:37:12.890
I wouldn't be able to write a book about self love if I didn't hate myself.

600
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:17.090
I wouldn't be able to do what I love if I didn't experience those.

601
00:37:17.091 --> 00:37:21.200
So I think it's really about allowing yourself to go through each phase of life.

602
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.853
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

603
00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.560
<v 1>Does anybody want to ask any questions from the audience Q and a time about</v>

604
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.160
anything in the world?
Anything.
What are your plans for the weekend?

605
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.790
How are you doing?
Joy?
Yeah.

606
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.260
<v 5>Oh Hi.
My name is Pankaj Makati.</v>

607
00:37:39.261 --> 00:37:43.550
Thank you so much for sharing your self love experience.
So the question is,

608
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:48.250
you said,
uh,
accept yourself as you are,
but uh,

609
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.350
to improve in anything you do or as a person,

610
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:56.360
you need to constantly analyze yourself or act your own critique.
Yes.

611
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.660
That too.
How do you improve?
So how do you balance both the things?

612
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:03.980
<v 1>Such a great question.
I'm so glad you asked that because I think what the,</v>

613
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.740
what we have to ask yourself is where is our point of attraction?

614
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:10.400
So from before I was like trying to reach that number on the scale or we're

615
00:38:10.401 --> 00:38:14.180
trying to improve ourselves from a place of self hate or desperation or I'm not

616
00:38:14.181 --> 00:38:18.740
good enough.
But once I found self love and when you're in an empowered place,

617
00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.100
that means you can make the changes from an empowered place.

618
00:38:22.101 --> 00:38:25.730
It doesn't mean we just settle.
It doesn't mean we just say,
oh forget it.

619
00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.850
I'm a healthier and happier than I've ever been today and making the best

620
00:38:28.851 --> 00:38:32.570
choices for me.
Even though society may say an overweight person,
you know,

621
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.310
doesn't isn't that way.
So for you and anyone who trying to improve,

622
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.510
it's about saying,

623
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:41.950
I'm going to do this because I love myself and I care about myself and I'm going

624
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:46.950
to honor myself and then watch your results come a lot faster.
So,

625
00:38:46.951 --> 00:38:47.381
in essence,

626
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:51.250
what you're saying is anything that you do should be in order driven and not

627
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.290
externally driven.
Somebody has.
Sure,
absolutely.
Yeah.

628
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.930
And I get that we have bosses that need stuff from us.
Right.
So you guys,

629
00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:03.460
I'll walk out.
You're like,
shit,
that's the,
we don't have to,
don't do that.

630
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.010
No,
but I believe that the internal,

631
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.340
the reason we feel this anxiety and this pain and we go home feeling like

632
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:11.920
something's missing is because we're still looking out there.

633
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.580
Once we turn inward and there's a process I take people through in the book to

634
00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:19.170
really align,
then yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Yeah.

635
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.530
Thank you for the question.
I feel like we should clap

636
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.250
just for standing up.
That takes courage.
Any other questions?

637
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.910
Hello?
Hi.
Thank you.
You did great.
Thank you.
Um,
so my question is,

638
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.370
um,
as a child,
like what,

639
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.850
what did you see around you that made you start to

640
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.820
lack that confidence?
Right?

641
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:45.760
Like what were the reinforcements and know if it's not too personal,

642
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.400
sometimes we pick up things as children.

643
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:51.370
I know you talked a little bit about like rejection from the basketball team,

644
00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:56.040
but like at home,
like what was your family not um,

645
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.020
encouraging you,
your siblings,
your aunts,
your uncles?

646
00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:02.200
And I asked that because I know that that's been like an experience for me where

647
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:05.470
it's like I don't,
I didn't get that love reinforcement at home.

648
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:10.210
And then I found out later,
well the last few years it dawned on me like,

649
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.160
yeah,
my mom didn't have it.
Her parents weren't around on,
they'll have it.

650
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.830
Her parents weren't around,
you know?
So I think it's a beautiful question.

651
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.580
Absolutely.
And actually in the book I talk about it.
Yeah.
If you want,

652
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.790
I talk about it too because there's a principle in the book.

653
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.470
In order to find self love,

654
00:40:26.471 --> 00:40:30.160
we have to be who we needed to be when we were younger because for all of us
men,

655
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.360
to answer this in a layered way,

656
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:35.590
if we get really clear and honest with ourselves from age like maybe seven to

657
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:40.000
nine,
usually something happens.
Something happens in every person's life.

658
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.450
Where we are ourself,
we do what we feel is natural.

659
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:47.920
But the world tells us that's wrong.
So for me,
I really love ice cream.

660
00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:49.090
I loved it as a kid.

661
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.500
It was fun and it was part of how I related to my dad cause he loves sweet
stuff.

662
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:57.070
But my mom would say,
no,
don't eat the ice cream.
Like really bad.

663
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:58.420
And so I saw the way she looked at me,

664
00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:01.060
I saw the way she treated me when I did what it felt natural.

665
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:05.350
Like I'm just talking about food,
but there's other situations in our life.
Um,

666
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:06.880
and I shied away.

667
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:10.390
So it turned into an eating disorder at a very young age where I'd have to hide

668
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.450
something that felt natural.
Now if she would've said,
okay,

669
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:15.700
maybe you can have a couple bites or something,

670
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.210
then maybe I want to turn it into me feeling bad about doing what I want.

671
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.440
So instead of blaming our parents,
right,
they do the best they could.

672
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.260
We as adults still feel like there's a piece of us now there could it,

673
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.540
maybe it wasn't eating for you,

674
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:32.320
but maybe you want it to be a dancer and your parents wanted you to be an

675
00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:34.610
athlete or maybe you want to be an artist.

676
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:39.440
Like the all these things that we shy away from.
So the point is as an adult,

677
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.220
give yourself what you needed as a child that was missing.

678
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.650
And there's a process I take you through in the book as well,

679
00:41:45.651 --> 00:41:50.420
which is really healing because I realized I had a great childhood,
very loving,

680
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.480
but I was bullied because I was the new kid all the time and I would eat and you

681
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:59.630
know,
overweight child.
So wherever you were,
go back to your childhood,

682
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.390
go back to that point where you first realized,
oh my gosh,

683
00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:05.390
I was just being me in the world,
said I got made fun of for being me.

684
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:06.740
Or you know,

685
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.120
and then give yourself as an adult that love that respect and attention and then

686
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:14.840
forgive your parents because they do the best they can and they don't even know

687
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.760
better.
And we can do better for us.
Thank you.
Good question that answer it.

688
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.670
Any other questions?
Can you give a bad answer?
I get dry.

689
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.450
<v 3>Um,
I just have one,
one more question.
Um,</v>

690
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.630
you talked a lot about the tools and I love what you actually just added more

691
00:42:36.631 --> 00:42:39.330
tools on to what you already talked about.

692
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:43.250
What are your favorite tools when it comes to self love or self care?
Yeah,

693
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.060
<v 1>that's beautiful.
So I like the hand on the heart,
which I shared with you guys,</v>

694
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.650
but actually one of the beautiful things about the book is I am really big

695
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:55.280
believer on asking yourself questions and then giving your tie yourself time to

696
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:55.641
answer.

697
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:59.480
So I've put all the questions I asked in the book in the back in like a format

698
00:42:59.481 --> 00:43:01.700
so you could do a joy journal or free ride on it.

699
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.120
But one of my favorite favorites,
his letters to yourself.

700
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:09.440
So letters to your future self.
When I was stuck in depression,

701
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:12.230
I had no idea that there was such thing as a happy life.

702
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:16.490
Someone who enjoyed their career.
And I was like,
Dear Future Shannon,

703
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.020
what message do you have for me?

704
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.990
And so I encourage you guys to the one who has it figured out,

705
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:24.830
the one who is not suffering.
And then there's also a letter to her past self.

706
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.310
So now I write a letter to the one who was depressed and stuck and like,
oh,

707
00:43:28.311 --> 00:43:31.520
it's gonna work out.
Just stay with it like don't give up.

708
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.440
Or the most challenging one is letter to the part of you that is struggling.

709
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:41.090
So I said,
dear overweight body,
why are you here?
What do you have to teach me?

710
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.110
And it said,
you are here to love yourself no matter what.

711
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:48.410
I'm here to show you that how you look.
Self love is not how you look.

712
00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:49.460
It's about how you live.

713
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.450
So we can get profound answers when we just allow ourselves the space and time

714
00:43:53.451 --> 00:43:55.670
to go inward.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.

715
00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:00.050
Do you ever mail the letters of yourself?
I should,
but I haven't.
Yeah,

716
00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:03.830
that would be really fun.
I have crazy journals piled up all over.
So

717
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:04.990
<v 3>I did a,
it's a,</v>

718
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.880
it's something similar a few years ago when I was a yoga teacher and had a whole

719
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:09.880
class write letters to portray ourselves.

720
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:13.280
That's something I gave it to me and I held onto her for two years and then I

721
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:14.420
ended up sending them.

722
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.790
<v 1>That's all spent.
You guys should all go home today,</v>

723
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:21.570
write a letter and then mail it to yourself or give it to someone that you trust

724
00:44:21.571 --> 00:44:24.630
and then have them mail it to you.
It's really fun.
It's actually fantastic.

725
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.880
And it's about celebrating you and saying,
you know what,

726
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:30.840
start starts saying like,
you're doing a good job.
I appreciate you.

727
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.350
Like we did good today.
Like we need to be our own cheerleaders.

728
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.550
<v 6>I love it.
Any last questions from the audience?</v>

729
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:44.380
<v 1>Yes.
Come on up.
Hi.
Um,
I guess my question is regarding,</v>

730
00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:47.350
or if you touch on the book at all on external love and when that,

731
00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:51.480
I guess came back into your life or,
um,

732
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.780
where you feel like that balance comes.
Yeah.
Actually that's beautiful.
Um,

733
00:44:55.781 --> 00:44:59.770
so a lot of the work that I do is about learning how to be your own hero.

734
00:44:59.771 --> 00:45:03.910
A lot of the,
you talking about like maybe romantic love.
So for beef,
yes.

735
00:45:03.911 --> 00:45:07.360
So there is a part in there and there's,
it's,
it's actually layered throughout.

736
00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:09.550
Um,
I don't have one specific tool,

737
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.150
but I will say that it's conducive on when you truly love yourself,

738
00:45:13.151 --> 00:45:16.600
you can bring the love into your life that is really long lasting and who loves

739
00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:17.434
themselves too.

740
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.160
So I also think that every relationship we're in at every stage of our life is

741
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.680
an opportunity and a teacher and a lesson.

742
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:28.510
So every relationship leading up to the soulmate has become a profound kind of

743
00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.020
helping me become more of who I need to be.
And I think for all of us as well.

744
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.320
But it is very much you come to relationships from a place of not needing them

745
00:45:37.511 --> 00:45:41.230
to fill you up,
whereas you are full and saying,

746
00:45:41.231 --> 00:45:44.800
I accept myself and love myself and you are adding to my life and where in this

747
00:45:44.801 --> 00:45:47.980
glorious adventure together,
which is a beautiful place to be.

748
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:50.563
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

749
00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.340
<v 1>I have a lot of articles too on that,</v>

750
00:45:52.341 --> 00:45:54.100
like I write for Huffington post and Mindbodygreen,

751
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:57.470
so just type in relationships.
Shannon Kaiser might come up.

752
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.920
Yeah.
All right.
Can we get a big round of [inaudible]

753
00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.370
<v 6>for Shannon?
Thank you.</v>
