00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.020
I'm pleased to introduce Peggy Orenstein in addition to being a best selling

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:04.590
author.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.010
She's been named one of the 40 women who changed the media business in the past

4
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.900
40 years by the Columbia Journalism Review.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.730
Her last few books have focused on topics related to her growing daughter or

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.310
relevant to them.
And this book continues in that tradition.

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.010
As the father of a teenage girl,

8
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.250
I found the topic both interesting and concerning.

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.000
Even though I started the book with my daughter in mind along the way,

10
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.030
it gave me insights,
relevance,
relevance to both of my children.

11
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.280
And I'm sure you'll find it in cycle too.

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.250
Please join me in giving a warm welcome to Peggy Orenstein.

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.000
<v 2>Oh Yeah,
look,
I've got a microphone on me.
Um,</v>

14
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.030
this is interesting because I have yet to do an event just to where there are

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.300
more than three men present.

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.060
So this is sort of cool.

17
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.120
I wondered about this coming to Google because I kind of figured it was a little

18
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:05.480
bit more of a guy place to work off the deck might be a stereotype and I

19
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:09.410
apologize if that's true,
but um,
but that was a,
I was,

20
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.700
I was excited about that.

21
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060
So I wanted to talk a little bit about this book and how I came to do it and um,

22
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.290
some of what I've found and then I thought we could just chat if that works for

23
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:22.940
you guys.
So,
um,

24
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.390
I came to this book really I,

25
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.840
my previous book had been called Cinderella it my daughter.

26
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.320
And that was looking at the ways that the culture was telling girls from the

27
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:41.321
very youngest ages that how they looked was more important than who they were.

28
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.640
And I was looking at that through a kind of pop cultural lens and I was looking

29
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:51.641
at it partly because I'm a mother myself and I have a 12 now,

30
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:56.660
12 and a half year old daughter.
Um,
and after I finished that book,

31
00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:59.300
I was going around and I was starting to hear some stories that were,

32
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.330
that were really concerning me about the hookup culture and about sexting and

33
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:09.260
about,
um,
binge drinking.
And my first response was to kind of go,

34
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.590
Ooh,
my child photo,
I don't have to hear this.
I don't want to hear this yet.

35
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.950
Parenting from ignorance and fear generally not the best idea.

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.760
So I started sort of digging into it and,

37
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.540
and what I wanted to look at was we had,

38
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.680
we're having this umbrella conversation in this culture right now that's been

39
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:34.550
going on for several years about assault on campus.

40
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.960
And it's a really,
really,
really important topic.

41
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.050
But consent

42
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780
some really low bar for a sexual experience,
you know,

43
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:52.700
like I was not assaulted is a really low bar for a sexual experience.

44
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.650
And so I became really interested in looking at what was going on in young

45
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:02.530
women's lives after.
Yes.
And what had changed,
what hadn't,
how they,

46
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.320
whether they felt more in control,
if their experience,

47
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.070
whether they were more able to create something that was satisfying them,

48
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.190
whether they were more able to articulate their wants,

49
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:16.780
needs and desires and previous generations and whether some of the dynamics that

50
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.640
were happening in those relationships were feeding into the culture that was

51
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.560
surfacing around coercive sex and assault.

52
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860
So I decided to,
um,

53
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.670
talk to young women who were between the ages of 15 and 20,

54
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.330
because that's sort of when girls are becoming sexually active.

55
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.470
And I talked to girls who were,
uh,
they,

56
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.550
they spend a pretty broad ethnic demographic.
Um,

57
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.140
but they were all middle class.
They were all in high school,

58
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:53.050
either going to college or already in college.

59
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.670
And I particularly chose that demographic because I wanted to talk to girls that

60
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.750
we think of as having opportunity and the kind of girls that,
you know,

61
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.900
we think of as being the beneficiaries of the feminist movement.

62
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.070
Because if those girls who were,
I mean the girls I talked to,
they were,

63
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.420
if I had been interviewing them about their education,
their aspirations,

64
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.960
their professional dreams,
I would've walked away.
So impressed.

65
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.210
And if these girls who were leaning in all over the place,
you know,

66
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.880
we're toppling in their personal lives,

67
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.510
I felt that we couldn't really deny that there were issues that we needed to

68
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.344
address.

69
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650
And what I found with them was that while today's young women felt entitled to

70
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.110
engage in sexual activity,

71
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.260
they didn't necessarily feel entitled to enjoy it.

72
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.450
So as one young woman I talked to who was a sophomore and Ivy League school said

73
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:47.740
to me,
you know,

74
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
I come from generations of strong women and my grandmother was a firecracker and

75
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:59.140
my mother super strong and my sister and I are really loud and that's our

76
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:00.280
feminine power.

77
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.030
And then she proceeded to articulate a kind of series of

78
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.510
hookups that were kind of demeaning,
depersonalized,

79
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.040
not very pleasurable.
And she said,
you know,

80
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:18.874
I think,

81
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.650
I think we girls are socialized to be deferential and not express our once.

82
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.700
And I said,
wait five minutes ago,

83
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.220
you told me that you were a really strong woman.

84
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.750
And she kind of hemmed and hawed and she said,
yeah,
you know,

85
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.350
I don't think anybody ever told me that that strong woman image applied to sex.

86
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.430
And I began to think about this disconnect between how we talk about sex in the

87
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:51.301
culture and how we see sex all around us and how the landscape is littered with

88
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:54.040
female body parts.

89
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:58.670
He used to sell everything that we can possibly think of and the complete dearth

90
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.020
of honest conversation,
frank conversation,

91
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.250
real authentic conversation that we have with young women and young men,

92
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.100
but particularly young women,
um,
about sex.

93
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.550
And the whole idea of where the,

94
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.850
my previous book led me to this book or saying girls used to,
you know,

95
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.920
talk about pretty and how it was more important to be pretty than to be anything

96
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.810
else that had morphed into hot and girls were sold hot,

97
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:30.390
which is a,
you know,
a really narrow,

98
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.890
superficial,

99
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.020
commercialized idea of what's sexy and what's attractive.

100
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.230
That tells them over and over that how their bodies look to someone else is more

101
00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:46.380
important than how those bodies feel to themselves and their salt.

102
00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:51.381
That in a way that whereas I think parents who are gen x parents or who are baby

103
00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:52.410
boom parents,

104
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.090
women that age would have pushed back against that is self objectification or

105
00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:03.091
sexualization for today's young women that's sold as a source of empowerment and

106
00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:08.710
self confidence and often as the most important,
um,
uh,

107
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.690
source of self confidence and power.

108
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.530
So it becomes much more complicated for those girls,
for instances.

109
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:19.090
One Young Woman that I was talking to said she showed me a picture of herself.

110
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.270
<v 2>And she was,
um,</v>

112
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.740
going to a party and she had the requisite crop top and little skirt and high

113
00:07:25.741 --> 00:07:28.710
heels.
And she said,
you know,

114
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.480
I'm proud of my body and I never feel more liberated than when I'm wearing

115
00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:37.230
skimpy clothing.
And I said,
okay.

116
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.740
And we talked about it a little more and she said,
and a few minutes later,

117
00:07:40.741 --> 00:07:44.970
she said that a year previous she wouldn't have worn that same outfit because

118
00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:47.610
she was 25 pounds heavier.
And as she put it,

119
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:50.730
some Jerky boys would have called me the fat girl and that would be bad for my

120
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:53.220
mental health.
So then,
you know,

121
00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:56.220
I felt we needed to have a discussion and have a discussion with young girls

122
00:07:56.221 --> 00:08:01.221
about who gets to be proud of which bodies under what circumstances and how

123
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:04.650
liberating that idea of hot really is.

124
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.190
If humiliation and judgment look just around the corner.

125
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.970
And what we know in the culture of hot is that self sexualization affects girls

126
00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:20.310
cognitively,
psychologically,
and in a real bait and switch.

127
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.730
It affects them sexually.
Girls who self sexualized,

128
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.660
I actually report less power in the bedroom,
less self satis,

129
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.440
less satisfaction,
um,
less control over their experiences.

130
00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:34.860
So there's this way that I felt like,
okay,

131
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.140
if the opposite were true,

132
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.590
if this was truly creating a more powerful situation for girls in the workplace,

133
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:50.510
in education,
in their sex lives,
I'd have to say,
all right,

134
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:54.620
I'm just fusty and old and it's time for me to shuffle off.
You know?
But

135
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.800
it seemed quite apparent to me that the confidence was coming out with the

136
00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:04.801
clothes coming off with the clothes and whether we were talking about porn,

137
00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:08.260
whether we were talking about pap,
whether we're talking about fashion,

138
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.640
what girls were learning was that pleasing others was more important than their

139
00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:13.474
own pleasure.

140
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.140
That being desirable was more important than understanding their desire.

141
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.470
That appearing sexy was more important than understanding their own sexuality.

142
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.680
And one of the things that I talk about in the book is,
um,

143
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.530
the way that we need to,

144
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.890
as adults change the way that we talk about sex with kids and broaden our

145
00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:40.520
definition of sex beyond virginity and beyond intercourse.

146
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:45.230
Because when we talk about sex as being intercourse,
we are,
and,
and in fact,

147
00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:48.550
the rates of intercourse among kids have not changed.
They get,

148
00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:51.200
they're sexually active at the same age as they were 20 years ago,

149
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.180
and they're sexually active at the same rates,

150
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:58.390
however that denies and diminishes and marginalizes the other forms of sexual

151
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.200
activity that they're taking that are taking place,
particularly oral sex.

152
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:08.530
And it makes it so that those are not subject to the same rules about consent,

153
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.160
coercion,
responsibility and respect.

154
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.560
It makes it into not sex.

155
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.100
So particularly were oral sex work was concerned?
Yeah,

156
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.200
I heard so many stories about girls having one,

157
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:25.710
you know,
oral sex.
And when I say that,

158
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:30.420
I mean female on male because male and female was a whole different situation

159
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.510
for girls.
But female on male,
they would describe as not sex.

160
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:37.140
They would describe as no big deal.
And they engaged in it for a lot of reasons.

161
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:41.280
It was,
um,
to please a partner to,
uh,

162
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.880
gain popularity to,
um,

163
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.730
feel a sense of power to feel desirable,
uh,

164
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.930
because they wanted an evening to end and they wanted a guy to go away and they

165
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:54.190
didn't know how else to make them go away.
Um,

166
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.850
but it was rarely something that was in their own bodies.

167
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.050
And after awhile I started saying to girls,

168
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:05.520
because I got no sort of frustrated by hearing all these stories of this one way

169
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:06.354
situation.

170
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.630
What if every time you were alone with a guy,

171
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:17.230
he asked you to go to the kitchen and get them a glass of water and he never

172
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.210
offered to get you a glass of water?
Or if he did,
it was kind of like,

173
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.190
you want me to,
you know,
get you a glass of water.
No,

174
00:11:33.191 --> 00:11:37.480
really begrudging when you would never stand for it.
And they would say,

175
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.040
they would laugh and they'd say,
well,
when you put it that way,
yeah.
And I said,

176
00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:44.140
well,
you know,
maybe you need to put it that way.

177
00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:48.520
Maybe do we need to think about why for you it's more insulting to think about

178
00:11:48.521 --> 00:11:52.960
getting somebody a glass of water then performing a nonreciprocal sex act and it

179
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.390
just about girls getting theirs.

180
00:11:55.391 --> 00:12:00.391
But I became very intrigued with this idea of what Sarah Mclachlan,

181
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:04.480
who's a researcher at the University of Michigan calls intimate justice.

182
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.060
And just like when we talk about,
you know,

183
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.660
who does the dishes in your home is partly a political act as well as a personal

184
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:20.050
accommodation.
Sex has those dynamics too.

185
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.670
And it can bring up similar ideas about equality,
economic disparity,

186
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.740
mental health,
violence.
And we need to ask,
when we talk about girls and sex,

187
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.600
who gets to engage in an experience,
who's entitled to enjoy it?

188
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.090
Who's the primary beneficiary of that experience and how each partner defines

189
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:40.924
good enough.

190
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.240
And those are really thorny ideas to explore for adult women I think.

191
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.380
But when we're talking about girls early formative experience that's going to be

192
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:55.240
following them through their lives.
You know,

193
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.074
I just,

194
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.080
I don't want girls early experiences to be something that they have to get over.

195
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.230
And that was something that I was just hearing way too much.

196
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.380
So as part of that intimate justice,

197
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.180
we set girls up to expect inequality and their sexual relationships.

198
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.100
And I call that the,
um,

199
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.780
psychological clutter reductor me that we engage in.

200
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.290
So when baby girls in baby boys are born,

201
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.250
we tend to name all of our baby boy's body parts.

202
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.640
So at least we'll say like there's your pee pee,
something like that,
you know.

203
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.350
But with girls we tend to go from naval to knees and we just don't name that

204
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:40.351
great void and there's no better way to make something unspeakable the not to

205
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:42.244
name it.

206
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Then girls go into their puberty education classes and they learned that boys

207
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:53.431
have erections and ejaculations and girls have periods and unwanted pregnancy,

208
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.930
which are not the same thing.

209
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.000
And we only see that sort of internal diagram.

210
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.850
Um,
you know,
that looks like a steer head of,

211
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:10.180
of girls and it grays out between the legs.

212
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.500
So we never hear the word Volvo,
we never hear the word cliteracy.

213
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.780
And not surprisingly,

214
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:21.930
fewer than half of girls ages 14 to 17 have ever masturbated.

215
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.970
And then they go into their partner and interactions and we somehow expect that

216
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:32.020
magically they're going to be able to articulate their wants,
their needs,

217
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:34.810
their desires,
their limits,
and have those respected,

218
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.330
we think that they're going to be able to think they have a voice.

219
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.650
We think that they're going to be able to advocate for an equal relationship.

220
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.900
And it's really just not that realistic.
And so again,
you know,

221
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.380
I wanted to talk about that idea of virginity and I wanted to talk about that

222
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:52.070
idea,
the idea of satisfaction.

223
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.460
Because one thing that we know is that we think of satisfaction as being one

224
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.270
kind of monolithic idea and that we know how to find it.
But in fact,

225
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:05.270
young women and young men define satisfaction very differently.

226
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.140
So young women are more likely than young men to define,

227
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.500
to measure their satisfaction by their partners pleasure.

228
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.010
So they'll say if he had a good time,
I had a good time.

229
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.530
Whereas young men are more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own

230
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:25.160
pleasure.
So if I had a good time,
I had a good time.

231
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.280
What's interesting is that that dynamic remains the same for girls when they're

232
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:32.870
in same sex relationships.

233
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.150
So that's when we sort of see an interesting transformation that in same sex

234
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:42.530
liaisons,
girls tend to be orgasmic at the same rate as heterosexual men.

235
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.970
Also really interesting.
And back to the point of virginity or I don't know,

236
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.210
actually,
let me skip back a second before we get to that.
Um,

237
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.750
one of the things that gay and lesbian girls would say,

238
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.130
oh gay and bisexual girls would say to me is that when they were with other

239
00:15:58.131 --> 00:15:58.760
women,

240
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.710
other girls that they felt that they could get off the script and they use

241
00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:08.600
several of them use that word script.
Um,
which you know,
is the cultural script,

242
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:12.920
the media script,
the porn script,
every script,
the sex education script.

243
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.470
And that when they got off that script,

244
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:20.471
they were free to create an experience that worked for them.

245
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.740
And that wasn't dictated by something outside of themselves.

246
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:26.180
And it was a more creative act.

247
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.630
And that really stuck with me is something that I think that we can learn from.

248
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.160
Um,
even if we're in a other sex liaisons.

249
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.750
Um,
the other piece of that was,
uh,
when I was talking earlier about virginity,

250
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.360
when we continually talk about sex and virginity as intercourse,

251
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:46.670
not because intercourse is no big deal.
Of course it's a big deal,

252
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.930
but it's not the only big deal.
And it also marginalizes,

253
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:55.460
and it completely ignores the experience of lesbian and bisexual girls.

254
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.860
And so I asked a young woman,

255
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.690
how did you know that you weren't a virgin anymore when you've never had

256
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:06.860
heterosexual intercourse?
I get to make this joke here.

257
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:10.190
This is so great.
She said,
I had to Google it.

258
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.850
Guess what?
Google didn't know,

259
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.010
guys get on it.
So she said,

260
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:26.930
there was no answer.
And uh,
I said,
well,
what is your side?

261
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.560
And she sort of hemmed and she hard for a while and she said,
you know,

262
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.410
I think I stopped being a virgin when I had my first orgasm with a partner.

263
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.730
And I thought,
just for a second,

264
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.430
what if that was the definition,

265
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.820
how that would shift or whole conception of sexuality.

266
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.200
And it's this idea that sexuality,
especially for young people,

267
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:57.201
should be this pool of experiences that is about warmth and closeness and

268
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:03.261
affection and sensation and communication and pleasure,

269
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.320
not this race to a goal.
And,

270
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.271
you know,

271
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:16.830
I like to say when I talk to young people who's really more experienced,

272
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.520
the person who spends three hours kissing their partner and the experimenting

273
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:27.480
with these ideas of erotic tension and communication and sensation or the person

274
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.630
who gets wasted hooks up with a random and tries to dump their virginity before

275
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:36.840
they get to college.
So it's just a way to sort of,
you know,

276
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.470
think about how to reframe this.
And

277
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.920
I'm starting to decide how much I want to talk and how much I want to let the
to,

278
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.390
to let you guys ask.
I mean,
I,
I talk a lot about the,

279
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:55.670
the hookup culture and what has changed in recent years on the end.

280
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.920
You know,
young people did not invent casual sex.
Right?
I heard that.

281
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.780
Um,
you know,
please.

282
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.220
But what has changed is the idea that co that sex arise,

283
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:12.660
arises out of,
um,
I mean,
uh,

284
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.840
proceeds rather than a rises out of intimacy.
And that that's the norm.

285
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.580
And that was true in colleges.

286
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:21.450
And it was because of me becoming more true in high school so that whether young

287
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:22.690
women,
um,

288
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.320
wanted to be part of hookup culture or wanted to opt out of cook up culture or

289
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:31.540
wanted to go in and out,
or however they wanted to do what they had to,
um,

290
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.570
define themselves in their relationships,

291
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:35.700
in their sexuality and relationship to that culture.

292
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.510
And some young women were really into it.
Um,

293
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.490
some girls would come in and sit down and say,

294
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.870
I am so sick of women being portrayed as victims of the hookup culture.

295
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.130
I'm a participant.
I want to be here.
You know,
this serves me.

296
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:53.160
I don't want a boyfriend right now.
I don't have time for a boyfriend right now.

297
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.480
I want to focus on school.

298
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:56.760
I want to focus on my friends and I still want to have a sex life.

299
00:19:56.761 --> 00:20:01.410
And this is how I do it.
Other women found it,
you know,

300
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.430
unhygienic and just not something that they wanted to purchase date,

301
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:06.510
but they all had to do that.

302
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:11.340
And what became interesting to me was not thinking about hookups,

303
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:14.640
good or hookups,
bad relationships,
good or relationships bad.

304
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.070
I'm not prescriptive that way.
That's not my job.

305
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.420
But what I did want to talk about with girls and what I did want them to know

306
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:25.410
was what they were likely and probably we're not likely to get out of a

307
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:28.590
situation.
So to know that if you're going to do,

308
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.150
if you're going to go out and hook up,

309
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:33.190
and hookups of course are not just lubricated by alcohol,

310
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.180
they are dependent on it.
Um,

311
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.870
in order to create what a sociologist at Occidental told me was called

312
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.650
compulsory carelessness.
So trying to,
you know,
anesta size,

313
00:20:44.651 --> 00:20:48.070
you're against itself against feelings so that you can go into the sexual

314
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:49.930
liaisons.
And she said,

315
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:53.080
actually her interview subjects talk about I'm sober sex.

316
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:57.640
Like it was an amazing Unicorn.
Um,
but so going into a hookup,

317
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:04.250
you'll probably get an adrenaline rush.
You'll probably get,

318
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.450
um,
a sense of conquest,
a war story.

319
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.780
Um,
you'll probably feel desirable for a short period of time.

320
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.510
You'll get a warm body.
You might have some fun.

321
00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.260
What you probably won't get out of hookups is a good sex or the tools that you

322
00:21:22.011 --> 00:21:26.240
need in order to practice good sex or create intimacy.

323
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.960
So my hope was by surfacing that and surfacing how girls talked about hookups

324
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.960
was to allow them to look at what the realities were of their choices and then

325
00:21:38.991 --> 00:21:42.710
make the choice from an informed place.
I'm not telling them how to make it,

326
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.180
but this is what they need to know.
So

327
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.370
at the end of the book,

328
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.080
I see I end in a coed classroom and I do that on purpose because I really wanted

329
00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:02.550
to stop in a place where boys and girls were working out these issues together

330
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.300
because I do have great belief that teenagers are thoughtful,

331
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.910
they are eager,
they're interested,

332
00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:13.140
and they're capable of working out their ethics,
their values and learning to,

333
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:18.150
you know,
treat people with ethics and respect.
And in part of that,

334
00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:19.710
and looking at that section of the book,

335
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.000
I also looked at other countries and one of the things that was most interesting

336
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:29.001
to me was comparing the experience of Dutch teenagers to American teenagers.

337
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.880
And I looked at research that showed how a Dutch college girls and American

338
00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:40.080
college girls spoke about their early sexual experiences.

339
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.810
So these were demographically very similar groups

340
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.450
on every measure.

341
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.350
<v 2>The Dutch girls,</v>

343
00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:53.380
whether it was fewer negative consequences like pregnancy disease,

344
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.370
um,
regret or enhanced positive consequences like,

345
00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.593
um,

346
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.850
<v 1>okay.</v>

347
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.680
<v 2>You know,
knowing your partner,
preparing responsibly,
enjoying the experience,</v>

348
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.260
uh,
having a positive body image.

349
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.900
Every single measure,
the Dutch girls came out way ahead.

350
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.280
They embodied everything that we hope for for our girls.

351
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.320
So what was different?
Well,
in Dutch culture,

352
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.700
teachers,

353
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.760
doctors and parents talk explicitly about sex from the time kids are young,

354
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:33.160
not in a,
you know,
in an age appropriate way,
obviously.
Um,

355
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.750
and what was particularly different was parents that while parents,

356
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.240
American parents and Dutch parents were no less,

357
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.930
we're no different in their comfort levels.
And talking about sex,

358
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.840
American parents spoke exclusively about risk and disease and Dutch parents

359
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:54.260
talked about balancing responsibility and joy.

360
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.200
And I'll tell you that.

361
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:01.490
Thinking about that as a parent really made a big difference to me because I

362
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:04.820
think that before I would have reflexively said,
you know,

363
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.360
I've talked to my daughter about contraception,

364
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:10.550
I've talked to my daughter about disease protection,

365
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:12.740
I've talked to my daughter because I'm really modern.

366
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.390
I've talked to her about consent,
but,
and then I would have thought,
good job,

367
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:21.800
Peggy job is done.
Now I know that that's not true.

368
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.590
And there's a whole other job that I have to figure out how to do.

369
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.740
And that's important for boys as well.
And one of the,

370
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:30.110
I'll tell you that one of the most meaningful moments in

371
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.500
the classroom that I was in was when a young boy in high school,

372
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:39.020
boy raised his hand and they were talking about some meeting.
He said,

373
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.900
you know that baseball metaphor for sex and baseball,

374
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:46.790
there's winners and there's losers.

375
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.980
So who's supposed to be the loser and sex?
And I thought,

376
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:56.480
you know,
Bingo,
like that was just a small revelation.

377
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.060
But that boy and making that switch,

378
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:04.061
we'll go more into his partnerships as a partner rather than as an adversary

379
00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:04.790
trying to score.

380
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.170
And actually I don't even think the girls in that metaphor or the opposite team.

381
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.140
I think the girls might be the field.
Right?

382
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.200
It's not even that good.
So you know,
thinking about how to replace that.
I have,

383
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.110
and I'll,
and I'll end on this because it's my favorite thing in the world.

384
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.970
You guys know l Vernaccia.
Do you know who he is?
He is.
He did a Ted talk.

385
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:31.140
He is a sex educator and in Pennsylvania and he advocates replacing the base.

386
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:34.100
And if you can do one thing with your kids,
this is,

387
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.910
this is it replacing the baseball metaphor with the pizza metaphor.

388
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.050
And here's why.
When we go out to pizza,

389
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.860
we have a shared experience.

390
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.970
First we decide together you want to have pizza?
Yeah,
pizza.

391
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.450
Then we go to the pizza place and we order a pie and we negotiate.

392
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.200
We talk about like maybe I like mushrooms and you like Pepperoni.

393
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.040
And so maybe we'll go halfsies or maybe,
um,

394
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:03.110
we'll have mushrooms this time and Pepperoni next time.

395
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:06.290
Or maybe if you keep insisting on Pepperoni and I keep kosher,

396
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.050
I'm not going to go out to pizza with you anymore.
Or you know,
it's,

397
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.570
it's a kind of endless metaphor,

398
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:16.571
but it is all about having an experience that's shared.

399
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.190
Everybody's invested in one another's pleasure.

400
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:20.810
You would never want to go out to pizza and have your,

401
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.950
you're not care if your partner didn't like the pizza you were having.

402
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.800
You want them to like the pizza.
You want to have an enjoyable experience.

403
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.880
You want to be communicating.
And it's,
you know,
you can see you can,

404
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.160
you can take that metaphor in all different directions,

405
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.200
but it's so far superior and thinking about how we can talk to our kids and

406
00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:44.201
raise them so that they can think about their sexuality in terms of intimate

407
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:48.780
justice and so that they can think about engaging ethically,
responsibly,

408
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.480
respectfully and joyfully.

409
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.650
Whether the liaisons lasts for 10 minutes or whether they last for 10 years.

410
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.580
So I will stop there and I'd be happy to take any questions.

411
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:01.410
Probably not the discussion you think you're going to have in the middle of a

412
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:02.244
workday.
Right.

413
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.730
<v 3>I appreciate that you came.
Anybody have any,
any thoughts?
Yeah,</v>

414
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.430
so the question I have is about the research that compares the Netherlands and

415
00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:13.264
the United States.

416
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.010
Is there research that compares to the Netherlands to the best state in the u s

417
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:22.690
because it seems like it's such a small country and all the people are very

418
00:27:22.691 --> 00:27:26.050
similar,
whereas us is huge and very diverse.
Right?

419
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.600
So I feel like it's maybe not a very fair comparison.

420
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.181
<v 2>Well,
here's why.</v>

421
00:27:29.181 --> 00:27:33.380
It was a fair comparison because it wasn't comparing the demographic to a broad

422
00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:34.700
swath of the United States.

423
00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:38.660
It was comparing two sets of girls who were in college who were the same age,

424
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.900
who were the same ethnic background and who were the same,
um,
uh,

425
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.000
largely the same religious background and the same,
uh,
economic background.

426
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.200
So it was comparing,

427
00:27:48.201 --> 00:27:52.730
it wasn't comparing Dutch girls to the broad swath of American society.

428
00:27:52.731 --> 00:27:55.940
It was comparing the demographic that I was particularly interested in.

429
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.700
To the demographic I was particularly interested in.

430
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.510
But in terms of,
um,
states,
you know,
yeah,

431
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:05.220
there's huge diverse,
I mean,

432
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.490
the truth is that only 23 states in our country mandate sex education and only

433
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.230
13 mandate that it'd be medically accurate.

434
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.080
I know,
I mean it's,
it's very sad.
And one of them I'm from,

435
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:25.350
I live in California and one of them is supposed to be mine,

436
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:30.180
but it wasn't until last summer that the city of Clovis,

437
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.260
uh,
was found in violation of that because they were running films,
um,

438
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:40.310
in their sex ed class that compared a sexually active unmarried woman to a dirty

439
00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:44.670
old shoe.
Um,
and had the kids chanting,

440
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.380
I can't remember exactly what they were saying.
No,

441
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:50.340
but they were cheating teaching them antigay slogans to champion school in

442
00:28:50.341 --> 00:28:54.440
public school.
Yup.
Thank you.
[inaudible] you know,

443
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.340
I'll say one other thing about the Netherlands too,

444
00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:58.080
that's a sort of broader idea about them.

445
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:03.000
But the one thing that also really struck me as a parent was Amy [inaudible] who

446
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:06.060
wrote a book called not under my roof and also compared the Netherlands to

447
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.903
Americans.

448
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.720
She found some really interesting things and one of them was that we expect

449
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:18.080
American teenagers to grow up by creating a rift with their parents that we

450
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:20.850
expect,
particularly girls,

451
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.960
we expect them to be to present as the good girl at home and to lie either

452
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:28.770
overtly or blood or by omission about what they're doing outside of the home.

453
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.710
And I certainly saw that with the girls I talked to who are always saying things

454
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:35.000
like,
Ugh,
my father thinks I'm a virgin or my mother.

455
00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:37.230
It has no idea what I'm doing.
Or You know,

456
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.710
and in Holland they're expected to these matters in the family.

457
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.180
They're expected to grow up in an interdependent way with the family.

458
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.590
And parents use that as a way to continue to exert a kind of soft control over

459
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:54.880
the kids so that they can reiterate ideas about safety,

460
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:59.350
ideas about values,
ideas about respect.
And when I thought about that,

461
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.730
I thought,
oh my gosh,

462
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.770
I don't want my daughter to have to grow up by lying to me.
I want her to,

463
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:10.270
I want to be on her team.
Well at the same time,
I also realized that,

464
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.930
um,
that can be hard to do when you're the parent,

465
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.190
especially in our culture.

466
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:20.630
And so I really advocate also building the team.
Here's a good bit,

467
00:30:20.631 --> 00:30:24.170
this baseball metaphor works.
Build the team.
Um,
and,

468
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.510
and I've been that person where I,
I,
you know,

469
00:30:26.511 --> 00:30:31.160
I have a friend whose daughter was becoming thinking about becoming a,

470
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.730
having intercourse when she was 16.
And she asked me though,

471
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.630
the mother asked me to go out and have a conversation with the girl and like

472
00:30:38.631 --> 00:30:42.410
everybody,
I wanted to fall through the floor.
I'm no different.
Um,
but I said,

473
00:30:42.411 --> 00:30:46.190
look,
um,
let's talk about this.
I know you're thinking about this.

474
00:30:46.191 --> 00:30:48.980
Let's talk about contraception.
Let's talk about disease protection.

475
00:30:48.981 --> 00:30:53.570
Let's talk about consent.
And I'm going to ask you some questions.

476
00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.240
You don't have to answer them,
but I want you to think about them.

477
00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.080
Have you ever masturbated?
Have you had an orgasm on your own?

478
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.940
Have you had an orgasm with your partner?

479
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.020
Can you tell this partner what you like and don't like?

480
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.830
Can you tell him no.
When you're ready to stop and have him respect that.

481
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.070
Are you able to communicate with him around these issues?

482
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.860
And if you answer no to those questions,

483
00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.040
what is it that you want out of this experience?

484
00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:22.460
What is it that you want for you?
Why are you,
why are you doing this?

485
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.410
And she didn't really answer.
She just,
her eyes got as big as my head,
but,

486
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.140
and I don't know what she ultimately decided,

487
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:36.020
but she's 24 now and we talked,
I just talked to her yesterday.

488
00:31:36.021 --> 00:31:40.490
We talk all the time.
We talk about her sex life,
we talk about her job,

489
00:31:40.491 --> 00:31:44.630
we talk about her,
you know,
ideas about graduate school.
We talk about everything.

490
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.900
And I feel like that conversation opened this door where she knew that,

491
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.390
you know,
there was never going to,
I was never going to flinch.
You know,

492
00:31:53.391 --> 00:31:56.180
I was never going to flinch no matter what she told me,

493
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.430
no matter what we talked about,
I was there.

494
00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:02.960
And I just think to be able to have that relationship with your niece,

495
00:32:02.961 --> 00:32:05.540
with your friend's kids,
with your own daughter,
ideally,

496
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.970
it's just a huge gift in this culture.

497
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.423
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

498
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.770
<v 5>So you mentioned kind of off hand to talking,</v>

499
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.760
talking to children in age appropriate ways about sex.

500
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:23.050
One of the things that I've learned in talking with parents is that the

501
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:27.880
definition of age appropriate varies very wildly.
Do you have any guidance on

502
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.960
<v 2>that?
You know what I would do,</v>

503
00:32:33.961 --> 00:32:38.660
I think what I'd like to do is recommend a couple of books too because that's a

504
00:32:38.661 --> 00:32:43.430
really conversation and there are really interesting books that look at it from

505
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.900
a,
uh,
um,
development,
developmental psychology point of view.

506
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.220
Um,
Debra Roffman's book talk to me first,
uh,

507
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.020
talks about kids from infancy to teenage years.
I mean,
you know,

508
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.070
upper teenagers and Alvin Nacchio,

509
00:32:59.071 --> 00:33:01.490
the pizza guy has a book called for goodness sex.

510
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.510
And both of those books are wonderful about guiding you.
Like,

511
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:08.570
what do you tell your two year old,
you know,
what do you tell your 10 year old,

512
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.450
what do you tell your 12 year old?
It's really helpful from that.

513
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:12.430
But I do think that,
you know,

514
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.040
there is a way that we start from the get go by naming the body parts.

515
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.160
And I mean,
I don't know if any of you have a preschooler,

516
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.750
but preschoolers masturbate all the time and you know,

517
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.740
one way to make that,

518
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.510
to talk about that with them is,
you know,
to say,
Gee,
you know,
it's great.

519
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.020
It feels really good when you touch your Volvo.
It doesn't it,
but,
and not,
but,

520
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.990
and,
um,
we don't do that at the Thanksgiving table.

521
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.670
We do that in private and in,
in our rooms.
And you know,

522
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:47.510
it's okay to talk about privacy,
which is not the same as secrecy,
you know,

523
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:50.590
and start building that idea of bodily integrity and,

524
00:33:50.591 --> 00:33:54.710
and pleasure and having control and understanding of your body.
It's okay to say,

525
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:59.090
you know,
you don't have to hug great aunt Nancy if you don't want to.

526
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:01.570
I'm not going to make you do that because that's,
you know,

527
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.640
pushing you beyond a boundary and you should be able to set your boundaries,

528
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:06.830
nor are you.
Am I going to make her hug you?

529
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:09.560
And I'm just going to live with the embarrassment that great aunt Nancy thinks

530
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.200
I'm a really bad parent.
You know?
Um,

531
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.590
so even things like that that aren't necessarily,
I mean,

532
00:34:15.591 --> 00:34:19.400
a lot of this is not about sex.
It's about creating an atmosphere of trust.

533
00:34:19.401 --> 00:34:23.270
And it's about creating an atmosphere of ethics and values in the same way that

534
00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:27.320
we do in any area of our kids' lives and the way that we want them to treat

535
00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:31.010
others and in the way that we want them to expect others to treat them.

536
00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:36.220
But I would recommend those two books about the actual direct specifics.

537
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:38.890
Yeah.
Um,

538
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:43.880
talk to me first by Deborah Rothman and for goodness,

539
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:48.610
sex by Alvara Nacchio,
which is v e R,
n,
a,
c,

540
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.560
c,
h.
I.
O,
I think.

541
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:54.740
But if you look at Pizza Guy and sex,
you'll find them.

542
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.380
So I have a team come up there.
Ninja.

543
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.960
I have a really good one.
Did

544
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.380
<v 4>Fred,</v>

545
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.380
who wants to raise her children with a culturally appropriate rehearsed sexual

546
00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:17.000
ethic?
They're very strong Christians.
I'm personally not,
but you know,

547
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:21.740
she's a really good friend of mine and one of her challenges is she wants to be

548
00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:26.741
able to have these sorts of conversations that respect the child,

549
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:32.930
the girls as women who have these bodies but has even less resources we're

550
00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:37.860
doing.
So in a way within that subculture where I think a lot of,

551
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.250
you know,
just the idea of saying,
you know,
Oh,

552
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:45.270
think about the relationship you're in and what you're getting out of it is not

553
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:48.720
really the conversation she wants to have.

554
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.790
I mean if it's the reality that's a different thing,

555
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:52.590
but it's not the example she wants to set.

556
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:56.550
So you have any advice for people coming from that perspective?

557
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.640
<v 2>That's a very good question.
I mean,
I think that you can again talk about</v>

558
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.090
ideas about bodily integrity,
about respect,

559
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.340
about pleasure,

560
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:14.420
about limit setting about that.

561
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.100
That don't necessarily mean that you have to,
you know,

562
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:22.170
go from zero to 60 what's comfortable for you?
What's valuable to you?

563
00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:25.920
I mean I think you can have those same conversations regardless of when you

564
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:29.160
expect a young person.
I mean,
I don't know if what if,
what you're talking about.

565
00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:31.950
One of the things that was true with

566
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:38.550
people who advocated abstinence until marriage was that again,

567
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:40.440
they were very focused on intercourse.

568
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.630
And what we know about that is that first of all,
it doesn't work.

569
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.880
Um,
those kids have sex,
have intercourse at the same rates as other people.

570
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.660
They do tend to have start maybe a little later,
but it's a matter of months.

571
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.400
They have maybe fewer partners,

572
00:36:56.401 --> 00:37:00.930
but they have much higher rates of pregnancy and disease way higher rates of

573
00:37:00.931 --> 00:37:02.660
disease.
Um,

574
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:09.110
we also know that they engage in other forms of sexual activity,

575
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.900
particularly particularly oral and anal sex at higher rates and other teenagers.

576
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.240
So one thing to understand for your friend would be that that's the likely

577
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:23.550
outcome.
If you take that point of view,

578
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.820
if you still want to take that point of view,

579
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.850
you better be having a whole other set of discussions about what that means and

580
00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.780
how kids can engage in ways that would still,

581
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.270
where they can express affection,

582
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:47.271
where they can express sensuality that you feel jives with your values.

583
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.150
But it's a tough one because I mean,

584
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:54.420
essentially you're educating your children for ignorance.

585
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:57.060
You're educating your children for,
um,

586
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.100
risk.
You're putting your children at risk when you,

587
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:03.660
when you take that perspective.

588
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.400
So it's hard for me to give advice on how to do it in a healthy way.

589
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:15.330
Oh,
you have a question,

590
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.660
<v 4>Dave,
in your book,
you mentioned something called Philip Phobia,</v>

591
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.910
which is your work.
How's it relate to the subject?

592
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.930
<v 2>So interesting.
I was talking to this girl,</v>

593
00:38:26.931 --> 00:38:28.460
you're the first person who's asked me about that.

594
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.560
That was such a profound experience.

595
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.470
I was talking to this young woman who told,
you know,

596
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:39.130
it's like really swaggery and really like,
I have sex,

597
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:42.280
like a guy by which she meant she didn't have to have any feelings,

598
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:47.050
which I'd like to question in a minute.
Um,
you know,
and she could just objective,

599
00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:51.280
she objectified men,
the way men objectify women.
Um,
she would tell you,
no,

600
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:53.800
I don't want to that guy.
He's too fat and you know,

601
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:57.190
I'm not going to go with that.
You know,
she was like,
really?
Um,

602
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:59.703
like

603
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.540
the way I would hope a male would never treat my daughter.

604
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.020
That was how she was treating boys.
Um,

605
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:09.850
and she felt really good about that.

606
00:39:09.851 --> 00:39:13.180
And then at the very end of the interview we talked for about two hours.
I said,

607
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.450
do you have anything else you want to talk about?
And she said,

608
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.660
feel a phobia.
And I said,
excuse me?
She said,
feel a phobia.

609
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:26.680
And I said,
I'm sorry.
I don't know what that means.
And she said,
fear of love.

610
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.810
I think that I have fear of love.
I would not,
I do all of this,

611
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:36.040
but I am really afraid of ever really liking somebody and getting into a

612
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:39.070
relationship with them.
And it was a really,
you know,
it was,

613
00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:42.520
it was like this really deep moment.
She almost cried of,
you know,

614
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:46.390
what was she getting out of what she was doing?
She,
and what wasn't she getting?

615
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.040
Um,
and thinking about her,
I was,
I was,
you know,

616
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:55.130
I felt like that idea that how we should learn to,

617
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:04.180
that the progress is somehow becoming as disconnected as we can be.

618
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.900
You know,
getting,
getting our sexual hookups on,

619
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.410
on Tinder or whatever people are doing now.
Um,

620
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.310
that is a really low road to equality.

621
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.840
That's a very low road to equality and treating other people like objects has a

622
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:21.670
very low road to equality.

623
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:27.060
And it's also clear in research that one of the things that teenagers talk about

624
00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:31.090
American teenagers talk about is that they do want to hear more from their

625
00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:35.950
parents and that they especially wanted to hear more from their parents about

626
00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:40.000
relationships and the emotional side of sex.
And that that's a part that they,

627
00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:45.001
because what's happening right now is that kids are without sex education in

628
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:48.160
schools and in the face of silence from their parents,

629
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:53.620
they go to porn because there it is on the Internet.
And I don't,
you know,

630
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.360
I don't want to,
especially in front of you guys,

631
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:57.430
I don't want to demonize the Internet,
but you know,

632
00:40:57.431 --> 00:41:01.270
one of the things it's done is allowed,
you know,

633
00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:05.680
pouring into your house 24,
seven,
really easily accessible,
um,

634
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:07.970
increasingly explicit because it's competitive,

635
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.780
got to be increasingly competitive and kids are able to access it at ever

636
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.450
earlier ages.
And when you look at research on this,

637
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:18.510
there was a survey of college students,
um,

638
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.580
in England that showed that 60% of them said that they consult porn in part as

639
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.800
sex education,

640
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:31.830
even though 75% of them know that it's about as realistic as pro wrestling.
Um,

641
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.020
and I think it's not really where we want our kids to be getting their sex

642
00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:40.220
education because it's really not,
you know,

643
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:44.360
perhaps the best image and vision of female sexuality.
And you know,

644
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:48.890
it's another performative space that presents it as m for male gratification.

645
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:52.250
And I would hear about this from girls.

646
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.080
They would say things to me like,
um,
oh,
often they would say,

647
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.920
my boyfriend wants to know why I don't make the noises like the women in porn.

648
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.870
And I was,
again,
I got kind of frustrated and my journalist to remove faltered.

649
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:07.040
And I said,
look,

650
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.450
it's a movie and a movie has to have a soundtrack.

651
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.020
And if it doesn't,
it's a silent movie.

652
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:21.100
So people have to make the noises so that there'll be a soundtrack on the movie

653
00:42:21.111 --> 00:42:24.140
that doesn't make it real.
There are actors,
you know,
they're actors.

654
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.590
And that was kind of a revelation to them.
Um,

655
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.490
on the more extreme end of that spectrum,
uh,

656
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.380
we've seen a significant uptick among teenagers in anal sex.
And again,

657
00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:40.520
I don't want to demonize a particular behavior,
but you know,
we're talking,

658
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:44.080
like I said,
about girls who have,
um,
uh,
never masturbated,

659
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.820
never had an orgasm on their own,
never had an orgasm with a partner,

660
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:49.340
can't communicate effectively with their partners.

661
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.780
And when you look into the research,
what comes up is that it is driven,
you know,

662
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:57.070
it's a,
it's a trend that is driven by porn that,
um,

663
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.060
pushed more by boys because they want not as an act of intimacy with a partner,

664
00:43:02.061 --> 00:43:03.620
but as like,
you know,

665
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.740
part of that continuing to go in a straight line and in experience and kind of

666
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.680
checking it off your bucket list,
um,
that the girls report on.

667
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.640
Surprisingly that it hurts.
But that both this is was what was interesting to me.

668
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:20.540
Both girls and boys blamed that on the girls because they say the girls are

669
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:24.800
night,
they used the language like naive,
flawed and unable to relax.

670
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.240
So again,
you know,

671
00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:29.740
I think it's really important to get out front and talk to kids about,
you know,

672
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:34.810
porn is vision of women is about as real as real housewives vision of marriage,

673
00:43:36.951 --> 00:43:39.770
you know.
Um,
but I also started feeling,

674
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:44.771
I had this conversation with my own daughter and then like a week or two later

675
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:49.580
we were watching the movie Brooklyn.
Um,
which is a great movie,
right?
Fine movie.

676
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.550
Or maybe you don't like it,
I don't care.
But if we know it's some,

677
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.393
it's fine with me.

678
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.380
And there's a sex scene in that movie that is very nondescript.
You know,

679
00:43:57.381 --> 00:44:00.890
it's just an absolutely garden variety,
ordinary Hollywood sex scene,

680
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.930
which is that the two characters,
um,
kiss for a couple of seconds,

681
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.820
they rip off half their clothes.

682
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:12.230
They apparently are having intercourse for approximately seven and a half

683
00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:15.710
seconds and then everybody's happy and it's done.

684
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.330
And it suddenly occurred to me that that wasn't very realistic either and that

685
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:25.360
she is probably going to see many more thousands of times that image,

686
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:29.030
that sequence than actual porn.

687
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:34.420
And what impact does that have on her idea about what sex is supposed to be and

688
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:38.820
who it's supposed to be four and who gets to enjoy it and all of that.
So I said,

689
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:39.810
you know,
honey,

690
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.150
<v 1>okay.</v>

691
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:44.930
<v 2>You know how in a movie when somebody takes a cab ride,</v>

692
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:46.630
<v 1>okay,</v>

693
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:50.320
<v 2>they opened the door and get into the cab and then you see them open the door</v>

694
00:44:50.321 --> 00:44:52.180
and get out of the cabinet,
their destination.

695
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:57.220
But you don't see the whole cab ride because that would be like the whole movie

696
00:44:57.221 --> 00:44:59.890
and it would be boring.
Similarly,

697
00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:05.320
when we see sex in movies and on TV and ads and,
and all these places,

698
00:45:05.321 --> 00:45:07.780
or in videos or whatever you're doing watching,

699
00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.740
we don't see what really happens.

700
00:45:11.741 --> 00:45:15.050
Hollywood has a series of symbols which are,
you know,

701
00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.180
kind of outdated on what sex is,

702
00:45:19.181 --> 00:45:22.690
and they throw those up and that is supposed to signal to us that sex has

703
00:45:22.691 --> 00:45:27.250
happened,
but it doesn't actually tell us anything about what real sex is or the

704
00:45:27.251 --> 00:45:28.300
experience of sex.

705
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:32.140
And I felt like that was at least as important for kids to understand,

706
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.630
as you know,
talking to them about porn.

707
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:36.663
<v 1>So</v>

708
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.980
<v 2>a little ways from field of phobia,
but there you go.
All right.</v>

709
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.360
Thank you very much.
I'm like,
okay,
thanks.

710
00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.580
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
