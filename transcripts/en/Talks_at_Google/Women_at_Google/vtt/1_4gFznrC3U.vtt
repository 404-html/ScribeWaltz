WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.680
Uh,
thank you Carl.
Carl is my next door neighbor brand new to the neighborhoods.

2
00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:17.681
So I'm doing everything I can to help acclimate him to Ann Arbor and to fair

3
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:19.081
street.

4
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:23.730
I like to tell people I live on fare street as in fair and unfair and instead of

5
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.380
art fair,
uh,
so that they will remember that I'm on the fare side of things.

6
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.940
But uh,
I'm happy,

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.800
I'm very happy to be here and so happy to see so many of you taking a moment

8
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:39.540
away from your desks,
your lunches.
I went to the cafeteria here at Google.

9
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:40.860
That was phenomenal.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.220
And all of the opportunities you have to do almost anything but sit and listen

11
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:49.410
to a federal judge Yammer on seed.

12
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:53.940
Most of the people who come to see and meet with me have no choice in the
matter.

13
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.300
Many are shackled and have fancy escorts in Nice uniforms and others are

14
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.380
pleading with me to grant whatever relief they may be thinking is appropriate

15
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:08.850
for their case.
But all of you,
I presume are here of your own freewill.

16
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.720
And if not,
please see me afterwards.
So see what I can do.

17
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.900
So seriously,
thank you so much for being here.

18
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.700
I'd like to begin actually by welcoming all of you to Anarbor who may be

19
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:24.990
relatively new here.
It's a wonderful town and a great place to live.

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.130
I moved here,
uh,
before I knew anything about the Internet,

21
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.880
nothing about search engines,
advertising markets.

22
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:37.881
And this was back in 1978 I came here to complete my undergraduate education and

23
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.690
that's for the most part,
the story I told my parents.

24
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.790
But what I really came here to do was to meet gay people and that was the

25
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:52.200
purpose of my destination.
Now,
most of you would be thinking right now,

26
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.500
what was she thinking?
We are in the rust belt.

27
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.340
She could have gone to San Francisco,
she could have gone to New York City.

28
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.990
Any of these places might have been a smarter place for my real purpose.

29
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.960
But I was born and raised in Bloomington,
Indiana,

30
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.630
and I'm a Midwest girl through and through.

31
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.020
So I found a home here in Anarbor and I have never left once I arrived in

32
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:19.980
[inaudible] 78 I am,
I attended the University of Michigan,
uh,

33
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:22.350
to complete my undergraduate education.

34
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.210
But I also undertook what was sometimes hard work of coming out as a lesbian.

35
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.440
I had begun doing that in a small college town in Ohio,

36
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.810
but I felt suffocated,

37
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.110
isolated and uncertain about how to survive there.

38
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.650
And Arbor at the time had a very small lesbian run bookstore upstairs from where

39
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:47.640
the Birkenstock store is right now on fourth avenue across from the Co op

40
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.170
upstairs used to be a bookstore called woman's space.

41
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.970
If any of you have seen Portlandia,
it's
okay.

42
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.320
Then you know,
sort of what I'm talking about.

43
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.840
But it was not even quite that up and coming.
Uh,

44
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.820
so Ann Arbor also had on fourth avenue to gay bars.

45
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:11.821
One was called the flame and it's where Logan restaurant is very nice up and

46
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.880
coming restaurant.
Well the flame was not quite like that.

47
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.200
It was dark,
it was musty,
it was moldy.

48
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.550
And it gave you this sense of my God,
is this what my life is about?

49
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.100
But we still went there.
The other was a dance bar,
uh,

50
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.410
not far from where the current YMC MCA is.

51
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.460
But I have already digressed from my story.
Uh,

52
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.430
so my story starts with,
with this,

53
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.510
I believe I am one of the lucky ones.
Back in those days,

54
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.680
I had grown up as the daughter of a child survivor of the Holocaust,

55
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.640
a German immigrant,

56
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.900
my mother and a survivor of the mean streets of Patterson,

57
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.490
New Jersey.
My father,

58
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.350
we were one of the few Jewish families in Bloomington,
Indiana,
and the fifties.

59
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.490
And that would not be true today.
Bloomington is a more cosmopolitan,

60
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:06.940
it's not quite Anarbor,
it's not San Francisco.
But,
uh,

61
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.000
but back then it was a very isolating place,
uh,

62
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.770
for Jewish families to be.
As a result,

63
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.150
I always felt like I was other in school and in my neighborhood,

64
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.820
our neighbors didn't like Jewish people.

65
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.300
The lofts where their name and they called the police.

66
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:30.160
If my brother and sister and I or our jogs set foot on their lawn,

67
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.720
and you can imagine the dares that my brother and sister and I had to one

68
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.740
another to run through their lawn when our parents were not watching.

69
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.820
When I went off to college in 1976 and came to fully understand and embrace that

70
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:46.900
I was a lesbian,

71
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.520
I did not suffer the way many people did and still do today.

72
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.430
That's why I say I was one of the lucky ones.

73
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.570
I had already felt different from my peers and I was used to that.

74
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.840
It was part of who I was and what I understood about the world.

75
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.760
I was also a skinny,

76
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.850
awkward kid who was ticklish and giggly and not all that concerned with fitting

77
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.120
in.
I was,

78
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.040
I wasn't afraid of losing status or jobs or any of those things that so many

79
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:16.150
people worry about.

80
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.620
I had never felt confident that those things would be mine in the first place.

81
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.820
So I arrived in Ann Arbor in 1978 and said about my mission of coming out and

82
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:32.410
completing my college education.
Somewhere along the way in those early years,

83
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:36.370
I got distracted and I've got a couple of my law clerks and an intern here,

84
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:39.490
and they can tell you I get distracted pretty quickly.
Um,

85
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.900
and this particular distraction brought me in the direction of becoming a

86
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:47.950
community organizer for lesbian and gay rights,
uh,

87
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.390
not as a paid position.

88
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.500
Now you hear President Obama was a community organizer and we all think that's

89
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:56.370
good.
Well,
uh,
we,

90
00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.950
we wasn't looked upon quite so favorably at the time.
Uh,
but I,

91
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.210
I did,
uh,
this work in all of the free time that I could find.

92
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.740
And from there I was drawn to looking at the labor movement as a vehicle for

93
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.200
social change.
In particular for women.

94
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.910
I help try to organize a union for clerical workers at the University of

95
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:21.220
Michigan.
There were over 3000 secretaries and,
uh,

96
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.230
we tried to organize a union and were unsuccessful by about 15 votes out of all

97
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:30.830
those,
uh,
clericals.
But as a result of that,

98
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:35.831
I decided to run for union steward at the University of Michigan Hospital where

99
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:40.160
I had a part time and later fulltime position.
Uh,
cleaning,
uh,

100
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.550
patient rooms working in the cafeteria.
Uh,

101
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.460
through that I and I just got that work to support myself,
uh,
going to school.

102
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.570
Um,

103
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.430
but I was elected to that position as a union steward and some years later I ran

104
00:06:55.431 --> 00:07:00.140
to become the full time chief negotiator for the University of Michigan Service

105
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:02.570
and maintenance employees.
So finally,

106
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:05.930
at that time I was a full time paid troublemaker,

107
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.680
but as time marched on and I grew older,

108
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:14.681
I wanted to have a family back in 1984 I met someone I would fall in love with

109
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:18.800
and have a nonlegal marriage too.
In 1989,

110
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.400
we raised three children together and finally we were married legally in 2013 in

111
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:30.041
Washington DC before marriage equality became the law of the land and possible

112
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:31.400
here in Michigan.

113
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So I went to law school in 1993 in hopes of finding a stable job,

114
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.000
a and a way to support my family.

115
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.850
After graduation from law school,

116
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:47.870
I had the enormous privilege of being hired to serve as a law clerk for a

117
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.960
federal judge in Detroit,
Judge Bernard Friedman.

118
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.940
And he's the judge who would ultimately strike Michigan's marriage law as

119
00:07:55.941 --> 00:08:00.170
unconstitutional and whose case would be among the three that reached the

120
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:04.820
supreme court in the United States and led to marriage equality throughout the

121
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:05.654
country.

122
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.920
I want to pause for a minute and just say something about judge Friedman.

123
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.940
I owe him a debt of gratitude for taking a chance on me.

124
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.360
I was an older student.
I had done this a,

125
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.190
it had been involved in the union work for 12 years between Undergrad and

126
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.380
graduate school and,
uh,

127
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.920
students I teach now and students often say to me,
my,

128
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:32.420
you took a lot of time off.
And I say,
no,
no,
no.
I wasn't taking time off.

129
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:35.360
I was just living my life.
That was my life.

130
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:39.300
It wasn't viewed as a way of getting to the next step.
Uh,

131
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.580
it was just what I was doing.
Uh,
but I was an older student.

132
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.720
I wasn't the traditional candidate that he was interviewing for a clerkship.

133
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.130
And little did he know I was pregnant during the interview.
I tried,

134
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.110
I hit it as well as I could.

135
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.470
I tried to communicate though to judge Friedman that I was a lesbian because I

136
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.720
just didn't want there to be any mistake about that.
Uh,
I had had some,

137
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.320
some difficult experiences with some incidents of,

138
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.940
of what would possibly be called discrimination,
um,

139
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.340
and some some violence and things that had happened and I didn't want there to

140
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:19.500
be a mistake.
Uh,

141
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.680
but I don't think judge Friedman picked up on what I was trying to say I learned

142
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:29.100
from,
but I learned from judge Friedman something I have never forgotten,

143
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.410
which is to be open minded,

144
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.760
to welcome those who are a little different and that should I ever be in a

145
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:39.270
position to get through a difficult to open door.

146
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.390
I would hold it open for others to come through.

147
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.200
I've lived by those principles ever since and I've had the enormous privilege to

148
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:52.410
hold the door open to people who are previously not been let in.

149
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.570
I know that there are many of you here today who live by this ideal as well.

150
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.520
We are the lucky ones.

151
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.610
We have come inside and we have the amazing chance to let others come along with

152
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:08.400
us,
which I believe is one of life's greatest privileges.

153
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.310
I went on to spend 14,

154
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.050
I spent three years with judge Friedman and then I spent 14 years as a civil

155
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:20.130
rights lawyer at the United States Department of Justice at the US attorney's

156
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:22.680
Office in Detroit.
Uh,

157
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.700
earlier I mentioned to you that my mother was an immigrant and my father was

158
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:28.860
from a family of meager means.

159
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.630
I was raised with a critical eye about the inequalities in this country,

160
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.300
but when I arrived at the US attorney's office and went to court and stood

161
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:44.301
before the judge on my cases where I was enforcing this country's incredible

162
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:47.670
civil rights laws and I would begin by saying,

163
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.620
my name is Judy Levy and I'm here on behalf of the United States of America.

164
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.100
I became a Patriot in some ways for the first time I was proud to be an American

165
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.260
and to be able to serve my country,
to make it a more fair and equal country.

166
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.350
And ultimately I think a better place for all of us.

167
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.930
So far as I was concerned,

168
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.820
my work as a federal prosecutor bringing civil rights cases,
fair lending,

169
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.660
fair housing,
including access for our support animals.

170
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:23.640
We have an animal in the autumn audience here.
Uh,
police misconduct cases,

171
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.230
disability rights cases,

172
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:30.231
voting rights and more was the greatest honor I could ever have imagined.

173
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.430
I'm fond of telling my students,
uh,

174
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.440
I teach a seminar or two at the U of m law school,
um,

175
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.770
that like I have told you I'm one of the lucky ones.

176
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.180
I tell them that not related to coming out are opening doors for others,

177
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.490
but because I truly,
truly believe I have never worked a day in my life.

178
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.300
I've had the enormous privilege of spending my days working in the sense of

179
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.210
work,
yes.

180
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:02.320
But engaging with and doing things that matter to me,

181
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.120
what I believe will make a positive difference in someone's life and what I hope

182
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:11.860
will make a contribution to our public lives together.
Uh,

183
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.660
I will end soon.
Uh,
but I first want to tell you just a little bit,
uh,

184
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:20.560
about how I ended up with this ridiculous title,
your honor,

185
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.160
or simply judge instead of my name.
Uh,

186
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.250
it was the result entirely an exclusively of the kindness and thoughtfulness of

187
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:31.750
others.
I have.

188
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.340
I was contacted sitting at my desk in Detroit working on a case by a young

189
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:41.290
lawyer in Washington DC who was working with a progressive social justice

190
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:44.750
oriented organization.
He said that his group,
uh,

191
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.880
was aware that there were some vacancies on the Federal Bench in Detroit.

192
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.860
There are about 22 judges,

193
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.280
federal judges in the Eastern District of Michigan,
which is,
uh,
where,
uh,

194
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.700
the bench that I'm a part of.

195
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:03.270
And his organization had done some phone calling and emailing and things like

196
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:08.821
that to try to come up with some names of candidates in Michigan that they might

197
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:10.420
recommend,
uh,

198
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:15.010
for the position and my name had come to their attention at that time.

199
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:17.350
I almost hung up the phone,
uh,

200
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.170
because this is not something that had ever occurred to me.

201
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:25.060
I was not as a young child wishing or hoping or thinking of becoming a federal

202
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:28.060
judge.
I did not know lawyers.
Uh,

203
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.900
and it was nothing that was a part of my life.
Uh,

204
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.640
but at the time that I got that call,

205
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:38.641
a colleague and friend was in my office and she encouraged me to keep talking.

206
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.280
And the rest is history.
I applied for the position.

207
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.090
I was interviewed by some 27 lawyers in Detroit.

208
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.340
My name was recommended to the White House and ultimately President Obama

209
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.370
nominated me and I was confirmed by the Senate in March of 2014 I now have a

210
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:02.821
caseload of approximately 200 criminal and civil cases randomly assigned as they

211
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:08.881
come in to any one of the 22 federal judges in the Eastern District of Michigan.

212
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.650
And I just want to say some,

213
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.670
a little bit about the position and I hope that you'll ask questions about

214
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:18.070
anything that's interesting to you.
Uh,

215
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.080
but one of the things that has been a challenge for me in this position is that

216
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:27.880
just when our country seemed to have a national consensus that we're against

217
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:31.600
mass incarceration.
I have become an incarcerator.

218
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.600
I conduct civil and criminal trials.

219
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.810
I take guilty pleas and I sentenced defendants and do all of the miscellaneous

220
00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:43.720
duties that are required for a judge to do.

221
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.400
It's an awesome responsibility and one that I welcome,

222
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.080
but I don't always feel that I'm the smartest person for the job or the most

223
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:58.450
qualified or the most knowledgeable.
In fact,
I can assure you up,

224
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.090
I am not,
but I know that when I enter the courtroom,

225
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:06.380
I give it all that I have and that I welcome everyone who walks into my

226
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:09.230
courtroom with respect and kindness,

227
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.910
no matter whether they walk in the front door or through the lockup in
handcuffs.

228
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:19.490
And I ensure that everyone has their day in court and is heard in a meaningful

229
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:24.491
way that much I can promise to all of you and I try to promise it to everyone

230
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:28.410
who comes in.
Uh,
beyond that,
I,

231
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.580
I believe I have never worked a day in my life and that as hard as I might work

232
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:38.420
in a certain sense to try to get each case right and to bring fresh eyes and a

233
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:40.190
fair heart to every case,

234
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.560
I still don't feel that I'm ever working when I'm,
uh,

235
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.170
on the bench or in the court or,
or working on cases.

236
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.440
And I realized the other day that sometimes opening doors for others is actually

237
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:55.610
not quite enough.

238
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.640
Sometimes you have to hold the door open so that others can see inside for c

239
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:06.830
inside for a while and begin to develop a dream or an idea that they can live

240
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:11.600
inside where that door leads to.
I know that each of you has done that,

241
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.980
uh,
for others.
You,
you work in such an interesting and novel and,

242
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:16.910
uh,

243
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.910
important place and opening the doors so that others can get a glimpse of what

244
00:16:21.951 --> 00:16:24.710
you're able to do here is so important.

245
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.750
I'd like to close my remarks with a,

246
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.800
a quote from someone I have admired for decades.
Maybe,
uh,

247
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.680
you all know as much or more about him than I do.
Uh,
it's,
uh,
uh,

248
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.210
Bayard Rustin,
uh,
Mr Rustin,
as you may know,

249
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:46.211
work tired tirelessly alongside Martin Luther King Jr and other civil rights

250
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:51.290
activists in the 60s in their common quest for racial equality.

251
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.770
I might add that many of the historical accounts of the civil rights movement of

252
00:16:56.841 --> 00:17:01.040
the 60s,
uh,
don't mention that they are dressed in,
was gay.

253
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.900
Rustin said this on the subject of protesting and fighting for equality.

254
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.190
He said,
quote,
we need in every day and every community,

255
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.740
a group of angelic troublemakers.

256
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.340
I imagine as I look and see some of you here,

257
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.870
that you are angelic troublemakers in your own families,

258
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.960
in this office and in the community.
Sorry,
Carl,

259
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:28.340
I'm not trying to make trouble in your office,
uh,
and in your communities.

260
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.020
And I think this is a good thing.
Change is hard,
but it's good.

261
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.100
And if it's achieved in an open and honest way,
it can be lat,

262
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.590
very lasting,
uh,
and,
and make a difference.
So I,

263
00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:43.750
I thank you for inviting me and,
um,

264
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.810
that's a little bit of my story and I'd love to hear any questions you might

265
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:52.140
have or ideas of your own and I understand that we need to have a microphone for

266
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:56.350
those who have questions and there's one right there.
Oh,
all right.

267
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.770
<v 2>Hi.
Thank you.
Is this working?
Okay.
Thank you so much for coming.
First of all,</v>

268
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:07.130
I actually have kind of a two part question.
Um,

269
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.820
the first being that like if you were walking watching the last presidential

270
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:12.301
debate,

271
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:17.301
we heard the two nominees talk about their strategy for selecting supreme court

272
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.710
nominees.
And um,

273
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:24.450
I found honestly both candidates to be very political in what they said.

274
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.240
You know,
Hillary Trump is whatever to do as divide.

275
00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:32.460
Hillary was also saying stuff about how she wanted a candidate who would support

276
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:35.010
abortion and a candidate who would repeal citizen's United.

277
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:39.240
It was a very explicitly political,
um,
description.

278
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:42.900
Whereas I feel like President Obama selecting Merrick Garland was saying,
no,

279
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:45.150
I want someone who just looks at the loft fairly.

280
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:47.490
I'm thinks about people but looks at the law.

281
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.530
So I'd love to hear your kind of opinion on the implications of presidential

282
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:56.910
candidates and how they choose their nominees and what they say about their

283
00:18:56.911 --> 00:19:00.900
nominating process.
And also just hear about your experience.
You know,

284
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:05.901
you were saying balancing the fact that for many years you were a very political

285
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.210
and activist person,

286
00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:13.260
but now you're on a bench where you do have to look at cases sort of

287
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:16.140
dispassionately and how you've,
how you've balanced that.

288
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.180
<v 0>Well,
thank you for the question.
In terms of,
um,</v>

289
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.910
anything partisan at once,
I,

290
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.720
even though I was selected by President Obama confirmed by the Senate,

291
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:31.670
once I'm in the position,
I am not permitted to make any,
uh,

292
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.750
partisan remarks or comments.
I can vote.

293
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.780
But only if it's not a caucus where Democrats go in this store and Republicans

294
00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:42.450
go in this door,
uh,

295
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:47.420
I cannot fundraise and I'm not supposed to come that in any way on,
uh,

296
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.580
candidates that would favor one or another.

297
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:51.590
But I don't see your question is asking,

298
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.970
did I like the way one candidate defined who they would nominate?

299
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.600
That the only thing I can say is I,

300
00:19:58.601 --> 00:20:02.840
I listened to some of those remarks and I have a feeling of campaign is very

301
00:20:02.841 --> 00:20:07.310
different from reality and that when it comes down to it,
they're,

302
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.840
the process may look very different once a candidate is in the position.

303
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.400
I know that President Obama made remarks that,
uh,

304
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.630
he thought that the bench should be more diverse than it is.
Um,

305
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:21.740
and he,

306
00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:26.741
he was talking about qualities he was looking for in judges as opposed to a

307
00:20:26.811 --> 00:20:30.530
specific position that they might take on a case.
Um,

308
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.500
so that's probably all that I can,
uh,
say really in,

309
00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:38.830
in response to the first part of your question.
Uh,

310
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.810
in terms of the process itself,
um,
the,

311
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.660
it's such an interesting process because you're not supposed to say if presented

312
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:52.750
with a case by a union,

313
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.190
would you rule in favor of the union or something like that.
Um,
but the,

314
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
but the process is still one designed to figure out if you in some way share,

315
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.990
um,
the,

316
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:12.070
the philosophy that the administration that would be appointing you is looking

317
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:14.350
for.
And I,
and I,

318
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.280
I can't really say what President Obama's judicial philosophy is,

319
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.490
but I know what was communicated to me was the idea that I would have an open

320
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:27.310
mind,
that I would bring my life experiences,

321
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:30.310
which may not be the same as,
um,

322
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.480
people who have not experienced some of the,

323
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.470
the things that I've experienced.
I had an incident where,
uh,

324
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.660
my then partner now spouse and I lived in an apartment on West Hoover street

325
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:47.800
here in Anarbor.
The apartment manager was coming home drunk,

326
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.690
getting ready to,
uh,

327
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.840
physically assault his wife and I opened our door and to see if I needed to call

328
00:21:55.121 --> 00:21:55.900
the police.

329
00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.900
He turned on us and used a very sexist and vulgar and gay epithets and some

330
00:22:03.401 --> 00:22:08.230
racist epithets against us and physically attacked us.
My,

331
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.820
uh,
spouse went to the hospital with a blood coming down her.
I,

332
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.600
we both went to the hospital.
Um,
so I've had those.

333
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.660
I've been a crime victim in that sense.
Um,

334
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.540
and had other experiences that the,

335
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.850
the White House was aware of by the time my application got there.
Uh,

336
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.290
and I think that went into the selection is saying here's somebody who when a

337
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:33.940
litigant comes in the door,

338
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:39.150
won't see things through a lens of not understanding what can happen in life and

339
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:43.600
what harm can be fall people.

340
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.910
So I don't know if that answers your question.
You're welcome.

341
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.340
Is there anyone that's,
yeah.

342
00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.130
<v 3>First of all,
thank you so much for coming.
Glad to be here.
Excited to have you.</v>

343
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.490
Um,
my question is centered around,
um,
you know,

344
00:23:04.491 --> 00:23:09.491
now that LGBT or gay marriage is now legal across the country,

345
00:23:09.571 --> 00:23:12.050
like there's still a lot of progress to be made.

346
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:16.160
What do you think are the most important issues,
um,

347
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.970
whether legal or political right now for the LGBT community?

348
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.000
<v 0>You know,</v>

349
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
that's an interesting question in terms of legal issues.

350
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.990
I know that,
uh,

351
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.020
there is not protection for a lesbian and gay people or people with fluid gender

352
00:23:35.131 --> 00:23:39.480
identities and that sort of thing.
Uh,
in the workplace.
Um,

353
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.540
some states in some cities and some counties have passed ordinances and,

354
00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:49.220
and sort of thing,
but there is no national protection and,

355
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.900
uh,
built into the,
our country's civil rights laws.

356
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.440
And that just seems like such an important thing for everyone to have some kind

357
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.300
of protection against discrimination on the job.

358
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.810
There are ways that some of the existing statutes are being litigated.

359
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.910
Uh,
these issues are being litigated under current existing laws.

360
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:18.911
And I'm trying to see whether they can fit this issue into sex discrimination

361
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.500
prohibitions and things like that.
Um,
so,
so that,

362
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:29.400
that's what comes to my mind is the importance of the workplace in terms of what

363
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.930
we spent so much time at work,
uh,

364
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:36.370
all of us do in this country and to,

365
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:41.590
to not know that you can be safe at work coming out if your employer holds some

366
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:46.910
sort of bias or animus is,
is worrisome.

367
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.113
<v 4>Thank you.</v>

368
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.240
<v 5>Hey,
um,</v>

369
00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.310
so in your presentation you talked about mass incarceration and kind of

370
00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:05.120
mandatory minimum sentences and I was wondering if you could kind of expand on

371
00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:09.680
that.
And then I've also read in some cases where judges have actually gone and

372
00:25:09.681 --> 00:25:12.380
visited those folks that they've sentenced.
Um,

373
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:15.710
and I'm wondering if you've ever done that sort of outreach to the folks that

374
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:16.640
you've seen in your courtroom.

375
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.430
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a good question.
Well,</v>

376
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:22.150
in terms of this whole issue of mass incarceration,

377
00:25:22.151 --> 00:25:27.130
there are so many possible reasons for it that our prison population has

378
00:25:27.131 --> 00:25:31.150
exploded.
Um,
and,
uh,

379
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.450
mandatory minimum.

380
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:37.451
So I have some cases that come to me where I have no choice but to sentence

381
00:25:37.511 --> 00:25:39.040
someone to,
uh,

382
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.420
generally that there's a five year mandatory minimum in a good number of cases

383
00:25:43.421 --> 00:25:48.040
that I have 10 and 20 year mandatory minimums for people who are,

384
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.530
uh,
considered to be armed career criminals or career criminals.

385
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:58.750
Uh,
some of those are drug drug cases,
drug law related,

386
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:04.330
uh,
and um,
it is a very painful thing.

387
00:26:04.331 --> 00:26:09.331
One of the things that's important to me and sentencing is to look very,

388
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.380
uh,
is to have the conversation with the defendant,
not with the prosecutor,

389
00:26:14.381 --> 00:26:15.850
not with the defendant's lawyer,

390
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:21.090
but to be able to talk to the person I'm sentencing and to look into his or her

391
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.510
eyes.
And mostly it's his eyes,
but there are some female defendants,

392
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:26.680
uh,

393
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.330
and make sure that I am able to communicate to them what this sentence is and

394
00:26:31.331 --> 00:26:35.260
why.
And there has been at least,
there've been more than one,

395
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:40.210
but one case where I truly did not believe there was a mandatory minimum that

396
00:26:40.211 --> 00:26:43.180
this person should face more than two to three months.

397
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.980
And I had no choice but to sentence him to five years.

398
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:51.550
And it was not a just and fair sentence,
which I'm required to,
uh,

399
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.990
under the sentencing laws on the required to impose a just and fair sentence

400
00:26:57.481 --> 00:26:58.680
that is sufficient.

401
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.690
This is the law but not greater than necessary to achieve the objectives of,

402
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.740
of the law.
And I couldn't do that.
Um,
but,
but I still,

403
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.140
but I had to do it.
I can't,

404
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.280
like I had to do it in terms of visiting people,

405
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:16.920
there are several federal judges who have done that.

406
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:22.250
It has come under some legal criticism of would you learn something?

407
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:27.360
I don't know.
I don't really understand what the criticism is.
I haven't done it.

408
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.620
Uh,
I'm new enough at this that,
um,
I just sort of had,

409
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:37.530
haven't gotten enough free space in my mind even to think about how to do that

410
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.550
in the federal system.
There are beds just like any other system,

411
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.510
but they're all over the country and we have a federal prison in Myelin,

412
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:50.310
Michigan.
But it's a medium to low security prison and so are,

413
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.173
it does not,

414
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.050
it has a medical facility but it's not for people with specific medical or

415
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:56.070
mental health issues.

416
00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:01.370
A lot of the defendants I sentence are dispersed all over the country and so

417
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.970
it's not as easy as just driving to Milan and,
and talking to people.

418
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:11.940
But I'm very interested in prisoner reentry and trying to get connected.

419
00:28:11.941 --> 00:28:16.660
There's two judges in Detroit who are working on meeting prisoners,
uh,

420
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.260
defendants as they come back into the community.

421
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.700
And so it's my hope to spend some time with that project.

422
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.703
Thank you.
Yeah.

423
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.913
<v 4>Okay.</v>

424
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.340
<v 3>I'm actually wanting to jump off,
um,</v>

425
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.250
colonel's question one I wanted to know,
um,

426
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.890
do you have any,
uh,

427
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:44.730
levers internally to either express displeasure or,
uh,

428
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.090
basically annotate or measure how often you are handing out a sentence that is a

429
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.920
required but that you feel is sort of not within your discretion?

430
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.023
And then second,

431
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.510
I would just jump off maybe your a community organizing experience.

432
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.900
I think that the issue is something that's a galvanizing but sort of difficult

433
00:29:05.271 --> 00:29:09.200
from a community perspective to know exactly where the levers are and if you

434
00:29:09.201 --> 00:29:12.040
have any insights on sort of a citizens where we're,

435
00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.110
where the soft points are within that just put to

436
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.860
<v 0>to create more change.
Yes.
Yeah.
Uh Huh.
Well thank you.</v>

437
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:22.950
First of all on the sentencing issue,
um,

438
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.960
I'm keeping track,
uh,
in a excel spreadsheet.

439
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:30.980
Is that a Google product?
No.
Okay.
Sorry.

440
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.580
Not some sort of thing.
I'm keeping track of it.
Um,

441
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.360
and uh,
because Eh,

442
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:43.180
such an emotionally and exhausting,

443
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.830
uh,
process to sentence somebody and um,

444
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.820
I don't even trust myself to remember carefully enough.

445
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:55.270
So I have a chart that has the name,

446
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.570
that sentencing guidelines that are the,

447
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:03.690
what the United States sentencing commission recommends the sentence be.

448
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.400
And then if I have discretion,

449
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:10.270
which the vast majority of cases I can go dramatically below and above,

450
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:14.800
I have to articulate the reasons on the record or I'll be reversed.
But,

451
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.210
um,
I,

452
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.630
I am consistently sentencing at leat below and sometimes significantly below the

453
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:24.280
sentencing guidelines,

454
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:29.281
but are sentences in the federal system are normally long.

455
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:34.650
So even saying that I'm sentencing people generally below the guidelines by

456
00:30:35.411 --> 00:30:37.990
articulating the reasons for that,
uh,

457
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:42.991
is to say I'm regularly imposing five and six and seven and 10 year sentences.

458
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:47.440
Um,
so I do put the reasons on the record.

459
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:52.441
I also put a small paragraph in the judgment that's entered that can be studied

460
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.740
by anybody who,
who wants to,
um,

461
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.830
what the reasons are for going below,
uh,

462
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:04.730
what the sentencing commission recommends.
Um,
and,
and I,

463
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:09.730
I keep track of it all.
Uh,
in the one instance where I thought that the,

464
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.020
uh,
mandatory minimum and the way the case was charged,

465
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:15.880
it's not just the mandatory minimums.

466
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:20.350
Prosecutors have charging decisions to charge somebody with a crime that has a

467
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:24.970
minimum or not charge them with something lesser where there's,
uh,

468
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:30.250
the whole thing disturbed me profoundly and I still see his face.

469
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:34.780
I closed my eyes and I can see many of these defendants faces.
And,

470
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:39.370
um,
it just disturbs me terribly.
So I,
so I keep,

471
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.180
keep track of it somewhat that way as well.
Um,

472
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.230
in terms of areas for change,
one thing,

473
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:52.180
this is just my personal,
I um,

474
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.490
was very involved as a civil rights lawyer in Fair Housing Litigation in trying,

475
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.240
uh,
in the Detroit metropolitan area.
We have,
uh,

476
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.750
one of the most racially segregated,
uh,

477
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.080
communities in our country.

478
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.060
Every now and then Milwaukee,
Bree beats us out.
Sometimes Chicago beats us out,

479
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:17.440
but Detroit's always competing for the top,
the Detroit metropolitan area.

480
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:18.990
And um,

481
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:25.050
there has got to be something that can be done to increase racial and other

482
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:32.311
diversity in people's neighborhoods and make access to housing fair in this

483
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:37.420
country.
Um,
and this isn't even touching upon affordable housing,

484
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:38.583
but it's,

485
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:43.240
it's an issue that just deeply worries me when I see how the,

486
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.960
the racial,
if you ever go on altar road on the east side of Detroit,

487
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.660
you've got Detroit here,
you've got alter road,

488
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.230
you've got gross point on one side of the street,

489
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:56.990
there are black people walking on the other side.

490
00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.650
There are only white people walking.
There are white businesses on one side,

491
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:05.651
black businesses on the other side and there is something going on to make sure

492
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:09.740
that people don't cross that street.
And uh,

493
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.380
those things just worry me about our country and about access to education and

494
00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:20.381
jobs and transportation and healthcare and food and,

495
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.280
um,
just the basics.
But,
so I,

496
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.290
I just hope that people will keep focused on that and look at ways to support

497
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:36.611
ordinances that increased housing opportunities and strengthen penalties for

498
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:40.930
people who violate fair housing laws.
I don't,

499
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:45.050
it's not that easy to figure out how to do these things,

500
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.690
but those things concern me a lot.

501
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.613
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

502
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.250
<v 2>Um,
I wanted to go back to a point that you made earlier about how there were</v>

503
00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:03.251
instances where the minimum sentencing for somebody was much greater than what

504
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:07.400
you actually thought was fitting with your judicial obligation to issue,

505
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:10.680
just unfair and not excessive sentences.
Um,

506
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.700
I was curious how those kind of inconsistencies pop up where a minimum sentence

507
00:34:16.081 --> 00:34:20.630
is in direct contradiction to what you consider to be a judicial responsibility.

508
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:25.220
I assume that situations like that arise from someone thinking that you know,

509
00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:29.450
a certain minimum sentence is what is required for that crime,

510
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:33.350
but then what's the process when it starts to become apparent that that's not

511
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:33.730
the case?

512
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.120
<v 0>That's a good question because the way the mandatory minimums get,</v>

513
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:41.020
uh,
come about is congress.

514
00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.010
Congress passes a law saying,
um,

515
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.920
if you've had two prior drug offenses and a third,

516
00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:52.840
then you're a career criminal and so a mandatory 10 years or whatever the

517
00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:57.841
statute might say and then the person gets charged with that crime is most

518
00:34:58.481 --> 00:35:03.481
certainly guilty of the crime pleads guilty and open court and then I have no

519
00:35:03.491 --> 00:35:07.420
choice but to sentence them in between the guilty plea and the sentencing.

520
00:35:07.421 --> 00:35:12.130
I'd get something phenomenal that I wish I could share with the world.

521
00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:13.240
But they're confidential,

522
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:18.070
which is called a pre sentence report where we have an incredible probation

523
00:35:18.071 --> 00:35:22.570
department that goes out to the defendant's homes,

524
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.260
interviews,
the defendant,
family members,
teachers,

525
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.130
all sorts of people get interviewed to determine,

526
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.200
to tell me the history and characteristics of this individual who is this
person.

527
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.000
And I read,

528
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.010
I was reading two of them last night actually and I just,

529
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:46.310
I just wanted to shred it because one of them was someone who's being,

530
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.870
uh,
who would pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Those,

531
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.003
uh,

532
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.330
the sentencing guidelines for being a felon in possession of a firearm are

533
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.480
enormously high and we have a serious violent crime problem in Detroit.

534
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:07.020
And so I don't fault anyone for trying to resolve that,

535
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.530
but I read his pre sentence report and this individual was born to a family with

536
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.680
meant serious and profound mental health problems for the mother and the father.

537
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.510
Addiction problems,
violence problems.
Half of his family is in prison,

538
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.010
the other half are marginally not employed.

539
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.410
I in the legal market,
uh,

540
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.700
legal economy and uh,

541
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.180
he stopped going to school in sixth grade.
He,
I mean he,

542
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.310
his conviction,

543
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:46.340
he had a criminal conviction at seven years old for receipt of stolen property,

544
00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:51.480
which is a bicycle that somebody gave him.
He says six year old and that's,

545
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:53.850
I'm to take that into consideration in sentencing.

546
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.300
Then he had a conviction at 13,
at 15,
at 16.

547
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.060
It just goes on and now and so,

548
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.050
so that's how it comes to my attention.
Okay,
yes,

549
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.760
you violated this law,

550
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.330
but nothing in our society.

551
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.980
We are all responsible for this.
We did not support this young man.

552
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:18.540
This child did not have the basic necessities of daily life.

553
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.490
And now I'm facing,
uh,

554
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.840
a decision about what's appropriate for him.

555
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.260
And I'm just left with thinking our mental healthcare system is deficient and

556
00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:36.150
devoid of real meaningful options.
The just physical health care.

557
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:39.510
This young man didn't have food as a child.
Uh,

558
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.230
and the educational system couldn't accommodate his disability,

559
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.300
cognitive impairments,
and he goes out and commits crimes.

560
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.080
So that leads to a disconnect that the solution is now for him to spend many of

561
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:59.280
his formative early adult years in prison.
So it,
it comes to me

562
00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.370
<v 6>through that route.</v>

563
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.640
So yeah.

564
00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:10.730
<v 5>I just want to ask a quick question.
Sure.
What sort of advice would you have for,</v>

565
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.920
for a young person or maybe young lawyer who'd maybe worked in public interests

566
00:38:14.921 --> 00:38:19.560
before now in the private sector and kind of trying to find some direction?
Um,

567
00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.850
and what advice from your career,

568
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.310
<v 0>you know,
um,</v>

569
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.500
one thing is to have an open mind about what,

570
00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.420
uh,

571
00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:34.420
what might help you or that person develop in the direction they want to.

572
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.060
For instance,
when I got,
um,
hired at the US Attorney's office,

573
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:45.300
I was interested in doing civil rights work and the position I got hired for was

574
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:50.590
not that public.
I ultimately worked my way into creating the position.

575
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:52.180
It didn't exist and then doing it.

576
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:56.890
But I got hired to defend the government when it was sued in civil litigation.

577
00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.750
I worked to keep people who are undocumented out of the country for the first

578
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:05.500
year.
It wasn't work that I,
my heart was in,

579
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.310
but I saw that I could learn litigation,
hi,

580
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:13.270
could get the kind of support and direction and training that I needed to be a

581
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:17.020
good lawyer.
And then I found a way within that system to say,

582
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.080
to pitch these ideas of what we could really do.

583
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.530
So one thing is just to keep a really open mind.

584
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:27.670
Sometimes a corporate law firm is the best step to getting training so you can

585
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:31.900
get where you want to go.
Um,
so that's not very concrete,

586
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:35.980
but I always really,
the students I work with at the U of m law school,

587
00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:39.820
I really encouraged them to keep really close tabs on what,

588
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.160
what they care about the most,

589
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.240
so that they don't lose sight of that while they're taking these steps that

590
00:39:46.241 --> 00:39:49.900
might get them there.
So,
yeah.

591
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.200
<v 5>Um,</v>

592
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.200
I'm curious about your thoughts on the mechanism of the preemptory challenge and

593
00:39:58.611 --> 00:40:03.611
how that relates to a racial disparity and to access specifically to a fair

594
00:40:05.151 --> 00:40:05.840
trial.

595
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.840
And it's something that's just like an interest or curiosity for me and I've

596
00:40:11.581 --> 00:40:16.581
tried to wrap my mind around the mechanism and whether we're dealing with

597
00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:20.810
something that is the,
um,

598
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:26.130
the best of a lot of bad options.
Or if you were given the chance to,
uh,

599
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.690
design a different jury selection process,
what you would,

600
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:33.660
<v 0>wow.
Interesting.
So for those who aren't familiar with peremptory challenges,</v>

601
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.640
when you select a jury,
you,
um,
each side can,

602
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.660
can ask that jurors be struck for cause.
Um,

603
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.440
Carl lives on Ferris Street,
this thing took place on fair street.

604
00:40:46.441 --> 00:40:51.420
He can't possibly be fair about fair street.
So,
and so I'd say,

605
00:40:51.421 --> 00:40:56.200
yeah,
that makes sense.
We're going to thank and excuse you because you can't,
uh,

606
00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:00.330
be an unbiased juror in this case.
And once that's done,

607
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.950
then the lawyers for both sides get a certain number of just for free

608
00:41:04.951 --> 00:41:09.210
challenges,
just their own gut tells them so and so,

609
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.860
I don't want so and so on my jury.
And in that instance,

610
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.940
you are entirely relying on bias and stereotype.

611
00:41:17.941 --> 00:41:21.630
You've met the Juror for all of 20 minutes.

612
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.640
You've asked some basic questions and you have this feeling as a lawyer that

613
00:41:26.641 --> 00:41:29.940
there's something going on that I can't put my finger on.

614
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.890
And I don't think that person should be on this jury.
And there are some,

615
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.110
their supreme court law that says you can do it for no reason at all.

616
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:42.350
You can do it for your personal reason.
You can strike these people,

617
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:45.500
but you can't do it based on race,
sex,

618
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:51.080
religion maybe.
And the attorney general,
uh,

619
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.110
Obama's last attorney general and it's continued into,

620
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:59.111
this attorney general said Doj lawyers are prohibited from striking people based

621
00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:04.440
on sexual orientation and gender identity.
But there's no law on that as a,

622
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:09.320
at the supreme court level at least yet.
But,
um,

623
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:14.950
I'd be a little bit loath to get rid of the peremptory challenge process

624
00:42:15.321 --> 00:42:17.180
because,
uh,

625
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:22.810
really all of jury selection is about stereotypes and biases.

626
00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:24.530
And it's a terrible thing to say,

627
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:29.770
but you don't have much time and you have to just get a sense of the person's

628
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:33.410
posture,
whether they're mumbling,
whether they're looking straight at,

629
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.140
you have nothing to go on a,

630
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:40.190
and in criminal cases your liberty is in their hands.

631
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.980
And so,
um,
it's,

632
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.060
it's sort of the only light gets just sort of a safe guard we have.

633
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:52.061
If you feel that the person could potentially be unstable or something like

634
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:53.300
that.
Um,

635
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:58.570
I work pretty hard to avoid because strikes for my juror permitting people,

636
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:05.830
lawyers to strike jurors for cause when I suspect it's a discriminatory animus.

637
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.780
And I'll s we had a case of two,
um,

638
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.130
Pakistani Muslims,
uh,

639
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:16.910
on trial for a very serious,
uh,

640
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.200
federal criminal case.

641
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.290
And there was a Muslim juror.
Well,

642
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.950
I actually didn't never asked him his religion,

643
00:43:24.951 --> 00:43:27.290
but he worked at a mosque and his family went to the,

644
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.570
my sort of gave me the feeling that possibly he was a member of that
corrugation.

645
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.770
Uh,
and uh,
there was some,
well,
I don't know if he should be.
Yes,

646
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:41.180
he can be on this jury.
That's not a reason for him not to be on this.
Jerry.
Uh,

647
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:45.410
and he did serve on the jury and the defendants were found guilty on all counts.

648
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.360
Um,
and he didn't seem to hesitate to vote for guilt.
Um,
so,

649
00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:54.980
so I try to do my part in rooting out anything that might be discriminatory,

650
00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.400
uh,
have a discriminatory motive.
Um,

651
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.370
and then sort of let the lawyers do their part.

652
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:05.183
Yeah.

653
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.340
<v 5>Quick question for you.
Thanks for joining us today.
By the way,</v>

654
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:12.990
I'm kind of taking more like macro look at a lot of the topics you've talked

655
00:44:12.991 --> 00:44:14.290
about here today.
Um,

656
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:19.200
I really love how kind of like positive and how,
um,

657
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:23.340
you see your work as not really even being work.
Um,

658
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:28.050
in just hearing some about your background,
sexual orientation,

659
00:44:28.051 --> 00:44:32.040
things that have happened against you in your life that you know really are

660
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.690
unique and could affect different people in different ways.

661
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:39.300
What do you credit,
um,

662
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:44.210
in your life that helps you have such a kind of high level view on things and,

663
00:44:44.211 --> 00:44:46.820
and really just being able to see things in a,

664
00:44:46.821 --> 00:44:48.870
in a very clear and positive light.

665
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.110
<v 0>Oh,
well that's nice of you to say.
Oh,
I,</v>

666
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.830
I appreciate your question just because of what you said in your question.

667
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.230
Um,
I don't know.
I've just side,

668
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:04.770
I don't know how it got great.

669
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:09.240
I had great parents and I've got a brother and sister who are really great and

670
00:45:09.241 --> 00:45:11.730
friends and family.

671
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:16.770
I've got the three really great kids who keep me really,

672
00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.600
uh,
going a lot.
Um,
uh,

673
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.780
so I'm not really sure except that I just feel like I have been so fortunate to

674
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:32.001
have opportunities that others haven't had and I just don't want to mess up and,

675
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.240
and,
and not take advantage of the opportunities.

676
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:42.370
So I wish I could answer your question better.
So

677
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.000
thank you though.

678
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.600
<v 5>Hi.
Thank you for coming.
Um,
I just had a really quick question about,</v>

679
00:45:50.601 --> 00:45:54.330
I know you've worked a lot in the LGBT space,
Huh.
And I'm actually,
uh,

680
00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.110
I'm an LGBT and I came from Florida,
which I'm sure as you know,

681
00:45:57.111 --> 00:46:00.950
is not the most opening place.
Yeah.
Um,
and so for people here in Ann Arbor,

682
00:46:00.951 --> 00:46:02.120
it must've seemed like,
hey,
you know,

683
00:46:02.121 --> 00:46:04.580
things are going in the right direction and then was going great.

684
00:46:04.581 --> 00:46:08.240
But I have a lot of friends in Florida,
um,
who,
you know,
are constantly,
you know,

685
00:46:08.241 --> 00:46:11.240
the laws could change any day.
Yeah.
And they could be under a state,

686
00:46:11.241 --> 00:46:15.050
which is a very highly republican run.
Um,
and could go under it,
you know,

687
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.340
obviously issues.

688
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.570
So my questions stems from the facts that you've worked with both the,
I mean,

689
00:46:20.571 --> 00:46:24.200
from being a lawyer and the Doj and being,

690
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:28.010
I'm now a district attorney or I mean a judge.
Um,

691
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:32.330
do you feel that that could happen that any day the administration could change

692
00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:34.250
and then laws could become back to where they were?

693
00:46:34.251 --> 00:46:37.550
Or do you feel there's enough legal precedents now to where that be really hard

694
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.370
to,
uh,
redirect the direction that we've gone in?

695
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.130
<v 0>No,</v>

696
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:45.630
I think your question is really important because I always hear well now that we

697
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:49.080
have marriage equality,
everything's okay for the gay people.

698
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:54.240
And I don't feel like everything's okay for the gay people.
Um,

699
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:59.280
and try it.
Like I still try to figure out,

700
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.800
is it okay to be affectionate with my spouse in public?

701
00:47:02.801 --> 00:47:06.010
Sometimes here in Ann Arbor,
I still have,

702
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.240
there's sometimes a hesitation just to figure out,

703
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:13.860
just to look around and make sure things are okay.
Um,

704
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:18.610
and so I feel like even if we don't sort,

705
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.940
sort of suddenly have repressive laws,

706
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:26.180
that we still have a long way to go to bring people along to be fully embraced

707
00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:32.170
and welcomed and,
um,

708
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.260
considered to be equal and healthy and normal or typical or whatever word we're

709
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:40.750
gonna use.
So,

710
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:46.010
and I do think that there are areas where votes are being taken up to limit

711
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.760
LGBT,
well,

712
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:53.620
all of the bathroom bills of who can go to the bathroom for God's sake,

713
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.450
um,
in which bathroom.

714
00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.310
And so I think there are laws being passed that are repressive and are trying to

715
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:04.500
push back.
Uh,
so,
eh,
so I,

716
00:48:04.501 --> 00:48:07.060
I think it is possible for those things to happen.

717
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:12.330
I think it's also so wonderful that there's enough of a movement to respond to

718
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:16.930
that.
And even with the North Carolina Bathroom Bill,

719
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:21.700
the Department of Justice says,
no,
our government says that's not okay.

720
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.710
Uh,
so there's,
when we see these pushing back,

721
00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:30.280
there's also pushing forward.
So,
so I think that's,

722
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.400
there's a lot of room to be optimistic at least.

723
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.490
All right,

724
00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.300
<v 3>a final question here.
Um,
um,</v>

725
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.390
thank you so much for coming in today.
Um,

726
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.890
and imparting your knowledge appointments.
I have a just a quick question.
Um,

727
00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:50.760
with Colin,
cap permit cap new right now is doing a lot of protesting,

728
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:54.420
uh,
for some issues that are,
are,
are pretty prevalent here within the country.

729
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.980
And I was wondering from your perspective,

730
00:48:55.981 --> 00:48:59.830
what can we do to impact things in the legal realm,
um,

731
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:03.890
to start making things a little bit better instead of maybe being out here

732
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:06.480
taking a knee during the national anthem.

733
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:13.780
<v 0>I really think if I look at two legal cases there with me for just a minute,</v>

734
00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.920
we had Bowers versus Hardwick in 1980,
what,
four,

735
00:49:18.921 --> 00:49:21.050
six,
1986,

736
00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:25.010
I got a couple of law clerks came with me.
Okay.

737
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.040
And that's where the supreme court said that there was a challenge to a Georgia

738
00:49:31.521 --> 00:49:34.220
sodomy laws that um,

739
00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.820
there is no right to homosexual sodomy and all this sort of language was used in

740
00:49:40.161 --> 00:49:42.680
their insulting language that that's what it was really about.

741
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.920
And the laws were upheld as constitutional.

742
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:50.180
Fast forward 12 or so years and we'd get Lawrence versus Texas.

743
00:49:50.181 --> 00:49:55.181
And it comes out the other way with language about love and family and what

744
00:49:55.311 --> 00:49:58.790
happened between Bowers and Lawrence protesting happened.

745
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:03.560
People took the knees,
so to speak,
on behalf of lesbian and gay rights.

746
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:08.620
And there was a huge effort in small towns,

747
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:14.050
big towns in Ann Arbor in Detroit to change people's hearts and minds.

748
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:17.660
And the supreme court saw it very differently.

749
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:21.730
And the language that was used just to litigate Bowers or uh,

750
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:26.870
Lawrence versus the earlier language about a fundamental right to sodomy.

751
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.230
Nobody wants a fundamental right to stop.
That's not what we're talking about.

752
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:33.580
And I mean,
many do.
I do,
but I just,

753
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.320
all I'm saying is that's so,

754
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:41.200
so I think those protests really impact the legal,
uh,

755
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.700
climate.
Um,
you know,

756
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:48.730
yesterday I was just in court and a defendant wanted to be let out on bond in a

757
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:55.130
big marijuana case.
Like,
I mean,
capital B,
capital I,
capital g,

758
00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.000
that much marijuana going around the country.
And,
uh,

759
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.290
at an earlier hearing I did not let him out.
And I said,
you know,

760
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.670
he has access to enough money to purchase a small country in terms of whether he

761
00:51:07.671 --> 00:51:12.650
would flee or not,
and that likelihood of Flint.
But at this hearing,
the,

762
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:12.950
uh,

763
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:17.950
his lawyer brought me a case from New Mexico with different facts and stuff,

764
00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:21.080
but whatever.
Um,
and it said,
you know what?

765
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.430
Marijuana is now legal in Colorado.
Colorado's near us.

766
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.090
I think I'm going to let this defendant out,
uh,
pending trial.

767
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.500
And here's a situation where,
and this all seems disconnected,

768
00:51:33.501 --> 00:51:36.290
and that's why I told you I get distracted.
But in my mind,

769
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:41.291
it's connected because there's been social change that has impacted the league,

770
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:46.700
our opinions about marijuana and whether it should be illegal or not.

771
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.350
And that impacts what happens inside little courtrooms all over the country,

772
00:51:51.351 --> 00:51:53.480
even though you don't know it that that's going on.

773
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.980
<v 7>Well,
thank you all.</v>

774
00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:00.090
