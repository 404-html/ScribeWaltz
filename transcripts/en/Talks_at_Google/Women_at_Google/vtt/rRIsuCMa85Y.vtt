1
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.780
It's so fun for me to be here.
Uh,
for a number of reasons.

2
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:17.680
One is I live two blocks away,
so this is the easiest speaking thing possible.

3
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.740
The others I was telling Jacqueline,
it's like coming back to high school.

4
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:24.010
I left Google about eight years ago and it's like all these memories come

5
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:27.220
flooding back.
This building actually wasn't a Google building when I left,

6
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:30.700
but um,
it's,
you know,
it's all consistent branding and all that,

7
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.130
so it brings back lots of good memories.
Um,

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.890
so when I left Google eight years ago,

9
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.470
I decided to spend the second half of my career working towards social goods,

10
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.380
specifically focused on global poverty.
And you know,

11
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.460
I had spent my whole career in the tech world.

12
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:48.890
I studied as a software engineer or as an engineering director.
Um,

13
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.870
I knew how to build software,
but,
um,
I knew nothing about global poverty,

14
00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:55.150
so I knew I had a lot to learn.
Um,

15
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.060
and I wasn't really sure how I could contribute a,

16
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:02.920
at first everyone was trying to come to me to help them build an app for this or

17
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:04.180
that or build a website.

18
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:07.330
And it wasn't clear to me that that was really going to be a highest and best

19
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:08.230
use.
Um,

20
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:13.231
so I set out to learn and one of the things that really struck me as I dug into

21
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.730
these issues was that there's these immense,

22
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:19.920
complex challenges out there and it seemed,

23
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.460
and there's incredible people working on these issues who it's such dedication,

24
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.050
a lot of resources going into it,

25
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.330
but it just felt like we were barely making a dent.
Um,
and so I've been,

26
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.661
you know,

27
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.840
I think my journey over the last eight years has really been trying to figure

28
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:39.670
out not how I can make my own tiny little mark on some corner of some issue,

29
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:44.280
but really looking at the system and saying,
how can we do this better?
Um,

30
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.620
and trying to bring some of the experiences I've had at Google and other places

31
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.560
too,
some of these big social challenges.

32
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.030
And so I'm assuming people here generally have heard of the lean startup.

33
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.880
Is that yes.
Um,

34
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.450
and so I think the lean startup just is one of the books that's really captured

35
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:03.070
some of the best practices of innovation.

36
00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:06.160
I think we live and breathe here at Google.
And you know,

37
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.330
Eric talks about the lean startup as a methodology for building products and

38
00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.730
services under conditions of extreme uncertainty,

39
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.670
which is true for startup companies is true for a lot of things we're trying to

40
00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:18.190
invent here at Google that have never been done before.

41
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.230
And I would argue it's equally if not more true when it comes to social

42
00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:26.860
challenges cause we're talking about big,
complex,

43
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:31.810
longterm entrenched issues that we don't have solutions for.
Um,

44
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.980
and so in that case,
um,

45
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.630
there's a huge amount of uncertainty but yet what seems,

46
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.820
what I found to be true is that most of the organizations out there who are

47
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:47.590
trying to tackle these challenges are really good at predictable execution.

48
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.890
You know,
they like to create these grand master plans.

49
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.970
Maybe they don't like to do it,
but the system you know,
of,

50
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.160
of applying for grants and so forth forces them to create these grand masters

51
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:01.270
plans and they're expected to rigid,
execute rigidly to that plan.
Um,

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.980
sort of the opposite of what you,
we all know come innovation looks like.

53
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.740
So when there is such uncertainty,

54
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.460
I think what we need to do instead is look at approaches that help accelerate

55
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:14.260
the speed of learning.
And,

56
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.620
and this probably seems obvious to all of you and,

57
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.390
and I know lots of nonprofit leaders who have picked up the lean startup,

58
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.390
have heard about other innovation tools such as human centered design.

59
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.030
And they say this makes a lot of sense.
We want to do this.

60
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.220
And then they get stuck because they struggle with a number of barriers such as

61
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.160
the nature of how restrictive funding can be.
Um,

62
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.520
the difficulty of measuring impact,
um,
and the,

63
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.250
the length of time it can take to realize impact.

64
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.140
And also the whole notion of experimentation running ab tests sounds great.

65
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:48.430
When you're building a website,

66
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:51.400
it's a little harder when you're talking about experimenting on really

67
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.380
vulnerable people who are living on the edge.

68
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.580
And so that's really why I wrote this book is not to invent something new.

69
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.030
I'm not,
I don't come up with new methodology here that didn't exist before,

70
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.080
but to really look at how these best practices that have come out of places like

71
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:10.081
Google can be adapted for the realities of the context that organizations work

72
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.420
in who are trying to deliver social good.
Um,

73
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.920
until in the process of writing the book I spoke with,

74
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.920
I was lucky to interview over 200 organizations,

75
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.610
big and small domestic and international nonprofits and for profits,

76
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:25.870
funders and implementers,

77
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.770
and really try to see from among the most successful,
um,
what,

78
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.400
what were the core elements of their success.

79
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.550
And I kind of boiled it down into three principles.

80
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.040
And what was surprising to me is that the,

81
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.070
the traditional way of going about doing social good is exact opposite of this.

82
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:48.250
We tend to think too small,
start too big,

83
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.490
and get diverted by many things on the path,
the impact.

84
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.740
So let me start with think big.
So what I found is that most nonprofits,

85
00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:01.510
the way that they go about their work is that they plan based on constraints.

86
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.660
You know,
we have this much money,
we have this,
this many people.

87
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.090
We have this grant opportunity that is this size and scope.

88
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.110
And so what can we do within this box we're in?
Um,

89
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.840
and they're usually do some good,
but it rarely moves the needle.
You know,

90
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.910
this is where it feels like we're doing so much work and working so hard and yet

91
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:21.130
we're never getting ahead.
Um,

92
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.460
I think the first shift that I,

93
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.290
that needs to happen is that we need to stop planning based on constraints and

94
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.040
start planning based on the need.
What is the actual need in the world?

95
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:37.740
What would actually move the needle on,
on changing,

96
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.560
addressing a real problem.
Um,
and,
and that's a really different approach.

97
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:43.750
You know,
here in silicon valley,
we know everybody's,

98
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.410
all the startup companies are running around with their PowerPoint decks that

99
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:51.010
show the hockey stick curve of how they're going to reach a billion people.

100
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.970
That doesn't happen in the,
in the social sector,
um,
very often at least.
Uh,

101
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.160
and it needs to,
because the are just as big.

102
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.780
Let me just kind of illustrate what that looks like.
Over the last 30 years,

103
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:07.781
we've made slow but steady progress on core social challenges like access to

104
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:12.730
clean water or electricity in sanitation.
And we say that,
you know,
we,

105
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.270
it,
this is really hard,

106
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:18.380
painstaking work because we're trying to reach people who are very poor,

107
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.890
who are living in very remote areas.
And so it's slow.

108
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.420
And yet during the same period of time,
adoption of mobile phones skyrocketed.

109
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.060
You know?
And,
and why,
what's the difference here?

110
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.140
One of the differences is that this is something people really want and demand.

111
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.210
So,
um,
I,

112
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.040
I've heard so many stories of people who will top up their mobile phone before

113
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.100
they'll buy food.
Uh,

114
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.260
and so today there's more people with mobile phones than have a toilet.

115
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.620
The other side is on the supply side.

116
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:52.760
The companies that manufacture or mobile phones make a profit and plow that into

117
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:55.400
making better phones for cheaper and distributing them.

118
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.550
The telecom companies that sell minutes are able to make a profit and so they

119
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:02.780
can build more towers,
reach more rural areas,
um,
deliver service more cheaply.

120
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.770
And so through this combination of strong demand and strong supply,

121
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.970
you see this kind of growth.
Um,

122
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.500
and certainly not everything in the social sector's going to look like this,

123
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.470
but I think we should challenge ourselves to say,
you know,

124
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.490
how do we shoot for something that it has this kind of trajectory.

125
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.250
And I think it's possible more cases than we think.

126
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.890
And that starts out by setting a goal setting higher sites.

127
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.350
I'm on a nonprofit here in the bay area called earn,

128
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.370
is focused on helping low income Americans develop a habit of savings.

129
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.230
And after 10 years in business,

130
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.410
they were being loaded at being the top of their field,

131
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:41.780
having 7,000 micro savings accounts.

132
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.830
And the founder of Bend Mangan one day woke up and he thought,
you know,

133
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.900
we're getting all this recognition,

134
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.850
but really there are an estimated 50 to 70 million Americans who could benefit

135
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:57.560
from this and we're reaching 7,000 after 10 years,
barely scratching the surface.

136
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.030
And so he got up at an awards dinner and made this grand announcement that they

137
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.230
were going to reach a million people in the next five years as a big stretch

138
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:07.250
from 7,000.

139
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.720
But what it did is it forced earned to relook at their model they were doing in

140
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:16.460
person visits to each of their clients.
They were doing a financial match.

141
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.330
And these things are short,

142
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.760
feasible if they're going to get to the scope of the need.

143
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.820
And so it forced them to take a different look at things and they ended up

144
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:25.970
building a technology platform that could reach a lot more people a lot more

145
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:29.120
cheaply.
And the first year after rolling out that platform,

146
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.530
they reached 85,000 people or more than 10 times as many as in their first 10

147
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:34.364
years combined.

148
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.050
So it's just an illustration of what it can look like to shift your mindset and

149
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:39.950
to shoot bigger.

150
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.740
And it often means that we don't necessarily know the path there yet,

151
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.190
but at least one,
if we're successful,
we can really move the needle.

152
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.870
So this is the second principle.
Lean impact is to start small.
Um,

153
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.710
you know,
we all know here that when we have,
you know,

154
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.490
great product idea that we want to start small,
we dog food things.

155
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.740
We've run AB tests,
we,
but,
but this is uncommon in the,
in,

156
00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:05.730
in the social sector.
Um,

157
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.750
and we all know that by starting small we can make a bigger impact over time

158
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.460
because we can learn much more faster,

159
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:16.461
iterate much more quickly when we're experimenting with just five or 10 or a

160
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:20.220
hundred people versus trying to carry the infrastructure and all the logistics

161
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:25.140
related to serving thousands of people.
So the core of lean startup,

162
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:29.120
Eric talks about the build,
measure,
learn feedback loop,
right?
And the,

163
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.220
this is the cycle of iteration where we build an experiment.

164
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:35.700
We know we have a potential solution,
a hypothesis about what it will do.

165
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.090
We build an experiment and measure gathering the data and we learned and we

166
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:43.080
iterate through this.
So this is all very familiar to us in the tech world.

167
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.290
It's sort of familiar in the social sector.

168
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:51.120
The only problem is in the social sector,
this cycle usually takes years.

169
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.280
So in the global development space,
you know,
by that,
you know,

170
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.310
you're often designing a program for one or two or three years before it even

171
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:02.100
hits the field.
And then you run it,
say it's a five year program,

172
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:06.990
you run it for two and a half years,
you then do your midline evaluation,

173
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:08.910
which usually takes a year in it of itself.

174
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.820
Then you're three and a half injure your and you get some data and then you

175
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:14.400
might plow what you learned into your next proposal.

176
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:18.300
So the whole cycle could take like five or seven years to get through.

177
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.250
And so if you imagine these great complex challenges and you're only learning on

178
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:26.370
this cycle of like seven years,
you're not going to make a lot of progress.

179
00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:28.500
And the world is only moving faster and faster.

180
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.720
So the key here is how do we speed up this feedback loop for social good so that

181
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:37.830
we can make faster progress and can take more risks and try more different

182
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:39.810
things,
can find much better solutions.

183
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.100
And so when it comes to social impact,

184
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.120
there's three dimensions that I think we need to test hypotheses around value,

185
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:49.860
impact and growth.
In the lean startup,

186
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:54.861
Eric talks about the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis as a two core

187
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:58.200
hypothesis to test that we do within the,
um,
you know,

188
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:01.680
the tech industry certainly value hypothesis is certainly not only do people

189
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.140
want your product,
but they'll demand it,
come back for it,

190
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:06.690
tell their friends about it.
Growth is,
you know,

191
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.840
what is the engine for growth that's going to drive adoption?
You know,

192
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:12.270
are People gonna refer our folks?
Are they going to pay money for that?

193
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:17.220
You can plow back into investment and so forth.
But then for social impact,

194
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.250
we need to add a third hypothesis,
which is the impact hypothesis.

195
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:24.860
It's not enough to have something that people want and have it be able to get to

196
00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:27.540
people.
Then you can just be talking about Nike shoes maybe.

197
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.730
But it also has to have social impact.

198
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.490
And too often we don't ask the simple question,
does it work?

199
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.840
Does it deliver the social benefit that we are seeking?

200
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.380
Um,
and so let me just talk briefly,

201
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.530
give a brief example for each of these three and what it might look like in the

202
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:48.060
social context.
So,
um,
for value,
you know,
this is testing.

203
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.090
Is this something that people will really demand and using engage with?
Um,

204
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.140
and an MVP for value will look very different in the salt can look very

205
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:59.320
different.
The social sector then when you're testing an online service,

206
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.030
in this case a social enterprise called copia global,
it's in Kenya.

207
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.190
They set out to look at how to provide a much wider range of consumer goods to

208
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.280
people living in rural areas that typically only have access to the basic

209
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.470
consumer staples.

210
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.270
And so rather than building out the infrastructure to transport goods to build

211
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:23.590
an online catalog or ordering system and warehouses and all this kind of stuff,

212
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:25.120
they decided to run an MVP.

213
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.720
Their MVP consisted of the CEO Crispin Er going to the local sort of Walmart

214
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.150
equivalent than Nakumatt and taking pictures of a bunch of different products

215
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:36.700
off the shelves of what he thought people might like.

216
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.540
And he pasted these into a handful of catalogs,

217
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:44.890
distributed into a few villages to and step back to see what would happen and as

218
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:48.460
questions,
where would people even want to order for a cat from a catalog?

219
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.500
What kinds of things would they order?
Would agents sell from the catalog?

220
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.680
And they learned a lot of things just from this process.

221
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.910
First they learned that people would order orders started coming in and when an

222
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:03.700
order would come in Crispin himself,
we'd go run to the store,

223
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:07.060
buy the product off the shelf and hand carry it to the village.

224
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.550
Now this is certainly not something that could scale,

225
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.290
but it's something that he could get up and running within a few days.
Um,

226
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.890
and so you validated the fact that yes,

227
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:17.290
people wanted these pro wanting to order from the catalog.

228
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:18.610
This was a value to people.

229
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.460
He also found out what kinds of products people wanted to order.
Um,

230
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.680
one of the surprises was that,
um,

231
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.510
today one of their most popular products is cement.

232
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.630
Not something they thought of initially.
But if you think about it going,

233
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.100
if you don't have a car going and getting cement and carry it home is actually

234
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:39.640
kind of hard.
And so it's something that people really value getting delivery of.

235
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.310
Um,
and then they had another surprise,

236
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:45.160
which is they originally thought that the agents that would be,

237
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.310
that they would use would be the people who are running these kind of kiosks,

238
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:53.140
the corner stores in these villages because they were already selling goods.

239
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:54.910
But it turned out that these,

240
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:58.150
these kiosk owners were more interested in moving the inventory they were

241
00:13:58.151 --> 00:13:59.980
already carrying in their shops.

242
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.100
And so they didn't really try to encourage people to buy from the catalog.

243
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.690
And the people who ended up making much better agents were complimentary

244
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:11.410
businesses like hair salons where people will be waiting to get their haircut,

245
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.260
they could flip through the catalog and it would be an additional stream of

246
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:17.230
income.
So through this kind of MVP,
again,

247
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.780
that looks very different than if you're testing an online service.

248
00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:22.600
They were able to learn a ton of stuff very quickly,
very cheaply,

249
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:25.330
that really helped them refine their service.

250
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.940
On the impact front.
One of the biggest challenges is,
as I mentioned earlier,

251
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:34.570
that it can take a long time to really fully realize impact.

252
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.930
One of the examples of where that's true is in education.
You know,

253
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:42.250
the educational attainment can take years to realize summit public schools is

254
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:44.380
another,
a nonprofit in the bay area.

255
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.270
And they set out with this idea of Diane Tavenner,

256
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:54.271
who's the founder out with the idea that she wanted to run to school for a

257
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.700
diverse student body are 100% of the students would graduate college.

258
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.770
Now they brought in all the best practices that they could find set up a charter

259
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:07.760
school and eight years later when their first cohort graduated from college,

260
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.600
what they found was they were doing significantly better than average and they

261
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:15.020
were getting all sorts of pressure to scale their model.
And Diane said,
wait,

262
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:17.900
slow down.
We're doing really good,

263
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.170
but we're still far short of the hundred percent,
um,

264
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.090
target we can do better.
But she also said,
there's no way.

265
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.900
I'm waiting another eight years to try something different and see if it works.

266
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.130
And so what she decided instead is to figure out how to build a culture and

267
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:37.100
process for speeding up learning within their organization.

268
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.810
And that consisted of coming up with a,
a platform where they could capture data.

269
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.360
So they,

270
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.880
they moved to a weekly cycle where they would do student assessments to see what

271
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:50.090
students learn.
They would have focus groups,
see what people were engaged with,

272
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:53.780
get feedback from teachers and so forth and gather all this data on a weekly

273
00:15:53.781 --> 00:15:58.250
basis.
And they ended up running a 57 weeks of experiments,

274
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.150
kind of varying the length and duration in nature of different classroom

275
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:06.800
elements to come up with this revolutionary model of personalized learning.

276
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.873
Um,
and to,

277
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.960
and today that model of personalized learning has been adopted by over 300

278
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:15.920
public schools and they're,
the last year the,
um,
the,

279
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:20.030
their students had a 99% admission rate to college.

280
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.930
So they haven't graduated yet,
but they're learning much,
much faster now.

281
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.150
And so it was just an example that a lot of times,

282
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.240
even though the full impact may take a long time to realize there's earlier

283
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.870
indicators that we can capture that help us improve and refine our,

284
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.160
our interventions.

285
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.710
The third pillar of social innovation is growth.

286
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.650
Uh,
and I want to share the example of vision spring to,

287
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.850
to illustrate what growth might look like because it's very different than in

288
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:48.390
the private sector.
Uh,

289
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.440
so vision spring set out with their audacious goal was to take an innovation and

290
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:59.771
invention that's 700 years old that has been proven to increase productivity and

291
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:02.780
learning potential.
And that's eyeglasses.

292
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.250
We often think of innovation has got gotta be some whizzbang latest technology,

293
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.960
but they took something as 700 years old and yet two and a half billion people

294
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.260
who need eyeglasses don't have them today.

295
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.110
And so they set out to try to figure this out.

296
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:22.460
They started out by going to two geographies,
El Salvador in India,

297
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:23.540
US hiring some people,

298
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:27.860
they called vision entrepreneurs to do outreach to these two people in rural

299
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:29.210
areas and provide vision care.

300
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:32.720
And they came back with compelling stories of kids who are able to,

301
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:37.010
to learn of adults who are able to work again.
And for most nonprofits,

302
00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:38.000
they would be thrilled by this.

303
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:40.340
They're making a huge difference in these people's lives.

304
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.890
But vision spring thought it wasn't enough.

305
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.340
They were losing money with every person they reached.

306
00:17:45.341 --> 00:17:50.010
They would never be at a get to scale.
So they pivoted their second incarnation,

307
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:54.330
they created vision centers in more urban areas and uh,

308
00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.780
served a more affluent population and took the profits from that to cross

309
00:17:57.781 --> 00:17:59.580
subsidize outreach,
the more rural areas.

310
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:02.640
And so through this they become financially self sustainable again.
You know,

311
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:03.900
the holy grail for nonprofits,

312
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:07.200
I'm making a big difference and I'm financially self sustainable,

313
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.250
but it still wasn't enough because it would have taken them decades to be able

314
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.030
to scale their infrastructure to reach everyone they wanted to reach.

315
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.770
So they pivoted again.
They,

316
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.350
they ended up partnering with a organization and in Bangladesh called Brac that

317
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.440
has a network of community health work care workers in every corner of the

318
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:29.670
country and provided vision services through this existing network.

319
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:30.870
And so through this partnership,

320
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:33.690
they've now been able to reach over a million people on through additional

321
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:36.270
partnerships.
They've reached over four and a half million people.

322
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.530
And so now they're making a difference financially self sustainable and reaching

323
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:42.660
millions.
There's only one problem.

324
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.220
Four and a half million people is a tiny fraction of two and a half billion

325
00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:48.054
people.

326
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.690
And they recognize that this is not something any one organization could solve.

327
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:55.380
There's a systems problem that manufacturers weren't incentivized to create low

328
00:18:55.381 --> 00:18:58.200
cost enough classes and get them distributed to rural areas,

329
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.710
government or taking care of the basic vision needs of their populations.

330
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.370
And so they started a public private partnership called the alliance that brings

331
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:09.110
together eyeglass manufacturers and governments and nonprofits to look at these

332
00:19:09.111 --> 00:19:13.800
systems issues.
And one of their first successes was um,
an MOU.

333
00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:15.780
They signed with the government of Liberia,

334
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.220
who are the government agreed to integrate vision care into their public health

335
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:21.900
system and public school system.

336
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.500
And so you can imagine that as they look at this more at a systemic level and

337
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:28.440
try to influence policy and influence market dynamics,

338
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.070
that they have a hope of eventually getting to that two and a half billion

339
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:36.360
number.
So the last,
uh,
principle of,

340
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:39.090
of lean impact is to relentlessly seek impact.

341
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.290
Now this may seem like the obvious thing to do after all of these are mission

342
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.600
driven organizations.
Of course they're going to seek impact.

343
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.070
But it turns out that there's so many things that push in the opposite
direction.

344
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.580
Now you've all probably heard of this phrase,
Paul and love the problem,

345
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:54.570
not the solution.

346
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:59.610
And what I see with a lot of organizations is that people get excited about

347
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:04.611
applying a particular technology or the particular role of their organization or

348
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:08.910
they have pride of ownership over the design of an intervention that they've,

349
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.480
you know,

350
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.240
have invested their time and energy into and I've seen make a difference.
Um,

351
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.130
one of the indicators of this to me is I talked to lots of different

352
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.700
international NGOs who work in education or healthcare or agriculture and a lot

353
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.700
of them have similar programs and every one of them will tell me their program

354
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:30.760
is the best and they can't all possibly be.
Right.
Um,

355
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.360
and so we're not really being rigorous and looking at what,

356
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.340
what really is the best solution to a problem.
People are just,
you know,

357
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:42.290
getting accustomed to promoting their thing cause it's on their websites,

358
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.890
what they pitch to funders.
They're all,

359
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.320
everybody's saying why they're thing is the best.

360
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.300
And very few of them can tell me basic answer,

361
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:53.200
basic questions like what is the cost effectiveness of your solution so that we

362
00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:54.550
can actually compare these things.

363
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.110
And so part of what I think we need to do is start looking at the right metrics.

364
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.300
Um,

365
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.150
w Eric talks about the vanity metrics as these absolute numbers of the number of

366
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:06.610
people we've reached or the number of dollars we've raised.

367
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.280
These are the things that organizations tend to highlight.
If you,

368
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.250
as much as they talk about mission on the outside,
on the inside,

369
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:15.070
if you go to the executive team meetings,
this is what they're talking about.

370
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.260
How many people do to reach,
how many dollars are we Rachel?

371
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:22.090
It's our grant pipeline.
None of these things have any correlation with impact.

372
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.170
You can reach a lot of people,
but did you actually improve their lives?
Um,

373
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.810
you can.
Uh,
and even if you did improve their lives,

374
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:33.700
could somebody else have done more with the same resources?
So instead,

375
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.900
what I think we need to focus on is the metrics on the right,

376
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.690
which are the,
what I call the innovation metrics.

377
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:43.660
These are the unit level metrics on value,
growth and impact.

378
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.960
Things such as the adoption rate,
the unit costs,

379
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:51.961
the success rate that will pay dividends over time as you optimize those.

380
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.110
Um,
and a lot of times we don't even know what the,
what the this data is.

381
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:57.730
When it comes to social interventions.

382
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:01.510
We're focusing too much on actually just reaching more and more people and not

383
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:06.511
on really optimizing for the basic unit drivers of success.

384
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.620
So I'll just wrap up by saying the ones,
if I could sum down,

385
00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:15.700
one thing that I really wanted to accomplish with this book is to change the

386
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:20.560
mindset of the world for anybody,
any organization who cares about social good,

387
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.760
whether your debt,
you know,
volunteering your time,
you're donating your money,

388
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.110
you're working on a project for social good or otherwise.

389
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.140
I think we need to raise the bar.
You know,

390
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:37.120
companies are expected to maximize shareholder value,
maximize profits,

391
00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:40.540
and we have all these regulations that forced them to do so and companies will

392
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.270
relentlessly maximize their profits.

393
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.050
I think we need to bring that same attitude to social good.

394
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:49.900
If you're a mission driven organization or you claim to be,

395
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.130
it's not enough to deliver some good weed.

396
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.200
We too easily let ourselves settle for delivering some good.

397
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:58.210
We made some difference.
Instead,

398
00:22:58.211 --> 00:23:02.890
I think we need to hold ourselves accountable to maximizing the impact and scale

399
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.724
of our work.

400
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.860
And so to me that means setting those audacious goals,

401
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:10.810
really thinking about the size of the need,

402
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:16.350
but then starting small and testing and optimizing what we deliver around value

403
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:21.250
growth and impact and staying relentlessly focused on achieving the maximum

404
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:22.930
impact possible.
Thank you.

405
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.770
<v 2>Um,
so I'm going to ask a few questions,
but get your questions ready.</v>

406
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.120
We'll turn over in a minute.
So,
and May,

407
00:23:35.121 --> 00:23:37.340
I think this is kind of a self selected group,

408
00:23:37.341 --> 00:23:42.200
but I think you are a hero to many at Google because we tend to attract a

409
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.010
technologist and you won't care very,
very about

410
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.720
<v 3>using their skills to change the world.</v>

411
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:50.900
And so I think a lot of folks are asking themselves,

412
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:54.740
how can I make the most impact?
How,
you know,
uh,

413
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:58.460
on the issues I care about,
you know,
especially if I'm a technologist.
So what's,

414
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.490
what's your advice to all of these Googlers?
Yeah,

415
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.480
that was a question I was asking myself.
I,
I couldn't figure out,
okay,

416
00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:06.650
I know how to build software.

417
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:09.890
How am I possibly going to make an impact on global poverty?
Um,

418
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.760
and this may be a little heretical given what google.org does,

419
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:16.100
but I think that the first thing people leave too is like,

420
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:17.600
let's figure out how to use technology.

421
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.030
And I think that using technology is absolutely a powerful tool that the social

422
00:24:23.031 --> 00:24:25.340
sector generally does not know how to use well enough.

423
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.260
But I think equally if not more so it's how we build the technology.

424
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.940
I mean Google is not outstanding only because of the technology at bills,

425
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:37.120
but it's the process and system building,
right?

426
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.630
I often give the example of everyone thinks of Google is one of the most

427
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:45.530
innovative companies on the planet.
And yet if you look at it,

428
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:47.150
Google didn't invent search.

429
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.800
Like there was like infoseek and excited rate all those guys.
But,

430
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.710
but Google got better at search because it iterated and improved the user

431
00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:58.730
interface,
that feature set the algorithms and so forth faster than anyone else.

432
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:03.850
And it's that sort of muscle of being able to do that that I think is really

433
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:06.560
missing from the social sector in addition to the technology.

434
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:10.040
So I think what I found is once I,
you know,
there's,

435
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.790
you have to start with a lot of humility because there's so much we don't know,

436
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.680
not living in that world,
but there's so much value we can add because,

437
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.390
um,
we bring a skill set that doesn't exist for the most part in the sector.

438
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:27.140
And so there's huge,
huge opportunity there.
Yeah.

439
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.790
Little infomercial for being a google.org,
uh,
fellow.
Uh,

440
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:35.750
we have some in the room here who have volunteered for some of our partners like

441
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:38.270
thorn and center for policing equity.
But you know,

442
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:43.271
our hypothesis is basically that we can help do the most good.

443
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:47.030
It's Google,
google.org and we're really leaning into providing resources,

444
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:48.950
but most importantly our Googlers.

445
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.170
And so we're sending out teams for six months at a time to really deeply,

446
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.230
deeply in bed.
And we've got some folks here who have done that.
But you know,

447
00:25:57.231 --> 00:26:01.460
you raise a good point too in the book about,
um,
I think sometimes,
uh,

448
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:06.380
we can have some Hubris in the tech world and think that we sort of know

449
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:09.950
everything and it can just go in and solve everything.
And you know,

450
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:12.620
there's folks in the nonprofit world or just not that bright or not that

451
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:15.380
ambitious and you know,
I'm going to go in and teach them.

452
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.640
So what do you think is something that you've picked up from being on both sides

453
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:24.410
of the table that tech can learn from the nonprofit sector?
Well,

454
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:26.630
there's sort of the macro thing and then the micro thing on the,

455
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:30.350
on the macro level you had talked about the value growth and impact hypotheses

456
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:31.161
and,
and you know,

457
00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:34.220
Eric started out with Silicon Valley being value and growth are the two

458
00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:38.570
hypotheses.
I think that we're seeing pressure now around the world on the,

459
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.370
on the impact that tech has.

460
00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:44.630
And I think that my hope is not only does the social sector adopt,

461
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.070
you know,
some of these tools from the tech sector,

462
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:51.360
but maybe some of this will flow back where we can also be looking at the impact

463
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:55.950
hypothesis is something we should equally weight and value as as we develop

464
00:26:55.951 --> 00:26:58.220
products.
Because there's,
you know,

465
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.540
the kind of reach that Google and other companies have is huge.
Um,
and,

466
00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:06.780
and we need to think about the impact we're having.
Um,
at a micro level,

467
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:08.160
I think that,
um,

468
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:12.240
one of the things I've seen is tech people coming into the social sector,

469
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:13.590
especially global development,

470
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.230
which is hard because you're working with people who are very,

471
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.150
very different than you,
who are very far away,

472
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:21.150
who have different cultures and languages and life's.
Um,

473
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.090
and I think there can be this Hubris to say,
hey,

474
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:25.800
we can build you an app for that.

475
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.380
Not to mention they don't have smartphones or let alone us signal.
Right.
Um,

476
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:36.590
and so people who have been in the social sector for in global development for a

477
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:37.434
long time,

478
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.000
I've worked in and out with the local populations and have a much better

479
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:46.960
understanding of the realities of what people live with.
And I think,
um,

480
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.560
we can often be naive and just zooming that if we build an APP or provide the

481
00:27:52.561 --> 00:27:55.290
technology that it's going to change everything.
And there's so many,
you know,

482
00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.340
that's like 2% of the problem and there's so many other dynamics at play we

483
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.570
talked to in the book and Brian Stevenson has this phrase get proximate.

484
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.841
You know,

485
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:08.130
how important it is for us to just roll up our sleeves and go and listen,

486
00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:12.990
listen with empathy.
Um,
you know,
how has that played out in your career?
Yeah,

487
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:17.410
I think it's so essential to get proximate and not just like,
Eh,

488
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:21.450
I think sometimes people think get proximate means go take a trip to Kenya for a

489
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.000
week and talk to some people and come home and then you build your product.
Um,

490
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.910
one of the examples I give him the book is of proximity design incorporated that

491
00:28:29.911 --> 00:28:33.200
into their name.
When they decided to work with small holder farmers in Myanmar,

492
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.700
they literally picked up and move there.
Cause what,

493
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:40.170
what allowed them to do is every day be living among and talking to the farmers

494
00:28:40.171 --> 00:28:43.740
they were trying to serve and be able to design with them in,

495
00:28:43.741 --> 00:28:46.430
in the whole process and every day,

496
00:28:46.431 --> 00:28:49.170
be it as bringing prototypes and get their feedback.

497
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.860
And so they were able to speed up their feedback loop by being there and getting

498
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:53.910
that kind of feedback.

499
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.470
I think that's just so essential because we make so many bad assumptions,

500
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:00.960
especially when we're working with people who are so different than us.

501
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:04.680
It's like,
Eh,
you know,
I think innovating is so much,

502
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.740
one of the things I've learned is that innovating is so much harder in the

503
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:10.950
social sector for number of reasons.
But this is one of the reasons like here,

504
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:12.000
when we build products that Google,

505
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:15.570
we're generally building products that are for people like us and what I did

506
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.530
during my time at Google.
The problem.
Yeah.
During my time at Google,
I,
um,

507
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.650
the products that we failed that the most were the ones for people who are not

508
00:29:22.651 --> 00:29:27.120
quite like us.
Um,
because we were so used to,
we have some,
we're not very diverse.

509
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.180
There's a lot of people aren't quite like us.
Yes,
exactly.
And I think,
yeah,

510
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:31.260
I think that's really an issue.

511
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:34.650
But when you're building products for people like you,
you can use the product,

512
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:35.550
you dog through the product,

513
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:38.940
you get generally pretty good feedback and you have a pretty good sense of how

514
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:40.020
people are going to respond.

515
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.180
That's completely different when you're working with vulnerable populations,

516
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:48.100
whether domestic or international that just don't have the same instincts,

517
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.870
assumptions,
culture that we do.

518
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.540
So one more question and then I'm going to open it up to the audience.
So,
um,

519
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.020
you know,
you're talking about,
uh,

520
00:29:56.021 --> 00:29:59.500
the importance of nonprofits being able to be self sustaining.

521
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.340
And I think some of the problem in the nonprofit culture,
frankly,

522
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:08.100
are a lot of it is derived to just how a skewed they are by funders and that

523
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.760
funders of funder's acted more.

524
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.810
We sponsor Billy and inline with providing incentives around true impact.

525
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:17.860
You know,
I loved your slide about measuring true impact.
Um,

526
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.800
but do you have a thought on this,
uh,
you know,

527
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.700
social businesses versus nonprofits versus governments,
you know,

528
00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:29.470
how do you think about the different roles that each of those kinds of groups

529
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:32.890
can play in this integrate question?
And,
and,
and funders is,

530
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.820
is probably the biggest barrier to innovation that,

531
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:38.800
that I consistently hear when I talked to nonprofits.
Um,

532
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.900
and just because of the nature of restricted funding,
I,

533
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.690
I think that both funders and nonprofits,

534
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:51.691
so donors and nonprofits are trying too much to solve the problem themselves.

535
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.031
And if you look at the,

536
00:30:53.031 --> 00:30:57.490
just the numbers in terms of how much donor dollars there are and how much reach

537
00:30:57.491 --> 00:30:58.450
nonprofits have,

538
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:03.100
they're not set up for almost any problem to be able to deliver at the scale

539
00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:03.934
that's needed.

540
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.410
And so what I think we need to do is shift our thinking a bit and think of

541
00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:12.820
donors in nonprofits more as incubators,
as the startups,
if you will,

542
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:16.450
to figure out the better solutions because they can be close to the problem.

543
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:21.280
They can experiment and take risks and figure out how to deliver better

544
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:25.680
services.
And when they do,
then I think the,
the,

545
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.460
there's like three general pads to scale that that are possible and depends on

546
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:32.920
the type of thing you're doing.
But one path,
this scale,

547
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.290
if you can develop a private sector business model,

548
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:40.030
but that may start with a nonprofit or social enterprise because the upside may

549
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:44.650
not be big enough and the risk may be too high for a private sector company to

550
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:45.940
take it on.
So that's what it is.

551
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:50.130
We're donors and nonprofits can sort of de risk and refine a model and then be

552
00:31:50.131 --> 00:31:53.950
at a handed off to private sector to be able to take it forward.
Um,

553
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.640
the other end of the extreme is for basic social services.

554
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:01.360
Government is really the path to ScaleIO.
Government spends a lot of money,

555
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.870
you know,

556
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:06.040
many more times than philanthropy spins to providing social services towards

557
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.510
citizens.
Um,
you know,

558
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:10.690
whether it's education or healthcare or some of the biggest areas,
um,

559
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.720
but so where we can help government and more cost effectively spend his money by

560
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.760
coming up with new and better solutions,

561
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.840
we can leverage that money that government is already spending in a much better,

562
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:24.430
much better way to make a bigger difference.

563
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.550
And the third kind of path is some variation on,

564
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.940
on replication or franchising,
right?
That it's,
it can,

565
00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.420
maybe it's not just one private sector company or one government,

566
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:38.620
but it can be lots of smaller organizations in different places who are all

567
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.420
adapting.
You know,
micro,
uh,

568
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.730
micro finance is sort of a great example of the replication model getting to

569
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:47.870
millions of people through both private sector and nonprofit models.

570
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.183
Great.

571
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:52.400
Well let's open it up to questions in the room and do we have any on the live

572
00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:57.350
stream as well?
Yeah,
go ahead.
But I do have a question,
so,
and I apologize.

573
00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.400
I was trying to figure out how to formulate this well.
Um,

574
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.490
I think there's a culture in Silicon Valley of scale is good,
right?

575
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:06.560
And like scales kind of thing that you want it.
I think I agree.

576
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:08.090
Like it'd be good to see more scale.

577
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.210
I think your quarterly or this though is that organizations that are trying to

578
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:14.840
scale then kind of ignore the problems that don't scale well and I think like

579
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:17.690
you kind of mentioned like the hockey stick graph of mobile phones sales going

580
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:19.160
up and like latrines not really.

581
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.400
And I think there's a reason why Google like cell phones and we don't sell the

582
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:26.480
trees and like I guess like my question is what do you think happens in like say

583
00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:29.900
a decade when social impact organizations all started to say there becomes this

584
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:33.800
culture of like desire to scale and then kind of like a demand and like need and

585
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:37.220
like baseline is to scale.
And then they started to say,
okay,

586
00:33:37.221 --> 00:33:40.160
we're going to ignore the hardest scale problems and only address the ones the

587
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:42.340
scale it like,
is that like,

588
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.260
is that something that you'd think there's a way to hedge against that or,
yeah,

589
00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:50.030
it's a great question.
So I do think that I'm in just about every case.

590
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:52.100
We should be aiming for scale,

591
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.740
but I don't think that means we should pick off the easy problems.

592
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:59.090
I think that social sector organizations should focus on the toughest problems.

593
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.570
The reason we need a social sectors where both markets and governments are

594
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:03.490
failing.
Um,

595
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.560
and so it works in the government is already working like mobile phones.

596
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.540
You don't need nonprofits to get involved.

597
00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:12.500
So they generally should be focused on the problems that aren't being taken up

598
00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:13.550
by others.
And,

599
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.220
and I think for any kind of problem you should think about how to scale it.

600
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.830
I get a lot of questions from folks about how about like local community

601
00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:25.100
organizations.
And one of the things I would say is that yes,

602
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:28.250
local community organizations are essential to be close to the community,

603
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:33.050
understand the community and so forth.
But I would ask a few questions.

604
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.390
First,
are you,

605
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.560
are you delivering the most cost effective intervention that you could,
you know,

606
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:43.310
whether it's you're trying to help the homeless or feed the hungry or whatever,

607
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.850
are you doing this as well as cost effectively as possible?
If not,

608
00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:51.170
can you learn from or take practices from other organizations that are figuring

609
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:52.940
this out?
And if you are,

610
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:56.090
if you've gotten to the most cost effective way to do this and you're also

611
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:58.070
reaching all the people that need this,

612
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.890
you should absolutely tell other people how you're doing this.

613
00:35:00.891 --> 00:35:02.450
So they don't have to all figure it out themselves.

614
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.090
And scaling doesn't mean having to scale your organization.

615
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.340
It means scaling the impact.
Um,

616
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.510
and so I think there's very few cases I can think of where you wouldn't want to

617
00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:14.480
get the scale,
but that doesn't mean I don't see organizations say,
oh,

618
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:16.490
we're only going to tackle problems that get to scale.

619
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:18.560
I think they really have the problems they want to tackle.

620
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.980
The problem is that they're really focusing their success on delivering to a

621
00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:28.010
finite number of people instead of looking at how to really get to everyone that

622
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:28.844
needs it.

623
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.930
And my question is about more tactically around when you think you already,

624
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.960
and I've seen before a context like 10 years ago I finished a masters in cs and

625
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.210
<v 4>I got two offers.</v>

626
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:42.600
One was non profit doing right to consulting and doing kind of capacity building

627
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:43.434
for nonprofits.

628
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.270
And the other one was for Google being a developer and I want you to go through

629
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.030
a nonprofit,
but they're my mentors.
Saa.
Good intentions are not enough.

630
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.580
Go get your Eq skills,
money,
network and stuff.

631
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:58.581
So then years have gone by and I'm still at reevaluating that and my question is

632
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:01.460
along the lines of when would,

633
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.540
when do you know you were ready to make a transition?

634
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:06.990
And I specifically looking back what their muscles are,

635
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:11.450
you fell you on their flex and muscle that you felt you over flexed.
Uh,
uh,

636
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.990
now that you are a on the other side,

637
00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.110
<v 3>yeah,
that's a great question.
It is a great question.
Um,</v>

638
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.460
I made a somewhat arbitrary decision in my mid twenties.

639
00:36:19.461 --> 00:36:21.920
I was going to spend half of my career in tech,

640
00:36:21.921 --> 00:36:24.560
silicon valley and half my career.
So like for me it was just like,
oh,

641
00:36:24.561 --> 00:36:28.950
now I'm like 42 or something like that.
It's time to do it.
Um,

642
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.620
I don't think there's one answer it,

643
00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:33.300
I'll tell you my experience of this cause I think it's different.

644
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.100
Some people start from the beginning of the social sector and do great and other

645
00:36:37.101 --> 00:36:39.470
people came come in very late.
For me,

646
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:44.710
what worked out well about doing it mid career is I think the reality is that

647
00:36:45.291 --> 00:36:50.000
you can personally learn faster in the private sector.

648
00:36:50.001 --> 00:36:52.070
Lynn's social sector,
there's a lot more resources,

649
00:36:52.071 --> 00:36:56.090
there's a lot more talent and expertise.
Um,
there's a lot more competition.

650
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.260
Things move faster.

651
00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.440
And so I felt like I developed skills at two or three times the rate I would

652
00:37:02.601 --> 00:37:06.020
have by being in silicon valley than I would have if I just started in the

653
00:37:06.021 --> 00:37:07.510
social sector.
Um,

654
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.640
and so the other thing is I think that because there's a lot of dysfunction in

655
00:37:12.951 --> 00:37:13.784
the sector,

656
00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.320
a lot of us I think would be pretty frustrated going into the social sector in a

657
00:37:18.321 --> 00:37:22.290
junior level role where we're essentially executing on those grand master plans

658
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:23.390
at someone came up with.

659
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:28.250
And so for me it was more interesting going in where I could be in a senior

660
00:37:28.251 --> 00:37:33.080
enough role that I had some say over the planning of things and the strategy for

661
00:37:33.081 --> 00:37:37.160
things so that I felt like I could make a bigger difference and exactly what

662
00:37:37.161 --> 00:37:39.560
point in time there.
I don't think there's an exact science to it,

663
00:37:39.561 --> 00:37:44.360
but I think that spending enough time in the private sector to build up your

664
00:37:44.361 --> 00:37:46.160
skills,
think about what you want,

665
00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:50.300
your unique advantage to breathe when you go to the,
the organization,
uh,
to the,

666
00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:52.700
to the social sector.
You know,
if it's,
you know,

667
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:57.800
tech technical capabilities,
again,
you'll learn faster here than you will there.

668
00:37:57.801 --> 00:38:02.000
But then at some point you can bring it to government or to a nonprofit if it's

669
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.380
leadership experience,
that's a different type of thing.
That's an,
you know,

670
00:38:06.381 --> 00:38:07.850
if it's an innovation experience,

671
00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:11.690
those are the kinds of things that you can develop great expertise in at a place

672
00:38:11.691 --> 00:38:15.470
like Google and then eventually be able to cross fertilize that to other types

673
00:38:15.471 --> 00:38:18.560
of organizations.
I think the other thing that I tell folks,

674
00:38:18.561 --> 00:38:22.550
cause I get asked this question a lot as well,
is,
um,
uh,

675
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.320
especially if you're right out of college,

676
00:38:24.321 --> 00:38:27.710
I strongly encourage people to go get their transferrable skill in business.

677
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.090
You know,
whether that's accounting or marketing our coding,
you know,

678
00:38:32.091 --> 00:38:36.800
get really do what Ann Mei was saying,
but be careful that you don't,
uh,

679
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:41.920
create a lifestyle that's unsustainable to work in government or nonprofits

680
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:45.760
because those same people who I counsel sometimes I check in five years later

681
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.650
and they're like,
ah,
man,
I got this mortgage and yeah,
I wanted to do,
you know,

682
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:54.790
go work for give directly,
but I can't.
And you know,
so,
uh,

683
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.380
there's some practicalities to it too in terms of making,

684
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:04.381
freeing yourself to do the kinds of things that you want to do at a certain

685
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:06.940
season.
Yeah.
That,
that's a great point.

686
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:11.941
And the other way to do it is not necessarily to have it be a one way shift.

687
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.370
Right?
That,
that I think this fellowship that you've talked about,

688
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.530
which is sounds new,
I cheated.
Oh,

689
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:20.770
would you do if something that didn't exist when I was at Google,

690
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:25.090
I made up my own fellowship,
essentially took a leave of absence.
Um,
but,

691
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:25.571
but you know,

692
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:29.170
the u s government now has the US digital services and 18 f where they're taking

693
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:33.070
people in for like one or two years and then you can go back to your job.

694
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.480
And so it doesn't,

695
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.660
for some people it doesn't necessarily make sense for it to be a one way street.

696
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:38.560
You may want to come back,

697
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:42.580
but you could take a year or two out and do something to contribute back.

698
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.100
Any idea of where to fundraise when nonprofit needs to be agile,
try fail,

699
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:51.970
iterate without showing appealing concrete impact numbers to donor.
Yes.

700
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:57.030
That is hard because most big donors tend to like to fun very,

701
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.540
uh,
rigid defined programs.
Uh,
the good news is that,

702
00:40:05.541 --> 00:40:09.790
and they liked the big reach numbers.
Yes,
they do.
Speaking for a friend.

703
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.900
Um,
so I,
it's hard to answer this in a general sense.

704
00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:19.660
The good news is I think more and more donors are waking up to this.

705
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:22.900
I spent a lot of time going around talking to donors and both,

706
00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:27.640
there's a lot of more innovative,
smaller donors like google.org,
um,

707
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.300
uh,

708
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.300
echoing green draper Richards Kaplan give well.

709
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:38.440
So there's a lot of these kind of smaller,
more innovative donors,
if you will,

710
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.230
uh,
that specialize in,

711
00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:45.820
in kind of Mulago Foundation here that specialize in kind of helping,

712
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.540
allowing people to iterate and fail and experiment and so forth.

713
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:52.570
And so finding the relevant ones in your space is great.

714
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.490
The other good news is that more and more,

715
00:40:54.491 --> 00:40:58.990
the big donors are also starting to do this and not necessarily in the core of

716
00:40:58.991 --> 00:40:59.681
what they're doing,
but the,

717
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:03.430
almost every donor now has something on the side where they have more flexible

718
00:41:03.431 --> 00:41:03.760
funding.

719
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.170
So at USA id we had the development innovation ventures that was modeled after

720
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:12.490
venture capital that did tiered funding that started at $100,000 at $1 million

721
00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:15.600
and $5 million.
We could take a lot more risk.
Um,

722
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.610
and then we spun out the Global Innovation Fund that similar we have the grand

723
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:22.630
challenges that are similar on specific,
um,
uh,
issues that,

724
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:24.790
that we're where we need better solutions.

725
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:28.300
So there's a lot of different things out there.
Whoever asked this question,

726
00:41:28.301 --> 00:41:31.090
I'm happy to talk to depending on your specific types of,

727
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:32.910
and a lot of work who asked the question.

728
00:41:32.911 --> 00:41:36.990
It's done a lot of work internally on Google social impact projects.
Yeah.
And,

729
00:41:36.991 --> 00:41:41.960
and I would encourage you all that as you donate money also those donors

730
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:43.570
yourself,
even if you're not,
you know,

731
00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:46.260
a huge mega donor like the gates foundation,
um,

732
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:51.340
you can help organizations by giving them unrestricted money to allow them to do

733
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:52.550
this kind of experiment.
And there's,

734
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.440
if you don't have the time or sort of know how to do the research to find those,

735
00:41:57.441 --> 00:42:01.910
you can use proxies like give well and our groups like fast forward who are

736
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:06.280
funding tech based nonprofits who you can,
you know,

737
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:11.210
sort of use them as a proxy for really understanding deeply,
uh,
the impact.

738
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.173
Uh,

739
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.850
<v 2>if you could talk a little bit about how,</v>

740
00:42:15.851 --> 00:42:19.780
like you would make the pitch for this type of approach in industries.

741
00:42:19.781 --> 00:42:23.860
Where are the government,
for example,
where things tend to move a lot slower?

742
00:42:23.861 --> 00:42:26.140
Because I can imagine if you were to take this approach,

743
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.440
like you give a couple examples of like how spots and the federal government are

744
00:42:29.441 --> 00:42:31.330
becoming more innovative with their spending,

745
00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:33.190
but they tend to be very niche programs.

746
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.430
Whereas I can imagine if you took this to like a career program officer,

747
00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.130
they might perceive,
oh,
someone from Silicon Valley's and an outsider.

748
00:42:39.131 --> 00:42:40.000
So how do you,

749
00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.750
how do you make a pitch for like rapid iteration and a place where the culture

750
00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:45.460
is kind of like what we've always done it this way?

751
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.760
<v 3>Yeah,
it's a great question.
I mean,</v>

752
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.670
government is a huge institution and it changes very slowly.

753
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:55.000
The good news is that there are career people.
So,

754
00:42:55.001 --> 00:42:57.820
so this was essentially my charter at USA id.
I,

755
00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.240
I was the first executive director for the global development lab.

756
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.450
We're set up as a bureau to really promote,
you know,

757
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.210
transform global development.
And,
um,
you know,

758
00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:09.250
we're a little corner of the agency,
but our,

759
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.980
our mission was to go reach out to other parts of the agency,

760
00:43:11.981 --> 00:43:16.120
find those advocates,
work with them to build success stories.
So it's a,
it's,

761
00:43:16.121 --> 00:43:20.590
it's just like adoption of any new thing.
Um,
you have to go step by step.

762
00:43:20.591 --> 00:43:24.340
And so we would start by experimenting ourselves,
showing it could be done,

763
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.970
then we would partner with the early adopters across the agency that we could

764
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:31.960
find the senior foreign service officers who were like mission directors but who

765
00:43:31.961 --> 00:43:32.890
are forward leaning.

766
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.150
And we'd get a handful of them to try stuff with us and show that they could do

767
00:43:37.151 --> 00:43:40.510
it.
And they had their own network of other senior foreign service officers that

768
00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:45.370
trusted them that they could then tell and be then be our advocates and spread

769
00:43:45.371 --> 00:43:48.100
the word further.
And so it's,
you know,
it's step by step,

770
00:43:48.101 --> 00:43:50.350
that kind of adoption curve that takes a long time.

771
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:54.160
And one of the most exciting things for me in writing this book is,
you know,
I,

772
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:58.180
I left USA ID and government at the end of the Obama Administration when I

773
00:43:58.181 --> 00:44:01.930
launched this book three months ago at the Brookings Institute in DC.

774
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.980
One of the speakers on the panel,
like Jacqueline is being here,
um,

775
00:44:05.981 --> 00:44:10.981
was Jim Richardson who's one of the most senior political appointees in USA ID

776
00:44:11.471 --> 00:44:12.880
as part of the Trump administration.

777
00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:17.680
He runs the policy and Budget Bureau for USA id and he read the whole book.

778
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.930
He said,
this is exactly what we're trying to do.

779
00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:24.010
We're trying to move all our procurement so that 30% of what we're spending is

780
00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:28.180
going through innovative funding mechanisms.
And so even this administration,

781
00:44:28.181 --> 00:44:33.120
which you know,
has its challenges is still moving these things forward.
Um,

782
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:36.660
and so I do think there's movement but it will be slow because government is

783
00:44:36.661 --> 00:44:37.494
just slow.

784
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.120
We've found too and working with as google.org and worth working with USA ID for

785
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:42.451
example,

786
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:47.451
we've been supporting using direct unconditional cash transfers as a benchmark

787
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:51.360
as you talk about household grants.
Yeah.
And,
um,

788
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.610
worked with USA ID to uh,
do some ab testing with them.

789
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.250
And I think sometimes as you were saying,

790
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.540
other groups can help de-risk ideas,
prove them out.

791
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:07.170
But really the government groups like USA idea,

792
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.640
the ones who are going to do things at scale.

793
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:13.140
So us doing a partnership with USA id,
you know,
it was way to take an idea,

794
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.410
test it out,
see,
see where it works,

795
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:18.990
where it doesn't and have government bring it to scale.
Yeah,

796
00:45:18.991 --> 00:45:20.910
you're always gonna have people who are going to drag their feet.

797
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:24.750
But I think you all also are always going to have people who really are mission

798
00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:25.081
driven.

799
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:28.350
If they see something's going to work better and get better results and save

800
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:32.520
lives.
And our case,
it was like the Rwandan mission set forward and it was like,

801
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:36.720
we want to do this.
You know?
So it's,
it's finding folks within.

802
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:38.910
And when you went to,
we've talked a lot about government,

803
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:41.910
but when you went into the nonprofit sector as well,

804
00:45:41.911 --> 00:45:45.750
you went into an innovation was at the innovation lab at mercy wasn't called an

805
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:48.840
innovation.
I lead the social ventures team.
Yeah.
Social ventures.

806
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.870
And so even with our large,
you know,
uh,

807
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.350
multinational and nonprofits as well.
Similarly,
there are ways to,

808
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.080
yeah.
And I think almost every of the large international NGOs now,

809
00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:03.740
almost every one of them has some sort of innovation lab now.
Yeah.

810
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:10.630
<v 2>Um,
I know that government often has a strain on it spreadsheet,</v>

811
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:14.060
whether that's like San Francisco City Hall or maybe USAID.
Um,

812
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.270
so I'm really interested in public private partnerships.
Uh,
in your research,

813
00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:23.271
did you see any good example of a government working with companies to scale

814
00:46:23.521 --> 00:46:24.354
their impact?

815
00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.280
<v 3>Um,
government working with comp you mean?</v>

816
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:29.210
<v 2>Yeah,
like for example,</v>

817
00:46:29.211 --> 00:46:34.000
I know in San Francisco maybe the local government will work with nonprofit.

818
00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.990
We'll work with companies in the area to provide jobs for people,
you know,

819
00:46:38.991 --> 00:46:43.100
like have an impact that the government might not have budget for.
[inaudible].

820
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:44.560
<v 3>I see,
I see.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

821
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.420
so it is true that government is always crunched by budgets,

822
00:46:49.421 --> 00:46:53.530
but I think it's also true that we don't spend government money very effectively

823
00:46:53.531 --> 00:46:57.940
a lot of the time.
So,
um,
so I think that's what private sector can really help.

824
00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.700
Um,
I'm not sure the kind of projects you're,
you're thinking about.

825
00:47:00.701 --> 00:47:02.770
There's such a range of public private partnerships,

826
00:47:02.771 --> 00:47:05.050
which is why I was asking that.
We worked on at USA ID.

827
00:47:05.051 --> 00:47:08.920
I was responsible for our partnerships office as well.
And so,
uh,
you know,

828
00:47:08.921 --> 00:47:13.270
one of the categories is what people call shared value.

829
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.590
So classic is,
you know,

830
00:47:14.591 --> 00:47:19.591
Starbucks working or Walmart working to source from smallholder farmers are from

831
00:47:20.891 --> 00:47:25.240
disadvantaged populations to try to create economic growth for those folks.

832
00:47:25.241 --> 00:47:28.330
But while getting the goods that they need for their own supply chains,

833
00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:31.840
so that's where we will cross subsidize a sensual,

834
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.760
where grant money can go into to do the technical assistance to go find all the

835
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.660
farmers,

836
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.600
build collectives and so forth and connect them to the supply chains that then

837
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:44.800
companies can kind of take over and be able to operate on a ongoing basis.

838
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.920
We also did things,
um,
at the lab for example,

839
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:52.450
we would fund for profit entities as well as nonprofit entities in the early

840
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:56.630
stages to do risk.
They're new,
they're new innovation.

841
00:47:56.631 --> 00:48:00.790
So we did a lot with the off grid energy sector where,
um,

842
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.021
we're,
you know,

843
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:05.440
the sort of pay as you go solar where we put in some of the earliest money to

844
00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:10.190
experiment with these pays you go solar systems.
Um,
and then over time,
uh,

845
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:14.230
as the systems were proven,
as they became financially self sustainable impact,

846
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:17.950
investors started coming in to be able to fund them and at much much greater

847
00:48:17.951 --> 00:48:19.840
degree to then we would have been able to.

848
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.860
And so there's lots of different ways and that,
that,
and,

849
00:48:22.861 --> 00:48:26.140
and I think a lot of these kinds of public private partnerships like the Ilyas I

850
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:28.210
talked about earlier where,
um,

851
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.600
where private sector and governments come together for collective action.

852
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.150
I started something that Google was involved with called the Alliance for

853
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:38.110
affordable Internet that was looking at how do we expand access to internet

854
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:42.810
around the world by addressing market failures and Po policy failures.
Um,

855
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.700
so just a few examples but the,
but very important.

856
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.290
So we have like four minutes left.
So I wonder if we could try to hit the,

857
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.720
are remaining questions quickly.

858
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.680
So one of the argument about implied schools are so static is that it's hard to

859
00:48:56.681 --> 00:49:00.180
test iterate on other people's Children's.
What ways are ways innovative young,

860
00:49:00.181 --> 00:49:04.030
radical ideas can be validated without risking wellbeing of other folks?
Um,

861
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.930
it was a great question.
So I think that a couple of answers to that.

862
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:11.520
One is on the summit public schools thing.
This was like an optin kit.

863
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.510
People knew that their kids were going,

864
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:16.990
it wasn't like we're going to experiment with your children or not tell you is

865
00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:20.350
that they saw enough value in what was being provided there and they felt like

866
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:22.720
they were still going to get a better education than they would otherwise that

867
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:26.380
people opted into this.
Um,
and I think that's important that people need to make,

868
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:27.700
have conformed consent.

869
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:29.830
And that can be a little trickier when you're working with vulnerable

870
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:30.664
populations.

871
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.950
I think two things I would say to this one is that it's one of the reasons that

872
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:36.970
we need to start small.

873
00:49:36.971 --> 00:49:40.180
So when you experiment with very only a very small number of people,

874
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:44.470
you can pay much more attention to making sure that they are made whole and that

875
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:48.250
nothing bad happens or not unintended consequences because you can watch what

876
00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:51.010
happens with five people much more easily than thousands of people.

877
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.420
The other is I think that,

878
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.470
so we need a tear up those risks and not take too big a recipe for we're ready.

879
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:57.990
The other is,
um,

880
00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:01.750
I think we also need to ask the question of what is the risk of not doing

881
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:04.600
anything.
So we think of vaccines,
for example,

882
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:06.820
if no one was ever given the first polio vaccine,

883
00:50:06.821 --> 00:50:09.940
there is a risk to that person's life who got the first polio vaccine.

884
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.130
There was millions of people would have died otherwise,

885
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.340
but you don't irresponsibly just randomly give someone a polio vaccine.

886
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:18.430
You test in a petri dish that you test it with Rasta and texted with monkeys.

887
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:21.910
And then when you get to testing it with people,
you watch very closely,

888
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.700
but you still take some risks.
But it's that measured risk.

889
00:50:24.701 --> 00:50:27.190
And you look at the upside of the first successful,

890
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.850
the number of people so she can save.

891
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.670
<v 4>Hi.</v>

892
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:32.480
<v 2>Um,</v>

893
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.390
one of the sections in your book that really stuck out to me was when you talked

894
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:39.320
about the different type of like impact numbers that result from both like an

895
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:43.250
ecommerce business.
You talk more about the 30 day active,
you know,

896
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.200
you could do like,
like sign up,
completes,
et Cetera,

897
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.430
more silicon valley numbers that were used to,
um,

898
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:54.460
but then how the impact numbers for social impact takes years to see that same

899
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:57.650
type of result.
Um,
so I was wondering,

900
00:50:57.651 --> 00:51:00.380
have you had any recommendations of a set of numbers,

901
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:03.380
maybe three categories of numbers that can sit in the middle?

902
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.500
So not quite 30 day user active,

903
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:11.501
but not quite like a four year RCT that can help both funders and nonprofits

904
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:16.010
guide and tell the story of whether or not a program is successful.

905
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.100
<v 3>Yeah,
I can't give you generic,
um,</v>

906
00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.540
metrics because they're going to be different depending on the type of

907
00:51:22.541 --> 00:51:24.360
intervention.
Uh,

908
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.600
what I would say is that I look at almost every nonprofit has like a theory of

909
00:51:29.621 --> 00:51:33.100
change for what,
you know,
we're going to train these farmers,

910
00:51:33.101 --> 00:51:34.990
then they're going to have better farming techniques,

911
00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:37.600
then they're going to have better yields for the crops in and you're gonna have

912
00:51:37.601 --> 00:51:40.420
higher incomes and you know,
whatever that you have a theory of change.

913
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:44.500
And part of testing for impact is testing those linkages and the theory of

914
00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:44.801
change.

915
00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:47.350
We tend to create these elaborate theories of change and then put them on the

916
00:51:47.351 --> 00:51:50.830
bookshelf and then just run through the whole program and then try and do an RCT

917
00:51:50.831 --> 00:51:52.900
at the end.
But if you've tests each of those linkages,

918
00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:54.550
it's like if you train the farmers,

919
00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:58.480
did they actually do what you trained them to do?
If they didn't,

920
00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.210
you don't have to wait four years to figure out if their incomes increased.

921
00:52:01.211 --> 00:52:04.270
So what are those simpler earlier indicators that tell you?

922
00:52:04.271 --> 00:52:08.500
And so you'll summit public schools did this by measuring learning assessment

923
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:09.820
each week to say,
hey,

924
00:52:09.821 --> 00:52:13.300
we tried this thing that the students learn better than doing it some other way.

925
00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.140
Um,
and so it really depends on the nature of their intervention.
All right,

926
00:52:17.141 --> 00:52:17.974
last question.

927
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.450
<v 4>Yeah.
Uh,</v>

928
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:26.120
so my sense is that a lot of small organizations in particular hat,

929
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.890
you know,
their thought processes kind of,

930
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.970
well sure it would be great to quantify things and know how we're doing,

931
00:52:32.971 --> 00:52:36.990
but we're just spending all of our energy and effort doing kind of the real work

932
00:52:36.991 --> 00:52:40.620
of the organization,
you know,
helping her target population,
whatever it is.

933
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:41.371
So like,

934
00:52:41.371 --> 00:52:45.930
how do you pitch to those groups that reorienting some of their efforts toward

935
00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.380
coming up with metrics,
quantifying things,

936
00:52:49.381 --> 00:52:52.620
tracking those metrics is worth the effort.

937
00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.240
<v 3>Yeah,
that's a great question.
Um,</v>

938
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.760
one is that I think funders need change funder behavior number one,
capital.

939
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.990
Cause like when your funders are telling you to give us numbers,

940
00:53:01.991 --> 00:53:05.470
it's really hard to do something different.
I'll give us real numbers.
Yeah.

941
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.000
Outcomes.
Yeah.
And also I think that I,
you know,

942
00:53:10.001 --> 00:53:13.600
in the book I talk about starting with a,
an audacious goal.

943
00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.870
So too often it's a short term,
longterm tradeoff,
right?

944
00:53:16.871 --> 00:53:19.900
You can deliver more in the short term by just cranking out stuff.

945
00:53:19.901 --> 00:53:22.660
But you're never going to bend the curve to accelerate your growth in the

946
00:53:22.661 --> 00:53:27.340
longterm.
So you end up like the clean water or sanitation graph.
Um,

947
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:30.330
and so it,
it,
it,
it means,
you know,

948
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.150
setting that audacious goal because when most nonprofits have goals that they

949
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:38.730
can meet just by working a little bit harder.

950
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:41.610
And so if you have a goal that's like 10% better than last year,

951
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.550
there's no reason to take risks.
There's no reason to innovate.

952
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:48.210
There's no reason to potentially fail.
But if you have a goal that's longer term,

953
00:53:48.211 --> 00:53:51.510
that's like,
we got to get to 10 x or a hundred extra thousand x,

954
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.410
then you know,
as you're doing your thing,
you can sort of see,

955
00:53:55.411 --> 00:53:58.690
are you on your trajectory to get there?
You know?
And,

956
00:53:58.691 --> 00:54:01.800
and so I asked nonprofits like,
what's your definition of success?

957
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:04.080
What does success look like in 10 years or 20 years?

958
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:06.990
Could push it out far enough that they're not trying to project what they're

959
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:10.380
doing today,
but then look at are we on a trajectory to get there?
And if not,

960
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.700
and this is your mission,

961
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:15.310
what do we need to do to try to shift the curve so that we,

962
00:54:15.311 --> 00:54:16.920
we changed the trajectory,

963
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:22.550
but let's give a warm thank you to the hero of many of us who is helping to not

964
00:54:24.901 --> 00:54:28.560
only create,
you know,
a product or do one small thing for one small group,

965
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:33.150
but really help an entire sector of government and the social sector to

966
00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:38.151
understand how to be innovative and how to really create systems change.

967
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:39.940
Thanks again,
man.
Thank you so much.
