1
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.163
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.080
Today we're excited to welcome founder and CEO of Doak you confections.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.460
Kristen Tomlin.
Welcome.
Thank you.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.590
And 2014 Kristen decided to officially launch doe as she uncovered a market of

5
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.960
cookie dough lovers in the world,
just psych herself.

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.880
They increase in demand soon.

7
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:27.150
Prompted Kristen to open her first brick and mortar experience here in New York

8
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:32.151
City in 2017 since Kristen has been a nominee of Crain's 40 under 40 and receive

9
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:36.420
brand praise my own publications such as the New York Times o,

10
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:41.370
the Oprah magazine people and across show is such as today.
And CBS this morning.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
Today Kristen has developed over a hundred handcrafted flavors,

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.000
including top sellers such as signature chocolate chip,

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.410
which is my favorite cake batter,
heavenly and confetti,

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.540
some of which she will showcase here at Google today.
So how did doe start?

15
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:59.220
Like where did this idea come from?

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.510
So I had been a cookie dough lover my entire life.
Um,

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.570
I learned the INS and out of the kitchen from my mom who is a baker and a chef.

18
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.710
Um,
I grew up in Saint Louis,
so from the Midwest,
um,

19
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.750
and we made everything from scratch.
And so cookies,
we're no different.
We,
um,

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.991
you know,

21
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:23.991
I would love sharing just anything sugary with others for birthdays or any

22
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.480
occasion.
Um,
and anytime that we baked cookies at home,

23
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:32.481
it was a requirement to save my dad a Tupperware container of cookie dough so

24
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.790
that when he came home and saw the fresh baked cookies on the counter,

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.880
he immediately went to the fridge and got the cookie dough.

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.730
And even though we weren't supposed to eat cookie dough,

27
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.430
it was worth the risk for me growing up.

28
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.010
And it just continued to be kind of a secret obsession of mine.
You know,

29
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.230
throughout college I always had a tub of,
you know,

30
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.860
Toll House or whatever I could get my hands on.
Um,

31
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.160
and even after college I was continuing to bake.

32
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:03.570
I was working here in New York City,
um,
and I treated cookie dough,

33
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.250
like it was ice cream.

34
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.000
So I would keep some in my fridge at all times and take it out,
you know,

35
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.000
by the spoonful a little bit.
And then stick the container back.

36
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.950
So that was my experience with cookie dough.

37
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.720
But I came up with the idea for doe when I was with a bunch of girlfriends.

38
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.930
We were visiting a friend in graduate school at Villanova and we happened to go

39
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:29.211
to this cookie shop and they had a ton of fresh baked cookies and all sorts of

40
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.330
flavors.

41
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.560
And I had wandered over to their freezer section and they were selling their

42
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.920
cookie dough and chocolate chip for you to of course go home and bake.

43
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.480
But I turned to my friends and said,
hey,
well anybody split this with me?

44
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.960
I kind of just want the cookie dough and said,
no.

45
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.130
Everybody decided to just walk out of there without buying anything that was

46
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:51.000
actually baked.

47
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.010
And at that time it wasn't really acceptable to like sit in their cute little

48
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.610
shop and eat the cookie dough from the container.
So sat in the car and then,

49
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.510
you know,
we continued on with our shopping or whatever we were doing and we are,

50
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.940
you know,
are we going to get sick?
Are we going to feel terrible later?
Um,

51
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.160
we didn't really care.
We just finished the whole thing,
you know,

52
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.910
licking our fingers.
No shame.
Um,
good girlfriends.

53
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.980
And um,
and that was the moment we were in the car.
And I thought,

54
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.480
why isn't this a thing?

55
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.440
Why can't you go to a store and just eat the cookie dough?

56
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:29.020
We all just wanted to do it.
I've been eating,

57
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.720
everybody does it and actually gotten sick.

58
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.350
I don't know anybody that doesn't like the cookie dough or doesn't try it when

59
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.540
they're baking.
And so that was the moment,

60
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.870
like kind of the light bulb for me that was like,
maybe this could be a thing,

61
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:45.760
maybe cookie dough could be a dessert on its own.
Um,

62
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.380
and so that started me on my quest to develop this brand and develop this

63
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:54.040
product that was completely safe to eat and bankable.

64
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.400
So you have the option to do both.
Um,

65
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.780
so then I decided to launch the business online to just test the market first

66
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.590
because I had no idea how to start a business.
Um,
you know,

67
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.450
let alone run a retail store,
which was the original idea.

68
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.020
So I launched it online to test it.
And then from there,

69
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.380
once that was successful and I saw that there really was this market of cookie

70
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:21.100
dough levers that I knew coming out of the woodwork.
Um,

71
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.610
I decided to open up the store in 2017 and that kind of catapulted the business

72
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.150
to the next level.

73
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.750
And I remember I ordered some for my team and we waited six weeks to get it.

74
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:36.580
I ordered it online.
Yeah,
you're so patient.
Thank you.
In a second.
Yeah.
I always,

75
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:39.370
I didn't get people that say no,
especially when we first opened like,
oh,

76
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:42.300
I waited three hours in line and I know,
you know,

77
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.180
they waited in the cold or they waited in the rain.

78
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.760
And I always tell people like,
thank you so much,

79
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:51.910
I'm so happy that we have such great fans and supporters and so many cookie

80
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:56.080
dough levers.
What are we gonna make today?
Okay.
So today we're going to make our,

81
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:59.980
one of our most popular flavors,
it is our Brookie dough,

82
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.810
which you guys have in front of you.

83
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.020
It's a combination of a cookie and a Brownie.

84
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:09.820
So that's why we call it the Brookie.
Um,
yeah,
you can't go wrong at all.

85
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:12.130
It actually started as a seasonal flavor.

86
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:14.530
So we have 20 different flavors at our shop.

87
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.290
And if for those of you who haven't been,
who don't want to wait in line,

88
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.330
it's set up like an ice cream experience.

89
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:23.110
So I wanted to create something that was familiar enough so everyone knows when

90
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:27.050
you go into an ice cream store you can get it by the scoop.
You can,
you know,

91
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.530
add toppings.
You can get it in a cup or a cone.

92
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.380
You can even make a milkshake out of it,
whatever you want to do.
Um,

93
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.540
but instead of ice cream,

94
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.920
it is all cookie dough and two of the flavors change every single month.

95
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:43.330
And we love to have fun depending on the season and trying new flavors and

96
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:48.010
always taking requests from fans about,
um,
you know,
what we should,
should have.

97
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.020
And we decided to have this flavor Brookie doe as a seasonal for the month.

98
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.050
It's just our chocolate chip and our Brownie batter swirled together in one and

99
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.430
it was immediately one of the most popular flavors,

100
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:04.460
which doesn't always happen with the seasonal cause.
Chocolate chip is like,

101
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.280
you know,
usually,
usually people go for the classic ones.

102
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.200
And we took a vote on social media and everyone wanted Brookie to stay on the

103
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.650
menu,
so we decided to keep it.
So now it's on our regular menu.

104
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.910
So I'm going to show you guys today how to make these two flavors,

105
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.020
how to combine them.

106
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200
And then actually the Brookie doe originally since we opened the shop was a bar.

107
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:29.210
So it is a Brownie on the bottom,

108
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.510
it's chocolate chip cookie dough on top and then it's topped with chocolate

109
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:37.250
ganache.
So that was kind of the inspiration for the flavor in the first place.

110
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.500
Um,
so we're going to make the dough version,

111
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:42.610
we're going to make the actual Brookie,
um,

112
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.850
and the top it with chocolate ganache and then until you guys with all sorts of

113
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:50.750
sugar.
All right,
well I'll lake does that sound good?
Um,

114
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.360
thank you guys for having me.
Thank you for coming.

115
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.450
I hope you are ready to eat some cookie dough and have some sugar for breakfast.

116
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.380
Um,
I want this to be very interactive,
so if anyone has questions at any time,

117
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.800
grabbed the mic and ask away.
For me,

118
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.560
cooking and baking is an experience that I,

119
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.700
I love fell in love with because I got to share it with others.
I got,

120
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.000
I love baking and cooking with others in the kitchen and then sharing those

121
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:19.760
treats and seeing the smile that it puts on people's faces.
So please,

122
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.890
if you guys have anything,
want to get involved,
get your hands dirty,
let me know.

123
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.910
Um,
but yes,
like you said,
thank you for the introduction.

124
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:31.730
My name is Kristin Tomlin,
the founder and CEO.

125
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.760
I started the business in 2014,
um,

126
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:39.290
when I was still working full time at a brand consultant here in New York.

127
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:41.360
So my old job,

128
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:44.400
which I used to call like my real job and then this was my fake job.

129
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.390
Then now it's kind of switched.
Um,

130
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.680
I used to work in brand experience design,

131
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:55.730
so I was a designer for a consultant and,
um,

132
00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.820
I got to work with amazing brands like BMW and Samsung and Walmart and I was

133
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.420
developing their customer experience.

134
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.820
So innovating that experience and really working through,
um,

135
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.320
how to stay new and different and I really use that expertise as I was

136
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.300
developing this brand to understand,
you know,

137
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:19.460
what are the unique points of the customer journey,

138
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:23.540
what are all the interactions?
Um,
so a lot of people assume that I,
you know,

139
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:28.460
went to business school or you know,
had this had investors or any sort of thing.

140
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:30.260
I had no idea how to start this business.

141
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:34.280
And I did it by trial and the only things I knew in the beginning were about

142
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:37.790
branding and about baking.
So I started there.
Um,

143
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.270
the first recipe I ever developed was our signature chocolate chip.

144
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.280
All of our recipes come from old family recipes that have been in my family for

145
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:47.210
years and years.

146
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:50.780
And then we've modified them to make sure that they're safe to eat,
um,

147
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.500
and that they're also bankable.
So should we get to it?
Awesome.

148
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.500
Um,
we're going to start with like I said,
chocolate chip,

149
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.250
which every one of our cookie doughs except for the Vegan flavors.

150
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.980
Start with good old fashioned butter.

151
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.290
We use 100% real butter.
Um,

152
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.450
we don't use any sort of margarine or you know,
Crisco or anything.

153
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:16.080
Fake butter is better always.
Um,

154
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.130
it gives your cookies and your cookie dough or really rich flavor,
which we like.

155
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.310
Um,
and also,
you know,

156
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:25.500
is for me,

157
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.690
makes every cookie you can really take.
I liked that buttery taste.
Um,

158
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.930
so that's exactly what we use.
We use unsalted butter.

159
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.170
So a lot of people don't know that actually salted butter typically has a higher

160
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.660
moisture content because of that salt.

161
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.640
And you don't want that moisture in your cookies.

162
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:47.970
You want it to be super fudgy and dense.
So don't use this

163
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.640
<v 1>salt,
salt and time.</v>

164
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:53.140
Do you also have more control over how much salt you put in your cookie dough,

165
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.570
which is exactly what you want when you're baking.

166
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.380
This has been soften.

167
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:02.140
So I've just left it on the counter to get to room temperature.

168
00:10:02.141 --> 00:10:04.180
And this is going to be the base of what we're making.

169
00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:08.740
So we would want it to be nice and smooth and creamy before we add any other

170
00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.510
ingredients.
So I'm just going to leave it in here.

171
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:14.050
If you read a recipe that says cream the butter,
it's exactly what we're doing.

172
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:14.741
Um,

173
00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:19.090
I always recommend using a mixer if you don't have a stand mixer or use a hand

174
00:10:19.091 --> 00:10:22.640
mixer just makes your life a lot easier.
Um,

175
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.070
then it'll allow the flavors to really come together and make sure that,

176
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.960
you know,
the butter and the sugars are creaming,

177
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.180
which are incredibly important when you're making cookies.

178
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.780
<v 3>All right,
so I have a question.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
um,
I've always,</v>

179
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.450
like whenever I watch the cooking shows or the restaurant shows,

180
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:51.420
one of the most interesting things is like the sourcing of ingredients because

181
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.940
the chefs get up at like 5:00 AM and go to the,
well,

182
00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:57.870
that's even pretty late to get up and go to the fishmongers by these fish that

183
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.900
you can ever buys a home cook.
And so what I'm wondering is like,

184
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.500
even with things like butter,
like there's a thousand different brands of butter,

185
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:06.960
how do I as a home chef or how did you,
as,

186
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.260
as in your role like source your ingredients and say,
oh,

187
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:11.820
this is the best butter for me to use.

188
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:13.740
Not that other brand of butter or whatever.

189
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.420
<v 0>Yeah.
So a lot of testing goes into,
um,</v>

190
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.370
all of our recipes and even from the beginning.
So,
um,

191
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.230
the type of butter that we use is an American butter.
It's not a European butter.

192
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.810
Um,
it depends on how much fat content you want.
Unfortunately,
we're not,
you know,

193
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.240
going to the farmer's market fresh and getting and getting the cultured butter

194
00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:38.890
that's from,
from the,
um,
the farmer.
I wish we could,
um,

195
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.480
but,
but butter for me,
we know anytime that we can do local,

196
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:45.220
organic,
um,
you know,

197
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:48.280
we try our best and then it was just a matter of a lot of testing.

198
00:11:48.281 --> 00:11:49.810
So there's a ton of different sugars,

199
00:11:49.811 --> 00:11:53.350
a ton of different flowers that you can add in baking,
you know,

200
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:55.030
vanillas extracts,
all of that stuff.

201
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:58.360
And I'll talk through some of the importance of the other ingredients as we go

202
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:01.420
through it and why we chose certain ones.
Um,

203
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.000
but because our cookie dough is edible and Bakel,

204
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.600
it's a lot about the texture of how things come together when you're eating it

205
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.600
raw and when you're baking it,
it's not just one or the other.

206
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.180
And then also for us in any food business,
you know,

207
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:17.680
perishability is obviously something that,
you know,
we need to think about.

208
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.880
And,
um,

209
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:22.870
so making sure that our ingredients are top quality to make sure that they will

210
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.100
last for consumers in the fridge and in the freezer and all of the ways that we,

211
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.080
that we recommend cooking them or eating them.

212
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.930
<v 1>So we got the butter,
the best part.
Um,
next we're going to add the sugar.</v>

213
00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:37.470
So this particular recipe uses a combination of white sugar,

214
00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:39.900
which is granulated sugar and brown sugar.

215
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.550
For those of you who don't know brown sugar is white sugar with added molasses,

216
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.990
molasses,
do you have a darker sugar?
So dark brown sugar just has more molasses.

217
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.290
Um,
for this,
we're going to use light brown sugar.
Um,

218
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.070
and it uses 75% brown sugar.

219
00:12:56.071 --> 00:13:01.071
So the brown sugar is typically what people mostly associated with eating

220
00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:03.510
chocolate chip cookie dough.
It's that molasses,

221
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:07.430
the flavor that most people love and is,
you know,

222
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.730
super nostalgic.

223
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.960
So we really upped the amount of brown sugar that we use in this recipe,

224
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:16.680
but you 75% brown sugar and 25% white sugar,

225
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.350
the white sugar is going to help things spread.
Um,

226
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.610
and the brown sugar is going to be an acid in this recipe and it's going to mix

227
00:13:23.611 --> 00:13:25.590
with a base that we're going to add later.

228
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.160
So cooking is a little bit of chemistry or baking at least is a little bit of

229
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:30.380
chemistry.
Um,

230
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.810
it's not as easy to just like dump a little bit of this and a little bit of that

231
00:13:33.811 --> 00:13:37.140
in the substitute,
you know,
here and there.
Um,

232
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.390
so what we're doing is just creaming the butter and sugar.

233
00:13:39.391 --> 00:13:41.820
We want to just let this go and get nice and smooth.

234
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:45.520
We want it to be all one color and all one texture.
Um,

235
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.190
the sugar and these little granules and what you want to do when you're making

236
00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:53.790
cookie dough is you want to envision just coating each one of those little

237
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:58.170
things of sugar with butter evenly.
Um,
and just making sure it's nice,

238
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:02.940
smooth texture.
No question.

239
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.460
Yeah.
Since you've had so much success from your first store opening in 2017,

240
00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:08.840
do you have any plans to franchise?

241
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.480
We get thousands of requests to franchise,
especially since we've opened,

242
00:14:14.481 --> 00:14:18.200
which is amazing because it just means that so many other people you know,

243
00:14:18.201 --> 00:14:22.430
relate to this concept and can see it being popular in their city or their town.

244
00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:23.470
Yeah.
Um,

245
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.040
right now we are so busy and my team is so busy that I don't want to take a

246
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.650
minute of our time too to figure out the franchising.

247
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:37.210
I think we'll do a few more company owned stores before we actually franchise it

248
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:38.500
out.
Um,

249
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:43.590
this is very much like my baby and I have a very hard time letting go of,

250
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.980
you know,
handing it over to somebody else to just kind of run with it.

251
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.980
And that would always be my worry with franchising.

252
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.260
But I will never say never to anything.

253
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.370
I'm always keeping options open.
So I certainly think that,
um,

254
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:03.410
it could be a possibility down the line.
Okay.
So we got the butter and sugar.

255
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.340
The next ingredients that we're going to add our liquid ingredients.

256
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.980
And I want to talk about these for a couple of reasons.
One,

257
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.690
I'm going back to your sourcing question.
Our Vanilla,
we use 100% vanilla,
um,

258
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.370
pure vanilla extract.
It comes from Madagascar.
We have tested a ton of vanilla,

259
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:21.320
some from Mexico,
some from Tahiti.

260
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.240
I'm in Madagascar for us is really the best of the best.
So,

261
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.313
um,

262
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:32.120
I always recommend when you're baking and for at home chefs to go for the good

263
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:34.100
vanilla,
it will yield a better,

264
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:39.020
smoother flavor and you're in whatever you're baking.
Um,
and,

265
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.070
and typically a,

266
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:44.300
a bottle of it at home will go a long way cause you only use a teaspoon or a

267
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:48.590
tablespoon here,
there.
Um,
so it is expensive but it's,

268
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.910
it is really worth it.

269
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.840
We use even more vanilla in this recipe cause we liked that flavor,

270
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:56.510
how it mixes with the brown sugar.
Um,

271
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.670
so that is why this is liquid is Brown.
The other ingredient in here is our egg.

272
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.300
Most people assume that because our cookie dough is safety,

273
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:07.660
I'm just going to very slowly pour this in,
um,

274
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.170
to avoid it sprang up in my face and giving me an egg facial.

275
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.470
Good.
Um,
the other ingredient is the egg.

276
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:18.800
So most people assume that our cookie dough is safe to eat.

277
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.290
We just eliminate the egg and therefore you're good to go.

278
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:24.800
You can just eat it from the bowl.
That's actually not the case at all.

279
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.790
There are other ingredients in cookie dough that I'll talk about in a bit that

280
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:33.140
can make you sick besides just eating raw eggs in the United States.

281
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.370
As many of you know,

282
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:38.900
Salmonella would be the bacteria that you could get from eating raw eggs.
Um,

283
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.100
but our eggs are completely safe to eat.
They're good in this cookie dough.

284
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.370
And you know,
you could put it in your smoothie if you wanted more protein.

285
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.990
It's been pasteurized.

286
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:51.500
So that means it's been heated to a specific temperature to kill the bacteria

287
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.180
and then cooled back down.
Um,
and it retains its normal properties of an egg.

288
00:16:56.181 --> 00:17:00.170
So if you were to stick this in a hot sauce pan,
it would make scrambled eggs,

289
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:03.410
which people are always surprised about.
Um,
but in cookie dough,

290
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:07.340
we don't want to make scrambled eggs.
We want it to be used as a binding agent.

291
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:09.110
So it's going to keep everything together.

292
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.360
It's also going to add some extra flavor that you otherwise would miss.
Um,

293
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.630
when I was recipe testing,

294
00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:19.631
I tried every egg substitute out there and every single time it never stood up

295
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.400
to the real egg,
the real deal.

296
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:29.870
So I decided to scrap all of those substitutes and find an egg that was

297
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:34.040
completely safe to eat.
Um,
so that is our egg,

298
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:36.580
that's the liquid ingredients,
which we just added.
And now we're,

299
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.340
we want to just whip it until it's really light and fluffy to make sure that all

300
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:44.930
gets incorporated.
Um,
this mixer is great.
It's,

301
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.350
I'm not having to scrape it down at all because of the bowl is really high.

302
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:51.540
But sometimes when you're baking you might have to stop,

303
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.390
scrape things down just to get it all incorporated.

304
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

305
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.200
<v 1>So when I originally started the business,
I was,
like I said,</v>

306
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:11.910
I was working full time.
Um,
and you know,

307
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:16.380
I think that,
I think I was nervous to,
cause no one else had really done this.

308
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:18.630
And we get so many people now that are like,
oh,
why didn't I think of this?

309
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:22.410
This is such a great idea.
Like,
you know,
everybody's been eating cookie dough.
Um,

310
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.430
but when I first started the business,
I didn't know,

311
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.330
<v 0>honestly if it was really going to work,
I thought,
you know,</v>

312
00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:32.150
maybe somebody's this hasn't been done before because it can't be done.

313
00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:33.740
Maybe people won't respond to it.
Well,

314
00:18:33.741 --> 00:18:38.030
maybe there is this stigma that even if through education people won't be able

315
00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:42.560
to get over the egg thing,
um,
or the worry of getting sick.
Um,
you know,

316
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:45.550
it's just a completely different model from an ice cream

317
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.120
<v 1>store or a traditional bakery.</v>

318
00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:50.930
So it was difficult as I was like working on this business plan to try and

319
00:18:50.931 --> 00:18:54.860
figure out,
you know,
how it would work and you know,

320
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.790
what would be popular and what wouldn't be popular.
Um,

321
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.910
so that's why I decided to start it online and just take baby steps,

322
00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:05.510
kind of get my feet wet with the production and understanding what the market

323
00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:09.550
looks like.
And luckily the market was amazing,
you know,

324
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.940
almost from the beginning.
I think the power of social media and you know,

325
00:19:13.941 --> 00:19:15.200
people sharing what they're doing,

326
00:19:15.201 --> 00:19:18.320
especially this like foodie culture in New York.
Um,

327
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.680
it really worked to our advantage and you know,
it's been,

328
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.220
it's been a really crazy ride but really fun.

329
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.400
Next ingredients we're going to add.

330
00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:32.060
So it's a small amount of white questionable white powder.

331
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.320
It's all legal substances.
The first thing is really easy to understand.

332
00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:39.780
It is our sea salt.
So we use sea salt.

333
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.360
It's a less refined salt so it has a little bit of minerality

334
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.500
<v 0>in it.
Um,
which we like.</v>

335
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.220
And additionally it is going to be baking soda.

336
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:52.220
So baking soda is the base in this specific recipe.

337
00:19:52.221 --> 00:19:56.480
It's going to mix with the acid that is the molasses in the brown sugar.

338
00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:59.420
It's going to create carbon dioxide.
Without boring you,

339
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.430
it will help your cookies rise in the oven.

340
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.980
If you put too much baking soda in your cookie dough,

341
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.510
it's going to taste like a bar of soap or like baking soda toothpaste,

342
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:09.800
which is the worst.

343
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.890
So you have to really balance how much you're putting in to make sure that it's

344
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:16.070
reacting,
um,
and make sure you don't taste it in the actual cookie dough.

345
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.410
And then the third ingredient,
um,

346
00:20:18.411 --> 00:20:21.000
one of our secrets is a little bit of cornstarch.

347
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:26.050
So cornstarch is going to be also used as a binding agent and as 11 or so we

348
00:20:27.711 --> 00:20:31.130
like our cookies when they bake to be extra super soft.

349
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.930
I'm not a thin crunchy cookie kind of Gal and you won't find thin crunchy

350
00:20:35.931 --> 00:20:39.140
cookies that doe you will find nice and thick,

351
00:20:39.141 --> 00:20:44.141
kind of crispy on the outside with that Golden Brown outside and nice and gooey

352
00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:45.770
and shoe and the inside.

353
00:20:45.771 --> 00:20:49.810
And that corn starch in the dough will allow you to get that soft bake cookie

354
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:53.170
texture.
Um,
so I'm going to just add these in now.

355
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.300
<v 1>Can we just get together with your flower?
Um,</v>

356
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.510
but I'm going to just do it first just to make sure it's really well

357
00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:03.260
incorporated in the doe.
Um,
because it is a small amount of stuff.

358
00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:06.620
You just want to make sure it's evenly distributed so that those reactions can

359
00:21:06.621 --> 00:21:08.930
happen and all those flavors are really coming together.

360
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.360
<v 4>So I'm really curious,
you're sort of targeting both,
you know,</v>

361
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.930
making delicious when they're big and making them delicious as cookie dough.

362
00:21:15.931 --> 00:21:18.900
And are there trade offs here where you could maybe make more delicious cookie

363
00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:22.080
dough by not making them as good when they're baked or vice versa?

364
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.610
<v 1>So when I was experimenting,
or actually when I was,
um,</v>

365
00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.800
well before I even came up with,
with the idea,
um,

366
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.330
there were specific recipes that we would make at home with my mom that were

367
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:39.190
really good as cookie dough and not as good as cookies or vice versa,

368
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.290
really good as cookies and not as good as cookie dough.

369
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.370
But my dad wanted the good stuff and I,
you know,

370
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:47.170
we always baked it and we always kept it raw.

371
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:51.160
And so we found a recipe that was the perfect mix of both.

372
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.570
And so that is kind of the recipe that we went off of for the development.

373
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.510
Um,
I think that there,
there could be ways,

374
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:01.840
depending on how rich you wanted or that consistency that you want it.

375
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:07.050
But for me what was important is to like really give people a full on cookie

376
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:07.960
dough experience.

377
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.830
So a lot of people when they eat our dough with a spoon there surprise like,
oh,

378
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.490
this tastes just like cookie dough.
And I'm like,
yeah,
it,
it,
it is,

379
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.280
it's exactly what it is.
Um,
it's much more rich than an ice cream.

380
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.780
Um,
it's more dense.
So if you were to stick any of our cookie dough in the oven,

381
00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:29.590
it would fake.
So I'm sorry.
It's tell people,
you know,

382
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:33.100
like if you save it for later,
if you can't finish it,
um,

383
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:35.020
it'll last in the fridge or the freezer.

384
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:39.580
You can always take it home and bake it or mix it with ice cream and you know,

385
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.750
that way you don't have to,

386
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.710
I was always the one like picking around the ice cream and just eating the

387
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:46.990
cookie dough out and then leaving the rest.

388
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.840
For my husband to basically have a pint of vanilla ice cream,

389
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:54.410
which no one actually wants.
So,
um,
next ingredient.

390
00:22:54.411 --> 00:22:59.060
So I'm going to talk about the flower.
So as most people know,
um,
the eggs,

391
00:22:59.080 --> 00:22:59.980
eating raw eggs could

392
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.320
<v 0>be harmful.
There could be salmonella donate cookie dough.</v>

393
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:04.700
We've heard all of that.

394
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.530
What a lot of people don't know is that raw flower could also harbor bacteria.

395
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.530
Um,
so if you think about it,

396
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.450
flower is a raw agricultural ingredients.
So it's grown in the field somewhere.

397
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.523
Um,

398
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:23.530
and there's really not a ton of control over what birds fly over or you know,

399
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.700
what critters may or may not crawl in.
And typically during the milling process,

400
00:23:28.701 --> 00:23:32.270
when you harvest the wheat and you make it into flour,

401
00:23:32.271 --> 00:23:35.840
and there isn't a step in that process which kills any potentially harmful

402
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:38.840
bacteria that those critters could have left behind,

403
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.600
which is gross to think about.
It then goes to,

404
00:23:41.601 --> 00:23:46.010
you sits on your counter for six months,
that bacteria bacteria to harbor.

405
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.640
But as soon as you cook it,
you bake it,
you fry it,

406
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:52.250
you heated in a pan,
whatever you're doing,

407
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:55.730
that's the kill step that kills that potentially harmful bacteria.

408
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.350
So you don't even know if that,

409
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:00.470
if your flower head bacteria or not because you heated it.

410
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.550
But with the rise of people eating cookie dough and Brownie batter and cake

411
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:05.210
batter,

412
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:10.130
more people are licking the spoon and the bacteria is not from the egg.

413
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:14.720
It comes from the flower.
Um,
so that obviously poses a risk for,

414
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.760
for people at home.
Um,

415
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.560
so we did such an extensive amount of research.
We actually,

416
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.240
um,
we're one of the first people to bring this to the New York market.

417
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:30.260
So some of the large cookie dough and other manufacturers.
Um,

418
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.730
we're using heat treated flower.

419
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:36.230
When I started this business in 2014 but it was nearly impossible to get as a

420
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:39.890
small,
you know,
producer that might our minimum,
you know,

421
00:24:39.891 --> 00:24:43.760
we didn't have room to have pallets and pallets of this not let alone go through

422
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:44.870
it all.
Um,

423
00:24:44.871 --> 00:24:48.440
so that was one of the biggest challenges as I was starting the business is

424
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:52.220
finding someone,
a distributor to carry the product,

425
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:56.390
bring it in specifically for us so that we could make our cookie dough safe to

426
00:24:56.391 --> 00:25:00.350
eat.
Um,
so the flower that we're using is a heat treated flower.

427
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:01.640
It's been through the process,

428
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:06.290
like the pasteurization process to make sure that all of that bacteria no longer

429
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:11.120
exists.
It's tested like the egg is tested before it comes to us.
Um,

430
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.260
and then again,

431
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:15.710
it's just like a normal flour so you can use it in your cookie dough and you

432
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:18.260
don't have to worry about getting sick.
Um,

433
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:23.030
the other unique thing about this specific flower is that we make our own blend

434
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.590
of AP flour.
So there are a ton of different flowers out there.

435
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.933
Um,

436
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.600
two basic ones mostly boils down to a hard flower and a soft flour.

437
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.640
And the difference between those flowers are about where they're grown,

438
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:39.710
when they're grown and when they're harvested,

439
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:42.230
and how much gluten is in those flowers.

440
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.470
So all purpose flour is a mix of both.

441
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.240
Soft flour is also known as cake flour and is really great for anything that you

442
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:54.140
want to be light and fluffy like French pastries or um,

443
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.550
or cake.

444
00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.100
The other kind hard flower has a higher gluten content in is great for breads

445
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.300
and pizza dough.

446
00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:05.810
It's going to give you that stretchiness that everyone loves to kind of bite

447
00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:06.760
into.
Um,

448
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.430
and for cookies you just want to use a mix of both of those so that your cookies

449
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:14.120
aren't too dainty and crumbly and you also,
you know,

450
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:16.160
they're not too tough or stretchy.

451
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.920
So we mix our own proprietary blend of all purpose flour in house.

452
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.260
Um,
it was a process that we tested extensively,
um,

453
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.370
to have the exact texture that we want for the cookie dough and for the cookies.

454
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.470
Um,
so that is what we have here.

455
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:37.760
It is our blend of AP flour at t treated.
Um,

456
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.160
and I'm just going to add this in little by little,

457
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.280
you don't really notice any sort of difference in

458
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.630
<v 1>the heat treated.</v>

459
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:50.340
You might notice if you smell it a little bit of a,

460
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.430
a toasted flavor cause that's essentially what they're doing when they're heat

461
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:55.920
treating it.
Um,
but with the,

462
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.530
when it's mixed with all of the other ingredients and cookie dough,

463
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.080
you would never notice any difference whatsoever.

464
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.940
So add this little by little,
this is the final step.
Um,

465
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:09.723
this,

466
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.100
the recipe that we're making technically is in the category of cookies called

467
00:27:13.101 --> 00:27:15.830
[inaudible] drop cookie recipe and a drop cookie recipe.

468
00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:19.220
It's a recipe that most people make at home and most people are used to eating,

469
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.710
um,
or sneaking from the bowl.
What it,

470
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.500
it's the kind of cookie that you drop on a sheet and then bake.

471
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.420
You don't have to roll it out.
You don't have to cut it out.

472
00:27:29.421 --> 00:27:32.540
You don't have to do all of these other things that some other cookies,
you know,

473
00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:35.150
pipe or,
or anything else.
Um,

474
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.990
and drop cookie recipes are great because they're pretty easy to go together.

475
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:43.910
Once you have all of the ingredients measured out,
um,
which is,
you know,

476
00:27:43.911 --> 00:27:48.620
half the battle,
you just throw it into mixer like this.
Similar to,
you know,

477
00:27:48.621 --> 00:27:53.420
you always start with the fat in our case butter.
Um,
then you do sugars,

478
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.780
liquid ingredients,
and then dry ingredients.
Um,

479
00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.490
and the good thing is it all comes together and you,
you really,

480
00:28:01.491 --> 00:28:04.070
it's hard to mess up if you've measured correctly.

481
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.480
The only thing you can do is overmix it.
So once it's like good,

482
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:10.790
you can just keep going along with the process.

483
00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:14.300
And especially once you add the flour in because the flower adds the gluten.

484
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.650
Once it's mixed,

485
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.820
you can just be done and you don't have to let it keep going forever and ever.

486
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.290
Um,
like you would potentially with a merengue or with,
you know,

487
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.380
whip cream or something.

488
00:28:24.381 --> 00:28:28.580
You don't need to add any extra air because we want our cookies to be nice and

489
00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:30.680
dense and fudgy.
Um,

490
00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.480
and the more you mix it the more and activates that gluten and your cookies can

491
00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:36.314
get tough.

492
00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:37.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

493
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.340
<v 3>Did you have another question?
Right?
Yeah.
What's your name by the way?</v>

494
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.780
My name is James.
Hey.
Um,

495
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.180
so like you've came in with the recipes from when you were growing up and also

496
00:28:47.181 --> 00:28:48.860
through developing them,
you know,

497
00:28:48.861 --> 00:28:52.160
as you started thinking about the business and you had the marketing knowledge

498
00:28:52.161 --> 00:28:54.050
from your previous work,
you know,

499
00:28:54.051 --> 00:28:56.750
but one of the things I've always heard is that the,

500
00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.760
one of the hardest parts about building a restaurant is the actual like
business,

501
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.540
the accounting,
the are we actually making a profit right now?
Like,
Yo,

502
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.490
how do we control costs and get the right number of workers and so on and so

503
00:29:10.491 --> 00:29:12.360
forth.
So where,
what,
like how,

504
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:14.960
have you just picked that up as you've gone along or did you,

505
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.780
did you have some previous experience in running business?

506
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:22.270
<v 0>Um,
no previous business experience.
Luckily,
um,</v>

507
00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.380
my,
my husband,
um,
did go to business school.

508
00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:29.040
Not that business school teaches you how to run a business.
Um,

509
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:33.460
he always says he's like,
this taught me nothing.
But it is helpful,
you know,

510
00:29:33.461 --> 00:29:38.461
to kind of have a sidekick in that as at least Ben to school.

511
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.770
Um,
not that I didn't graduate and all of these things,
but um,

512
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.830
to be honest,
for me it was a lot of just figuring out as I go.

513
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:51.070
I always tell people,
especially new entrepreneurs like you,

514
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.810
there was never a point that you feel prepared or feel ready to start any sort

515
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:58.270
of business.
Like you'll never going to have it all figured out.

516
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.440
So just do something to move forward and you will learn if you are smart,

517
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:03.670
if you are a hard worker,

518
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:08.671
if you have a network of people that you can ask and honestly google.com is like

519
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.640
your best friend,
literally.
Um,

520
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.910
there's so many resources out there to find information.

521
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:20.440
And for me it was incredibly helpful to start with baby steps.

522
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:25.450
Um,
and so starting online first,
figuring that out,

523
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.440
learning,
you know,

524
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:31.470
hiring a few people and learning how to manage that and manage production and

525
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:36.450
ordering and online before I even opened the store.
Um,

526
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.270
and that's,

527
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:42.270
that's part of the reason why I launched online was because the t the thought of

528
00:30:42.611 --> 00:30:46.120
opening up a restaurant in New York City without any business experience or

529
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:50.710
operation experience was incredibly daunting.
And I was looking at,

530
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:51.603
you know,

531
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.390
the investment was going to be insane and I didn't want to be one of those

532
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:56.830
businesses that opened.

533
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.600
And then or restaurants that you've see all the time that it's a great location.

534
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:06.130
It's a great idea.
You know,
maybe the execution is even pretty good,
but it just,

535
00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:06.371
you know,

536
00:31:06.371 --> 00:31:09.310
six months later the doors are closed because they just can't make it work.

537
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.490
It's incredibly difficult.
Um,
but I did use,
you know,

538
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.230
the experience I started launched in 2014 um,
and then,

539
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:21.580
you know,
didn't open the store 2017 so,
but even then when I,

540
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.230
when we first opened the store,

541
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:28.410
I had no idea about the popularity or like really an expectation.

542
00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.190
I,
I thought it was going to be popular.
Like I told my old boss,
I was like,

543
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:35.830
maybe this could be the next big thing in desserts.

544
00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:38.740
Like cupcakes have kind of come and gone,
you know,

545
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.220
this is when I was working on this idea in 2012 it was like,
you know,

546
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:45.970
so I was like,
maybe this could be the next thing.
Um,
and,

547
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.010
and I,
I didn't know.
So I had a story stories.

548
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:56.011
I had five full time people when I moved to the new store and they all were

549
00:31:56.201 --> 00:32:01.160
working in the kitchen.
Um,
and one other like assistant who,

550
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.630
who did a little bit of everything business and you know,
kitchen and everything.

551
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.360
And then when I opened up the store,
so we,
we basically,

552
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:11.560
we're moving our kitchen and then we had this new front of House element.

553
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.660
And so I thought,
okay,

554
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.350
I'll hire five more people to help,
you know,

555
00:32:17.351 --> 00:32:20.740
just work as hourly employees in the front.
Um,

556
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.340
and then all of us,
the people in the back and me included,

557
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:28.180
can pop in and out and like work up front and just make sure that everything's

558
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:30.100
running smoothly.
Like,
I'm fine,
you know,

559
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:33.460
checking people out or doing whatever we need to do.
My husband was like,

560
00:32:33.461 --> 00:32:37.420
you can't afford five people.
You can only hire for.
So I'm like,
fine.
Okay.

561
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:42.110
I hire fire for.
Um,
and even then,
I mean we had,

562
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:46.610
we spent essentially all of the money that we had made in the first two years on

563
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:51.160
this new lease,
new build out,
new equipment,
new everything.
Um,

564
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:54.190
cause for me I was like,
I'm just going to go big or go home.
Like I,

565
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.120
I didn't want to keep doing what I was doing,
um,

566
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.760
with just the online orders and like,
you know,
this really small business.

567
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:05.390
I really wanted to see where it was going to go and just kind of give it my all.

568
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.410
It was,
it was incredibly terrifying.
Yeah.
Um,

569
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:14.770
and so we hired these four people and when we opened there was a line down the

570
00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:20.660
block and I was like,
how did these people like what's going on?
You know?

571
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.360
And then I just thought,
I thought,
you know,
we had,
we had,

572
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.230
I think there was a news article and in New York magazine,
so I was like,
oh,

573
00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:29.240
they probably learned about it through there.

574
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.480
And then as soon as these people come and go,
it'll be like quiet.

575
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.730
It was for like a small amount of time.
People like trickled in all day.
When we,

576
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:42.440
when we first opened,
we opened on Wednesday,
Wednesday.

577
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.130
Um,
I don't even,
Jeez,
that whole time is like a blur to me.

578
00:33:46.131 --> 00:33:48.710
I don't think I slept for a month.
Um,

579
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:54.020
so we open on a Wednesday and then my family came to visit that first weekend to

580
00:33:54.021 --> 00:33:57.560
kind of celebrate the opening and,
and my mom's typical fashion.

581
00:33:57.561 --> 00:34:01.730
She had theater tickets and dinners planned and like all this stuff.

582
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.840
And on Thursday we opened up in the store was like slammed.
Wednesday,

583
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:07.280
we like ran out of a ton of stuff.

584
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:11.660
We were staying up all night trying to like remake it to open on Thursday.
Um,

585
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.750
and I called my mom a Thursday.
I was like,
cancel all your plans.

586
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:19.040
Like I need you guys to help work in the store.
Like,

587
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:24.020
I don't know what's happening,
but like,
I just need help and my family is there,

588
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:27.770
you know,
they're all bakers and cooks and like,
you know,
good Midwestern folk.

589
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.340
Like,
they'll,
you know,
roll their sleeves up and get their hands dirty anytime.

590
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.593
Um,

591
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:37.460
so they came on I think Thursday night and immediately I put them to work.

592
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:40.880
And so it was the four employees that I hired.
My Dad,
my brother,

593
00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:44.840
my brother in law,
my sister,
two sisters,
my mom.
Um,

594
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.840
and we all took,
we,

595
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:50.420
we took turns like part of us were in the front part of some their back.

596
00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.610
We were just making cookie dough,
you know,

597
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:55.670
my brother in law was did like dishes for eight or straight.

598
00:34:55.671 --> 00:35:00.530
The poor guy love you James.
Um,
and my parents,

599
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.150
you know,
my dad's scooped cookie dough,

600
00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:04.550
they have like carpal tunnel by the end of the weekend.
And they were like,

601
00:35:04.551 --> 00:35:06.560
we have got to get out.
Um,

602
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.270
and that was the weekend that there were four hour lines down the block and

603
00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:16.100
around the corner.
And we didn't know what was going on.

604
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.810
I mean,
that was just the very beginning.
We ran out of all of our ingredients,

605
00:35:20.811 --> 00:35:23.450
like all of our cookie dough,
anything that was edible,
it was like gone.

606
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.520
And anything that you know,
was,
uh,
we,

607
00:35:26.521 --> 00:35:29.780
we just ran out of every single thing that we had no flour in our flower.

608
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:32.870
You can't just like go to the grocery store and get our flour or our eggs.

609
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.120
So we had to wait,
this was the weekend,

610
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:37.100
so you couldn't put an order in until Monday.

611
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:40.230
So we've had to wait until Tuesday to get everything.

612
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.880
So I'm going to start on the next one while I'm talking.
Um,
so it was kind of,

613
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:47.250
to be honest,
a shit show.
Um,

614
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.730
but I learned a lot in those first few weeks and then we closed the store.

615
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:53.620
We had to,

616
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:58.620
because we didn't have anything to sell 'em for the first couple for a Sunday

617
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:02.880
and a Monday,
and that I put up as many ads as I could.
Um,

618
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.590
and then just,
I bet people would walk in and I'd be like,
okay,

619
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.050
do you like cookie dough?
Do you know anything about,
could you okay.

620
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:14.490
You can speak clearly.
Great.
Um,
are you available?

621
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.020
Great.
You have availability.
Can you scoop cookie dough?
Okay.

622
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:21.350
Show me that you can use your hands.
You're hired.

623
00:36:21.351 --> 00:36:24.990
Like that was basically the process in the beginning,
which was,
you know,

624
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:29.610
worked for a time,
um,
and was great.
But obviously we've,
we've,

625
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.530
we have such a great staff now that we're like settled and established,

626
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:39.480
but that team of 10,
I guess,
or nine when,

627
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.270
um,
immediately to within the first,

628
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:46.810
like four weeks after we opened to about 60 people,
um,

629
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:51.390
we started running multiple shifts.
We were basically in the kitchen from,

630
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.313
um,

631
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:58.150
<v 1>5:00 AM until midnight or 1:00 AM and then we were cleaning from,</v>

632
00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.570
you know,

633
00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:04.340
two to four and then the team would come back at five and it was just like

634
00:37:04.341 --> 00:37:08.510
around the clock.
And really,
um,
it was a struggle for many,

635
00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:13.220
many weeks until we were able to get our facility in the Bronx open and running.

636
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.810
Um,
because not only did we not have enough
people,

637
00:37:17.811 --> 00:37:21.680
we didn't have enough space,
like we didn't have enough refrigeration.
Um,

638
00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:22.910
we didn't have enough of anything,

639
00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:26.090
so we had to kind of move off site and immediately start looking at other

640
00:37:26.091 --> 00:37:27.770
options.
Um,

641
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.450
what I'm making now is our Brownie batter.
So what I just put,

642
00:37:32.451 --> 00:37:35.750
ed was melted chocolate,
semi sweet chocolate and butter.

643
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.110
That's going to be the base of this.
So this one is super fudgy,

644
00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:42.860
really like a chocolate lover's dream.
Um,

645
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.190
and I'm just mixing it with the brown sugar again and the white sugar.

646
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.310
So this is going to be the base of that Brookie.

647
00:37:49.311 --> 00:37:53.750
And then also obviously the Brownie part of the recipe.

648
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.063
Um,

649
00:37:55.250 --> 00:38:00.250
this one is dangerous because this is a recipe that I can sit and eat like so

650
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:07.100
much of.
And suddenly I'm like,
what happened?
Like where,

651
00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:10.190
who ate it?
Where did it go?
You'll like scrape the bottom of the container,

652
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.930
especially when it's nice and warm.
Um,

653
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.890
and it disappears in an instant.

654
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.720
So I guess my love for and baked things is like,

655
00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:25.100
it goes far beyond just cookie dough.
I also love Brownie batter.

656
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.000
I love cake batter.
Anything that is like not fully baked,

657
00:38:29.001 --> 00:38:32.720
kind of beauty in the middle is like my jam.
Um,

658
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:34.460
actually when I was babysitting,

659
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.310
I used to do ton of babysitting when I was [inaudible]

660
00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.980
<v 4>growing up.
Um,
and yeah,</v>

661
00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.900
<v 1>I,
there were these,
this family I babysat down the street.</v>

662
00:38:41.901 --> 00:38:46.100
They have five kids and it was like madness at all times.

663
00:38:46.101 --> 00:38:50.180
I usually had one of my siblings like with me and um,

664
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.580
and the one way to occupy their attention was to make brownies.

665
00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.570
So I would get two boxes of brownies,
sit the kids down,

666
00:38:59.571 --> 00:39:03.230
we would like have a mix,
one box would not have the egg.
And at this point,

667
00:39:03.231 --> 00:39:07.380
this was so long ago,
no one really kind of knew about the flower thing.
Um,

668
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
and I would make one box without the egg and just put it in bowls and the kids

669
00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:15.230
would eat,
you know,
the bowls and Brownie batter.

670
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:19.100
And then the other box I would actually make into brownies so that when the mom

671
00:39:19.101 --> 00:39:23.450
came home there was like something nice and um,
you know,
fresh baked.

672
00:39:23.451 --> 00:39:26.970
And also just to,
even though sugar probably wasn't the right thing to,

673
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.620
to give a bunch of rambunctious,
um,
rambunctious kids,

674
00:39:30.621 --> 00:39:34.730
it was like just our routine.
Every Saturday or whenever I would babysit,

675
00:39:34.731 --> 00:39:38.210
we would make two boxes of brownies.
And so this recipe,

676
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.290
even though it's a cookie recipe,
it,

677
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:44.270
it is very much like the Brownie texture and flavor.

678
00:39:44.271 --> 00:39:46.640
It's super fudgy with that melted chocolate.

679
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:52.070
Other ingredients are going to be cocoa powder and then those learners again

680
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.250
and the sea salt.
So this was all going to go in the mixer.

681
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.930
<v 4>I have a question.
Uh,
it seems like you've,</v>

682
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.990
you've kind of built a cookie dough in New York that didn't exist before,

683
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.140
which is really awesome.
But now that you prove the concepts other,

684
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.540
I noticed the competitor down the street kind of sprung up.
So it,

685
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:10.980
has that changed your business at all?

686
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.190
<v 1>Honestly,
no,
it hasn't really changed the business.
Um,</v>

687
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.540
obviously we were the first of the co of our kind to,

688
00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:24.050
to make this concept and show that it could really work,
especially in New York.

689
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:25.303
Um,

690
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.540
and for us we've been so laser focused and so busy on growing the business and

691
00:40:29.541 --> 00:40:34.541
continuing to expand in a number of different ways that I don't have time to

692
00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:39.320
like really pay attention to competitors.
Um,
of course,

693
00:40:39.321 --> 00:40:43.760
like I'm aware that they exist.
And for me,
I think that this concept,
like I said,

694
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.580
how it could be kind of the next big thing and desserts.

695
00:40:46.581 --> 00:40:50.930
I think that there's a lot of the pie to go around and because we have this

696
00:40:50.931 --> 00:40:53.450
presence in New York,
um,
which is amazing,

697
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:56.900
I'm like encouraging other people and other cookie dough lovers to,
you know,

698
00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:01.610
obviously follow their passions and if they think that they're um,
town would,

699
00:41:01.611 --> 00:41:05.240
could use a cookie dough shop that only works better for me as I continue to

700
00:41:05.241 --> 00:41:09.170
expand and more people learn about this cookie dough trend.
Um,

701
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.790
and if people always ask like,
oh,
are you worried about the people here,

702
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:16.250
the people there or these people are ripping you off or like they're taking your

703
00:41:16.251 --> 00:41:20.570
this and um,
yeah,
I don't really have time to like,

704
00:41:20.571 --> 00:41:24.920
what am I going to do copy the people who are copying me like a shittier version

705
00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:29.570
of myself.
Like that is a terrible idea.
Like who has time for that?
Um,

706
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.250
so yeah,
we're continued to expand.
We are serving more than ever we have.

707
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.410
I don't know if you guys ever go to [inaudible] gains.

708
00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:39.080
You have a couple of stands at Citi field,
which are really fun,

709
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:41.870
so you can get some cookie dough at the ballpark.
Um,

710
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.150
we also are doing a number of different popups this summer.

711
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:46.430
So we've got our camp cookie dough,

712
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:50.190
which is at Chef's club counter in Soho.
Um,

713
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:54.200
it is a summer camp themed cookie dough store.

714
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:58.940
So when we had this,
um,
this,
uh,
this,
uh,

715
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:02.840
opportunity to do something for the summer there,
we thought,
you know,

716
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:06.020
obviously cookie dough is nostalgic and it brings everybody back to their

717
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:07.970
childhood.
And that's why I think people are like,

718
00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.240
have this emotional connection to what they're eating.
Um,

719
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.320
people also have the same nostalgia,
especially in New York for summer camp.

720
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.460
So we thought,

721
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.870
why don't we just kind of blow this concept up and have all of the Di,

722
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.780
the dessert centered around childhood favorites.
All of them,

723
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:25.220
of course include cookie dough,

724
00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:28.040
but all of them also include soft serve ice cream.

725
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:30.740
And it's a really fun experience.
Um,

726
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.270
we have a pop up in Montauk for the summer for anybody's east.
Um,

727
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.740
Washington DC and Chicago all the summer,
so

728
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.770
all sorts of fun stuff going on.

729
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:47.750
And we just launched our new baking kits,

730
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.613
so

731
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.240
<v 0>we,
they're actually coming out in August,</v>

732
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:54.560
but we just debuted them at fancy food the other week.
And um,

733
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.130
the three flavors for that are going to be chocolate chip Brownie batter,

734
00:42:58.131 --> 00:43:01.610
which the two I'm making today.
And then sugar cookie and that mix,

735
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:04.220
it comes in a box.
I'm like this,

736
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:07.910
you just add two ingredients and then everything else is ready to go.

737
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.940
The nice thing about this product is that it's shelf stable.

738
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.470
If I were to ever start another food business,
perishability is like,

739
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.920
is so in refrigeration and freezing is like,

740
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.660
is obviously incredibly difficult.
Um,
so this is nice because it can,
um,

741
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:28.250
it has a long shelf life.
It can go in grocery stores across the United States.

742
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.060
Um,
obviously it has our name all over it and is like a brand,

743
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:37.010
a natural kind of brand extension.
Um,
in addition,
we continue to ship online,

744
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.933
um,

745
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:43.160
all over the United States and we have a pretty robust,

746
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:47.390
um,
catering and event business in New York

747
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.800
<v 5>and sorry,
um,</v>

748
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.230
<v 0>that we ship nationwide.</v>

749
00:43:52.231 --> 00:43:56.760
And then we also go to offices and do little cookie dough bars.

750
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.600
<v 5>Um,
and then</v>

751
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.340
<v 0>at our store,
one of my,
like,</v>

752
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:07.170
one of the most fun things about my job is just interacting with customers and

753
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.230
teaching people all of the things that I've learned over the years.

754
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:13.680
So we just started this,
um,
baking school program.

755
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.950
It's called the cookie academy.
Um,

756
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:21.180
and you can take cookie dough making and baking classes in our store.

757
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.460
So I think we're almost good.
What I'm going to do here is just turn on this,

758
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.130
<v 5>I can get it.
Okay.
So I've got</v>

759
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.270
<v 0>some on going to make here is the good notch to top this Brookie.</v>

760
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:38.310
So what we've got is we've got our Brownie batter,

761
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:43.311
which is nice and gooey tastes exactly like Brownie batter and we've got our

762
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:49.170
chocolate chip cookie dough.
So in order to make the Brookie what we would do,

763
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.200
which we're not going to do,
right,
the second is we would take this,

764
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.720
we would press it down in a pan and we would bake it.

765
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:56.790
So the bottom is a full on Brownie.

766
00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.290
Then we would add a layer of chocolate chip on top of that once it's cooled,

767
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.580
and then stick that back in the oven until it gets nice and gooey and it's not

768
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:09.240
fully baked.
And then it gets topped off with a chocolate ganache.

769
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.960
So we're going to do the ganache element ganache.
Sounds fancy.
It's not.

770
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.860
It's very easy.
Um,
but it's really also super delicious.

771
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:20.700
So all you're gonna do is you're going to heat up heavy cream.

772
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.510
If you can do it in the microwave,
you,
um,

773
00:45:25.511 --> 00:45:28.480
it makes it even easier.
Okay.
Um,

774
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.300
and then you're just going to pour it over the chocolate chips and let it set

775
00:45:31.301 --> 00:45:34.120
and then we'll whisk it together.
Um,

776
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:37.570
but to make the actual Brookie flavor,
what we do,

777
00:45:37.571 --> 00:45:41.410
since we scooped the cookie dough out of what looks like gelato containers,

778
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.660
we would add dollops of both of these different flavors in the same container

779
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:47.860
and then kind of swirl it around.

780
00:45:47.861 --> 00:45:51.430
So if you guys can tell from the little jars we have in front of you,
um,

781
00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.690
that we like being able to see the chocolate chip cookie dough and the Brownie

782
00:45:55.691 --> 00:45:58.030
batter cookie dough.
So it's not like a full Nick's,

783
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:00.790
it's really like a swirl technique.
Um,

784
00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:03.100
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to fold in.

785
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.520
I'll do it in here because it's,
it'll be a little bit easier to see.
Um,

786
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:12.420
I'm going to just take some of this Brownie batter and just add a few dollops in

787
00:46:13.001 --> 00:46:17.460
here and then we'll just swirl it around and we'll have some

788
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.690
<v 5>fresh cookie dough</v>

789
00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:25.580
<v 0>when you do the little cups.
Do you do equal parts chocolate chip Brownie?
Yeah,</v>

790
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:30.830
we do.
Um,
those cups are,
you know,
everything's filled by hand,

791
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.950
so they might have like some of them I'd have a little bit more of one of the

792
00:46:33.951 --> 00:46:36.440
other,
but we try to do it really evenly and I only,

793
00:46:36.441 --> 00:46:40.430
it started one or two times and you get this like nice ribbon technique and we

794
00:46:40.431 --> 00:46:44.720
would leave it just like this.
Um,
if we were going to bake this into cookies,

795
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:48.320
all I would do is refrigerate this cookie dough,
put Saran wrap over it,

796
00:46:48.321 --> 00:46:52.220
stick it in the fridge,
um,
for as long as I can at least 24 hours.

797
00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:55.680
And then I would just scoop it out with a cookie scoop right on.
Um,

798
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.600
a sheet tray and three 50 in the oven for about 10 minutes.

799
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.500
They make really delicious cookies.
Um,
so that's what we got.

800
00:47:03.501 --> 00:47:07.100
We got our Brookie doe and then let's see how we're doing with this heavy cream.

801
00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.350
Okay.
I'm just going to get this to a boil

802
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.990
<v 5>and then turn it down.</v>

803
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.930
<v 0>You guys have any questions in the meantime?</v>

804
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.860
<v 5>Anything else I didn't cover?</v>

805
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.610
<v 0>Hi.
In this sort of health crazed market.
Yeah,
Audi,</v>

806
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.360
you sort of combat that or uh,

807
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.690
help people to limit the amount if that's something you are doing.

808
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:36.820
So obviously,
you know,
I get that question a lot.

809
00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:38.140
Like everyone's like,
oh,
it's,

810
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:41.890
it's not just like gluten free or Vegan this and trying to be healthy.

811
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:43.980
People are just trying to eliminate,
you know,

812
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.280
fats and sugars and all those things from,
from their diet.
Um,

813
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.800
certainly we have gluten free slavers and Vegan flavors and all of that which

814
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.700
are equally as delicious.
Um,

815
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:57.370
but I also think that there's a moment in life to treat yourself and to have a

816
00:47:57.371 --> 00:48:00.730
little bit of fun and indulge in something that makes you happy.

817
00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:05.590
So you all work very hard.
I work very hard.
Everybody like has,

818
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:06.940
you know,
lives.

819
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.470
There's a lot of stuff going on in the world that is not pleasant.

820
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:15.760
And so if there's a moment that you can just put a smile on your face and treat

821
00:48:15.761 --> 00:48:18.580
yourself to whatever makes you happy,
maybe that's a yoga class,

822
00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:21.190
maybe that's a spoonful of cookie dough,
maybe it's an ice cream cone.

823
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:24.610
Maybe it's none of those things.
And it's like your own personal choice.

824
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.760
That's what I'm all about is like just making sure that,
you know,

825
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:31.300
we're putting a smile on your face and allowing you to indulge in something that

826
00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:35.290
you really love.
So even with all the healthgrades,
like trust me,

827
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:39.100
I have to go to soul cycle like way too often too.

828
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.580
Cause I get cookie dough all day.
Um,

829
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.930
but I do think that there's a moment where you deserve a little treat and

830
00:48:45.931 --> 00:48:46.764
something

831
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:48.690
<v 5>just smile.
So</v>

832
00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.400
<v 0>you so much for sharing your story of course.</v>

833
00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.800
Was that tipping point or that moment where you were like,

834
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:59.870
I need to make this my full time job and it's really time to leave your brand

835
00:48:59.871 --> 00:49:01.550
background.
So I,

836
00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:06.580
so this is just really coming to a slow boil 'em and as soon as it you see those

837
00:49:06.921 --> 00:49:07.191
bubbles,

838
00:49:07.191 --> 00:49:10.780
you can take it off and all I'm going to do is pour it over this chocolate,
um,

839
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.550
and just let it sit for a second.
Um,

840
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.430
so I was working full time.

841
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:22.110
I was living the consultant life,
which is just a difficult life.
Um,

842
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:27.050
because you're traveling,
you know,
you're on the site with a client,
etc. Um,

843
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.870
and so when I started this business,
my boss,
my boss knew I was starting it.
And,

844
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:35.400
um,
and so once things were kind of taking off,

845
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.680
I went to him and I was like,
Randall,
I was like,

846
00:49:37.681 --> 00:49:40.890
I dunno what the is going on,

847
00:49:40.891 --> 00:49:45.891
but I just feel like I need to dedicate more time to this business and like

848
00:49:47.821 --> 00:49:52.080
trying to figure it out.
And I don't know at what point,
you know,

849
00:49:52.081 --> 00:49:56.020
people like quit their jobs or don't,
but like,
I don't know that I want to come.

850
00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:59.190
I took it.
It was very,
it was very conflicting for me.
And so,
um,

851
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:03.480
he was so nice and so encouraging.
And so originally I,
um,

852
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:07.730
went down to working two days a week and I had a really flexible schedule,
um,

853
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.040
which helped me dedicate more time to the business.
And I also,
you know,

854
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:15.870
it was only on a one final client commitment.
Um,
and as you know,

855
00:50:15.871 --> 00:50:19.650
that started wrapping up.
It like still,
even working two days a week was,

856
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:20.730
was too much.

857
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:24.750
And I found myself just really wanting to work on the business and it taking up

858
00:50:24.751 --> 00:50:28.420
every,
every hour of my day.
And my poor husband,
you know,

859
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.050
hadn't slept either.
So,
um,
so I just went back and I was like,
look,
I,

860
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:36.650
as much as I love my job and as much as this has been such an amazing
experience,

861
00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:38.660
I'd been there for five years.
Um,

862
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:43.580
I feel like now's the time to kind of take a step and see where this goes and

863
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.930
has never looked back since then,
but it wasn't easy.
It was difficult,

864
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.710
very difficult.
That was about six weeks after I had launched online.
So,
um,

865
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.690
yeah.
Um,

866
00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:04.490
what about people were kind of skeptics that think this is a fad and how do you

867
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:09.210
keep it relevant?
Yeah.
Um,
okay.
So I always tell people,

868
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.090
I obviously did not invent cookie dough.

869
00:51:12.091 --> 00:51:15.330
So cookie dough has been around for a very,
very long time.

870
00:51:15.331 --> 00:51:20.280
And cookies in general are such an American dessert.
Um,
you know,

871
00:51:20.281 --> 00:51:24.470
that people that have grown up with for,
as you know,
since the 18 hundreds,

872
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:28.680
it's like when the chocolate chip cookie,
you know,
really came to be.
Um,

873
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:33.540
and so I'm not pretending like I'm created something new,

874
00:51:33.541 --> 00:51:36.960
but what I think I'm doing or I'm making a huge mess,
that's what I'm doing,
um,

875
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:41.520
is,
is kind of reinventing it and making it new,

876
00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:46.350
indifferent,
um,
and serving in a different way obviously.

877
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:47.543
Um,

878
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:52.620
which I think has a lot of legs because the nostalgia factor.
So,

879
00:51:52.621 --> 00:51:54.820
um,
it's rare that,
you know,

880
00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:58.440
you find something that's so many people can relate to on this like emotional

881
00:51:58.441 --> 00:52:02.280
level because it reminds them of their mom or their grandmother and nostalgia

882
00:52:02.281 --> 00:52:06.000
goes a long way.
Um,
but I also recognize that,
you know,

883
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.820
fads come and go and desserts come and go.

884
00:52:08.821 --> 00:52:12.330
And so I think it's continuing to listen to our customers and continuing to

885
00:52:12.331 --> 00:52:17.160
innovate and find new ways to expand the brand.
And,
um,

886
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.210
so I'm not really concerned.
I don't think cookies are going away anytime soon.

887
00:52:21.211 --> 00:52:23.210
I don't think cookie dough is going away.
So I think as,

888
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.430
as long as we're continuing to,
you know,

889
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:29.370
stay relevant and be new and different and,
um,

890
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.510
innovate the experience,
I think that cookie dough can go along way.

891
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.930
