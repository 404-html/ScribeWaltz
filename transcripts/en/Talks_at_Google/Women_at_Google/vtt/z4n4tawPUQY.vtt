1
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.150
So I'm really excited to introduce Joanne Chang.

2
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.190
She is the co owner and pastry chef at flower bakery and cafe with four

3
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:21.191
locations in Boston and Cambridge as well as the co owner of Myers and chain.

4
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.170
Um,
this is her third visit to our office and she has three cookbooks now.

5
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:31.820
So I'm looking forward to her fourth visit to us maybe soon.
Um,

6
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.200
please join me in welcoming Joanne chain of here.

7
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.690
So,
uh,

8
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.960
I am really excited that I get to talk to you about this because I love to bake

9
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.660
and it's something that I've loved to do since I was a really,

10
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.160
I think like eight years old and my parents never really baked much.

11
00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:01.390
So I started doing making cookies and cakes and everything.
Um,

12
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.630
the low sugar thing is interesting and it's been something that I think a lot of

13
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:10.210
people are interested in learning more about.

14
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:14.170
What made you start to decide to do a cookbook about that?
Yep.

15
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.020
<v 2>It certainly wasn't anything that I had planned kind of all along,</v>

16
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:22.130
like the first baking book flower,
I'd always wanted to write a baking book.

17
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.420
The second book flower too was kind of a natural offshoot of the first one

18
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.390
because there are a lot of people who like to eat savory things.

19
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.330
And at the bakery we do a lot of sandwiches and soups and salads.

20
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:35.690
And so after the first book came out,
a lot of people,

21
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:36.860
a lot of our customers said,

22
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:41.000
you know what happened to all of the savory part of your menu?

23
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.310
And so that led to the second book.
So this third book,

24
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.440
baking with less sugar was not kind of in the,

25
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.450
in my plan until I started to think,
okay,

26
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:54.830
next book,
what should I do?
I really enjoy writing books.
And honestly,

27
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.740
the next book was supposed to be the Meyers and Chang Book.
Um,

28
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.140
that will be your fourth.
That is going to be the fourth visit.

29
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:03.560
And we did just sign a deal for the fourth book so that one will be forthcoming.

30
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.761
But,
uh,

31
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:08.510
what happened was I was starting to write the proposal for the Meyers and Chang

32
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.260
Book and a couple,
like two or three things happen all at once.
Um,

33
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.680
one at home for myself and my husband.

34
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.780
I eat sugar all day long.

35
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:21.350
I mean that's part of my job is to go to all the bakeries and taste the things

36
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:25.550
that we make.
Um,
and fortunate for me,
I don't have a problem with sugar.

37
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.950
I've been eating it all my,
you know,
my whole life and I love it.

38
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.150
My husband loves sugar,
but he is somebody who,

39
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.530
he definitely goes through kind of sugar highs and sugar lows and I will use to

40
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:41.150
bring stuff home from the bakery.
And after eating it,
um,
he would just crash.

41
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.620
And I started to try to figure out ways that I could bring stuff home or make

42
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:49.550
stuff at home that he could enjoy and not feel deprived,

43
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:52.760
but that wouldn't cause him to do this up and down thing.

44
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.960
So I was just starting to experiment at home just for me personally.

45
00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:01.540
And about the same time,
um,
my publisher chronicle called me and said,
okay,

46
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:04.030
we're interested in doing a third book with you.
And I was like,
great.

47
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.140
Meyerson Chang.
And they said,
no,
we actually think that's a low sugar book.

48
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:11.590
Would be something that people would be really interested in.
I thought,
okay,

49
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.830
I'm doing this at home.
This could be a thing.
I wasn't positive.

50
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.490
And then literally,
probably about a week later,
um,

51
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.510
Oprah magazine emailed instead,

52
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.040
we want you to write an article about five desserts with no sugar.

53
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.310
Can you do it?
And I just thought this,
this is just meant to be,
it's a sign.

54
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:31.440
I don't know.
I,
so I did these five desserts for the magazine.
Um,

55
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.110
and I sent them to chronicle books and I said,
what do you think?
And they said,

56
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:39.970
this is your next book.
So I spent about a year testing recipes.

57
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.660
Um,
and this was really challenging for me because the first two books are all

58
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:45.920
recipes that currently exist there.

59
00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:49.030
There are things that we serve every day at the bakery that I have recipes for

60
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:52.370
that we make a huge batch sizes.
So with the first and second book,
uh,

61
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.310
I just had to reduce the batch size,

62
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:58.960
but for this third book I had to make up recipes for pretty much every single

63
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:00.810
recipe.
Just start from scratch.
Yeah,

64
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:03.210
that was really interesting to read in your introduction,

65
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.580
some of the stuff about and throughout the book,

66
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.050
how you were able to test recipes and the ones that you thought might not work.

67
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.040
Like the monkey bread recipe that you said actually did work and I haven't had a

68
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.770
chance to make it,
but it looks really good.
I'm really,

69
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.480
I'm actually curious if there were any recipes that you thought would work or

70
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:25.980
that you tried really hard to make work that you just couldn't get with low

71
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.090
sugar.
Yeah,
there was,

72
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.750
there's one recipe that still in my head because I still want to try to figure

73
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:34.750
it out.
Um,
so there's lemon pudding cake.

74
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.910
Have you ever had lemon pudding cake?
It's a,

75
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.510
it's a really easy cake batter that you,
you make this cake batter,

76
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.190
you put it in a pan,
you bake it,
and naturally the cake part floats to the top.

77
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:49.270
And then at the bottom is a layer of pudding.
Um,
it's a really simple,

78
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.290
wonderful dessert.
And I thought I would love to do a low sugar,

79
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.570
no sugar version,
but with maple syrup.

80
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.030
And I thought maybe I can make a maple putting cake.

81
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.390
And I imagined like this top layer of cake floating to the top,

82
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.020
that was kind of like a pancake and then maybe like a creamy maple leaf sauce at

83
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.240
the bottom.
Does that sound good?
Like it's exactly like I had the,

84
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:11.630
the vision of what it was going to taste like head.
Um,

85
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.250
I must've made maple putting cake like every week,
probably for the whole year.

86
00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:19.490
I feel like it was about the whole year of writing the book and it just kept

87
00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:22.010
being that,
that recipe that I was like,
I'm gonna try it again next week.

88
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:26.390
I'm going to try it again next week.
I never got it.
I never got to get that.

89
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.180
Uh,
I think what happens is you have to,

90
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.030
you have to do something with the eggs that involves sugar,

91
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.960
that doesn't work with maple in order to get the putting to sink in the cake to

92
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:39.860
rise.
So well that,
that brings me to an interesting question too,

93
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:41.600
is the science behind sugar.

94
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.980
And there were things like moraines that you said you knew you couldn't really,

95
00:05:45.981 --> 00:05:47.570
um,
even bother doing.

96
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:52.571
Could you tell us a little bit about what low sugar means in this cookbook and

97
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.200
uh,
and maybe also a little bit about the science,

98
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.270
sugar and what makes certain,
what,

99
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:02.720
how it helps make certain things work the way they do in baking?

100
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.620
I thought so I thought that the biggest challenge in writing this book was going

101
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:11.621
to be figuring out how to replicate the sweetness in desserts because you're

102
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.460
eliminating sugar.
Um,
because that's what we think of is sugar,
right?
It's sweet.

103
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:18.890
So if you have something that has less sugar,
it's going to be less sweet.

104
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.820
So how do I trick the pallet into thinking that it's still tastes sweet,

105
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.180
but that ended up being the easiest part of the book in part because we are very

106
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.490
adaptable and it works with salt and it works with sugar.

107
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.820
If you go without salt or if you go without sugar,
um,

108
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.910
I don't know the exact time it takes,

109
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:42.560
but after awhile your palate just starts to naturally prefer the less salt or

110
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:44.630
the less sugar.
And it's the same with more salt and more sugar.

111
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:46.910
The more you eat of sugar and the more you eat of salt,

112
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.600
the more your palate adjust to that and then you things you want things that are

113
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:52.670
more sugary or more salty.
Um,

114
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.170
so that part was easy in that once I started testing these recipes with less

115
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.700
sugar for me,

116
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.200
I recognize that things that were less sweet tasted just as good,
if not better,

117
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.070
but the challenging part was the chemistry of sugar because sugar does so many

118
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:11.240
other things than just Sweden.
Uh,
the main,

119
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.890
well there's a bunch of main things,

120
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.910
but one of the big things that sugar does is it's hygroscopic,

121
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.744
which means that it,

122
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.980
it attracts moisture in the air and so it attracts water.

123
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.510
And so in any baked good that has sugar in it,
it sits there on the counter.

124
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.650
And as it's sitting there,
it's attracting water model molecules from the air,

125
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.600
which,
and bringing it to itself.

126
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.390
And that's what makes the pastry stay moist for a couple of days.

127
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:38.660
So you can make a cake today and still serve it tomorrow or the next day.

128
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:42.020
And it'll still be great if it has the regular amount of sugar.

129
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.970
As you start to reduce sugar,
it'll taste great when it's fresh out of the oven.

130
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:51.800
And then maybe by tonight or maybe by tomorrow it's dry because it doesn't have

131
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:55.280
that,
the sugars to draw in all the moisture.
Um,

132
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.720
another thing that sugar does is that it,
uh,
caramelizes when it's in the oven.

133
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:04.610
And so when you're making something like a cookie,
the sugar combines with,

134
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:04.820
uh,

135
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.420
all of the other ingredients in the batter and then it hits that oven heat and

136
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:09.710
then it starts to caramelize.

137
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.310
And that's what allows the cookie to be kind of crunchy on the outside and then

138
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:14.810
maybe a little soft on the inside.

139
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.860
So it's really challenging to get texture right when you don't have sugar or if

140
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:21.890
you have less sugar.
I think that was a really big challenge.

141
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.450
Another thing that sugar does,

142
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:26.420
which is kind of in line with the characterization,

143
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:31.210
is that it adds color to baked goods.
And so,
you know,
any picture you,

144
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.880
if you imagine like a beautiful,
uh,
uh,

145
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.760
Vanilla cake you just see like golden bright,
every baking instruct,

146
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:39.860
every recipe says bake till Golden Brown,

147
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.100
but you can't bake things till Golden Brown if there's no sugar because it will

148
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:47.960
never get that way.
Um,
and that was for me something that took me a while to,

149
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.160
to recognize I was making the carrot cake,

150
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:54.800
which is actually the cover photo in the book.

151
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.560
And the carrot cake doesn't have any sugar in it,
but it has apple juice.

152
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.740
It has reduced to apple juice.
And I kept baiting,
you know,

153
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.930
making this batter and testing it and tasting it and saying,
okay,

154
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:07.830
it tastes sweet enough,
putting it into the oven.
And then I do everything by,

155
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:12.831
I don't do it by time because ovens are different and everything's always

156
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.291
different.

157
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:17.670
So at this point I just look at things and I touched them and the first couple

158
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.120
of rounds of this cake,
I would keep it in there until it got brown,

159
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.620
which it turns out it was pretty much burnt because it doesn't Brown without the

160
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:29.130
sugar.
And so when you pull it out of the oven,
it looks really Pale.

161
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:31.500
It looks at the same color as it did when it,
when it goes in,

162
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:32.670
it's just a little bit more solid.

163
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.030
So you have to get used to that when you're not baking with as much sugar.

164
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.110
I really liked the way you have the chapters organized.
Um,

165
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.150
it starts with the lower sugar recipes and then goes into just chocolate,

166
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.810
um,
honey maple and then fruit.
Uh,

167
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.460
why did you decide,

168
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:54.630
what was your reasoning behind organizing it in that way?

169
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.230
While we wanted,
I wanted to ease people into the idea.

170
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:00.120
So the first chapter is,

171
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:05.060
it's probably about 10 or 12 recipes of things that we all eat every day,
um,

172
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.810
that have less sugar.
So not no sugar.
So the,

173
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:12.720
the Fudgy Moscow brownies that I've been in,
the banana bread,

174
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.620
yellow birthday cake,
a coconut Chiffon cake,

175
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:18.540
all of those have white sugar in them,

176
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.840
but at least half the amount or even less than your standard recipe.

177
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.300
So I wanted to just kind of introduce the,

178
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.330
the baker or the reader to the idea that you can reduce sugar and still have

179
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.820
something that tastes great.
Um,

180
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.830
and in fact we have samples of the oatmeal raisin walnut cookie that is made

181
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:39.690
with a third of the amount of sugar as the standard recipe.

182
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.620
So that was the first chapter.
And then I wanted to,

183
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.060
and then in terms of grouping at according to flavors,
um,

184
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.960
a big reason you asked earlier why did I want to write the book and I gave you a

185
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:52.501
couple of reasons.

186
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:56.190
Another reason is that sugar itself doesn't actually taste like anything.

187
00:10:56.191 --> 00:11:00.930
It's just sweet.
Whereas sweeteners like maple and honey and fruit,

188
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.640
they actually have flavor and they add a whole nother dimension of flavor to

189
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:06.930
whatever it is that you're making.

190
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.790
And a big part of writing this book was recognizing that if you don't use sugar

191
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:12.511
as your sweetener,

192
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:16.740
but instead turn to a natural sweetener like a honey or maple or molasses,

193
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.990
you're adding that flavor to your baked good,
which is in my world,

194
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:22.860
a really great thing.

195
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.560
It's like you have something that tastes good and you add more flavor to it,

196
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:29.370
that's even better.
So I wanted to group it accordingly so that if you,

197
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.150
if you're somebody who really likes honey and if you like that flavor of honey,

198
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.630
here's a whole bunch of recipes that allow you to use that rather than white

199
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:39.220
sugar in making your baked goods.
Yeah.

200
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.940
And I told you I made the lemon recut the cupcakes,

201
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:44.760
which are just sweetened with honey and it was great and you would never have

202
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:49.320
known that the frosting even didn't have any sugar in it.
That's great.
Um,

203
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.130
so I did notice that the only cheesecake recipe in here is a cheesecake

204
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.820
<v 0>maple bars,
something like that.
The pumpkin.
Yeah.
Come get in.
That's what it was.</v>

205
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.360
Um,
was there any reason that you didn't?
I happen to love cheesecakes,

206
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.780
so of course I'm asking about.
She's good.
It was there any reason you didn't do,

207
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.350
uh,

208
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.350
just a regular straight up cheesecake or just as it happened was no reason

209
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.250
<v 2>is that we were,
um,
I wanted to do something with Pumpkin.
Um,</v>

210
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.140
and we've often,

211
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.220
we've often talked about introducing a Pumpkin cheesecake during the

212
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.300
Thanksgiving period,
um,
at the bakery.

213
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:25.060
And so I was thinking that we could do something,

214
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:29.840
I mean pumpkin goes well with maple,
but we already have in the book,
um,

215
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.120
uh,
maple pumpkin pie.
Um,
so then I,

216
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.730
I got really interested and excited about baking with dates and so this recipe

217
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:44.371
has dates in the base and then the actual cheesecake is sweetened with unreduced

218
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:49.390
apple juice,
which is one of the,
the go tos in the fruit chapter.
So I was just,

219
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.721
again,

220
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:54.100
you bring in so many more flavors when you are working with fruits versus just

221
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:54.934
with sugar.

222
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.500
And I wanted to try out mixing apple and Pumpkin and it all worked out great.

223
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.663
That's awesome.

224
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.530
<v 0>So,
uh,
again we were talking about this before.</v>

225
00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:08.300
I had thought about going to culinary school for Pastry Arts at one point,

226
00:13:08.301 --> 00:13:12.020
almost dropped out of Grad school to do it and decided instead,

227
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:16.520
not to in part because I was worried that if I did something that I loved doing

228
00:13:16.521 --> 00:13:19.130
at home and on my own time all the time for work,

229
00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:23.180
I wouldn't enjoy it as much anymore.
So do you still like baking?

230
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.220
<v 2>So love baking?
I don't bake as much as I used to for sure.
Uh,
you know,</v>

231
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:33.800
the first six years of the bakery I was baking every day.
Um,

232
00:13:33.801 --> 00:13:35.760
and then when we opened the second location,
I,

233
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:40.260
my role shifted so that I was no longer in the kitchen every single day.
Um,

234
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.630
but I was still in the kitchen probably about half the time.

235
00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:45.030
And then when we opened Cambridge,
the third location,

236
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.730
then it shifted entirely out of the kitchen.
Um,

237
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.870
so I bake now when I'm testing recipes for a book,
um,

238
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.500
and I'll bake,
you know,
at home just for special occasions.
But,
uh,

239
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.280
it's still something that I enjoy.
But as a,
as somebody who,

240
00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:01.950
if you enjoy baking and you want to do it professionally,

241
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.630
I mean not that I think you guys are looking for career changes,
but if you were,

242
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.230
um,
it is just,
it is very,
very different to do it professionally.
It's a job.

243
00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:12.930
It's still work.
You know,
I think we get a lot of people who,

244
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.600
a lot of career changers who come to us and say,

245
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.870
I bake a lot at home and I really love it and I want to come,
you know,

246
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.220
learn how to make cookies at flower.
And everybody loves it for about two weeks,

247
00:14:23.221 --> 00:14:24.660
sometimes three weeks.

248
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.560
And then the reality hits it and it's like everyday you're going to come in and

249
00:14:28.561 --> 00:14:29.880
you're going to crack,
you know,

250
00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:32.490
20 flats of eggs and then you're going to do this and you're,

251
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.800
and nothing changes.
Like there's,

252
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.560
there's just a lot of detail and work and it's hard and it's sweaty and you
know,

253
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.120
it's still work.
So when you're baking at home,

254
00:14:42.121 --> 00:14:44.880
you obviously have freedom to do whatever you want and you get to eat it

255
00:14:44.881 --> 00:14:46.950
whenever you want.
And if it doesn't work out,
no big deal,

256
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:49.440
you just make something else.
It doesn't really work like that at work.

257
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:52.400
So I always try to make understand that it's,

258
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.000
it's still really fun to make it work,
but it's just a different type of fun.

259
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.370
Sure.
Uh,

260
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.400
so my last question before we open it up to the audience is we have backyard

261
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:07.340
hens and so I often have a refrigerator full of two,

262
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:11.270
three dozen eggs.
What's your favorite recipe that uses a lot of eggs?

263
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.910
Uh,
let's see.
Recipes that use love eggs.
I mean sweet or savory.

264
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:18.180
Either way it would be sweet.

265
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.000
The chiffon cake that's in this book actually,

266
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:26.810
or any angel food cake or Chiffon cake,
um,
is,

267
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.960
is great for using a lot of eggs.
I think the,

268
00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.390
the angel food cake in the first book I think uses 12 eggs and we think this

269
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.520
cake might use to eight or,
or 12 eggs.

270
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.850
Any custard basically is going to use a lot of egg yolks.

271
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.730
So in pastry you're always using egg yolks for the most part.

272
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.830
And you're always trying to find something to do with the egg white.

273
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.890
So I feel like ice creams use a lot of egg,

274
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.330
egg yolks and then Marangu since Chiffon cakes and angel food cakes use a lot of

275
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:55.120
egg whites you can make to an angel food cake in a giant customer.

276
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.700
Exactly.
So if there are questions in the audience,

277
00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:02.590
there are microphones set up in the isles a piece.

278
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.990
<v 3>When you experiment with cooking,</v>

279
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.420
do you remember like any really big surprises where you didn't think two things,

280
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:14.960
we're going to compliment each other or go together and they ended up being

281
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:15.794
great.

282
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.760
<v 2>Uh,
and Cook and baking you mean?</v>

283
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.600
I mean I do mostly mostly dabbling around in baking.
Um,
let's see.

284
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:28.130
Two things that we combined that came out great.

285
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.430
Well,
I mean I was surprised at this Pumpkin,

286
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.900
Pumpkin and apple even though pumpkin pie and apple pie sound good.

287
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:38.660
I've never had pumpkin apple pie.
So when we were trying,

288
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:41.360
when I was doing the cheesecake,
I was trying to figure out if,

289
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.130
I mean it's a double edge sword,

290
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:45.920
you're adding the flavor of apple to anything that you sweetened with apple

291
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:48.620
juice,
which is great unless it doesn't go well with apple.

292
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.390
So that actually ended up being really great because Pumpkin is really rich and

293
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.730
earthy and apple is kind of acidic.

294
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.030
And so I often feel like when I'm eating Pumpkin I want something a little bit

295
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:02.540
brighter anyway.
And so by sweetening the Pumpkin with a little bit of apple,

296
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.840
it actually,
for me it's much more rounded,
balanced dessert.

297
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.910
So that was something that I wasn't expecting.

298
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.820
<v 3>You were talking about having to experiment about the</v>

299
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.530
topic and I was just curious,

300
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:23.531
did you play it all with temperature for things like baking cakes or or whatnot?

301
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.320
Um,
at the end.
So you could try and trap the,
uh,
the water at the,

302
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.420
at the tail end of the cooking process or,

303
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:30.910
<v 1>okay.</v>

304
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.080
<v 2>Well we did experiment with a temperature just because there are things that</v>

305
00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:38.140
will,
that you still need them to bake,
but they don't.
Brown.

306
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:42.190
And so you're kind of like adjusting and anything with honey or maple,

307
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:46.360
you want to bake it a little bit less lower temperature anyway,

308
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.690
but the hygroscopic is for when af when it's done and then it's sitting on the

309
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:55.050
counter or an on the shelf or whatever.

310
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.760
That's when that element comes into play more than in the baking,

311
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.830
like in the,
in the oven.
Does that make sense?

312
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.030
<v 3>Yes.</v>

313
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.880
Like it's just throwing it in the freezer at the end wouldn't necessarily help

314
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:09.810
it help capture the water inside of the,
uh,
the cake.

315
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.560
<v 2>No,
it would if you had a cake and if he wanted just to delay that,</v>

316
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.320
that evaporation or the drying,

317
00:18:17.321 --> 00:18:20.380
you could definitely slow it down by putting it in the freezer.
Okay.
For sure.

318
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.110
Yeah.
Yes.

319
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.000
<v 0>Thank you so much for coming.
And my question's not about less sugar,</v>

320
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.310
but one of my favorite treats at flower.
Are They Vegan?

321
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.570
My friend.
Do you have like a Vegan Vanilla Barry and yeah.
Again,
banana,

322
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:40.560
chocolate chip and then any time I eat a vegan treat anywhere else,

323
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.820
it's like really dry and gross.
So,

324
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.090
I don't know if it's a thicker pair of say that and I don't know if it's a

325
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:48.750
secret,

326
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.950
but I've always wondered like what you do with your Vegan treats to make them

327
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:55.110
taste just as good as some of the other ones.

328
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.250
<v 2>Well,
thank you.
Um,</v>

329
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.500
the Vegan muffin recipe is in the second book flower too.

330
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.010
Um,
and what we do is,
you know,
I don't know what other people are doing,

331
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:08.950
but we just substitute the things that,
I mean,

332
00:19:08.951 --> 00:19:10.180
if you're Vegan then you already know,

333
00:19:10.181 --> 00:19:13.600
like instead of milk we use soy milk or coconut milk.

334
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.260
Instead of butter,
we use oil.
Uh,

335
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.650
we didn't do anything for the game instead of eggs.

336
00:19:20.651 --> 00:19:25.120
I think we just kind of fiddled around and with the oil and the milk to make it

337
00:19:25.121 --> 00:19:29.050
still liquid enough.
Um,
but I don't know that we did anything.

338
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.880
You know,
that magic,
there's no magic to it.
I mean,
it's,
it's in,
it's in the book.

339
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.410
I think we just,
I mean,

340
00:19:35.411 --> 00:19:39.070
we spend a lot of time when we do come up with a new recipe,

341
00:19:39.071 --> 00:19:43.510
we spend a lot of time experimenting.
Um,
everything is weighed at the bakery,

342
00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:46.930
everything is weighed to the gram and we will literally change things by one to

343
00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:51.220
2% iteration after iteration to get to where we want it to be.
In fact,

344
00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:53.470
there's an email thread going on right now about something that they're like,

345
00:19:53.471 --> 00:19:57.160
should we up at 5%?
And I was like,
nope,
let's start with 3%.
Let's try it first,

346
00:19:57.161 --> 00:20:00.970
just 3% and then we'll see what happens.
Um,
so there's a lot of testing.

347
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.150
So the recipe for the Vegan muffin that you're talking about,
um,

348
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.860
went through many rounds of,
maybe it started out dry at one point.

349
00:20:08.861 --> 00:20:11.890
Let me just add it more and more stuff.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

350
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.290
<v 0>Hi Joanne.
Thanks so much for coming today.</v>

351
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.770
I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about your process for testing

352
00:20:18.771 --> 00:20:21.140
recipes for a cookbook and how many,

353
00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:24.010
if there's like an average number of times you test a few,

354
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.640
throw it to other people to test to make sure it's accessible for the novice

355
00:20:28.641 --> 00:20:29.330
speaker.

356
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.750
<v 2>Sure.
So if it's a recipe that we already have,</v>

357
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.870
like the Vegan muffin recipe,
which exists at the bakery,
um,

358
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.480
basically what happens is,

359
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.650
so everything's in metric and I just reduce it to what seems like a normal home,

360
00:20:42.651 --> 00:20:46.450
size them out,
and then I'll test it myself.
Um,

361
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.450
and I'll go through it once,
but just because I can do it,

362
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:52.510
I know that that doesn't mean that it's ready for the book because I know what

363
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:55.330
I'm thinking.
So I need to give it to somebody else.
So then a baker,

364
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:59.260
we'll test it within the bakery just to make sure that it's kind of the right

365
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:01.540
thing.
But even that doesn't really work for,

366
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:04.900
from a testing perspective because all the baker's know me and they know what I

367
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:06.520
mean when I say do this,
do that.

368
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.290
So then we send it out and we have a Cambridge culinary,

369
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.370
they will test recipes for us for class credit.
And so there's a whole,
um,

370
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.260
depending on,
you know,

371
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.610
whenever semester I'll reach out to the director and she'll put me in touch with

372
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:24.100
that class and they are on my email list and I say,

373
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:27.070
here's a bunch of recipes I need tested.
Um,

374
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.460
and then I have a couple of testers who are just people that I've worked closely

375
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:33.160
with who just test for me.
So it will take,

376
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.190
I mean if it's something that already existed,
the bakery,

377
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:39.040
it doesn't take that many iterations because we already do it.

378
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:43.030
It's just a matter of figuring out like sometimes as you reduce,
reduce,
reduce,

379
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:44.620
it reduces to a weird number.

380
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.150
It reduces to like one cup plus two tablespoons and one teaspoon,
you know,

381
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:51.610
and that's not really that usable.

382
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.420
So I'll have to change things around and change the proportions around just to

383
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:58.760
make sure that somebody at home can,
can actually do it.
Um,

384
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.370
but that doesn't usually take,
usually takes like one,
one try,
maybe two tries.

385
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.060
But if it's a brand new recipe,
like with the low sugar book,
that would,

386
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.010
I feel like those recipes,

387
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:14.170
a good recipe would take four iterations by me.

388
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.410
So that's me trying it out and then adjusting,
adjusting,
adjusting,

389
00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:19.510
and then by the fourth time being like,
okay,
I think this works.

390
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.380
Then I would give it to a baker and then they would do it and usually again,

391
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:25.840
it was almost the same thing as my doing it.

392
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:29.080
They know me well enough that they would just make it so that's like a fifth

393
00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:34.081
test and then we would send it out to the testers and usually from there I would

394
00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:37.810
say about 80% of the time it worked in 20% of the time I'd get feedback like

395
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:40.090
this isn't really working.
So then we adjust it.

396
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.110
But by that it was usually just one iteration because I would get specific

397
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:47.920
feedback.
I would say,
ah,
I knew that that was going to happen.
Let me adjust this.

398
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.420
So that's a good recipe.
A bad recipe or not a bad recipe.
No bad recipes.

399
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.590
More challenging recipe.
Probably more like eight or nine times.
I mean,

400
00:22:56.591 --> 00:23:01.540
it's just like there's,
again,
because we're doing things in such small,
in pastry,

401
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.670
there's so many things that you can vary,
right?

402
00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:05.830
If you have 10 ingredients in your thing,

403
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.930
in your recipe and you're trying to make it more moist or less sweet or

404
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:14.770
whatever,
if you just adjust one thing,
it's going to affect everything else.

405
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:17.620
So what you want to do is adjust everything,

406
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.200
but then you don't know which one of those adjustments worked in which one

407
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:22.510
doesn't.
So you have to kind of go slowly and say,
well,

408
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:25.360
I'm just going to reduce the eggs from four eggs to three eggs and see what

409
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:28.900
happens.
Then you have to wait until it bakes,
wait until it cools,

410
00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:33.300
try it and then do it again.
So it takes a lot of patients,
but,

411
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.670
but it's a lot of fun and there's a lot of mistakes along the way that most

412
00:23:36.671 --> 00:23:40.150
people don't use mistakes.
So people like to eat the mistakes.

413
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.070
If you need a test us for your next book,
um,

414
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.740
I'd be happy to send recipes out to the office.
Our office is very good.

415
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.870
One,
a test recipes.
Sure.
Hi.
Hi.

416
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.680
<v 0>Um,</v>

417
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.680
I wondered about a convection oven versus conventional in which is your goto and

418
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.230
in what cases will you opt for the other choice and why?

419
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.440
<v 2>We use mostly convection at this point.
Um,</v>

420
00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.930
but it's for,
but it's for a specific pastries.
So for cookies,

421
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.820
Brioche Muffins,
um,
and tarts,

422
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:18.660
tart shells,

423
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.660
we'll use convection and we'll use deck ovens or the still ovens for things like

424
00:24:24.271 --> 00:24:28.860
bread and cakes.
And the difference with the convection,
you know,

425
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.820
you've got the fan warring around which is making the temperature more

426
00:24:32.821 --> 00:24:37.080
consistent,
but it is introducing the element of movement and air.

427
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:42.350
And so for a cookie or a brioche or something that it's relatively stable,

428
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.410
I don't mind that there's air blowing around because I just want it to bake and

429
00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:47.820
I want it to bake relatively evenly.

430
00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:51.450
I don't want half of the Brioche to be under and a half to be over.
Um,

431
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.960
but a cake,
if you put a cake in a convection oven,

432
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.400
what tends to happen is that the cake starts to cook on the outside because

433
00:24:59.401 --> 00:25:03.690
you've got the scoring fan and then the inside is still needing time to cook.

434
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.430
And so the cake will sometimes come out like crispier on the outside.
Like it'll,

435
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.160
it'll finish baking on the outside first.
And by the time the inside is baked,

436
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.700
it'll be over baked on the outside.

437
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.880
So we have found that these still ovens are better for baking cakes because it's

438
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.840
slow,
steady heat.

439
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.290
There's no air that's trying to like basically form across.

440
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.230
And that's the same with bread.
If you put bread in the convection oven,

441
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.820
the air will cause the,
the skin of the bread to crust,

442
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.320
which means that as the yeast is trying to expand and as the brand's trying to

443
00:25:37.321 --> 00:25:40.710
get big and airy,
it can't because it's been crusted over.

444
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.710
So we prefer doing that and it's still oven.

445
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.690
And an even better is if you can inject some steam in it,

446
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.330
take a little water bottle and put some scene.

447
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.880
It creates a really humid environment for the bread.

448
00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:55.970
So then the bread dose stays supple as the East is growing and then it doesn't

449
00:25:56.191 --> 00:25:58.650
crust over until the Easter all dead.
And then it's,

450
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:02.190
and then you get the crust that's characteristic of really good bread.

451
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.300
So that's how we differentiate.
Great.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

452
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.890
<v 0>I,
so I had a question about how do you decide which recipes to share?
I mean,</v>

453
00:26:11.891 --> 00:26:12.250
are there,

454
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.560
do you have a collection of recipes that you're never going to share that or

455
00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:15.850
like the secret ones or,

456
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.480
<v 2>okay.
Uh,</v>

457
00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:21.170
the first book was all the recipes that we had at the time and then since then

458
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:24.710
we've done new things and people will say,
how come you didn't share this recipe?

459
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:27.040
And I'll say,
cause we hadn't made it at that point.
Um,

460
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.850
and the same with the second book,
you know,
we,

461
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.120
I put a bunch of Salads and the second book and then we came up with a new salad

462
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:35.240
menu at the bakery and everyone's like,
where's the green goddess dressing?

463
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:36.950
And I said,
all,
we hadn't made it by then.

464
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.510
So the issue for us now as if somebody wants a recipe that hasn't been tested,

465
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.210
I can give you the recipe to make like 10 gallons of green goddess.

466
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.380
And if you want to do the math or I can do the math as well and just give it to

467
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:51.210
you in grams.
But I don't have,

468
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.260
I don't have home friendly recipes for everything.

469
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:58.050
So that's usually the limiting factor.
And I'll,
if somebody says,

470
00:26:58.051 --> 00:26:59.820
I love this recipe,
I'll just say to them,

471
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.870
I can give it to you in the big batch and I can do the math,
you know,

472
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:07.520
just divide it by,
you know,
50 or whatever.
But depending on your,

473
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.580
your comfort level,
you can either use it or it won't really help.

474
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:15.390
So I don't really feel like recipes are meant to be.
Um,

475
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.620
I feel like recipes are meant to be shared.
Um,

476
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.450
a lot of that comes from the fact that we obviously use the same recipe at the

477
00:27:24.451 --> 00:27:27.570
bakery for all of our items.
Every Baker has,
you know,

478
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.280
access to the big recipe book.
And it's crazy the variation that comes,

479
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.660
even though everything is weighed,
you know,
to the gram and everything is timed,

480
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.730
you know,
to the,
almost to the second.

481
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.890
And yet we will still have huge variations because to me baking isn't just

482
00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:44.221
about,

483
00:27:44.221 --> 00:27:47.430
I mean everyone talks about how baking is chemistry and it's so precise and it

484
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.180
is,

485
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.470
but it's also so much about who you are and what you put into it and how you're

486
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:54.900
feeling that day.
And I know that sounds very like touchy feely,

487
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:59.760
but I really feel like pastry is something that you can tell if somebody's doing

488
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:04.110
it right and doing it well.
And so giving somebody the recipe,

489
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:06.210
isn't it the secret?
It's,
it's just,

490
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.750
it's all the thought and the care and the attention that goes into making it.

491
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.441
That's the secret.

492
00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:14.700
So I'm happy to share all the recipes and hope that everybody has that same

493
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.340
thought and care.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

494
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.220
<v 0>I think we're out of audience questions.</v>

495
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:23.410
I love that last thing that you said because I've always said that,
um,

496
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.380
my art is speaking and that I put love into everything that I make.

497
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:31.140
And so I do that for gifts for people,
for holidays and everything.

498
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:35.120
So it was awesome that you said that.
Thank you so much for coming.
Yeah.
