1
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.810
So welcome everyone and thank you for coming to today's talk today as a member

2
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.560
of the EMEA mental health conference committee and one of your wellbeing champs,

3
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
I'm delighted to be able to welcome flow hos Sovos Habell to Google France.

4
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.420
Uh,

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.390
Florence having studied humanistic psychology and sustainability management in

6
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:31.224
San Francisco.

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.670
She went on to train and positive psychology with the renowned Harvard Professor

8
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.630
Tal Ben Shahar.

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.950
She is the best selling author of the hockey [inaudible] and power by that.

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.460
And she joined us today to discuss Alicia superpowers.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.860
Please put your hands together for flow house.

12
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.690
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.030
<v 3>Thank you very much.
You can give me one.
You really want this.
So Bourgeois,
hello,</v>

14
00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.511
my name is,

15
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:04.511
I'm is floss foreign tribe or I'd pick to do this talk in English because I

16
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:08.960
believe most of you do speak English and most talks I do are in French.

17
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:12.690
So I decided to do something a little more difficult than I usually do since we

18
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:15.710
are going to be unleashing our superpowers.

19
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.460
So why would we talk about superpowers?
Possibly.

20
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.240
How many of you here are familiar with positive psychology?

21
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.940
Okay.
So for the rest of us,
um,

22
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.980
positive psychology is not positive thinking just so you relax on that matter.

23
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.330
The um,
what,
what is positive psychology?
Basically about 20 years ago,

24
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.270
a researcher from University of Pennsylvania,

25
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:46.271
Marty Seligman realize that when we dealt with research and psychology,

26
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:52.130
it always had to do with um,
mental health of course,

27
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:53.810
but with mental diseases.

28
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.030
And basically he was elected at the head of the Psychology Institute of the

29
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:03.320
United States,
which basically brings together researchers and Seligman said,

30
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560
why don't we try and see if we could think research differently to come up with

31
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:11.570
a preventive psychology?

32
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.710
Because we all know that in health matters there are things that we can do more

33
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:20.150
of or less of that will enable us to live longer and better health.

34
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.180
But on a mental level,

35
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.270
are there things that we can do more of or less of that will enable us?

36
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.770
So what can it enable us to do?

37
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800
Not so much avoid the hardships of life because of the hardships will be coming

38
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.080
our way.
Maybe it's already they have already come your way.

39
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.960
But the good news is they are heading towards us.

40
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140
So since they are heading towards us to know how to get back on our feet in

41
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:51.680
order to feel more power,

42
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.990
to be able to get back in our daily lives after miserable things happen to us.

43
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.300
And that's when he decides to a new area of research.

44
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.470
Positive psychology is actually brings together researchers from different

45
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.250
psychology labs who work on three things,
behaviors,

46
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.210
personalities and organizations that work.

47
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.400
It's also called the science of happiness.

48
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.160
Have you heard of the science of happiness?
Okay,
wonderful.

49
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:23.050
So this is what positive psychology is.
So my job,
my day job,

50
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.820
I have a few,
a few jobs,
but my day job is to actually be um,

51
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.410
happiness teacher.
So what I do is a look at the research,

52
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.470
try everything before I get anywhere to talk or write about it.

53
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.530
And thanks for the author thing.
Um,
I have published books,

54
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.950
so maybe I am the first author that you are seeing here.
I don't know,
maybe.

55
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.760
Anyway,
before I write anything,
before I talk about anything,

56
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.170
I actually try it out.

57
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.000
And I guess that's how I am able to come in and tell you what we can possibly
do.

58
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.840
Positive psychology is information.
It's not therapy.

59
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.470
Once you know that there are certain behaviors that can lead us to feel this way

60
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:08.050
or that,
then you're completely free to try it out.

61
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.650
So since this is all about happiness,
let's start with happiness.

62
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.820
What is happiness?
Basically,
maybe I'll begin with what it is.
Not.

63
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.530
Happiness is not the opposite of unhappiness.

64
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.990
If you look at your lives,
whatever day goes by,

65
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.700
whatever month or a year goes by,

66
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.900
you will be swinging from one state to the next.
Sometimes you feel great,

67
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.200
sometimes you feel awful and maybe the day so far has gone perfectly well.

68
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.780
None of us here is protected from receiving a terrible text message where your

69
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:48.790
world goes upside down.
None of us,
but on the other hand,

70
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.150
we can wake up healing really grumpy and none of us is protected from a coup to

71
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:00.820
food dog.
You know what good food was love at first sight.

72
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.760
Okay,
we have no idea what's going to happen.

73
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.990
The only thing that we have to understand is that we will be swinging from one

74
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.220
state to the other.

75
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.120
And the opposite of happiness is apathy.

76
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.890
Apathy is when we are stuck in the middle and we just don't know where to go.

77
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.900
And the clinical version of empathy is called depression and that in that

78
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:26.470
particular matter,
we need regular psychology to cure us.

79
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.350
But when we're dealing with flourishing,

80
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.890
when we're dealing with how do we enjoy the projects that we work on,

81
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.160
how do we enjoy the relationships that we are in?

82
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.330
How do we dilate inside of our little envelope here?

83
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:45.250
This is a pretty small space that we each use on this planet within that little

84
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.990
space.
How can we use up most of the space that is ours actually?

85
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.390
And that is what positive psychology is about.

86
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.960
Let's expand inside who we are.

87
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.700
So I have a question for you.

88
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:03.470
Where does our ability to be happy come from?

89
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.120
I'll be a little more specific.

90
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.250
Who among you believes that our ability to be happy is genetic?

91
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.200
That it is preprogrammed?
Who thinks it is?
Okay?

92
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.790
Who thinks it's not?
All right.
And who doesn't know,

93
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.033
okay,

94
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.300
so this is one of the first things that regular psychology,

95
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.830
one of the first question that they asked,

96
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.340
where does our ability to be happy come from?
Is it genetic?

97
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.490
So the first thing they have to do is scratched their head.

98
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.280
How can we find that out?

99
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.860
And they realize there's only one way to go.

100
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.900
They're going to have to find identical twins and identical,

101
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.800
identical twins are basically one egg that hasn't been separated in two pieces.

102
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.810
So it's the same genetic code.

103
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.250
But we need these twins to have been separated at birth,

104
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.640
adopted in different families and we prefer them to be older than 40 years old.

105
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:05.831
So things have happened to them and these twins come in and the question is now

106
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.280
to measure their happiness level.

107
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.880
So how does one measure of happiness level?

108
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.020
Basically there's no software,

109
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.750
there's no blood test,

110
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.480
no saliva tests that can tell us if you're happy.

111
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.370
The only way to measure happiness is self declarative.

112
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.580
Knowing that you are the only person to know how you feel.

113
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.680
So we asked you a series of questions and you always have to answer on a scale

114
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.870
from one to 10 so for example,

115
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.440
you can be asked how do you feel about your current projects?

116
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.090
Or you can be asked,

117
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.210
how do you feel when you look at your peers or how do you feel about your

118
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.450
childhood dreams?
We can also go through emotions.

119
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.840
How much joy do you feel right now?
How much anger,

120
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.970
how much fear and so forth.

121
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.950
We sum it all up and we have an average.
That's your happiness score.

122
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.970
So the twins have very different lifestyles.

123
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.680
They are asked all these questions,

124
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.430
however they come up,

125
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.490
90% of them declare the exact same level of happiness as their twin.

126
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.920
So the researchers are very happy and they publish and they say,
okay,

127
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.670
Ladies and gentlemen,
happiness.
It's just like height.
It's genetic.

128
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.730
The talk is over.
Okay,

129
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:38.840
this is before positive psychology comes in.
So we live with that for awhile.

130
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.880
And then these new scientists come in was a very,

131
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.900
with a slightly different approach when it comes to happiness.

132
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.300
Basically what they have figured out is the following,

133
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.760
the question conditions,
the response,

134
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:58.230
which means that if our lives,
we look for what's wrong,

135
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.900
we will find what's wrong right away.

136
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.020
But if we start looking for what is right,

137
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.850
then we will start looking what is right and what is going well in our lives.

138
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:10.440
So what they see are the same results,

139
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:15.390
but they read them upside down and what they are interested in are the 10% of

140
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:19.350
twins who have the exact same genetic code as somebody else.

141
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.910
However they are happier or unhappier.
How is it possible?

142
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.690
So a woman named Sonja Lyubomirsky a works out of UC Davis in California and in

143
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:36.060
her lab,
the only question she asks is where does happiness comes from?

144
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.480
She has met people who have experienced all our wildest dreams,

145
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.830
winning at the lottery,
getting an entire makeover physically,
you know,

146
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:49.710
that type of crazy things that we always think that could possibly make us

147
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:50.491
happier.
Anyway,

148
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:53.910
she went through a bunch of bunch of bunch of situations and people and

149
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:55.980
basically she was able to figure it out.

150
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.610
50% of our ability to experience happiness is actually predetermined.

151
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.830
It comes from one of our genes,
um,
called the five htt five,

152
00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:13.831
eight htt swims up there somewhere and is responsible for manufacturing all the

153
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:20.550
neuro transmitters that run up in our brains.
Dopamine,

154
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.130
endorphins,
Serotonin,
oxytocin,
you know all these words.

155
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.870
Okay.
Lots of inwards that are basically all the substances that our brain will

156
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:34.920
actually manufacturer when we feel great and when we feel great it manufacturers

157
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:39.921
even more so the longer the five hgt the more of these neurotransmitters,

158
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.140
our brain is able to manufacture.
The shorter it is,

159
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:47.580
the drier it is up there.

160
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:53.150
So this is why there are different types of personalities and we all have people

161
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:59.130
around us for whom everything is fun,
everything is cool.

162
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.510
Basically it's probable that they have a very long five HDT and then for the

163
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:04.051
rest of us,

164
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:07.950
maybe it's a bit shorter and we don't really experience things the same way.

165
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.050
But you know something,
it's exactly like height.
It is a lottery.
But for example,

166
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.910
I belong to,
um,
let's say I'm a short person.
Okay,

167
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:21.840
well I can tell the tall people that even at this altitude,
life is fine,

168
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.310
you know,
we are fine.
We will get used to whatever our conditions are.

169
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.520
And that's the good thing about humans where great to chameleons.

170
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.570
So that's half of it,
of our ability to be happy.
Now,

171
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:37.770
what else do we need to be happy?
So I'll just take orders.

172
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.220
What would you like?
We all want the same thing.
Okay.

173
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:45.420
So you can just shout it out.
Love.
Thank you.

174
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.670
What else?
Excuse me.
Connections.
Yes.

175
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.550
Purpose.
Yeah.
What else?

176
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.080
Foodha yeah,
absolutely.
Food.

177
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.210
Certainly health.
Yes.
To be in good health.
Of course.

178
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.930
Comfort.
Little,
many.
Anybody?
Nah,

179
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.800
really not sunshine,
you know,
just the regular stuff.
I mean,

180
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:17.530
there's a lot of regular stuff that actually makes us happy.

181
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.240
So if we talk about regular stuff such as sunshine and comfort,

182
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.660
for example,
even the health,
uh,
the weather,

183
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.540
I mean everybody religiously looks at the weather.

184
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.200
It's usually 53% accurate,
not much more.
However,

185
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:35.650
we still look at the weather as an anticipation to our happiness.

186
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.280
All those things are circumstances and the outside circumstances,

187
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.620
even even our health is a circumstance.

188
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:49.621
Actually the circumstances count for 10% of our happiness.

189
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.640
But the thing is we each,
we all have a list.
It's not even one are long.

190
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.670
It's two arms long of things that we would like to change or meat or eradicate.

191
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.490
If it was legal,
you know,
things where we think,
yes,

192
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.320
if I could change my life,
if things were different than I would be happier,

193
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.870
maybe 10% happier.

194
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.030
But then of course we do sometimes need to act on our circumstances and we can.

195
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.740
But what we cannot expect is that changing the circumstances will change

196
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:31.480
everything that happens.
So 50% is preprogrammed,

197
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.290
10% comes from the outside.
How much is left?

198
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.920
40% yes,
you people can count.
Great.

199
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.660
So what do these last 40% rely on?

200
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.930
They rely on how we,

201
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.790
in our interpretation of what happens in our lives.

202
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.120
And it has been determined that the happiest people,

203
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.470
when something does not go the way they had planned it,

204
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.040
what they will do is that rather than considering it as a setback,

205
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.580
they will actually feel that they're already moving forward in a different

206
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:10.414
direction.

207
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.520
Meaning when something happens to us that upsets us,

208
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.030
that we did not plan.
We do not want,
we will be frustrated,

209
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.960
we will be angry,
we will be pissed off.
We may even cry.

210
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.700
It's called being human.
But pretty quickly these people will say,

211
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:32.530
okay,
I had planned to go this way.
I'm actually going to have to go this way.

212
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.500
And they get back on their feet and they start moving again.

213
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.220
And basically what we have to remember is that it is not so much what happens to

214
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.214
us,

215
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:47.310
but it is what we do about what happens to us that really matters.

216
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.250
So I know a little bit about that,
about,
um,

217
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.060
I became interested in positive psychology and uh,

218
00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.300
and change to this new profession because my previous job left me.

219
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.100
So in such a circumstance.
But Lisa,
have you think it's funny?

220
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.700
I didn't think it was very funny.
When did I,
when it,
when it happened.
Exactly.

221
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.980
It's always,
you know,
it's always a little,
uh,

222
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.550
lots of things downsizing and Yossi.
No,
everything's fine.

223
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:17.960
But it is a little humiliating.
I mean,

224
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:20.750
there's a lot of stuff that happens at that particular time.

225
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:22.550
But had it not happened,

226
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.740
I really don't know why or how I would've gone back to study,

227
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.370
had the time to simply gone back and studied positive psychology for real,

228
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.233
which is what I did.

229
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.730
And I learned all this material and I thought it was so easy to implement and so

230
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:42.050
interesting and so ongoing because the research is constantly ongoing.

231
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.920
It's a very new science that I decided.
So in France,

232
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:48.950
things are sort of well organized when you get fired,
you know about that.

233
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.290
And I had a little time on my hands,
right?

234
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.520
So what I decided to do was try everything.
So I tried everything.

235
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.520
I learned meditation.
You guys know about meditation,
right?
Okay.

236
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.080
You know that meditation can be learned.
You don't just sit there and meditate.

237
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:05.570
It's actually a skill.
It's like the rest of the things that we,

238
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.610
that we know how to do.
Uh,

239
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.820
I exercised more to be honest.

240
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:12.910
I began exercising and,

241
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.520
and I did write letters to people in my life because when you do write letters

242
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:20.310
to people,
you are,
you are happier.
And then at the end of this,
um,

243
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.450
particular year,
I have a tendency to forget things.

244
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:28.400
I didn't want to forget this time.
So I decided to sit down and write the story.

245
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.220
And when the book came out here in France,

246
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.210
I end the book did very well instantly.
So that was a surprise.

247
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:39.020
But I realized something very simple that although we are very unique

248
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:39.854
individuals,

249
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.300
there's something we have all in common with more information,

250
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.980
we make better decisions and the more we know about behaviors,

251
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:54.050
the freer we are to choose to implement these behaviors or to try things out.

252
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.910
And that's how I decided to go on and keep talking about this particular,

253
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.780
um,
particular topic.
Then,

254
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.770
um,
as we see in,
in,
in French,

255
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:10.250
the basically show,
she pen look too busy.

256
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.780
She do a bus ran me over,
not literally,

257
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.130
but we will all be run over by buses.
And in my case,

258
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.110
um,
what happened is that I had a very,
um,
very close and dear cousin,

259
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:28.000
his name was David Servant Schreiber.
Some of you may know his,
uh,

260
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.060
his name and um,
David was my age and David died.

261
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.230
He died from brain tumor.
He was a doctor and he,
uh,

262
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.920
as a doctor when he was diagnosed,
he was diagnosed when he was 30 years old.

263
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.960
And she decided to look for ways that he could fight cancer.
His doctor said,

264
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:47.510
just go on and live the way you live your life.
And he said,
no,

265
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:50.430
I don't believe that and I'm sure there's something better that I can do.

266
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.970
So he began researching all the compulsing,

267
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:57.810
all the research that has been done about fighting cancer cells that weren't

268
00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:02.490
really promoted and basically completely changed his lifestyle and gained 20

269
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:04.740
years of life expectancy.

270
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.310
Brie tumor is usually when the fight and it did.

271
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.220
David was a psychiatrist and he had,
um,

272
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.650
built a training school for a psychiatrist and that company was orphaned.

273
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.570
And one thing that I decided to do,
uh,
when morning is I woke up and,
um,

274
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.770
and I thought,
okay,

275
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:26.580
I'm going to buy this company from his kids and I'm going to continue his work.

276
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.330
And that's when all my little voices woke up.

277
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.760
So one of the voice here told me,
you know,
flow,
let me just remind you,

278
00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:38.370
you can't count,
which is not untrue.

279
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.410
And then another voice here said,
you did already start a company,
remember?

280
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:46.860
And I'm,
and the company went broke.
Are you sure you want to do that again?

281
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:50.760
And they said,
okay girls,
thank you very much for the advice,
but I'm going,

282
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.150
I'm going to do this.
And this was seven years ago.

283
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.570
<v 1>Okay,</v>

284
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.070
<v 3>I have no other</v>

285
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:04.910
word to define what has happened to us professionally then to say that we have

286
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.000
flourished.

287
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:10.740
You know what Florida's for w so how do you flourish on a professional level?

288
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:12.690
What does it mean?
So it means,
of course,

289
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:16.020
that all the jobs were saved and we have created more.
We've expanded.

290
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:18.480
It means that we've gone beyond our objectives.

291
00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:23.481
It means that we like the way we contribute to the area that is ours.

292
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.070
And it also means that we were able to learn to work together because there were

293
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:33.300
people that had,
I had not chosen and they had not chosen me either.
However,

294
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.680
it did work out.
So I began wondering how is it possible?

295
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.300
How can somebody very normal like me?
So I know,
I know two things.

296
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:45.630
I was trained in English obviously and in psychology,

297
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.030
but running a company,
managing a team,
not only did I have no appetite,

298
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.960
but you know,
no intuition for that at all.
But it worked.

299
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.860
So that's when I began looking at superpowers,
obviously.

300
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.360
And um,

301
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.450
and I was started to wonder if they weren't within each one of us very simple

302
00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:10.641
things that we can actually count on when the storm's started,

303
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.730
you know,
coming up and coming at us.
So naturally,
what did I do?

304
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.120
I turned to positive psychology and what these bunch of researchers did when

305
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:23.570
they actually began,
um,
positive psychologists,

306
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.580
they realize that there was no universal list of human qualities.

307
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:35.390
We did not know what qualities were to be found across the world and that we

308
00:20:36.121 --> 00:20:37.050
could actually count on.

309
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:40.470
So they began looking and they read everything that was published in psychology,

310
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:43.200
philosophy,
religions,
and put them all together.

311
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:48.530
And they came up with 24 common character strengths.

312
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.470
They call them characteristics or qualities basically.
And um,

313
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.060
so they had to make sure they had to verify that these qualities actually really

314
00:20:58.061 --> 00:21:02.530
existed when you went down to meet people.
So they separated in different teams.

315
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.820
And one of the team,

316
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:08.821
my favorite team went to Africa and they go and visit Messiah Warriors.

317
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.720
Now,
Mussai warriors are people who still hunt lions with,
um,

318
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.130
pierces peers is that I said spears,
spears with a spear.

319
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.930
And so they go to the Maasai warrior.
And,
um,
they said,
okay,

320
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:26.530
this is for like a,
a study that we are handling.

321
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.390
Um,
do,

322
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.500
are you familiar with the concept of leadership?

323
00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.150
So the Maasai warriors says,
yes,
I am.
So no,
no,
no.

324
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.890
Do you personally know people who actually,
um,

325
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.010
our leaders?
So the [inaudible] where it says,
yes,
I do.
No.

326
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.380
Do you know as many men as women who actually express leadership?

327
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.610
So the warrior says,
yes,
I do.
It's isn't it?
About one more question,

328
00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.230
would you like your children to actually express leadership and said,

329
00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:02.540
of course I want my children to express leadership.
So we're like,
yeah,

330
00:22:02.541 --> 00:22:05.330
they know about leadership.
You know,
it's very,
it's a familiar trait.

331
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:10.280
And they did the same thing with Eskimos,
Eskimo,
um,
uh,
Fisher,

332
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.040
this show fishermen.
Thank you very much,
uh,
with,

333
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:19.070
with Eskimos and so forth and they validated these qualities.

334
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.330
So let's see what qualities we have in this room.
May as well.

335
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.620
Who among you
is funny.

336
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

337
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.060
<v 3>Okay.
All right.
That's not bad.
You know,
when you,</v>

338
00:22:36.061 --> 00:22:40.920
when you walk in a costs of a elementary school children and you say,
okay,

339
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.240
who is smart?
Everybody raises their hands.
All right,

340
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.920
so I'll ask it again.
Who among you is funny?
All right.
Okay.

341
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:51.990
There you go.
Who,

342
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.290
who among you has the essence of justice?

343
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.720
Yes.
Very nice.

344
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.440
Who among you is a perseverance?

345
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.770
Yeah.
Okay,
wonderful.
Little harder.

346
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.680
Who among you is honest?

347
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.550
Okay.
Most of you are more honest than you think.
Okay,
let me just check.
Uh,

348
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:24.560
who has ever kissed anyone?
Okay,

349
00:23:24.561 --> 00:23:27.890
this is a happiness class.
You know,
there are things that are worth living for.

350
00:23:27.891 --> 00:23:32.810
You know,
things like you could,
you could actually try it.
So these are very,

351
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.860
these are very common qualities.
And what is a super power,

352
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.160
it's a very common quality except that it's yours.

353
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.410
So basically,
how do you it?

354
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.530
So the culture that I come from being French,

355
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.810
you have to know if you're not from this country,

356
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.620
that talking about your qualities just never happens.

357
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.940
It's not something we do.
It's rude,
it's pretentious.

358
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.190
It's absolutely not something we ever do.

359
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.830
So when we do come up with a list like that,

360
00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:07.010
it's very useful because all of a sudden there's something,
a little objective,

361
00:24:07.011 --> 00:24:10.130
you know,
because actually what you do is you go online and you answer a bunch of

362
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:13.940
questions and at the end of the questionnaire you are given the answers that

363
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:17.990
tell you,
okay,
among the 24 universal character strengths,

364
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.800
these is how yours are organized.
And then you know how it works.

365
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.800
Why is it useful?
I'll give you an example.

366
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.760
When I decided to write this book,

367
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.110
I had no idea how you write a book.
So actually went and asked people,

368
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.850
senior people who had written books,
they all came up with their um,

369
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.430
with the different ways that they do it.
But one thing came up,

370
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.370
came back systematically.
All of them told me,

371
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.580
you sit down at 8:00 AM and you do not get up until 12 so I sat down at 8:00 AM

372
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.450
and I had the title of the book,
like you spousal,
that I knew

373
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.263
nine o'clock

374
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.020
I'm sitting now 10 o'clock,

375
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.100
11 o'clock balance it out,
1130,

376
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:25.490
12 o'clock and by 12 o'clock I feel like a pile of dust under my desk.

377
00:25:26.521 --> 00:25:27.480
And I say to myself,

378
00:25:27.481 --> 00:25:31.380
how do you expect to write a book considering you can't even stay on your chair

379
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.490
basically.
And I did tell you earlier,
I think that,
I forget everything.

380
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:40.410
One thing that I had forgotten when I actually studied positive psychology,

381
00:25:40.411 --> 00:25:41.990
of course I answered this question.

382
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:46.080
They're just one of the basis basic things that you do and there is a quality

383
00:25:46.081 --> 00:25:50.070
that a lot of you here have and you have to know that I'm very,

384
00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:53.550
I'm impressed by how many of you have this quality,

385
00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:55.440
which is called perseverance.

386
00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.890
Perseverance is the ability to start something and take it all the way until

387
00:26:01.051 --> 00:26:04.040
it's done.
When I answer the question,

388
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:06.540
they're out of the 24 strengths.

389
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.070
My 24th strength is perseverance,

390
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:17.090
which means that in this life I will never experience perseverance and it

391
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.190
absolutely does not matter.

392
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.030
And what we have to understand is that if you want to do,

393
00:26:24.031 --> 00:26:26.430
if we do want to take on challenges,

394
00:26:26.431 --> 00:26:31.110
to have interesting relationships with people to are to be excited about the

395
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:34.740
projects that we're actually running and enjoy doing what we're doing,

396
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:40.160
we have to honor the strengths that come to us naturally.

397
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.190
So in my case,
I'll give you my first,
first top five.

398
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.840
Number one is curiosity.
Number two is creativity.

399
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.030
Number three is the ability to love and be loved.

400
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.640
Meaning that people matter a lot to me.

401
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.020
Number four I did not even know it was a strength.

402
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.150
It's called recognition of beauty.

403
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.900
It means that I'm very sensitive to beauty around me,

404
00:27:06.901 --> 00:27:11.900
but also to a job well done.
And the number four is a,

405
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.550
it's called zest,
just whether the evil,

406
00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.430
how do you write a book with these things?

407
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:23.250
Basically the way it works is that I do sit down at eight o'clock just like the

408
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:25.560
perseverance.
My brain is fresher.
Yes,

409
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.120
but I do exactly what I can and when I can't take it anymore,

410
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.540
I do get up and I go in the room next door and it so happens to be the kitchen

411
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.920
and with my fingers,
my creative fingers who can not just do intellectual stuff.

412
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.190
I will either cook something or make myself a cup of tea.
It doesn't matter.

413
00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:44.160
I need to use my fingers differently.
I come back,

414
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.740
I sit down and when I get stuck again,

415
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.980
I'll probably grab a pen and start drawing a star or whatever because I'm

416
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:57.621
thinking already about the cover of the book and it says it matters to me as

417
00:27:57.691 --> 00:27:59.460
much as what's inside the book.

418
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.020
And then I get back to work and I live in Paris.
When I get stuck again,

419
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.490
I even live in this neighborhood.

420
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.010
You may see me walking around when I get stuck again,

421
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.270
what I do is I go outside and I need to see,
I need to count buses and fell,

422
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:12.820
shook Golan,

423
00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.820
whatever there is because my curiosity needs to be fed every day and on the way

424
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:23.430
back I will probably call somebody and have a conversation with a person,

425
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:28.110
with a live person,
and once I understood that and honored that,

426
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.910
not only was I able to hand my book in with the 24 hours ahead of time,

427
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.330
but most importantly I began enjoying what I was doing and what we each and

428
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.790
every one of us has to remember is that we are completely unique.

429
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.430
We are a complete,
unique,

430
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:51.510
completely unique composition of these qualities.
Statistically,

431
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:56.190
it's impossible to have somebody in this room who has the same design of

432
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:57.030
qualities.

433
00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:02.180
Then you have and probably if you are stuck in anything in your life,

434
00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:07.170
whether it's a project that's difficult or communicating with your kids,

435
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:09.600
communicating with your lover,
whatever it is,

436
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.120
you are probably not using your top qualities and you are probably using the

437
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:19.020
ones that are in the middle or maybe the worst part is in the bottom.

438
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.740
The French school system is very perseverance.

439
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.880
I was a very miserable students in school,

440
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.710
but now that I can design my own line of work and the way I do it and however I

441
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:32.250
want to do it,

442
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:37.110
of course there's no practically no limits to where you can go once you start

443
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:40.590
respecting that.
So when I was looking for superpowers,

444
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.630
I also began wondering if there weren't things that were a little more common to

445
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:46.690
everybody,
not as singular as the character strengths.

446
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.470
And I ran into something very interesting called the others,

447
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.470
other people at,

448
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.810
unless you've heard the fact that we are social creatures,

449
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.660
meaning that we are very interdependent.

450
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:03.250
So if people look at you with admiration,

451
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.490
you would feel,
you will feel admirable.

452
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.170
You say that if people look at you with criticism,

453
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.590
you're actually going to feel terrible about yourself.
That's how it works.

454
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:16.720
Who are that sensitive to other people?

455
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.550
And there's one great study you probably heard about this study already where

456
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:25.030
researchers come into classrooms where children are between eight and nine years

457
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:27.100
old and they tell the teacher,

458
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:32.320
we came up with a questionnaire to determine if you have high potential students

459
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.180
in your class.
Okay,

460
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:39.270
so the kids answer the question there is they have no idea what they're going

461
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:43.900
to,
what,
why they are answering these questions.
So the answer,
the answer,

462
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:47.200
everything.
Then the researchers gather all the,

463
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.050
all the tests and they thank everybody and they leave.

464
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.840
They get to their lab and they throw everything out.

465
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.350
They come back three weeks later and say,

466
00:30:56.351 --> 00:31:00.790
we have looked through every single test,
which is completely untrue.
Uh,

467
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:04.180
we have looked for the test and we have found some high potential students in

468
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:07.810
your class.
Would you like to know who they are?
Of course the teacher says yes.

469
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.790
They don't even go and see the kids.

470
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.560
They asked for list and randomly,
completely randomly,

471
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:18.430
they point to three kids.
She's one,
she's won,
he's won.

472
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.540
Those kids that particular year made tremendous progress compared to their other

473
00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:30.040
classmates and later on went for longer studies.

474
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:34.810
Why?
Because for one year somebody looked at them thinking,

475
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.180
you are a high potential person

476
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.320
and I can hear you.
So the first thing that comes through your mind is,
okay,

477
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.460
people should have looked at me differently.
Right.
That explains it all.

478
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:54.160
Okay.
Then if any by any chance you have children of your own,

479
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:58.630
you are completely panicked.
It is still time and,

480
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.440
but the question that I would rather ask you is how do you look at people,

481
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.890
because I know how the French people look at other French people,

482
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.420
but how do you look at people?
Do you look at people wondering,
Oof,

483
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.930
look at this guy or do you wonder what are this person's qualities?

484
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.040
What are their super powers?
How do I work with these super powers?

485
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:24.640
Because in an ideal world,
parents would look at their children.

486
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:28.930
Like those managers would look at their employees like this.

487
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.790
Teachers would look at their students like this,
but then there's real life.

488
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.870
I can testify.
When,
um,

489
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.890
my oldest son Arthur was 21 he came to me and he said,

490
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.170
okay mom,
I'm going to Australia.

491
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.950
So I'm trained in positive psychology.

492
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:54.010
You know the whole deal and what comes out of my mouth is don't even think about

493
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:56.870
it.
That's real life.

494
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.640
So what we need to do about this information,
just remember that here,

495
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:06.080
what matters are the 40% that we actually have control over.

496
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.750
I have no control over what you're right now thinking about me.

497
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:16.190
None.
And I never will that I cannot control.

498
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:19.550
I have no influence on,
but this is what I have control on.

499
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:24.820
I can decide who I talked to and about what meaning when Arthur comes to me

500
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:32.290
because his plan is to go to Australia and I'm unable to encourage him,

501
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:37.880
then his mission is to go to somebody else who sees him bigger than he is.

502
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:40.370
We all have in our lives,

503
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.730
people that we actually turned to when we want to do something difficult and we

504
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:48.470
say,
okay,
this is what I want to do.
And then some people would say,
yeah,

505
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.780
um,
you know,
I don't know.

506
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.050
I just wouldn't want you to be disappointed type of reaction.
Okay.
You,

507
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.100
you don't go back to these people.
And then there are other,

508
00:33:58.101 --> 00:33:59.900
there's another type of person where you actually say,

509
00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:04.310
I do want to go to Australia was a yes,
absolutely.
You have to go to Australia.

510
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.120
We must know in our lives who sees us bigger than we are.

511
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.930
We can organize our support system,

512
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:19.340
we can organize the mirror that is actually held in front of us because this is

513
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:20.450
how we'll push forward.

514
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:26.140
So let me finish with the 10 happiness tips if you want scientifically proven.

515
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:32.810
Okay?
All of them.
Number one,
savor more.

516
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.790
Several eight.
You know,

517
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:38.930
it's savoring is we spend so much time being already in the whatever's coming

518
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:41.720
next or still in what came before that.

519
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:45.530
Most of the time we just forget to be here doing what we're doing right now.

520
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.810
So one way to save her is very easy when we're actually somewhere and happy

521
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:53.780
about where we are,
we turn to the person next to us and we just say,

522
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:56.210
this is great.
That's sabering.

523
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.903
Number two,

524
00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.360
stop comparing yourselves to others.

525
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.620
Not only are you fine the way you are,

526
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:15.130
but it is the way you are that we need you to be because that is when you're the

527
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:19.340
most singular,
the most attractive,

528
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.120
the most competent,
the most unique.

529
00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.930
There was absolutely nobody else out there like you.

530
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:31.280
And your only job is to live with this particular person.

531
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:36.290
So that's all you have to do.
And when I say stop comparing yourself to others,

532
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.980
we usually compare ourselves socially.
So when it comes to happiness,

533
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:45.270
this is the next step tip.
Think less about money.

534
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.170
All the economists have looked at the situation.

535
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.200
What is the link between wealth and happiness?

536
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.260
So of course if you are destitute,

537
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.580
if you are a refugee for example,
it what?

538
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.320
It will make a lot of difference necessarily.

539
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.010
But in this particular room right here,

540
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:10.230
they probably will not make a difference.

541
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:15.300
Accumulating goods has never made anybody happy.

542
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.490
There is one exception
shoes.

543
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.370
Next tip,

544
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.170
scientifically proven the shoes and we're waiting for the handbag research.

545
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.240
It's on its way.
Um,
next tip.

546
00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.170
There are three components to happiness.
One is pleasure,

547
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.630
number two is engagement.
And number three is meaning,

548
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:49.630
which means that we need all three.
Pleasure is not enough pleasures.

549
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:54.090
Great engagement means we need to be part of part of groups,

550
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.570
part of projects.
There's something very active about being happy.

551
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.320
It's not just watching nature,
watching nature is part of happiness,

552
00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:04.680
but there's something very productive.
But it's not enough.

553
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.240
We also need to have meaning.
Why am I doing all this?

554
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.470
What does it bring to me?
What am I bringing to the world?
That's very important.

555
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:14.970
So there too,

556
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.210
if you think your life these days is not exactly how you want it to be,

557
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.500
do you have enough pleasure?

558
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.470
Sometimes we're changing the world and we're super busy,

559
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.600
but is it pleasant enough for us?

560
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.720
And then sometimes we're partying like while you know,
while people,

561
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.160
and were completely engaged,
but is there any meaning to us?

562
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.690
So it's a way of adding what you need or just making sure everything is there.

563
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.390
Following,
um,
tip has been proven by Maria Montessori.
You know,

564
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:45.240
she works with children.
She worked with children,
were big children.

565
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:50.610
We're never as happy as when we have decided what we're doing.

566
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.840
So the best thing to do is to take initiatives and say,

567
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:57.240
this is what I want to do.
This is what I want to work on.

568
00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.790
This is what I want to watch,
this is what I want to eat.

569
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.500
The more we express our needs and desires,
the easier it is to get there.

570
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.960
Number six,

571
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:12.510
cherish your family's.
Cherish your friends,

572
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.480
cherish your colleagues.
Why do I say this?

573
00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:20.481
Because I'm the longest happiness study began in 1938 it was decided to follow

574
00:38:21.931 --> 00:38:25.440
the entire class of Harvard University.
All men at the time.

575
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:31.130
And they all agreed to answer a questionnaire every year about their life

576
00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:36.100
conditions and their happiness levels.
After 30 years,

577
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:39.040
the researcher,
um,
retires.

578
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.040
So the younger researchers come in and say,
so now come on,

579
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:43.930
you've been looking at these people for 30 years now.

580
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.060
Can you tell us anything about happiness?

581
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.690
Like have you noticed any difference between the ones that are happy and the

582
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:52.920
ones that aren't?
And he said,
yeah,
absolutely.
You know,

583
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.750
I know everything about these guys.
I know where they live,

584
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.320
I know how much they make.
I know if they're alcoholic,
if they're depressed,

585
00:38:59.321 --> 00:38:59.861
I know a,

586
00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:04.861
if their mother was nice to them when they were kids and the only thing that

587
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:07.120
matters is

588
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.763
<v 1>love.</v>

589
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.140
<v 3>And when he says love,
it's not just romantic or family ties,</v>

590
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:20.390
but it is the nature of relationships that we actually have in our lives.

591
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.820
Following tip.
Um,
[inaudible] three good things.

592
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.480
Count your blessings.

593
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:35.410
A blessing is something that you have the urge to say thank you for it.

594
00:39:38.601 --> 00:39:41.510
Usually it's called gratitude.
It usually starts with pleasure,

595
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:46.630
but pleasure is just fly out the door unless we stop just for a second and think

596
00:39:47.091 --> 00:39:51.170
to ourselves for that.
Thank you.
When we do that,

597
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.970
we can gain up to seven years of life expectancy.

598
00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.310
There was a physiological response to gratitude that will make us live longer

599
00:40:01.311 --> 00:40:05.990
and in better health.
The following tip,
exercise more.
I told you,

600
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.670
and I'm just talking about mood,
exercise,
I'm not talking about physical health,

601
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.020
just the brain health.

602
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:17.180
We were not designed to order Sushi and write escalators.

603
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.980
It was just not the plan.
So our bodies are completely underused.

604
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.050
We need to use the body in order to irrigate the brain.

605
00:40:25.051 --> 00:40:28.220
So it's three times 30 minutes of aerobic.

606
00:40:28.221 --> 00:40:31.370
Anything that you want to do when you live in Paris,
usually you walk around.

607
00:40:31.371 --> 00:40:35.180
So it's good.
You're,
you're,
you're,
you're there already.
Um,

608
00:40:35.181 --> 00:40:38.630
next before last,
when you talk about happiness,

609
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:43.460
giving is always superior to receiving,

610
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.690
which means that every time we do something for somebody else,

611
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:52.610
we get a little shower of dopamine up in the brain that makes us feel absolutely

612
00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:57.440
wonderful.
And then the last tip,
this one is physiological.

613
00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.620
Okay?
This one will work with anybody.
Whomever you are,

614
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.290
when you need to feel better,
right?
In a moment,
in an instant,

615
00:41:06.291 --> 00:41:07.340
there's only one thing to do,

616
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.653
<v 1>smile.</v>

617
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.280
<v 3>And when I say smile,
not smile,
you know,</v>

618
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.460
but when all the muscles in the face or engage,

619
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:21.150
it's impossible to experience dark thoughts.
Thank you.

620
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.140
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

621
00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.950
<v 4>Thank you very much.
That was a very,
very insightful,
very entertaining talk.</v>

622
00:41:40.951 --> 00:41:45.720
Thank you.
Um,
I know you've got a short window just for some Q and.
A.

623
00:41:45.721 --> 00:41:50.220
So can I open it up to,
uh,
to the audience?
Are there any,

624
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.580
any questions following this talk?
I have any questions for throws.

625
00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:01.490
<v 3>So questions can be your own stories.
You know,
when it comes to happiness,</v>

626
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:05.060
whatever positive psychology is just about observing regular people.

627
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.040
So why is it useful?

628
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:10.430
Because we're so busy with our lives that we only do the things we do them.

629
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:16.040
And sometimes just hearing how other people actually do things gives us more

630
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:19.310
ideas.
So you're,
you're,
um,

631
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.940
how can I say your experience has as much value as anything that I have said so

632
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:27.410
far.
What does this yellow box is a microphone.
Oh,
it's a microphone.

633
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.010
It can be through.
So there's a running there.
Oh,
it can be thrown.
Okay.

634
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.430
Hi.
I just have a question.

635
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.990
Don't you think that happiness is linked to expectations the last year?

636
00:42:37.991 --> 00:42:42.560
Expect and the more happy you are sometimes it's also fun to expect things that

637
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:46.470
actually happen.
You know,
there,
there's that too.
Um,

638
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.080
how can we put it this way?

639
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.070
Maybe expectations are um,

640
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:56.900
uh huh or hint can hinder happiness.
Yes,
there is a link,

641
00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:01.070
but it's also great to have expectations,

642
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.880
for example,
when people actually buy tickets to the lottery.

643
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:09.620
So the worst thing that can happen to you is when the lottery because then

644
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:10.940
you're in huge trouble.
Yeah.

645
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.880
Mentally it is a big challenge to actually win a lottery.

646
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:19.330
But buying the ticket is the instant of expectations.

647
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.900
And the reason so many people buy these tickets knowing that they will never win

648
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:24.734
anything.

649
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.860
It's just for the thrill of imagining what you would do if you actually did win

650
00:43:31.101 --> 00:43:31.934
all that money.

651
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.420
So anticipation rather than expectations is a great feeling.

652
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.940
And that's another tip I can give you is too,

653
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.840
but you know that already is to have things in your life that you actually

654
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:49.490
anticipate that are coming that are not there yet.
You know,

655
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:52.100
sometimes we say here in,
at least in France,
the,

656
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:54.770
the best part about love is walking up the stairs.
Right?

657
00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:56.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

658
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.050
<v 3>That's anticipation.</v>

659
00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.600
<v 4>We have another question.</v>

660
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.630
<v 3>So where does culture come in all this?
Uh,</v>

661
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.560
so culture is very present.
Uh,
but the brain structure remains the same.

662
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:14.890
I mean you are probably all very multicultured here and whoever hasn't been

663
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:20.470
raised in France and travels to the United States,
for example,

664
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:24.410
realizes it's a very different culture.
Because for example,

665
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:25.850
when it comes to happiness,

666
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:30.910
and I don't want to generalize because each individual is of course very unique,

667
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.570
but it's true that when you do get to Sunny California,

668
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.550
which has been my case many times,

669
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:41.060
people are by default positives about what can happen about a possibility.

670
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.030
Whereas when you come back to Paris,

671
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:49.950
by default we are against whatever is happening.
That's the basis.

672
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.660
Because if we are against,
then it's much a shaker.
You know,
it's,

673
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.430
it's [inaudible] that look cool.

674
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:03.060
It is because we believe that because we come from such an intellectual

675
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:04.320
background,
yes,

676
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.520
we believe that if we mark our opposition,

677
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.720
it shows that we have thought about it.
You know,
that we're smarter.

678
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:14.340
So culture is huge.

679
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:19.560
But inside the mechanisms are the same ones.
So we have access,

680
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:23.970
even us in Paris,
we do have access to happiness.
It's possible.

681
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:29.430
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Try.
Okay.

682
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.750
So yesterday was international day of girls.
Yes.

683
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.050
I would be very curious to know with kind of guilts you where,
what's,

684
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:41.220
what's your approach?
What is happiness?
Uh,
as a child?
Yes.
Okay.

685
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.770
Um,
even as a grown up,
I'm,

686
00:45:43.771 --> 00:45:47.010
I'm very worried pessimistic individual,

687
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:52.590
which is the reason that I found so much value in what I'm bringing you today.

688
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:57.240
I am not like that.
I mean,
yes.
Yeah.
I mean,
I am completely like that,

689
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.150
but it comes,
it comes from fear.

690
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.710
It comes from I'm just,
it comes.
Yeah.

691
00:46:04.711 --> 00:46:08.000
I guess fears was probably the,
the best.
Um,

692
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.150
the best word to qualify it because I am an anxious person.

693
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.450
I need to do things that make life easier for myself.

694
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:20.610
If that answers your question.
But I did have fun too,
you know?
But yes,

695
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.440
it does.
It does come from,
you know,

696
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.910
the thing about positive psychology and you know that you all know that when

697
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:31.710
life is all right,
we need none of this.
We need none of this information.

698
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:35.430
We just go on.
As you know,
as leading our lives.
That's what we do.

699
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.350
But when all of a sudden things get a little darker and things get a little more

700
00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:45.351
complicated than it's very useful to know that we have these resources.

701
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.540
I'll give you an example when it comes to gratitude,

702
00:46:48.541 --> 00:46:50.910
my favorite absolute topic is gratitude.

703
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:56.690
When the researchers decided to look at what the impact of gratitude can be,

704
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:58.440
one thing they did,

705
00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:03.470
they actually found out they decided to go and five years after nine 11 go meet

706
00:47:04.651 --> 00:47:07.260
with the families,
with the victim's families.

707
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.680
They wanted to understand what people had done in order to get back into life.

708
00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:16.620
How did they get back into life and they found different families.

709
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.830
Some were not back into life,
some were already back into life.

710
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:24.660
And one of the differences between the two is that the ones who were back in

711
00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:29.661
motion where people who before nine 11 in their life,

712
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.690
we're expressing gratitude and feeling gratitude.

713
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.560
So this is why when we talk about preventive psychology,

714
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.980
the more in our everyday okay lives we can practice to use gratitude for

715
00:47:45.701 --> 00:47:50.290
example,
and to feel grateful when the storm hits the fan,

716
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.510
we will have more training.

717
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.180
It will be easier for us to actually press on the button.

718
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.020
So this is what is so precious about all this information.
Once again,

719
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.350
it's just to train our brains.
Um,

720
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:07.410
the default mode of our brain is to first perceive negativity.

721
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.980
Whatever is wrong,
smells awful,
is scary,

722
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.620
has much more impact on us.

723
00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:18.820
Then what is nice and good because we consider it's regular.

724
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:23.590
It's a safety measure.
It's very useful for danger.
But however,

725
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.870
when for the day we really get in trouble,

726
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:30.190
it is definitely worth while things are okay to start training with all this

727
00:48:30.191 --> 00:48:34.420
little exercises and optimism is one that I really work on.

728
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:36.160
I work on it.
It's a,
it's really,

729
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:40.060
it's like a exercise that I do is like a physical exercise that I do on my brain

730
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:44.320
or else I just think everything that the world is over and every time one of my

731
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:48.310
kids had a fever,
I thought he was going to die.
So this is why,
you know,

732
00:48:48.311 --> 00:48:51.400
this is why we need to train.
We can,
we all know what our levels are.

733
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:52.960
We know what our buttons are,

734
00:48:52.961 --> 00:48:56.620
we know what our fears are and we can help those fears.
That's a good news.

735
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.720
Do you ever throw it?
Actually I will have people thrown it up.

736
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.830
Okay.
It's throwing it.
Yeah.
Um,

737
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:12.700
I like it very much.

738
00:49:12.701 --> 00:49:15.340
When you shared the story of your son coming to you saying he was going to

739
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:19.560
Australia and you gain of,
let's say you were not really supportive,
uh,

740
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.740
but what happens when you actually try to be supportive but just things that

741
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:26.740
someone has very bad idea.
How do you manage that?

742
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.220
You just say go to someone who is going to be supportive because you really,

743
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:34.060
truly,
sincerely thinks that it's not a good thing for them.
Um,

744
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.100
well of course.
Okay.
That's called a debate and you can,

745
00:49:38.101 --> 00:49:41.040
you can get into a conversation.
In that case it was a good idea.

746
00:49:41.041 --> 00:49:42.330
So I had nothing more to say.

747
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.890
But of course you debate your ideas necessarily and people do have terrible

748
00:49:46.891 --> 00:49:50.730
ideas and when you're a mother,
wait till you see what I did.
Your kids have,

749
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.380
they have terrible ideas.

750
00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.320
Um,
I just wanted to ask you a question.
So if,

751
00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:04.340
if you do some readings or if you go to such talks and you feel really inspired,

752
00:50:04.341 --> 00:50:07.820
but you have someone that you really love and you see that they're stuck and

753
00:50:07.821 --> 00:50:09.890
they're in an unhappy place,
um,

754
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:13.370
what can you do to help them without coaching them or sounding like you're

755
00:50:13.371 --> 00:50:16.340
giving them instructions?
I would be really interesting.

756
00:50:16.341 --> 00:50:21.280
That's a real life situation.
Um,
we cannot change other people.

757
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:26.200
That's the first thing we have to admit and um,
and,
and agreed to.

758
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:27.070
We cannot change other,

759
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.280
the only thing we can do is do what we believe in.

760
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:35.090
Because if you start coaching somebody,
they will maybe resistance.

761
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.740
The only thing you can do,
which you strongly believe in being a different way,

762
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:40.730
is to actually be that way.

763
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.840
And there's something that ends up being contagious or not.
You know,

764
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.140
not everybody will follow you,
but at least that's the only thing you can try.

765
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.950
But going to somebody saying no.
A lot of people come to my talks and say,
ah,

766
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.760
you know,

767
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.700
I have to tell my mother in law about you because she really needs your talk.

768
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.860
That type of thing doesn't really happen.

769
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:01.760
P the mother law will not make progress because she's not,

770
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.700
it's not her motivation.
We do care for others.

771
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.030
We would like them to be more positive.
Uh,
I know,
but you know,
we owe,

772
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:13.220
you also have to understand something is that p I have a not like that she

773
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:17.750
adores terrible news but adores to point that,
you know,
it's,

774
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:21.800
it's insane.
We have to respect that too.

775
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.570
Some people feed on atrocities,
you know,

776
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:30.590
and it actually does,
it gives more,
it gives more energy to their lives.

777
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.300
So I will never change her.

778
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:35.690
The only thing I can do if I'm around her is just be the way,
you know,

779
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:38.930
I think that a,
I want to be,
or that I think life can be,

780
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:44.090
and sometimes miracles happen,
people get better.
And then that's another thing.

781
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.160
Sometimes people need help.
It depends.
Uh,

782
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:51.230
sometimes people need psychological help and then we're not talking about

783
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.040
positive psychology.
But this is a mental health conference today.

784
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:57.200
And mental health is a whole different story.

785
00:51:57.201 --> 00:52:00.410
Sometimes we actually need help and we have to be able to get it.

786
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.970
Okay.
Thank you very much.

787
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:09.880
