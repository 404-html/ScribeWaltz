00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.740
Welcome.
Welcome,
welcome.
We're so excited to have you here at Google.

2
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:20.170
Thank you so much for taking time to come.
And this is Jessica,
well

3
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.630
two dope Queens,
so we're so happy to be here.
Thanks for having us.
Absolutely.

4
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.620
So just,
um,
for those of you who don't have as extensive of a background,

5
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:36.550
about two dope Queens,

6
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:41.020
two dope queens started as a comedy show between two best friends in Brooklyn,

7
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.380
hosted by these two wonderful ladies here to my left.
Um,

8
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.880
it launched and as a podcast in March,

9
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.530
2016 and it is produced by Wny c studios.
Um,
so,

10
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.140
uh,
but the,

11
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.140
the two dope Queens podcasts is appraised by the Guardian by the New York Times.

12
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.120
It was actually rated the best podcast of 2016.
So let's give it up.

13
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.053
<v 1>What</v>

14
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.590
they talked about it
in New York.

15
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.050
Yes,

16
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.220
<v 3>it is amazing.
Right?</v>

17
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.250
So he's going to let that soak in in Cimarron sparkle for a second.

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.350
So you have stays in three starting soon,
is that right?
Yes.
Three starts Tuesday,

19
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:26.590
April 4th.
And you're ready?
Yeah.
Ready to.
All right.

20
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.270
We have some pretty cool guests that are coming.

21
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:32.140
We've heard that we have Jon Hamm.
Gabrielle Union.

22
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.530
Gotcha.
I was going to be two dope queens and another queen.

23
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.823
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.150
<v 3>absolutely.
All right,
so let's get into some questions.
Cool.</v>

25
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.420
I tried to set up some hard hitting questions.
Let's not get too serious.
Okay.

26
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.730
Okay.
We're going to
go in really deep at first.

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.460
Great.
Whatever you want.
Right.

28
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.500
I want to talk to you guys about your show and the context of modern comedy and

29
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:04.920
intersectional feminism.
How do you feel your,
show us where it fits in?

30
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.010
It's that social commentary.
That's a great question.

31
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.550
It just seems like such a,
normally it's like not hard hitting.

32
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.980
To me it feels like just like a straight,
can you think about it all the time?

33
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.843
Yeah.

34
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.210
<v 4>I think,
you know,</v>

35
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:21.211
when we started the podcast we just recognize that the podcasting world was very

36
00:02:21.251 --> 00:02:24.680
height and um,

37
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.290
and everyone kind of sounds like I reclast which is great cause he has a

38
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:33.610
beautiful voice.
But you know,
I think it can make,

39
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.420
you know,

40
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.710
women or people of color or people from the Lgbtq plus community feel like,

41
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.110
well this isn't a space for us because the only things that are getting shine
or,

42
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.840
or breaking on mainstream wise are white people.

43
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.640
And so when we started show,
we just said that we wanted to do shows,

44
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.570
comedy shows,
especially in New York.
What's your also mostly white?
Uh,

45
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:58.120
so we just went to do shows with women,
people of Color,

46
00:02:58.121 --> 00:02:59.590
people in the queer community.
We're like,

47
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.280
there's so many brilliant people that aren't,
you know,

48
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.490
necessarily on like Netflix is radar,
like comedy central's radar yet,

49
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.730
but they're really talented and funny and they have stories to tell that are

50
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:14.590
just as valid and just as important as like the white dude stories,

51
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.230
you know what I mean?
And sometimes even like more important like,

52
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.160
<v 1>well,
and like,</v>

53
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.340
sorry [inaudible] you can't sing either.

54
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:33.730
Good luck with that,
but sorry.
I know it's too much.

55
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.250
[inaudible] it's like,

56
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.220
it cracks me up because it's so triggering for you.

57
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.710
[inaudible]

58
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.811
<v 4>and,
but anyway,</v>

59
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.630
the point is that we wanted to just kind of do something that was going to be

60
00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:54.590
representative of our conversations with the people that we hang out with and

61
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:59.060
like the conversation that you guys have at home or at work or at the gym.
So

62
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.633
<v 1>yeah.</v>

63
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.780
[inaudible] the city lifestyle sort of reference.

64
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.380
None of us [inaudible] sure.

65
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:23.170
You guys like talk to you guys like talk or he was just mortified.

66
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.380
<v 4>Karen counts payable wants to talk.</v>

67
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.070
<v 1>Yeah.
Well I know like</v>

68
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.910
<v 2>sang about we both,</v>

69
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:40.911
we're both members of Equinox Aka and so we're always joking about going to like

70
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:45.180
a class or something together and I'm always like,
I don't know,

71
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:48.920
I'm not really available just because the idea of like being super close here

72
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.010
and sweating,
I'm really scared.
I'm scared.
It's like vulnerable.

73
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.860
It's like the real me.
I might be ashy.
My Lips get dry.

74
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.790
Kalatu used to get my core strong.
It's fine.
Let's do it together.

75
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.240
Okay.
Okay.
I think I might.
Okay,
I'll see you upstairs like after

76
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.120
now that we've covered Lala land and how much we hated it,
it was fine.

77
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.870
To be honest.
I did it

78
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.800
team Pv here with the hated la La land.

79
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.190
So now that we've covered that,
making sure that the land escape

80
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.370
<v 3>wasn't super white and male.
Um,</v>

81
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.040
let's talk about the impact that you think this show has had.

82
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.090
What do you think the impact the show has had in 2016 and what would you like it

83
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:38.080
to be in the next year?
You know,
it's funny,
I,

84
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.100
I feel like the best part about,

85
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:46.030
for me at least with two dope queens is that now when we go out around Brooklyn,

86
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.810
there's always really cool women that come up and they're like,
oh dude,

87
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.990
I love your podcast.
And it feels like I'm hanging out with my friends.

88
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.220
And that to me is like really important.
And that's kind of why

89
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.450
<v 5>a part of the reason why we do the show is because we like each other and we</v>

90
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:07.220
think friendship is important and female friendship is like really at the core

91
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.810
of this podcast.
And I really,

92
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.670
I do think and hope that we encourage like female friendship in general.

93
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.150
And I also just feel like people are always tweeting at us trying to figure out

94
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.930
like who the comedian was that we had on our show and it will be like a lesbian

95
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.160
comedian or like an like anybody of the LGBT community and I feel like they're

96
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:33.050
also getting a platform.
So I think that's been such a huge part of everything.

97
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.370
<v 4>Um,</v>

98
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.370
and I also think like we reach people that we never expected would be into the

99
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:43.070
show.
Like Kevin Bacon was like,
I love it.

100
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.800
<v 1>They showed me,
he's like,</v>

101
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.240
I subscribe to it and I listened to it every week and I was like,

102
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.130
haven't you have so many things going on?

103
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.560
You know what I mean?
Is this was like crazy because again,
I love this show.

104
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.600
<v 4>Like my daughter like listens to it and it was just like,
that's really cool.</v>

105
00:06:57.601 --> 00:06:59.170
And like Bano send us flowers.

106
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.130
<v 1>I mean in 10 minutes,
I made 10 minutes and I'll bring it up,</v>

107
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.140
but she be [inaudible] we were looking at a u two fan in the car on the way

108
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:13.910
here.
Oh,
Youtube blog news.

109
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.940
But it's got like 94 followers and a lot of the photos were blurry out of focus

110
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:24.740
now formatted oddly working on it.

111
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.220
<v 4>Well my youtube news,
but it was like really cool because of Jasmine.</v>

112
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.880
I do like a lot of philanthropic stuff for Islam.
Two Dope Queens and uh,

113
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.270
and we did some for a poverty is sexist campaign and have bond would be like,

114
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:40.030
thank you for doing that.
It was really cool.
It was pretty good.
Yeah.

115
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:44.050
So I think the fact that we can highlight people and also people that were fans

116
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:49.051
of can be into our stuff on what we're doing feels kind of crazy because

117
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.700
sometimes I'm like,
I'm just talking about nonsense.

118
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.630
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
were just talking about things</v>

119
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.220
<v 5>we like and things that tickle us and make us laugh.
And I know for me,
my,</v>

120
00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:03.110
one of my favorite parts about the show is making you laugh and I feel like he's

121
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:04.800
told me you feel the same way too.

122
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.940
And so it's really exciting that people respond to that.
It's like,
oh cool,

123
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.930
we can do more of what's fun for us.
And people really like it.
That rules.

124
00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:14.240
That's the dream.
Yeah.
It was cool

125
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.130
<v 4>listening to hated it the other day.</v>

126
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.840
There was at least two to three seconds where the two of you are laughing and I

127
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:23.720
found myself laughing and it was just really interesting to be sitting in the

128
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.580
middle of Google and I'm just laughing really loud,

129
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.380
laughing with a group of girlfriends.
But that's good.
Yeah.
Disturbing.

130
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:33.170
Some of my coworkers who are here.
That's all right.

131
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.740
<v 1>Sorry.
Not really.
Okay.
So in that vein,
what do you think is cause</v>

132
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.460
<v 4>the most single bit of positive feedback you've received about the show?</v>

133
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.990
Um,
uh,
we don't get it.

134
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.570
No one ever remember.
They don't,
um,
I don't know.

135
00:08:54.571 --> 00:08:59.120
It's just like when it's just like a,
uh,
uh,
like when we did,
um,

136
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:05.590
sketch fest at Cobbs and this I guess was two years ago and his black woman came

137
00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:09.320
up to us and she was like starting to cry a little bit and I was like,
Whoa,

138
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:10.800
this is like Bieber level?
Yeah.

139
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.940
<v 2>[inaudible] and his name.</v>

140
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.193
Okay.

141
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.430
<v 4>Maybe not Justin Bieber,
maybe like the least famous Joan.
His brother.</v>

142
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.050
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

143
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.600
It was like comfortable with being Kelly.

144
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.940
<v 4>She likes just started to cry and she said,
you know,</v>

145
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.370
you guys like your podcast me so much to me.

146
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:41.850
Like these are conversations I have with my girlfriends and I just felt like I

147
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:45.900
wasn't represented in the media and the show is like a way for me to feel like

148
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:48.870
I'm looking at myself in the mirror.
So it was like,
that was pretty cool.

149
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.733
That's really cool.

150
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.650
<v 3>I remember like I don't,
we had Gabrielle Union on the show.</v>

151
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.900
She gave us really cool feedback.
And like she,

152
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.380
she's a fan of the show and she was saying how she loves listening to it because

153
00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:06.880
she feels like back in the day she couldn't get away with as a black actress

154
00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:09.580
saying the things that we are allowed to say.
And so it's really,

155
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.200
really cool that we are able to express ourselves freely.
And we were like,

156
00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:15.580
well thank you for what you did.

157
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.070
And so having like a legend say something like that to us.

158
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.810
I know we just died and then we like came back to life.

159
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.600
<v 2>No,
we definitely,
so now you're here.
Okay.
And so,
all right.</v>

160
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:29.900
So that's super positive.

161
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.710
<v 3>We can see how it impacts you.
I think that the energy you get,</v>

162
00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:35.080
you guys obviously give back to your show,
right?
Yeah.

163
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:40.290
But what do you think has been the most critical feedback that you've received

164
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.720
and how do you manage that?
That's funny.
You know,
I,

165
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.580
I stopped reading like any sort of reviews of us a long time ago,

166
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:55.360
like right after we started the show.
But one of them that I read was,
um,

167
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.400
then my laugh was annoying,
which is fine.

168
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.130
<v 2>All cause it's like there's nothing I can do.
Um,
but also that it,
they're like,</v>

169
00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:05.140
it's not for me.
Like I don't like the front,

170
00:11:05.141 --> 00:11:07.960
like the inside friendship stuff and it's like,

171
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.970
oh well that's like,
that's crazy.

172
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.040
Literally one of the most successful shows of all time.

173
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:20.190
It's called [inaudible] small talk with strangers.

174
00:11:21.851 --> 00:11:26.800
Just call it [inaudible] long have you hated things that are good.

175
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.430
It's like we're not for you.
Yeah.

176
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.630
The up and decided they hated friendships that,
you know what I mean?

177
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.800
That's just stupid.

178
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.110
<v 4>I used to be on top of the,
um,</v>

179
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.040
as we have a fan page on another website,
and I want to say it here,

180
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.490
<v 2>cause I don't know if you guys are beefing or not.
Just kidding.
It's Facebook.</v>

181
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.000
So is that of me?
So it's

182
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.350
<v 4>okay.
Okay,
cool.
Uh,</v>

183
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.080
and so I used to check the messages and there was this one guy,

184
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.390
it's always like a dude,
of course,
some freaking Tom or town.
Yeah.

185
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.390
And he didn't like how much we said the word like,

186
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.610
and so he was telling us that we should work on it.
And I,
you know,

187
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:19.480
I'm thinking literally,
this is just how everyone talks.
Everyone says,

188
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:22.300
like Barack Obama says like,
you know what I mean?

189
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.830
Justin Trudeau says like,
I've heard it,
you know,

190
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.720
like that's just a filler word,
get over it.
And it just,

191
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:33.010
stuff like that where men,

192
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:36.880
what I'm trying and tell us how we should speak differently,

193
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.700
that would be more pleasing to them.
And it's just there

194
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.200
<v 1>before you finish.
It isn't for you.
And it's all</v>

195
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.380
<v 4>trains people to think that the way that women naturally speak is somehow</v>

196
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:52.850
incorrect in the way that men speak is somehow the ideal and what people strive

197
00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:55.770
for.
And I'm just,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah,

198
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.890
just speak how you want to speak.

199
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.980
And so that was kind of really irritating.

200
00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:05.930
And then I think sometimes people will say,
you know,
you and Jace,

201
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.063
Jace,

202
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.680
<v 1>can we call you [inaudible] to say race?</v>

203
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.110
And then I say,
[inaudible],

204
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.850
<v 5>you're one of my best friends and you just call me j.
So remember that forever.</v>

205
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.560
<v 4>This word to say that Jess and I talked too much about race and it was just kind</v>

206
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.960
of like one we don't and also these are arcs

207
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:41.250
<v 1>not too much because we don't talk about race in a real way in the first place,</v>

208
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.930
which is why you know,
we have the present,
we have,
you know,
sorry,

209
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.910
let that simmer,
which is why we have the president we have,
but I think

210
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.230
<v 4>talking about,
you know,
racist cab drivers are bad customer service.</v>

211
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.050
These are all things that people of color go through in the country.

212
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.690
These are all things that every day we face these micro aggressions at your pace

213
00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:06.660
stomach.
Like

214
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.650
<v 5>oftentimes you,
I know for us,
we grew up in the suburbs.</v>

215
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:15.700
It's like you're around white people who oftentimes don't understand what

216
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:18.190
microaggressions are and you have to hold your tongue.

217
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:22.960
It's like you have to really keep a compose and then when you find somebody who

218
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.400
is a person of color or a member of the Lgbtq community who understands that

219
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.080
it's the best connection.
It's like the most life affirming thing ever.
It's like,

220
00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:35.140
um,
you know when women get catcalled at all,

221
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.870
like most of the time that's a very personal experience that you,

222
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.210
you just log and then you go about your day.

223
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:42.190
But if you explain that to another woman,

224
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.850
it feels so good and it feels really life affirming.

225
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:47.830
And that to me also,

226
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:52.160
this is a show about like friendships with people of color and that's how we
talk

227
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.890
<v 3>to each other.
So it really is,</v>

228
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.910
that means that you don't have enough friends that are minorities.

229
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.940
I think if you feel like we talk about race too much because every day we are

230
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.600
reminded of our race and we are constantly confronted with that in our day to

231
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:08.960
day.

232
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.960
And I just feel like it's the most natural thing to talk about things that make

233
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:19.151
you laugh or sad or angry or happy with like how you look and how your race and

234
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:22.940
I think Phoebe,
you,
you alluded to it,
but I just want to make sure that,
um,

235
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.710
that we talk about it a little bit more.

236
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.000
You did have an episode where you guys talked about an experience in a cab where

237
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:30.050
the racist cab driver,

238
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:35.360
and in terms of the validation of not just talking as friends,

239
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:39.950
but it's also really valuable that you talked about your thought process as you

240
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:42.680
went through that experience,
like was that racist?

241
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:47.660
Was that not racist and do I react now?
Do I not react now?
Do I allow,

242
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:51.770
you know,
my partner who's a white male to react,
you know,
how do I process this,

243
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.210
this feeling?
Do you find that a lot of your viewers respond to that as well?

244
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:57.590
Not just how you react together,

245
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:02.591
but sort of the verbal storytelling that goes with how you experience racism as

246
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:06.020
black women?
Yeah.

247
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.970
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,
I think when,</v>

248
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.550
I think we both have racist cab drivers in the same way.

249
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.610
<v 3>Yeah.
Sinked up like it was our period.</v>

250
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

251
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.880
<v 4>So it was just very funny how we both were like,
hey,
so this happened.
She's like,</v>

252
00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:29.350
well,
this happened to me.
I,
those are conversations that happen all the time,

253
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.213
every day.

254
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.520
And I think part of it is that people think that racism happens one time to you,

255
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.950
one time in your life and that's it.
And it's like,
no,

256
00:16:38.951 --> 00:16:42.310
it happens every week or every month,
every year.

257
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.080
And so I think when we both have these different experiences at like how justice

258
00:16:47.081 --> 00:16:52.081
cab driver only stopped once he saw her boyfriend or how the guy said the n word

259
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:55.480
because he was like,
well my daughter is half black so I can say it.

260
00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.480
And it was just these weird,
weird,

261
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.840
weird kind of like be pro supposed to live in a post racial society but things

262
00:17:01.841 --> 00:17:03.390
like this are still happening.
Yeah.

263
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.150
So I think it just kind of made the black,

264
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.030
the black woman hopefully who listened to the episode be like,
yeah,

265
00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:15.031
how my own really shitty cab experience and I maybe I didn't tell anybody and

266
00:17:15.311 --> 00:17:17.410
like the fact that we said something,
maybe they were like,

267
00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:20.500
well next time I am going to say something and I'm going to let people know that

268
00:17:20.501 --> 00:17:22.810
this is terrible.
Like when I was in that situation,

269
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.400
I didn't say anything to the guy because I was like,
this is weird.
This is crazy.

270
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.360
He knows where I live.
Like I don't want to anger any song,

271
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.240
anyone who's driving me.
But you know,
it is no situations where you got to,

272
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.170
you hopefully learned that you can stand up for yourself more.

273
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.510
<v 3>Right?
Yeah.
And that's,</v>

274
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.860
I think the show has given me a lot of things.

275
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:48.240
But one of the things that it's given me strength to sort of speak up a lot,

276
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.250
I feel there's this idea

277
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.510
<v 5>of the black woman as angry or confrontational,</v>

278
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:59.511
but oftentimes I find that I shrink into myself and I get really quiet when

279
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:05.580
something is like if there's a microaggression or if there is something racist

280
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:06.414
that's happened.

281
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:11.540
But I feel like the more that I do our show and the more that we get feedback

282
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:14.630
from other black one because really we're just two black women in a,

283
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.530
in a world full of black women,
you know?
Um,
I'm like,
oh,

284
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:24.180
I should speak up more.
It kind of gives me the courage to speak out.

285
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:24.980
I think,

286
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.870
<v 3>right.
And you did it so differently,
right?</v>

287
00:18:26.871 --> 00:18:31.280
Like so in that episode you at one point when you got into the cab and he had

288
00:18:31.281 --> 00:18:32.130
hailed the cab,
you said

289
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.650
<v 2>[inaudible] it's my white boyfriend.</v>

290
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.850
Yeah.
And then you responded

291
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.020
and said,
hi,
I'm black.

292
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.720
Great subject line really gets people high alert.
Oh Shit.

293
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.670
[inaudible] I got a refund.
And they're like,

294
00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:03.310
we're going to reprimand this guy.
And I was like,
great.
Awesome.
Yeah.

295
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.940
<v 3>So,
um,
thank you for that.
Thank you for going down that talk.</v>

296
00:19:07.941 --> 00:19:10.450
So that was definitely for me.
That was one of my favorite episodes.

297
00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:14.500
If you haven't seen it,
you need to go start listening to the entire podcast,

298
00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:17.650
but start with that one.
Um,
yeah,
it was awesome.
Um,

299
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.880
what advice would you give other black women but just intersection of women?

300
00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:24.610
Because I think we've talked a lot about intersectionality and about allyship,

301
00:19:24.611 --> 00:19:29.200
but trying to get into this industry,
trying to start a podcast,

302
00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:30.820
trying to really make their voices known.

303
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.600
<v 5>Um,
do you want to go first?
Yeah.
Well,
uh,
first of all,</v>

304
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:40.500
please start a podcast because the amount of feedback that we've gotten from

305
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:42.810
Trudeau Queens is great,
but you know,

306
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.590
there are so many black female voices that need to be heard.

307
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.510
And I think the response that we've gotten is just evidence that like,
oh,

308
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:56.460
there needs to be more black female stories out there.
Um,
but also,

309
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.150
um,
if you're doing it with another person,

310
00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:04.620
find someone that like excites you and that you can geek out with and that you

311
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:08.910
enjoy.
And also if you're doing it with another person,

312
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:13.710
realize that it's kind of a marriage and it's a relationship and it's a team and

313
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:18.711
you have to sort of figure out how to work together and do a give and take and

314
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.640
communicate and figure that out.
Um,

315
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.680
and also be the most yourself that you possibly can is the biggest one because

316
00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:32.871
it's super valuable and it keeps it from being just another like podcast about

317
00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:36.270
white dudes white knit up.
Um,

318
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.300
just be yourself because that is the most interesting,
fascinating thing.

319
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:46.290
And if you're speaking from a point of truth,
then it will resonate with people.

320
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.550
Really.
It's like impossible

321
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.120
<v 3>for it to not resonate that that would be my advice once you're like,
yeah.</v>

322
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:52.881
<v 4>Um,</v>

323
00:20:52.881 --> 00:20:57.680
I think just if you think you have a story to tell this worth hearing,

324
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.870
you're probably right.
So you should just go for it.

325
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.380
And it doesn't matter if there's not an example,

326
00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.140
they're a blueprint for you to follow.

327
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.140
You can be the first one and you can kind of figure things out yourself and what

328
00:21:09.141 --> 00:21:12.380
works and what doesn't.
So it's like don't be afraid to take a leap.

329
00:21:12.381 --> 00:21:15.830
And like Wyc is like getting really more involved with other things.

330
00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:19.790
And so we're both wearing pins for their latest podcast is coming out called

331
00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:24.791
Nancy on April 9th and it's an Lgbtq plus podcast to be a lot like storytelling

332
00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:28.070
and also like investigative stuff.
And they just decided,
hey,

333
00:21:28.071 --> 00:21:32.300
we want our voices out there and these are stories that should be told.

334
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.430
And now it's a podcast,
a WYC.

335
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:39.670
So I think if he just really believes in your idea a thousand percent and maybe

336
00:21:40.941 --> 00:21:44.000
you can't start a Wyc,
maybe have to start in your,

337
00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.700
your apartment and do a podcast.
I did that.

338
00:21:46.701 --> 00:21:51.200
I was doing a podcast in my apartment in Brooklyn and it's Shitty one bedroom

339
00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:52.940
apartment and

340
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.090
<v 1>there she saw it,
allegedly did a podcast.
I have to set it up.</v>

341
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.560
I accidentally deleted it.

342
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:04.040
[inaudible] that would never happen.

343
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.730
Maybe get a producer because I did not know how to work soundcloud properly.
It,

344
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.420
it was three hours of my time and I'll never get back.

345
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.440
[inaudible] and spades sat at her kitchen table.

346
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.650
<v 4>It's Google told us</v>

347
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:26.250
<v 1>I ain't [inaudible] but yeah,</v>

348
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.900
<v 4>to start out wherever you can and hone your voice and hone your vision because</v>

349
00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:35.080
the thing that's gonna set you apart the most,
like you think it's,
Oh,

350
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:36.100
I have to sound like this,

351
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.820
I have to do what's already been done at going to set you apart the most is if

352
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:44.350
you stay true to your voice.
Because ultimately people want that new thing.

353
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.410
And a lot of times people are scared to take the risk.
On a new thing,

354
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:51.010
but if you could just establish your own stuff in your own following and just

355
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.980
believing your own vision and be a business person about it.

356
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:55.870
That's the other thing is not just creativity.

357
00:22:55.871 --> 00:22:59.710
You have to be a business person about whatever endeavor you go into,

358
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.560
you're going to be fine and it's not going to happen overnight.

359
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.530
<v 3>It's going to take awhile.
But you know,
keep the faith,</v>

360
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.850
be yourself.
Yeah,
because he afraid to start.
Yeah.
Be All the way,
all the way,

361
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:12.590
all the way yourself.

362
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:17.590
You don't try to moderate or change your voice and it's the hardest thing to do.

363
00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:20.400
I think it's like life's journey Hashtag self help.

364
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:26.190
It's a marriage helpers like,
yeah.
So you two are best friends in real life.

365
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.580
Really,
really best friends.
What's it like?
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

366
00:23:29.581 --> 00:23:33.120
Hey,
we talked a lot about what are the sort of feelings,

367
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.400
motivations that you have to have really being true to yourself.

368
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.780
How did you guys get started?

369
00:23:36.781 --> 00:23:40.230
Like how did you decide you were hanging out having pizza?
Like,

370
00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:44.490
how did you look over to your girl and say,
we should start a comedy show?

371
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.040
Well,
we met,

372
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.120
<v 4>um,
when I did background and daily show a piece you did about black hair in the</v>

373
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:51.370
military and I had already,

374
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.181
<v 5>no,
no,
she was,</v>

375
00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:56.680
because she was in upright citizens brigade as was I.

376
00:23:56.681 --> 00:23:58.520
And she like had a white bay.
She was like really

377
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.780
<v 4>funny.
And so we met,
uh,</v>

378
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:06.650
that was July,
2014 and uh,

379
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:10.060
I was just like,
Hey,
do you want to come and do my podcasts?
Um,
and I was like,

380
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.980
<v 1>not Jane.
Like I interviewed,
it was like,</v>

381
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:17.981
it's super [inaudible] interview.

382
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.350
Why it's an act like this is like legit.

383
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.763
That was like,

384
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.540
<v 4>we do a new,
like different recording process,</v>

385
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.690
<v 1>dial up on me that's like black on black crime,</v>

386
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.940
<v 4>but you have to learn I'm experiment or I'm like Benjamin frame.</v>

387
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.430
<v 1>You're literally not like
that is so do some stuff</v>

388
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.730
you like to in a podcast.
Benjamin Franklin.
Yes.

389
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.230
You know,
and training anyways.

390
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.940
<v 4>And so we just kinda hit it off and when we're taking the podcast and she said</v>

391
00:25:02.941 --> 00:25:06.320
her birthday was coming up and asked her what she wanted to do,
she said,
well,

392
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.150
I always wanted to do stand up.
And I said,
well,

393
00:25:09.151 --> 00:25:13.980
I do a monthly standup show at UCB.
Do you want to cohosted with me as a goof?

394
00:25:13.981 --> 00:25:16.230
It'll be fun.
We'll just like hang out.
And then like,

395
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.690
there'll be like a nice treat for the audience.

396
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.620
And then we ended up having so much fun doing it.
They were like,
all right,

397
00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:26.760
let's do another show together.
And they were like,
let's just keep doing this.

398
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.470
And then we moved to union hall because we were like,

399
00:25:31.471 --> 00:25:35.960
we want to get paid.
ECB doesn't pay,
which is fine.
I mean,
that's like this.

400
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.330
Do you write whatever you wanted?
We need a sidebar.
I'm a business

401
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.880
<v 1>person.
Must Jaycee thing about,
um,</v>

402
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.260
I reaching real high with these legends.

403
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.750
[inaudible]

404
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.430
ruining his life.

405
00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.860
<v 4>And we were both,
we had a really amazing show,
a union hall.
We were both like,</v>

406
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:05.670
this could be a podcast.
Yeah.
And I was like,
well,

407
00:26:05.671 --> 00:26:08.760
what if we just record ourselves?
And she was like,
we should make it perfect.

408
00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.600
<v 1>You delete it on the track record is you have to read it.</v>

409
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.640
<v 4>I noticed that people at a Wyc LED's,
you know,</v>

410
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.680
figure out like a game plan,

411
00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:23.860
like pitch in and everything and the rest is just history.

412
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.600
<v 5>That's great.
So,
okay,
what is,</v>

413
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.090
what has been your favorite episode and your favorite guests and what,

414
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:40.690
um,
are you going to say,
are you going to sing Johnny?

415
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.090
<v 1>I'm trying to think.</v>

416
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.040
<v 3>Carrie Brownstein on and I was cool and obsessed with her and so that was kind</v>

417
00:26:53.171 --> 00:26:57.130
of a dream come true.
I had seen her in high school a couple times,

418
00:26:57.131 --> 00:27:00.960
like doing shows and stuff and I look,
we're such fans of Portlandia and um,

419
00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.990
she was amazing and Super Fun and I think we crowd surfed with her too.

420
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.320
<v 1>Oh,</v>

421
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.320

<v 3>yeah,

crowd surf with John,</v>

425
00:27:24.051 --> 00:27:28.940
him and I got video of that and that was really fun because

426
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.430
<v 1>yeah,</v>

427
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.030
<v 4>literally after our wedding we just crowd served out.</v>

428
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.573
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.380
[inaudible] that was our Jewish,
but thank you.

430
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:42.010
Yeah,
that was amazing.

431
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.760
<v 3>No,
and then I realized too,
that episode was very overwhelming because,</v>

432
00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.950
or I haven't been single for a while,

433
00:27:48.951 --> 00:27:53.951
but I realized when we were doing the Jon Hamm episode that I was like very

434
00:27:55.341 --> 00:28:00.341
overwhelmed and so I couldn't say things that were real or I couldn't say words.

435
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.730
I couldn't put things together coherently.
And uh,

436
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.200
I realized that about myself as like reverting back into the third grade.
Me.

437
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:14.570
Um,
yeah,
those are very,
I think it was great.
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.

438
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.200
Cause I really like feel like I spent a lot during that time

439
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.260
<v 1>fixing everywhere.</v>

440
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.740
<v 4>Part of it is because he is hands down the most attractive person we ever had on</v>

441
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:26.340
the show.

442
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.860
<v 1>Right.
No tea,
no shade.
It,</v>

443
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.620
everybody who's done the show know what y'all know what happened.
Um,

444
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:38.210
just the Hamercaz [inaudible] that's insane.

445
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.410
That up later

446
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.940
<v 4>we,
we were trying,
before we did the La show,
we told Shannon,
um,
was,</v>

447
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:04.980
uh,
one of our producers,

448
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.270
our podcasts are like our dream guests or ru Paul and John Hamm and we're still

449
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:10.650
holding out for rude,
so rude.

450
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.830
<v 1>Please,
please my ways.</v>

451
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.150
<v 4>And so,
um,</v>

452
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.410
John Social Nola reached out to John because he was supposed to do something

453
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:26.790
else and then he couldn't and he told Shinoa but I really want to do two dope

454
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:29.400
queens.
And we were both like,
wait,
he listens to two dope queens.

455
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.540
<v 1>It was crazy.
It was like,
this is madmen.
Um,</v>

456
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:37.570
but like [inaudible] jobs,

457
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:48.000
<v 4>um,
and yeah,</v>

458
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.080
we voted,
voted,
voted.
Yeah,
let's not cause it's that now I'm getting,

459
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.453
yeah,
okay,

460
00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.280
<v 1>we're going to be a [inaudible].</v>

461
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.800
<v 4>Well he just showed up and he was so nice.
He was like,
I love the show.</v>

462
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:12.790
And he went on,
we were like,

463
00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:18.340
<v 1>[inaudible] we didn't do any of that.</v>

464
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.830
<v 4>We're like,
what do you want to do?
And he's like,
I'll follow your lead.</v>

465
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:30.664
It's totally fine.

466
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.280
<v 1>I was like,
this is like really sexual all time.</v>

467
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:39.310
Just explain the

468
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.110
<v 4>to me.
Right.
And so basically we were just like,</v>

469
00:30:42.111 --> 00:30:45.290
we're just going to hit on you for 20 minutes.
And he was like,
cool.

470
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.640
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

471
00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:51.020
<v 4>being a good sport.
But he was like,
whoa.
He says,</v>

472
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.400
I agree Dan a little,
a little bit.

473
00:30:55.401 --> 00:30:58.310
We do sometimes if we have like a celebrity guest that nobody knows is coming

474
00:30:58.311 --> 00:31:01.620
out will be like,
can we get some water?
We're thirsty.
It'll just be awesome.

475
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.350
Thirsty.
Can we get some water?

476
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.930
<v 1>Then I do.</v>

477
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.920
The celebrity comes out

478
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.230
<v 4>just water.
But it was crazy because with him,</v>

479
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.070
he's such an amazing actor that he liked,

480
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:19.430
took an extra second and we genuinely didn't know it was coming out or not only

481
00:31:19.431 --> 00:31:21.270
like literally acted with Johnny.

482
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.580
<v 1>I do like a stage [inaudible] we've covered all the academy award.</v>

483
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.133
Okay.

484
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.520
<v 4>So he like came out.
It was amazing.
We like acted with him.
Yeah,
it was cool</v>

485
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:53.400
gas holding out for Rupaul.
Look in the camera.
It RuPaul,

486
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.550
Rupaul Charles

487
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:02.060
this Friday.
Please just do or she wants to be.
We will love you.

488
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.360
Come.
Okay,
so last question and we're going to try it.

489
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.770
We're going to try to be serious,
but I know that we can.
Um,
okay,
so

490
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.920
<v 3>how do you balance your need to bring joy,
levity?
It's bring your voice,</v>

491
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.120
highlight the voices of the other great comedians and other great actors with

492
00:32:20.121 --> 00:32:23.720
some of the very real traumatizing,

493
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.340
I can't even find another word for it.

494
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:30.190
Political Change and environment that we find ourselves in.
Um,

495
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.280
I was literally studying your post election episode,
uh,

496
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.790
trying to get through the fields,
trying to work through the field.
Yeah.

497
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.370
How did you plan that show?

498
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.930
<v 4>How do you process this now?</v>

499
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:46.250
How do you sort of bifurcate what's happening with the social political

500
00:32:46.251 --> 00:32:49.130
landscape and the goals of two dope queens?
Well,

501
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:53.270
I think that episode was Joanna.
I think that was your idea,
right?

502
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.320
To do like,
yeah,
it was the post election,
Huh?
Yeah.

503
00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.030
Were you not paying any attention?
Cool.

504
00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:05.450
<v 1>[inaudible] our Google Talk Rachel.</v>

505
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.980
But yeah,
we dragged you don't deserve,

506
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.530
but like pay attention to Google,
but also she like does she like,

507
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.170
and it's every one of us.
He loved me,
Joanna,
like,

508
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.350
um,
so yeah,

509
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.250
<v 4>who are all just feeling like a little,</v>

510
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.180
cause I think we all kind of assumed that like a mirror.
It could be like,
okay,

511
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:36.920
the joke is over.
We're going to like not elect Donald Trump.
Yes.

512
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.690
<v 5>Even when we had to record that,</v>

513
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:42.350
we had to record two versions of that episode and the first one was if Hillary

514
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.140
won and then we were like,
great.
And then like,

515
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:48.110
well why don't we just just in case do the other one where she didn't when we

516
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:49.750
were like,
what the fuck you talking [inaudible]

517
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.460
<v 1>and then yeah,
it happened.
And uh,</v>

518
00:33:55.870 --> 00:34:00.040
I don't even want to say Voldemort if you read a Harry Potter Book

519
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:07.140
<v 4>Bend.
And we were just kind of feeling like,
I think everyone was,</v>

520
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.790
a lot of people were in a state of shock.

521
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.380
And so I think we all just agree with Rachel that it would be good to have an

522
00:34:13.381 --> 00:34:17.910
episode where we just addressed it openly and honestly and be like,
Hey,

523
00:34:17.911 --> 00:34:19.980
let's just talk through what we're feeling right now.

524
00:34:19.981 --> 00:34:23.030
Just get these emotions out.
Because I know like I was crying.

525
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.610
<v 1>Yeah.
Day One was</v>

526
00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:31.140
<v 5>just the idea that somebody who is supposed to represent you completely doesn't</v>

527
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:33.760
have your interests at heart is no.
Has Your,

528
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:37.810
has your really your destruction really.
And it's really,

529
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.930
really deeply upsetting.
Yeah.
Like honestly,

530
00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:44.560
like I go to therapy every week and my therapist has been like,
yeah,

531
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.760
all everybody wants to talk about is the fact that we have this president.

532
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.650
How it bothers them.
Just yes,
but continue.

533
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.760
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
that was good.
And so I think when we just sat down,</v>

534
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.620
it wasn't like Jess and I had anything prepare.

535
00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:01.880
We really just spoke from the heart of how we felt.
We said some ignorant things.

536
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:03.320
I think they cut out of

537
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.350
<v 1>fuck,
I want to hear the [inaudible],</v>

538
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.280
you know,
like we can like just go off and this is less light can really pop off.

539
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.610
Yeah.
So is this,
where are these are for our techs,
right.

540
00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.050
No,

541
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:23.310
<v 4>I felt really kind of,
um,
know.
I think it felt like Cathartic for us.</v>

542
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.000
And I think for a lot of listeners we kind of stay a lot of things.

543
00:35:27.001 --> 00:35:29.640
They were thinking.
So it just felt really good.

544
00:35:29.641 --> 00:35:31.650
And I think going forward with the show,

545
00:35:31.651 --> 00:35:33.930
we just want to keep doing the same thing with our show,

546
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.730
which is just like highlight different voices.
Um,
promote comedy.

547
00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:43.530
That's about punching up,
not punching down and you know,

548
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:45.750
just keep telling our stories.

549
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.860
And I think if everyone just keeps like putting their stories out there and

550
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:52.890
putting their lives out there and say,
we're going to drown out the nonsense,

551
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:55.050
we're going to jot out the haters are going to drown out the ugliness.

552
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.110
<v 5>Yeah.
So it's nice too,</v>

553
00:35:57.111 --> 00:36:02.111
because I feel like one of the reasons comedy is great because it sort of

554
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.670
transcends differences in a way.

555
00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.690
And I feel like if people can listen to our podcast and feel a little bit of

556
00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:13.070
comfort for 45 minutes to an hour,
then we've done our job.
You know,

557
00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:17.600
just taking a second and just really being like,
oh,
it's going to be okay.
Oh,

558
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.910
there's still great comedy out there.
Oh,
okay.

559
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.800
This is like a transgender person doing standup.
Oh cool.
You know,
it's,
if,

560
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:29.230
if we can continue to up with those voices then we're going to be okay the next

561
00:36:30.561 --> 00:36:33.170
four years.
Yeah.
Well on that.

562
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.840
<v 4>No thank you for the encouragement because I think we all need it.</v>

563
00:36:35.841 --> 00:36:40.310
I think everyone watching needs it.
I know that can feel the energy in the room.

564
00:36:40.311 --> 00:36:42.290
For those of you watching the energy in the room is amazing.

565
00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.790
I just want to make sure that we actually open up the floor to the room.
Yeah.

566
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.470
I want to thank you ladies for coming.

567
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:54.290
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

568
00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.430
<v 4>and are you ready for round fire questions</v>

569
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:04.623
right?

570
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.940
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

571
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.210
<v 3>and make sure that you balance load the mikes guys.
So don't cry one.
Anyway,</v>

572
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:19.040
go ahead.
Hello.
What's your name?
[inaudible]

573
00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.420
they came out less to him than I wanted it to,

574
00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.000
I believe.
Anyway,

575
00:37:35.001 --> 00:37:39.490
my question is,
uh,
whenever I've listened to your podcast,
like my favorite parts.

576
00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:43.280
So like actually my favorite part is before the show actually starts and you're

577
00:37:43.281 --> 00:37:45.350
talking to you like the sound guy.
I thought I like,

578
00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.240
I start crying during that part cause it's so hilarious and I am a questions

579
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:50.083
actually.

580
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:54.350
Have you thought of like making episodes of just the banter and just the

581
00:37:54.351 --> 00:37:57.350
friendship,
like,
like a few episodes without guests?

582
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.660
<v 5>No,
actually that feedback.
Um,
and we just,</v>

583
00:38:01.661 --> 00:38:06.661
we really want to make sure that we are giving platforms to people that

584
00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:10.120
otherwise wouldn't have it.
So I think we want to use it for that.

585
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.930
<v 4>Yeah.
And we do like the bonus shows like we did the advice episode,</v>

586
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.700
which is really fun and my brother like wants to do an advice episode.

587
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

588
00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:26.100
<v 4>Yeah.
So I think stuff like that,
those episodes,
yeah.
Get like a lot of us.</v>

589
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:29.820
But like she said like we really want to showcase people and I think that's the

590
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:32.460
heart of the show showcasing.
Well No,
we're the heart of the show.

591
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:35.563
<v 1>Right.</v>

592
00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.170
<v 2>But they're like,
they're the,</v>

593
00:38:39.171 --> 00:38:42.130
the guests are like the risks of this show.
I don't know

594
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.080
that they have risks.
Okay.
Yeah.

595
00:38:48.081 --> 00:38:49.460
The forearm of the show.

596
00:38:49.461 --> 00:38:54.230
Whenever there is the other body parts that aren't the heart and we just want to

597
00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:55.250
make sure those beers.

598
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.920
Hi.
Thank you for coming to talk to us and thank you for your work.
Thanks.

599
00:39:03.921 --> 00:39:05.670
What's your name?
Can everyone just say their name?

600
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.240
I'm so many questions and I love so many white guys,

601
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.150
but I'll keep it to one cause you've touched about this a little bit,

602
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.320
how much you leverage your network for your guests cause your guests are
awesome.

603
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.950
And then how much do you put your wishlist together?

604
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.940
So like as professionals and for all being business people about what we do,

605
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.120
how much would you recommend that we leverage what we have or like go out and

606
00:39:34.701 --> 00:39:36.770
kind of just put it in the universe for your dream?

607
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.110
<v 4>Um,</v>

608
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:43.090
I mean I'm all about putting these in universe and talking about things all the

609
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:47.260
time.
It does manifest it.
Um,
but you work at Google.

610
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:50.710
Like I would literally just be like,
I,
hi,
I work at Google.

611
00:39:50.711 --> 00:39:52.210
Can I get this for free?

612
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:57.350
<v 1>[inaudible] would be like,
sure.</v>

613
00:39:57.351 --> 00:40:00.350
[inaudible] so you have

614
00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.470
<v 4>such a great,
and they're like,
you know,
I think with our show,</v>

615
00:40:03.471 --> 00:40:06.790
because we found out like,
you know,
Carrie Brown,

616
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.320
like all these swells were like listening to the show.
We were like,
oh,

617
00:40:09.321 --> 00:40:11.960
we should just ask them to do it.
They won't say no,

618
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.850
and so I think once we kind of know that it's on someone's radar,
then go for it.

619
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.770
Then we asked them like on a first date.
Um,
but yeah,
you work at Google,

620
00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:24.560
like lead with that and be like,
who'd done this?
This,
this.

621
00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.370
<v 2>Yeah.
There's a whole floor of our office that's just dedicated to seasons.</v>

622
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:33.850
<v 1>Yeah.
He's in season.</v>

623
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.240
Like we have snacks.

624
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.060
<v 2>Walls of Moss.</v>

625
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.810
<v 2>And like a massage chair and five restaurants on the one floor.</v>

627
00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.900
It's like Oprah design this place and then left.

628
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.220
<v 1>Yeah.
My work is done.
She likes</v>

629
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.320
<v 2>gold.
Her fairy dust.
They've seen one floor.</v>

630
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.100
<v 2>Can you kind of drag you guys because that is fucking amazing.</v>

632
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:08.080
I work out of my,
like off of a couch in my apartment.

633
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.513
Yeah.
So just

634
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.820

635
00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:16.423
<v 1>Hey,</v>

636
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:22.200
<v 4>you're no word.
You use that power because a lot of times people will be like,

637
00:41:22.201 --> 00:41:24.840
Google,
okay.
All like listen to this.

So yeah,

640

641
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:42.560
Thank you so much for being here,
Mike.

642
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.690
six feet tall.

I'm like,
oh.

645
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.330
what do you do at Google?

646
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.160
<v 6>MERCI programs.
So on the recruitment side of things,</v>

647
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.110
<v 1>that's how are you like leg?
Are you single?
Like what's up?</v>

648
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.840
He seems
to

649
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.850
have a
headboard.
Yeah.

650
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.460
Yeah.
It's like a sign that you're like,
oh man,

651
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:33.010
that's cool.
Yeah.
That's cool.
So do you live

652
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.680
live in Crown Heights?

653
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.590
Williamsburg?
No,
on I really,
really crown heights.
Okay,
that's cool.

654
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.513
Yeah.
I

655
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.270
ask him where he gets his clothes.

656
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.630
I like clothes or cools at urban outfitters.

657
00:42:56.631 --> 00:43:00.470
Was this second hand cool.
Even better.

658
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.220
Yeah.

659
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.720
We're going to make this happen.
We should be,
you should ask the question.
Yes.

660
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.280
This is how many days from now on.
I'm just going to like hold like Q and a

661
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:28.240
question.
Yeah,
sorry,
sorry.

662
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.083
Not Sorry.

663
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.920
<v 6>So thinking about allyship as being a really awesome thing in general,</v>

664
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.860
one of the things that I've been talking about and reading about recently is the

665
00:43:36.861 --> 00:43:41.090
idea of people who were like book misogynists.
I had a friend who said,

666
00:43:41.091 --> 00:43:43.730
I just saw get out,
I feel like a woke racist.

667
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:47.690
Like I just didn't really know what I'm thinking about these things.
First,

668
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.710
have you had any situations and anecdotally that you're like,
no,

669
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:55.240
I thought you were on my team and then this happened.
And then also

670
00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:00.360
<v 1>generally other than like shutting down the black every day</v>

671
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.300
country,
literally

672
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.270
<v 6>insistently shutting down the bullshit.</v>

673
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.830
How do we prevent people from being so comfortable having that sort of identity?

674
00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.810
<v 5>You know what,
that's a good question.
Um,
I think it's a give and take.</v>

675
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.300
I feel like first of all,

676
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.500
surround yourself with friends and people that are woke and you know,

677
00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:28.730
our kind and nice in general.

678
00:44:28.731 --> 00:44:32.760
We like aware of what's happening but also realize certain things are out of

679
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:34.050
your control too.
Like don't,

680
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.800
I think you should only do that to the extent that you're not exhausting

681
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:39.740
yourself and you're not tired.
Uh,

682
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.870
because one of my favorite things that my therapist says to me is,

683
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:45.570
you don't have to fight today.
It'll,
you could lift it.

684
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:49.440
Sometimes it's like good to crawl into bed and just watch reruns of Buffy the

685
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:52.320
vampire slayer or play the sims if you're me.

686
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.370
<v 2>And I feel like it is</v>

687
00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.520
<v 5>only doing it to an extent,</v>

688
00:44:57.521 --> 00:45:02.521
but also realizing that you can't control everybody and just making sure that

689
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.750
with your immediate group and when you're out and about,

690
00:45:07.751 --> 00:45:11.410
you express your allyship and you make sure that you advocate as a,

691
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.550
as a white male,

692
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.760
make sure that you advocate for people that otherwise wouldn't get in rooms that

693
00:45:15.761 --> 00:45:19.930
you're able to,
but only so much.
And uh,

694
00:45:19.931 --> 00:45:24.330
I also think that if it's like your family,
like if it's like somebody's old,

695
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:26.500
if it's like grandma,
it's like she's going to die sooner

696
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.480
<v 2>anyway.
Like let her go,</v>

697
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:36.970
let her take it away.
Yeah.
Like it's like crazy.
She's seen a lot of crazy shit,

698
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.430
but it's like,
just let her go.
Um,
but yeah,
when is what is here.

699
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.310
<v 4>Um,
I also,</v>

700
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:46.480
I also think it's like we all have to remind ourselves that we always have to be

701
00:45:46.481 --> 00:45:48.940
learning.
Abl just made it up.

702
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:52.800
<v 2>Oh
yeah,
I stole it,
but I made it up.</v>

703
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.190
<v 4>Um,
you know,
like for me,</v>

704
00:45:56.191 --> 00:45:59.880
like I'm constantly like having to learn about trans issues cause that's

705
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:02.610
something that I don't know everything about and it's fine and be like,

706
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.090
I don't know everything.
Well let me go and read a book,
let me go educate myself.

707
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.290
And so I think it's great that your friend saw get out and then was like,
oh,

708
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.100
I'm more racist than I thought and that person's going to go check themselves

709
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:17.490
and like really like evaluate their behaviors so they can do better in the

710
00:46:17.491 --> 00:46:20.580
future.
And I feel like once you know better,
you can then do better.

711
00:46:20.581 --> 00:46:25.080
So I think just really just checking yourself and just being like,
Hey,

712
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:27.900
am I doing everything that I can?
It'd be like a good person.

713
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.360
Do I still think these shitty things were?

714
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:33.600
Do I occasionally make a bad joke that I shouldn't say?

715
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:36.420
But it makes people laugh.
And so that's why I do it.

716
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:40.740
So I think as long as people are really open about,
I don't have all the answers,

717
00:46:40.741 --> 00:46:44.530
but I really want to learn and they're not like,
oh,
well Josh,
you're black.

718
00:46:44.531 --> 00:46:46.580
So I'm going to ask you everything so I could learn about black people,

719
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.950
<v 2>call me.
[inaudible] like turning someone into like,
you know,</v>

720
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:56.000
learning in x,
but just like educating yourself I think is great.
Of course worse.

721
00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:02.040
So you're the last question.
Oh my God,
no one else wants to ask a good question.

722
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.510
We like totally just like,

723
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:11.790
I understand.
It's a good,
it's a good strategy.
Hi,
my name's Kayla.

724
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:14.940
Just thank you for coming and thank you for everything that you do.

725
00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.250
[inaudible]

726
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.820
so of what you can share,

727
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:30.340
what other side projects do you guys have up this year?

728
00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.250
<v 4>Uh,
for me,
uh,
I'm,</v>

729
00:47:32.251 --> 00:47:35.910
I'm going to be an La April and may cause I'm writing on the last season of

730
00:47:35.911 --> 00:47:39.470
Portlandia I,
which is very exciting.
Um,

731
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.810
<v 2>and yeah,
I think that's it.
Yeah.
And I just,</v>

732
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.570
I went to Sundance with a movie called the incredible Jessica Dreams and we sold

733
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:47.740
it to Netflix.
So it'll be,

734
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.040
it'll be on Netflix on the next couple of months because we're very excited

735
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.500
for me there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

736
00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.620
Should we just do this one last part or no?
Meghan didn't say no.
Go ahead.
Go,
go,

737
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:06.430
go,
go,
go,
go.
I don't even have a question I just gave you,
if we have commentary

738
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.100
how you interact with people and so just tell Jessica that.

739
00:48:11.101 --> 00:48:13.060
I mean she was so much more than John Stewart.

740
00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:18.240
<v 1>Oh,
thank you so much.
Like Ah,
that's true.</v>

741
00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:23.310
<v 2>I appreciate it.
That's true.
Yeah.
Well capable of growing up.</v>

742
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.810
I don't work in late night anymore.

743
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:26.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

744
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.280
<v 2>Well we have a gift for you so we're going to get you a gift and we want to</v>

745
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:31.510
thank you again for coming.

746
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:33.640
<v 1>Why did you get us a massage chair?</v>

747
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:38.700
We try [inaudible]

748
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:50.000
<v 4>this is like Oprah's favorite things,
but</v>

749
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.100
we don't get anything under your chairs.
You don't?
Oh,
this is for you.

750
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:04.710
Oh sure.
I love shirts.
I'm going to sleep and then get cold.

751
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.070
You need to put on this extra large.

752
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.770
<v 1>Thank you so much.
Oh my God,
this is great.</v>

753
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.590
You guys can go back to work.

754
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:23.720
<v 2>Hi.</v>
