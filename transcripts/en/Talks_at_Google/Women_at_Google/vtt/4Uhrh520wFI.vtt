00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.350
Marcy Marcy recently wrote a book called just because my husband is a woman and

5
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.560
it's receiving five star ratings on Amazon.
Um,
I,

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.700
I'm really looking forward to her telling us her story,

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.350
her side of the story.
So I'm going to tell you a little bit about,
um,

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.770

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.370
I Aa plus people and their families.

18
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.190
They've been married for over 28 years.

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.250
I've known them for about 2020 plus of those years and each has a rich and

20
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:28.140
varied background as business owners and also in the production and TV world.

21
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.970
First,
Marcy,

22
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.480
Marcy went from managing several psychiatric offices in Marin and also has owned

23
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.600
several production companies.
She's been a director,
producer,

24
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:44.601
voiceover talent and wildlife rehabilitator and now she's an author.

25
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.190
Her new book was released on October 11th and it's entitled just because my

26
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:53.790
husband is a woman.
Marcy's side of the story.

27
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.400
Scotty who was just at Google last year giving her talk,

28
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.300
has sef,
has served in several capacities as well,

29
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:06.780
and the TV and film industry.
He's been a director.

30
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.320
She has been a director or a screenwriter and adventure documentary reality show

31
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.240
runner.
More recently,

32
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.750
Scottie has added speaker and author to her bio,

33
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.550
her memoir,

34
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.820
getting back to me from girl to boy to a woman in just 50 years is on Amazon's

35
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.820
Lgbtq biography best seller list and is in the process of being made into a TV

36
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:36.894
series.

37
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.180
Marcy and Scotty share intimate and pertinent stories about their real life

38
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:44.790
experience transitioning together.

39
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.060
Their story is both vulnerable and precious in our current times.

40
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.831
Like I said,

41
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:57.750
I've known Marcy and Scotty for over 20 years and it's a great privilege and

42
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.980
pleasure to bring them to the

43
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 1>talks at Google series.
And so I'd like to welcome first up Scottie,</v>

44
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
Jeanette Madden.

45
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.703
<v 2>Thank you,
Monica.</v>

46
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.463
<v 3>Right.</v>

47
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.200
<v 2>I'm out here to kind of set a little bit of context.</v>

48
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.650
I'm the husband that Marcy spoke about.

49
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.600
What's important for you to know is that,
um,

50
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.490
for about three years solid every morning,

51
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640
I would wake up at about 4:00 AM and I would pray to God for Marcy

52
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.150
and Marcy came.
I wasn't praying for her by name,

53
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.440
but I knew in the deepest fiber of my being that Marcy was out there and I just

54
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.490
wanted God to finally bring her to me.

55
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.080
I knew it as truly as I knew it,
that I was a woman.

56
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.570
I knew that despite what my body was telling me what everybody else in my life

57
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:05.940
was telling me,
that I was a woman.

58
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.700
I also knew that Marcy was out there.

59
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.090
So when Marcy says,

60
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.630
just because it's story goes a little bit deeper than that,

61
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.110
I'm so proud of her that she wrote this book.

62
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.700
But even more what I'm happy about is for you all to know now what I've always

63
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.400
known and that's how amazing Marcy is.

64
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.920
So I'll let her tell you the rest.

65
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.740
<v 1>Thank you,
my love.
Thank you Monica so much.
It really is a pleasure to be here.</v>

66
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.310
Being here with Scotty's book last year I had no idea that I would write a book.

67
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.473
Um,

68
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.580
and I guess I should tell you that it's obvious because of what Scotty just said

69
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.860
and the title of my book,

70
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.030
that there's not going to be a big Aha ending at the end of the talk.

71
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.630
You have that upfront.
So,
um,

72
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.170
the point of what I want to be here for today is,
um,

73
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.990
to tell you the part that comes after the ellipses just because my husband's a

74
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:15.860
woman.
Dot.
Dot,
dot.
Marcy side of the story.

75
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.810
Uh,
and,
uh,
just a little bit of a warning here.

76
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.290
I don't know if any of you have ever thought that you might want to write a
book.

77
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.790
I think it's kind of a romantic idea that a lot of us share.

78
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.900
I certainly did,

79
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.850
but my problem was I thought I would never have a subject matter.

80
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.190
So just,
you know,
this is a warning to be careful what you wish for.

81
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.500
So yes,
my spouse,
Scotty is transgender.

82
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.820
Um,
we've been married almost 29 years,

83
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.220
20 of those years.
I thought I was married to my husband Scott.

84
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.350
Then one morning Scotty came with coffee early and blurted out the words that

85
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.720
she was a woman.

86
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.200
This was 20 years into our marriage and it wasn't planned.

87
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.280
It was just as if her emotions and her mouth took over.

88
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.790
It was not something that she ever really expected to reveal and um,

89
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.350
she really thought that she'd be going to her grave with this secret.

90
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.310
Nowadays we hear transgender,
that word quite a bit.
It's been in the media a lot.

91
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.940
We're very familiar with it.
Um,

92
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.810
it was not that familiar word to me,
especially in my early years,

93
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.130
but more people have stepped out of the darkness of their feelings and their

94
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.900
sadness and are,
are coming forward and speaking up.
Um,

95
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.050
of course we still really have a long way to go to find acceptance because we

96
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:00.560
can sense that I think in the political arena,

97
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.420
although after the elections from last night and the results,

98
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.500
I think we've got some positive movement forward again in that arena too.

99
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.550
So Scotty wrote her book about coming out and we don't really hear much about

100
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.850
what goes on when a person is married and what happens to the spouse when one

101
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:24.350
person wants to transition.

102
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.260
And statistically the most recent statistics that we have,

103
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:35.261
say that only 21% of marriages where someone transitions survive.

104
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.030
So when Scotty came out and we'd already been married for 20 years,

105
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.713
um,

106
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.500
what happened was when she would be going on her book signings in Tours,
uh,

107
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.080
and they'd come time for Q and a perhaps in one of those sessions,
uh,

108
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.100
some people would raise their hands and start addressing questions to me.

109
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.110
Like,
how did you do this and,

110
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:08.090
and why did you do it?
What,
what was it that prompted you to want to stay?

111
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.290
Um,
because a lot of times what they would do would be to put themselves in my

112
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.010
position and they just couldn't imagine it.
Um,

113
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.810
so just because my husband's a woman is,
is my story.

114
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.410
I'm going to give you a little bit of background of my history,
uh,
because it,

115
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.620
it goes way back into the dark ages.

116
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.100
But I think part of my upbringing was,

117
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
was a big arc in my whole journey of coming around to accepting,

118
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.610
uh,
what was happening in our lives.
Um,

119
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.590
I was born and raised in New England.

120
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.160
I'm very much the,
uh,

121
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.810
boarding school type of raising.
Um,

122
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.070
manners were a big thing in our household.
Both my parents had been to boarding.

123
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.190
Um,
I had,
uh,

124
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.270
I still have three brothers and even from the early days when people would ask

125
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:07.440
my mother how many kids she had,
her answer was,

126
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.020
I have four boys and one's a girl.

127
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.720
So as I look back on my life,
getting ready to write this book,

128
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.750
I started to see little hints along the way of things that I was learning that

129
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:25.950
either stood in my way for growth or actually helped me along the way.

130
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.240
But so it was expected.
I too went to boarding school.

131
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.320
I was there for three years.
Um,

132
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.070
and I think I'll tell you a little sidebar story just to show you again how far

133
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:43.370
I've had to come with his whole topic.
Um,

134
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.480
but I remember once sitting my roommate down after I'd been there for several

135
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.080
months and I said,
have I done something wrong?

136
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.040
Have I said something wrong to the other girls in the house?

137
00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:00.630
They just seem like they're very standoffish and I feel like maybe I said

138
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:05.430
something I wasn't aware of that pissed them off.
And she said,

139
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.390
oh,
well.

140
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.080
And she shut the door to our bedroom and she sat on the bed opposite me and she

141
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:13.590
said,
well,
they think you're a lesbian.

142
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.900
And I went,
oh my God,
what's a lesbian?

143
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.820
So to say I was somewhat innocent is perhaps an understatement.

144
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.620
Um,
after boarding school,
I went to a two year college,

145
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.520
a woman's College in upstate New York,
and,
uh,

146
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.330
majored in an overseas program,
which took me to Geneva,

147
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:43.320
Switzerland for a year where I,
where I worked.
And,

148
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.573
um,

149
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:50.630
after that I came home in 1969 and I ended up moving to California starting out

150
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:57.660
here in the bay area.
And,
um,
for several years I was working for,

151
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.950
um,
psychiatrists during those years.
Um,

152
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.200
there's a few stories about experiences with them and have that in,
um,

153
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.153
in my book.

154
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.580
Some of it was quite humorous and also another little breadcrumb that I'd

155
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:17.220
forgotten about until again,

156
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:20.220
I went back in my memory to think about what to write about in my book.

157
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.600
And I went,
oh wait.

158
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:25.560
I was kind of exposed to the subject of transgender back then,

159
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.880
but I hadn't even remembered it or put it together until looking back.

160
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.860
So after several years with the shrinks,
um,

161
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.770
I started in the production business.

162
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:41.400
I volunteered for a company and then I ended up being one of the owners of it.

163
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:45.990
It was a recording studio in San Francisco.
Um,

164
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.790
I had gotten married while I was still working for the psychiatrists.

165
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.230
Then when I went to work at the recording studio,

166
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.940
I fell in love with one of the partners in that.

167
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.950
And um,

168
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.570
so ended up in a divorce moving into marriage number two.

169
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.080
And as I look back,

170
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.770
what I realized was I really have always been looking for love.

171
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:19.771
I always had been and I felt like my parents had us storybook marriage.

172
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:25.801
My Dad would come home from work every night and find my mother first and give

173
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:30.520
her a movie dip kiss when he got home and they'd sit and have a cocktail

174
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:33.790
together and he would download his day.
And he really,

175
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.560
she was his muse and his confidant and his advisor.

176
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.470
And I just thought that's what a marriage should be like.

177
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.720
And so when mine weren't fitting that or when it felt like the feelings were

178
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.830
gone,
mostly probably just cause we settled into an everyday life.

179
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.480
I thought the love was gone.

180
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.370
And so that's how I would end up being attracted to somebody else and leave that

181
00:12:57.371 --> 00:13:01.660
marriage and go into another one.
Um,
believe it or not,

182
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.760
I actually repeated the process again.

183
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.980
So I met this wonderful,
I'm very creative,
witty,

184
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:13.900
funny writer who was with one of the ad agencies who was our client.

185
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.530
And we started having lunches together and uh,
of course I thought,

186
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:18.730
well this is the one,

187
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.010
he's the one number two was not working out so well.

188
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.130
Uh,
the chinks in the armor we're definitely showing.

189
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.430
So I'm sure enough I broke off that marriage and entered number three and years

190
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:39.360
down the line of that marriage.
I think I hung in there for awhile.
Uh,

191
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.260
he was the one who broke it off.

192
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.820
So at least that was the little bit of a change in my pattern.
Um,

193
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.750
and he also had not been faithful.
So,
uh,

194
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.030
I realized I,

195
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.920
I probably just needed to really reevaluate what I was looking for and how I was

196
00:13:56.921 --> 00:14:01.240
looking for it and needed some space to figure out who I really was.

197
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.190
So I lived on my own for awhile.
And then along came Scott.

198
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.980
I had no idea,
cause people ask me this all the time.
No,

199
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:17.130
I had no idea that Scott was anything but a creative,

200
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.940
wonderful,
thoughtful,
loving,
smart,
witty,

201
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.740
funny man who was,
um,
very much in love with me.

202
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.170
And so this one,
especially because I had taken the time,

203
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:35.860
I hadn't left from one relationship to another.
Um,

204
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.170
this just felt right and we fell together pretty much from day one,

205
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:46.610
except I get teased that I sent Scott home the first night because,
you know,

206
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.670
I didn't want to seem like I was too easy.

207
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.100
Um,
so at this point I want to read you a little bit from my book because I've

208
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:02.930
hinted that,
um,
surprisingly to myself,

209
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:07.370
there were some breadcrumbs along the way that we're maybe little clues of,

210
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.960
of what was really going on that I hadn't really seen for what they were.

211
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.350
So,
um,
this might tell you a little bit about

212
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.110
<v 4>what that was like for me.</v>

213
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:22.783
This is yours.

214
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.950
<v 1>No,
I have,
I have like,
you know,
placeholders and everything.</v>

215
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.500
I love your book.
Getting back to me.
Oh,
thank you.

216
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.550
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yeah,
I know.
I did that on purpose.

217
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.793
Okay.

218
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.710
Journey back with me to 1992 some of you probably weren't even born then,

219
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.150
so Scott and I were on a TV shoot in India for two weeks.

220
00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.970
Being in India is like taking all the volume and color saturation knobs on your

221
00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:04.810
viewing and listening devices and turning them up to the Max.

222
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.490
The colors are intensely vibrant and can burn your eyeballs.

223
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.190
The sounds are strange.
Symphony,

224
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:17.310
symphony of familiar and unfamiliar noises and the smells,

225
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.290
the smells,
smoke mixed with fragrant flowers,

226
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.840
some not so frequent elements.

227
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.720
Incense and teaming life.

228
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.560
We visited temples and teachers and Mountain Shrines and during the annual Mog

229
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.010
Mila,
we took a boat out onto the water at sunset,

230
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.900
at the sacred confluence of the three rivers,
the Ganges,
the Muna,

231
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.960
and the Saraswati where hundreds of people were waiting and dipping in the water

232
00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:51.430
to be cleansed and to pray.

233
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.420
I took the opportunity to pray to the energy was thick with a vibrant,

234
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.830
with the vibration of something otherworldly,
something hallowed.

235
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.800
Since Scott and I were into yoga,

236
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.430
we felt deeply affected by being in the land where yoga was born.

237
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.840
We were so grateful.
Even giddy to be there though.

238
00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:18.700
The host of the TV show was far from home including mentally and emotionally.

239
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.520
Scott and I felt very much at home.

240
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.080
We were curious to see and try everything despite the challenges of a small crew

241
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:33.991
with lots of equipment to lug around and despite the show's host hosts many

242
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:39.040
tantrums.
We thrived.
The crew were all good friends of ours,

243
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.820
family really.
We were all like kids in a new playground.

244
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.850
One day we visited a Jain temple near our hotel in Mount.

245
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:55.290
The temple was built into a hillside and it had no decoration or indication on

246
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:57.090
the outside that it was a temple.

247
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.050
This was to protect it from attack at wartime.

248
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.060
It just looked like part of the rocky hillside disguise so it could not be seen

249
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:09.960
from the air.
Once we stepped inside,

250
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.570
we were in a wonderland of carved marble.

251
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.620
It took the craftsman years and years to complete the work.

252
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.400
There was room after room of intricately carved marble and every inch of space

253
00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:27.540
was done.
Floors,
ceilings,
walls and columns.

254
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.510
Often there were carvings within carvings,

255
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.180
one carved marble column within another.

256
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.220
It was as if the whole temple was made of the most intricate,
delicate,

257
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.150
white lace.

258
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.490
In some places you could look into an ante room and see other shapes and figures

259
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.970
that we're so tucked away it seemed we weren't even supposed to see them.

260
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.870
One such room had two huge lifesize marble marble elephants.

261
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.420
I could just see them through the lacy wall and door.

262
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.450
There was only cracked open and there were statutes of deities and saints

263
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.040
surrounding the outer circle of the temple.

264
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.500
They all had brightly painted eyes that when you stared at them drew you into a

265
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:12.360
deep and meditative state.

266
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.250
There was one such statue that completely had me mesmerized.

267
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.850
I just had to keep staring into those all knowing eyes.

268
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.310
I was filled with a feeling of warm love.
I felt completely connected,

269
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:31.560
completely one with that being and with everything around me and Scott was there

270
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:36.561
to seemingly in the same state when we compared our experiences.

271
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.550
Scott told me that his,
his case was locked on the statue.

272
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.050
He saw himself reach back to the middle of his shoulders,

273
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:51.460
grasp a zipper and unzipped from there and up over the top of his head until the

274
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:58.041
sheath that was his body just fell away revealing a body made purely of light.

275
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.240
As the sheath fell away like a lightweight Halloween costume,

276
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.720
he stepped out of his skin to stand as the new light being who said to him,

277
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.000
I'll Ms. Scott.
He was really fun.

278
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.720
I was confused by that and a bit frightened.

279
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.220
It sounded as if Scott was not long for this world.
Was He going to die?

280
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.610
Scott didn't really seem very concerned about it,

281
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:26.580
so I didn't say anything about the questions that brought up in me.

282
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.100
He seemed deeply touched by the experience.
It was amazing.

283
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.070
Over the years since that trip to India,

284
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.540
I would flash back on Scott's experience in the Jain temple and I often wondered

285
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:43.530
if he did too.
If he relived the words,
I'll Ms. Scott.

286
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.790
He was really fun.

287
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.960
Now I know each of did revisit that experience many times and now those words

288
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:52.870
have a different significance to me.

289
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.540
I had taken the experience then as a spiritual experience where Scott was

290
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:02.740
becoming less attached to the physical world and identifying more with his

291
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:05.230
universal self.
Yes,

292
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:09.790
he was less attached to the physical but not necessarily for spiritual reasons.

293
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.100
This was real physical,
uh,
direct hotline to who he was.

294
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.840
He was less attached to his body because he never felt he belonged in it.

295
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.790
He probably felt like unzipping it and stepping out of it most of the time.

296
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:29.950
And yet he might have to stay in Cayston that ill fitting costume for the rest

297
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:30.784
of his life.

298
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.130
So you've had a little glimpse into my personal history.
As I said,

299
00:21:46.131 --> 00:21:50.270
there's more in the book,
some,
um,
some fun stories.

300
00:21:50.271 --> 00:21:54.470
This isn't all scary stuff.
Um,

301
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.420
though transgender has been around for centuries,

302
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.680
it really,
as I said,
has not been talked about very much until more recently.

303
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.840
And as people have talked about it and come out some of the names,
you know,

304
00:22:08.841 --> 00:22:12.800
I'll let you fill in the blanks,
um,
and covered by the media.

305
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.200
Um,
one of,

306
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:21.370
one of my earliest experiences of this was when I was watching an Oprah show.

307
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.940
And Oprah had on a couple where one of the two had transgendered and they,

308
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.370
um,
the couple was staying together.
They were beautiful.
Couple happily married.

309
00:22:34.371 --> 00:22:38.690
They had kids.
Um,
the,
the one who had been a,

310
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.550
a husband was a doctor and was maintaining now her practice.

311
00:22:43.551 --> 00:22:48.380
She was gorgeous by the way.
And they talked about their whole experience.

312
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.110
And I swear to God,

313
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.220
I looked at the television and said out loud,

314
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.570
well,
at least I'll never have to deal with that.

315
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.040
So I want to be sharing this with you because that's an example of how far I've

316
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:12.424
had to come.

317
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.170
That was my feeling about what transgender was at the time.

318
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.300
So suffice to say,
it's been quite an arc.

319
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.700
My life has been an arc of discovery,

320
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:29.701
of questioning until I could find peace and understanding and love.

321
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.960
I talk about all the phases that I went through.

322
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:40.270
And I think that the phases of loss anyway for a lot of people,

323
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.850
you know,
I,
I went through denial,
um,

324
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:50.510
fears,
ultimatums.
Okay,

325
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.750
you can do this as long as you don't do that.
Okay?

326
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.910
You can pierce years and grow your hair,

327
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.730
but no way are you going to wear dresses.

328
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:02.720
And at the time Scotty would say that that's okay,
that's enough.

329
00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:07.460
I don't really want more.
Um,
but obviously for a lot of trans people,

330
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:10.580
they're not really complete with their journey until they even go all the way

331
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:15.530
through the point of having surgery and having the body that be speaks to
gender,

332
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:18.820
they identify with.
Um,

333
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.800
I was so determined that this was just maybe a phase or midlife crisis.
In fact,

334
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.780
when Scotty came downstairs to say to me that early morning with the two cups of

335
00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:33.410
coffee and just blurted out the first word,
she said,
we're,

336
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.150
I don't know who I am.
And so my first thought was,
oh God,
midlife crisis,

337
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:39.470
you're going to want to Porsche.

338
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.690
And it's suffice to say that as the journey progressed,

339
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:47.730
I was kind of wishing it had been the desire for a Porsche.

340
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.000
I had bouts where I played Nancy drew,
I'll get back to that in a minute,

341
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.380
but I also

342
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.870
since Scotty to our homeopaths to get a remedy

343
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.760
cause I thought,
you know,
there's just some kind of mix up in the system.

344
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:12.470
All she needs is rebalancing of some kind.
And to her credit,
she went,

345
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.450
I'm sure rolling her proverbial eyes in her head the whole way.

346
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.430
But she was willing to do that for me.

347
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.380
So all of my steps were baby steps towards acceptance.

348
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.400
Now I don't know if any of you grew up with Nancy drew.

349
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.140
Nancy drew was a series of,
uh,

350
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.900
detective books about a young woman who was a detective.
Um,

351
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.350
they've been upgraded even over the years because they were very famous popular

352
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:39.891
series.

353
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:43.760
And I think now Nancy probably does drive a Porsche at the time she drove a

354
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:44.570
roadster.

355
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.500
So you're just going to have to Google that and figure out how that old car

356
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:49.334
looked.

357
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.570
But that I started snooping around.

358
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.710
I couldn't stand the feeling that there was a secret.

359
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.920
And even those Scotty had come out to me.

360
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.270
I didn't understand what transgender was.
I started researching,

361
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.720
which actually was kind of a mistake because as you of all people probably know,

362
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:16.010
a lot of the things you can find on the Internet are disturbing.

363
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.820
You can find very disturbing stories.
So I thought,
well,

364
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:21.530
this isn't where I want to be.

365
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.340
So I admit I would go into Scotty's computer and look for clues.

366
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.690
And so I became quite the detective,
um,

367
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.810
and it was pretty good at it actually.
Uh,

368
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:41.890
I surprised myself at how good I was at finding phone numbers that were coded,

369
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.740
things like that.
So,
um,

370
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.740
I don't know if you can say that,
you know,
someone who's transgender,

371
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.600
uh,
whether you have a family member or a friend.
Um,

372
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.200
but now that you've met Scotty,

373
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.770
you can no longer say you don't know someone who's transgender.

374
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.510
And I don't know if there's any questions that we can check in to see if

375
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:16.590
anyone's asked questions,
if not,
um,
the,
the,

376
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.790
<v 0>so no questions on the dory,</v>

377
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:24.150
but this is a good time to remind people who are listening on livestream.

378
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.830
If you have questions,

379
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.360
please be sure to write them in the Dory and we'll get back to them in a few.

380
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.740
Great.
Thank you,
Monica.

381
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.630
<v 1>Um,
part of the reason I say that is because,
um,</v>

382
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.400
Scotty and I are making a real point to getting out and about.

383
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:46.110
We've spoken at universities and other corporations and,

384
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:51.360
um,
Lgbtq organizations.
I Aa plus,

385
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:57.000
um,
because we really want our lives to be an open book.

386
00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:02.090
We want us to be the people that you can count on to ask questions of where no

387
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:07.200
one will be upset by the question.
No one will feel

388
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.850
shamed or hurt by a question because we really want people to be educated about

389
00:28:14.701 --> 00:28:16.290
this.
Um,

390
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.430
when I've run into any kind of resistance or bumps with people,

391
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.140
I really find it's because people don't really understand.

392
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.530
One of the biggest signs of that is somebody might say,

393
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.110
why would you choose to be a woman?

394
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.880
And a lot of my women friends will say that,

395
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:40.680
who would want to choose to be a woman?
Um,
but it's,

396
00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.360
it's not a matter of choice.

397
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.780
And I think that's one of the biggest things that's really important to say.

398
00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:48.723
<v 3>Okay.</v>

399
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:53.390
<v 1>Um,
people ask me why and how I did it.</v>

400
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.063
So

401
00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:01.450
a big part of what I had to do was look through my own concepts.

402
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.660
What is a husband?
What is a wife?

403
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.880
What is marriage?
What is love?
What is gender?

404
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.770
I mean,
heck,
I'd already been mis-gendered as a lesbian or years before.

405
00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:19.530
So what's in a word?
And I,

406
00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.350
I dug deeply into those words,
but my relationship with them,

407
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:29.410
what did I think love was and what did I think a husband was?

408
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.900
Um,
you know,

409
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:37.901
as my mate and my spouse and my beloved Scotty was fulfilling those things that

410
00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:44.830
we really look for most in a relationship.
So I thought,

411
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:45.664
well,

412
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.780
does it matter that I call this person my husband or do I have love?

413
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.630
And I kept thinking how I had looked for love,

414
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.000
okay.
In all the wrong places.

415
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.900
I'd look for love for a long time until I found Scotty.

416
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.150
And I also thought about all the ways that,
that she had stuck with me,

417
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.100
that she had really been generous.
She's a great cook,
which really helps.

418
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.450
Um,
but took good care of me all along the way was loving,

419
00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:24.451
was the love I'd always looked for when I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

420
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.680
She didn't run away.

421
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.760
She took care of me and went with the doctor to me and has always supported me

422
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:32.140
throughout the whole process.

423
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:37.830
So looking at the words that we have and re asking ourselves,

424
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:40.610
how do I relate to that?
Um,

425
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.140
how do I relate to the things that my parents or peers or teachers taught me

426
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.870
back when?
Um,

427
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.840
it's really a valuable thing to do.

428
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.770
And we've often played a game with people when we've talked to it's,

429
00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.730
we call it the binary game and ask people to say some of the things that,

430
00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:06.290
um,
maybe they were taught or was said to them when they were little or even now

431
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.630
that has affected their opinion of something.

432
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.570
And even with the young people in the universities,

433
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:16.690
it's amazing how much those kinds of messages are still being given to them.

434
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.320
You know,
Scotty will often share how,
um,

435
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.310
her dad would say to Scott,
um,

436
00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:29.690
you run like a girl
or if you're,

437
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.990
<v 0>if you're going to cry like that Mary Jane go put on a dress.</v>

438
00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.540
<v 1>Yes.
So first of all,
that's a double whammy of putting a woman down,</v>

439
00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:43.541
but also telling your son that he's less than by saying he's like a girl.

440
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.370
Um,
my mother really screwed me up because she,

441
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.720
um,

442
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.720
wanted me to not like drive like a girl or throw a ball like a girl,

443
00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.470
but so she was the one who had to teach me how to do that.

444
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.930
So that's kind of confusing.

445
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:07.250
<v 0>Did you have something,
Monica?
Yeah,
there's a question on the dory and it's,
um,</v>

446
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.660
relevant to how you're speaking about these questions that you're asking

447
00:32:11.661 --> 00:32:15.380
yourselves,
um,
around binary and what,
what that means.

448
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.290
So the question is,
um,

449
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:22.730
how did you feel about the impact on your own identity?
Um,

450
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.500
you know,
given that you were,
you know,
part of a binary at,
you know,
a woman,

451
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:32.540
um,
w when did you decide to continue to be with your trans partner?

452
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.990
Did you feel your identity was being erased?

453
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.890
<v 1>Oh,
just a light question.</v>

454
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:47.040
Um,
I,

455
00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:52.110
it did occur to me that I would maybe leave,
I think it was a knee jerk reaction.

456
00:32:52.111 --> 00:32:55.830
Like,
well,
I can't be here.
I'm not a lesbian.
I can't be with this person.

457
00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.930
Um,
but again,
by evaluating some of those things,
we'll wait a minute.

458
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.410
Who is this person?
Um,

459
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:10.310
I had to really think about that and I'll get to the eraser part in a minute

460
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.830
cause I do have an answer about that too.
But,
um,

461
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:20.970
one of the biggest words I really had to look at was commitment because I'd

462
00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.980
already been in marriages where basically I gave up on the commitment or someone

463
00:33:26.261 --> 00:33:27.940
gave up on me.
So what does commitment,

464
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.710
I mean in our vows we say till death do us part.
Um,

465
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.060
so,

466
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.890
and I started looking at other couples who have stayed together like Michael Fox

467
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:41.530
and um,
uh,

468
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.800
Christopher Reeves and you know,

469
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.340
stuff happens in life and stuff happens to your partner.

470
00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.040
So do you walk away?
So as I said,

471
00:33:51.041 --> 00:33:56.041
Scotty hadn't walked away from me when I got deathly ill diagnosis.

472
00:33:56.381 --> 00:34:00.970
So I'm looking at commitment was one thing.
Um,

473
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.110
yes,

474
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:07.110
it made me question a lot about me and me as a woman at first.

475
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.900
Um,
and I used to sometimes to tease that.

476
00:34:13.901 --> 00:34:18.420
Well now I'm the one who wears the pants in the family,
the Scott,

477
00:34:18.421 --> 00:34:22.960
he's very into feminine stuff and I wasn't,
I was a tomboy.
So,

478
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:24.640
uh,
yes,

479
00:34:24.641 --> 00:34:28.360
it made me question my own identity as a woman.

480
00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.003
Um,

481
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.020
another sidebar was because Scotty was getting so much attention,

482
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.550
uh,
I started to ask the question,

483
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:44.050
what am I chopped liver.
I felt it was more like I just pushed,

484
00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:48.310
I felt pushed aside a bit as a person.
Um

485
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.833
<v 3>hmm.</v>

486
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.560
<v 1>Couple of things that helped me get through that was Scottie herself because,</v>

487
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.860
and,
and I want to say this because sometimes you'll hear,
uh,
that,

488
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:05.450
that trans people are selfish and I think especially if they come later in age,

489
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.940
they come out later in age.
They,
they just want their life.

490
00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:12.060
They've put it off for long enough.
Dammit.
I want to be who I am.

491
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.370
Scotty was very generous and patient with me and I could beat on her chest and

492
00:35:17.371 --> 00:35:21.780
scream and cry and accuse,
how could you do this to me?

493
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.430
How could you lie to me this long?
Um,
and,

494
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.120
but learn because she was patient and we talked about everything.

495
00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:34.830
We worked it all out together.
Um,
that she wasn't lying to me,

496
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.790
that actually she was the opposite of being.
She had,
um,

497
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.380
pretended to be a man for all that time so that she wouldn't hurt me.

498
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.220
So,
um,

499
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.160
<v 4>okay.</v>

500
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.030
<v 1>The other side of that is our friends,
thank God the,</v>

501
00:35:52.031 --> 00:35:56.080
the friends that we have in the family that we have in our lives,
um,

502
00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:01.450
didn't allow me to be chopped liver for too long because pretty much as soon as

503
00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:04.630
they would hear the news,
the next question would be turning to me and go,

504
00:36:04.631 --> 00:36:08.650
how are you?
So I was included.

505
00:36:08.651 --> 00:36:12.340
They knew that this might be hard for me and I felt that they were there to

506
00:36:12.341 --> 00:36:15.460
support me.
And I have a couple of funny stories about friends too,

507
00:36:15.461 --> 00:36:16.410
but it sounds like it.

508
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:20.700
<v 0>That was certainly one of the questions I asked you.
How are you?
Right.</v>

509
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.950
And I'm glad you're doing well.
Um,
that was,
uh,

510
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.200
another question that has come up.
Actually two questions.
Um,

511
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.500
one is how has your network of family and friends changed over time?

512
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.300
Uh,
and,
uh,
a question that I actually had to just out of curiosity,

513
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.600
what in your day to day has changed?

514
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:47.460
Like what's different in your day to day life and your relationship with Scotty?

515
00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:53.540
<v 1>Wow,
okay.
You may need to remind me of some cells,
so,
sure.</v>

516
00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.330
Um,
well family and friends.

517
00:36:56.331 --> 00:36:59.480
So this is maybe a good place for me to tell a couple of my friends' stories

518
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.030
because I realized too,
one of my biggest fears was telling people like,

519
00:37:05.031 --> 00:37:07.760
are they going to be shocked?
Are they going to think we're weird?

520
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:12.020
Obviously they think we're queer and now that I know what queer means,
but,
um,

521
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.310
I really was afraid of people's reaction and that we might be shunned and

522
00:37:16.311 --> 00:37:18.530
rejected.
And,
um,

523
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.510
so I took give these two examples in the book to a dear friend Melissa,

524
00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:26.840
who had worked with for a really long time.
I waited,

525
00:37:26.841 --> 00:37:29.120
I didn't want to tell people for a really long time,

526
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.510
I think because I kept hoping that Scotty would suddenly wake up someday and it

527
00:37:32.511 --> 00:37:35.900
would,
oh my God,
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm your husband again,

528
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.060
but that never came.
So,
um,
I,

529
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.100
I was feeling quite alone for a long time and uh,

530
00:37:43.101 --> 00:37:47.300
I told my friend Melissa,
who was there to visit,
I said,
you know what?

531
00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:49.430
I have something to tell you.
And she went,

532
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.993
<v 4>what?</v>

533
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.800
<v 1>Oh,
I said,
well,
Scott,
he's a woman.</v>

534
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.990
And she said,
Oh,
thank God.
I thought you were going to say you were splitting up

535
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.300
and that instantly it did something inside my whole being like this wasn't a bad

536
00:38:11.211 --> 00:38:14.270
thing that that's Scotty was,
was trans.

537
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:19.540
The bad thing was this love story that so many of our friends had subscribed to

538
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:24.881
and looked up to and wanted to clone my husband to have one of their own like

539
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:30.140
him.
That's what mattered to them was our love and preserving that.

540
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.920
So the other one was,
um,

541
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.550
I was sharing with a friend who is a lesbian,
uh,

542
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.540
of our childhood crushes.

543
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:45.430
And I had a mad crush on Richard Chamberlain who played Dr Kildare and a TV

544
00:38:45.431 --> 00:38:48.790
series way back when,
I think TV was still black and white,

545
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.340
but I just had the biggest crush on him.
And she said,
oh,
really?

546
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:57.900
My crush was Hayley mills.
So,
um,

547
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.440
I said,
yeah,
I know,
but then I find out that that Richard Chamberlain is,

548
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.420
is gay.
And she goes,
yeah.
And you ended up with Hayley Mills.

549
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.010
It's nice.
Oh,

550
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:16.240
and so the biggest change day to day in your life and your relationship with

551
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.074
Scotty?

552
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:21.460
I'm more into makeup now because I have someone who can teach me.

553
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:27.390
I really saw how much I was a tomboy and I shunned makeup and Scotty was so into

554
00:39:29.421 --> 00:39:32.530
it.
At first it really bugged me,
but,
um,

555
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.430
but then I would watch her put it on and they go,
Oh,
where'd you get that color?

556
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.970
Or,
so,
uh,
makeup is a day to day change.

557
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.540
<v 3>MMM.</v>

558
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.820
<v 1>I think part of it is also my priorities have changed.</v>

559
00:39:49.821 --> 00:39:53.840
Some of that has been with a diagnosis that I got,
but,
um,

560
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:55.763
<v 3>yeah,</v>

561
00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.020
<v 1>I'm relying a lot on my humor.
I are,
I always did.</v>

562
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:05.050
But I think that was also one of the things that got me through and seeing the

563
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.680
synchronicity and everything that happens around me and how sometimes things are

564
00:40:09.681 --> 00:40:14.300
almost a joke by the universe or a perfect pun on life itself.

565
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.450
Um,
I'm,

566
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.293
<v 3>hello,</v>

567
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:24.390
<v 1>I'm now less resistant to being affectionate in public with Scotty.</v>

568
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.470
Uh,
I was at first like,
Oh,
don't kiss me.
Oh,

569
00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:33.060
don't hold my hand and now I'll be the one to reach for her hand or,

570
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:38.020
or give her a kiss.
So,
because you know what,
I don't care.
Um,

571
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.020
my relationship even to the word lesbian,

572
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:45.400
like I was worried that people would think I'm a lesbian because now I was with

573
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:50.400
a woman.
But of course I flashed back on my high school days and went,
hmm,
okay,

574
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:55.630
that's interesting.
Um,
but I don't need a label.

575
00:40:55.750 --> 00:41:00.280
People kind of want to put you in a box and name it something.

576
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.370
And,
um,
I don't have to be,

577
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.490
be a lesbian to be in love with my spouse

578
00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:13.170
just because she's a woman.
Nice.
Um,

579
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.330
are there any questions here in the audience?
Yes,

580
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.440
my friend hers.
Thank you.

581
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.600
<v 5>So Marcy,
my question is,
um,
are,
are there any,</v>

582
00:41:27.601 --> 00:41:31.380
I mean there's so many spiritual aspects to what you've just described,

583
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.100
but are there any other lessons that

584
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.610
<v 2>were particularly powerful?</v>

585
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.250
Few from a kind of spiritual point of view about what's happened?

586
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.360
<v 1>Yeah,
thank you.
Great question.
Um,</v>

587
00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.040
I think

588
00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.750
contemplation was an important one and contemplating words and,

589
00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.500
and does this resonate with me?

590
00:41:56.501 --> 00:41:59.770
Do I need to accept this word anymore in my vocabulary?

591
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.800
But one of the things that released to me,

592
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.010
I think the most is that,
um,

593
00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:12.130
I believe in Karma.
Uh,
and,
and not kind of the everyday variety,

594
00:42:12.131 --> 00:42:15.930
the way some people slinging it around.
I mean,
I really do believe that,
um,

595
00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:21.090
what goes around comes around and that everything in one's life is a result of

596
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.860
past behaviors,
thoughts,
beliefs,
actions.

597
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.260
So once I kind of had this Aha that

598
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.220
Scotty didn't do this to me,

599
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:42.090
I was in this situation because it was my Karma to be in this situation.

600
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.980
I might not exactly see the reason why,

601
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:50.400
but I was supposed to be here and that erased the blame wasn't Scotty's fault.

602
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.550
Scotty wasn't doing this to me.
I was supposed to be here.

603
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.510
So now what are you going to do with it?
And um,

604
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.140
it was actually Scott Scott,

605
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.180
he's dad who had a saying that became my,

606
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:09.070
my guiding light through all the rest of my process,

607
00:43:09.071 --> 00:43:10.540
which kind of has to do with that.

608
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.170
And Jim Madden used to say,

609
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.520
you can go sitting up in the saddle or strapped across it,

610
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.770
but you're going riding Jesse James.

611
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:26.160
<v 2>Nice.
Good.
So we have another question in the audience.</v>

612
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.330
Hi.
Hi,
I'm Marcy.
Um,
I just want to ask,

613
00:43:30.331 --> 00:43:35.220
how did you guys first meet and how long did you date before he got married?

614
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:36.563
<v 1>Ah,</v>

615
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.700
we first met when we were both working for a production company in San Diego.

616
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:46.830
Um,
apparently when Scotty saw me,
is this fair to say

617
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.130
it was love at first sight?

618
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.780
I had this little stumbling block as I think I've told you that I was married at

619
00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:56.760
the time.
Um,

620
00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.630
but Scotty and I struck up this great friendship and we'd have great

621
00:44:00.631 --> 00:44:03.000
philosophical talks.
Um,

622
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.830
and I think this is one thing that was important and I would actually offer as

623
00:44:07.831 --> 00:44:09.270
advice about relationships,

624
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:15.040
is that friendship is really a key core important ingredient.

625
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:20.550
So we were friends first and we'd have arguments about Karma and philosophical

626
00:44:20.551 --> 00:44:21.450
things like that.

627
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:27.110
And I will also admit that Scotty's quite a bit younger than,

628
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.400
than I.
So I thought I was going to,

629
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.470
cause this guy was so great,

630
00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:38.910
fix him up with my stepdaughter and she was on the um,

631
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.000
the cheer team for uh,

632
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:46.320
she was going to Oregon state and her team was coming down the basketball team

633
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:48.780
to play at,
um,
Ucla.

634
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.190
So I since her,
she was going to come as a cheer girl.

635
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:58.220
I invited Scotty Scott to come with me and bill and come meet Kelly and the

636
00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:02.160
whole drive up from San Diego to La.

637
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:06.720
All Scott did was talk about these flipping earrings that he made for this other

638
00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:10.410
woman that he was interested in and they were Yin Yang.

639
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:15.950
And I remember sitting in the front seat next to my then husband and literally

640
00:45:17.461 --> 00:45:21.090
said to myself,
I was,
somebody loves me like that.

641
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:28.790
And after my marriage ended and I had had a few months and Scotty had had an

642
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:33.630
experience where,
um,

643
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:38.190
she was meditating one day and said that she saw me,

644
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.840
and this had been months and months since we'd worked together.
Um,

645
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.740
she called and said,
I haven't experienced,
I want to share with you.

646
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.710
And came to visit.

647
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:54.770
We went for a walk and I just fell in love with this being on the walk and she

648
00:45:55.651 --> 00:45:57.090
basically never left after that.

649
00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.040
<v 0>So it sounds like you're,
um,</v>

650
00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:06.580
marriage and relationship has both moved through chant,

651
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.240
transgender and has also transcended,

652
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:15.390
transcended any kinds of labels or boxes or a naming of,

653
00:46:18.431 --> 00:46:23.200
of any kind.
And that's really inspiring.
Um,
in this time,

654
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.790
um,
I want to thank you,
um,
and thank you,

655
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:29.223
Scotty,

656
00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:34.650
for coming to Google and sharing your story and being human with us about,

657
00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.680
um,
about how we can love in any circumstance.

658
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.590
So thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

659
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:46.420
<v 1>Thank you.</v>
