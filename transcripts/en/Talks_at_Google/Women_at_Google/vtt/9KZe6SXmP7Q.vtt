1
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.930
Hi,
thank you so much for coming and thanks for that lovely introduction.

2
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.760
Yes.
Okay.

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.200
We also wanted to give a special shout out to Google docs,
uh,

4
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.930
without which this collaborative book would never have been written.

5
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.590
Seriously play.
Yeah.
At one point we were in two different countries.
Um,

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.220
that's how you write a book together in two different countries.
So thank you,
uh,

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.390
to any folks here in this presentation is actually on Google slides and we

8
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:35.400
didn't do that just because we were coming to Google.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.550
We legit our fans,
so yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
okay.

10
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.790
So we want to talk about how Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.100
one the internet and why it matters,

12
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.850
and I want to start out by setting a scene for you.

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.250
It's June,
2013.

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.780
It's the last week of the Supreme Court term.
As many of you know,

15
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.810
that is the week that the most important decisions come down on this particular

16
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.890
day.
The voting rights act is on the chopping block.

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.201
As you may know,

18
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:14.010
this is one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation.

19
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.720
Chief Justice John Roberts has the opinion and he says,

20
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.210
any racial discrimination in voting is too much,

21
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.350
but our country has changed in the last 50 years.
Uh,

22
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.120
we have a comic and the boat that depicts this argument as lol,

23
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:34.020
racism is over.
Um,
now,

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.820
something that's a customary in the court bringing its opinions is that the

25
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.770
chief justice,
uh,

26
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:45.771
we'll say justice blank has the opinion and that opinion will be read by the

27
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:50.370
justice who wrote the opinion.
In this case,
the chief justice himself.

28
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.910
The impact of this decision was to gut an important provision of this piece of

29
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:59.700
civil rights legislation that made it,
uh,

30
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.680
this piece of legislation,

31
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:06.681
which was referred to as preclearance forced states with discriminatory

32
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:10.980
histories to bring their,
uh,
laws,

33
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:14.580
the changes in their voting laws to the federal government ahead of time so that

34
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:18.330
the federal government could monitor whether these would have a discriminatory

35
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:21.390
impact,
especially on historically oppressed groups.

36
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.330
So by undermining this piece of legislation,

37
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.470
by saying that it was no longer needed on a very questionable legal grounding,

38
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.460
essentially it was opening the door and has subsequently opened the door for

39
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.930
more racial discrimination in voting.
So in this case,

40
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:44.610
justice Ginsburg has a descent and like Erin mentioned,

41
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.240
it's customary for the majority opinion to be read from the bench.

42
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.190
But what's more unusual is for our descent to be read from the bench.

43
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.870
And in this case,

44
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:59.290
justice Ginsburg decided to read her descent out loud.

45
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.040
And not only

46
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.281
<v 1>that,</v>

47
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:05.050
she'd actually done so twice before in the same week,

48
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.290
once in a case regarding affirmative action and once in a combined two cases

49
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.690
involving workplace discrimination.

50
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.400
Now this is unusual and she actually broke supreme court records with the number

51
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:22.780
of,
uh,
oral descents that she gave that week.
And in this case,

52
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.050
when you read the dissent from the bench,
it means something,
it,
it,

53
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.300
it has an import,
it sends a message.

54
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.190
And that message is that something is wrong.
It's sounding the alarm.

55
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.190
It's like,
um,
as the New York Times actually put it,

56
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.960
it's like embarrassing your spouse at a dinner party in front of the guests.

57
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.760
So in this case,
I was in my second year of law school.

58
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.690
I was going into my second year at that time.
And as a future public defender,

59
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:54.691
I was appalled at the gutting of this central tool for racial justice advocates.

60
00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.400
So everyone I knew was sort of angry about what was happening on the court.

61
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.700
But the light amidst this anger was

62
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.190
<v 0>justice Ginsburg's words.
This is a court sketch that was a drawn live,</v>

63
00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:10.060
which we actually include in the book.

64
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.190
And if you look around Justice Ginsburg's neck,
uh,

65
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.200
a funny thing about a light thing that we include in the book is that a lot of

66
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:23.950
people recognize that these,
uh,
nick callers,
that she,
the Shabbos,
uh,

67
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.750
or necklaces that she wears with her juditional rubes many people don't know

68
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.510
that she chooses them based on what her opinion is that day.

69
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.720
So this is her descent,
Jibo.
Yeah.

70
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.740
So if she comes out to the bench wearing this spiky,

71
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.340
aggressive,
sparkling defending color,

72
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.060
it's bad news for liberals because she's about to descend

73
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.540
and her words,

74
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.410
<v 1>it's in this case,</v>

75
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:54.411
one of the most famous lines was actually the first post on the note

76
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.110
<v 0>for you as RBG tumbler throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is</v>

77
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.250
continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your

78
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.280
umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.

79
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.770
And we'd think that justice Ginsburg clear words,

80
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.690
which speak to people who are not just attorneys and our fierce and reasoned at

81
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:21.691
the same time are part of the reason why she has drawn so many people to her.

82
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.691
Uh,

83
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:27.691
this is such an elegant analogy that uses absolutely no legal jargon to draw

84
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:33.271
people's attention to what was a major appending of a core civil rights law.

85
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.190
And so

86
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.780
<v 1>when this case came out,</v>

87
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.860
I was inspired by Justice Ginsburg's words.

88
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.360
And at the same time I had already taken con law as a one l constitutional law.

89
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.500
I knew about Justice Ginsburg's work as an advocate at the women's rights

90
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:53.670
project of the Aclu.
And I knew something about her story,

91
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:54.540
her life story,

92
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.960
and I realized there was no space on the Internet that was just dedicated to

93
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.860
celebrating this amazing figure in our,

94
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.390
in our history.

95
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.720
And so I figured what better way to celebrate her then to juxtapose her with a

96
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.950
larger than life figure,
uh,
in our history as well.

97
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.270
The late great,

98
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.300
notorious B I g so I started a Tumblr and I designed a tee shirt.

99
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.600
And this is,
uh,
as you can see,

100
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.920
this was the first notorious RBG tee shirt.
And let's just say that it,

101
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:32.510
it took off yeah.
To say the least.

102
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.650
Here's an iconic image of biggie smalls,
uh,

103
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.790
that has,
uh,

104
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.350
found its way onto our book cover and a in the center are some those posters and

105
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:51.281
stickers blanketed Washington DC on the same week that we're talking about June,

106
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.660
2013,
uh,
the week of the Shelby County decision and the other oral,

107
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.460
the sense that we mentioned that we're also a concern,

108
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.760
civil rights and remedies to discrimination.

109
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.200
And the middle image is that Ken spelled truth without Ruth and it's a Basquiat

110
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:06.711
crown.

111
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:11.711
So definitely taking this kind of a street vernacular of the hip hop movement.

112
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.640
Uh,
and that's a little plug for art t shirts.
Uh,
the notorious RBG tee shirts,

113
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:21.020
that's my little brother
nail art.

114
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.690
There is Ruth Bader Ginsburg nail art.
There's also art art,

115
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.410
this illustrations in the times today.
By the way,
we were all very excited.

116
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.920
This is actually called,
that one is called Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

117
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.370
Smiting her enemies,
which,
um,

118
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.820
as I tried to explain in my op Ed in the New York Times this weekend,

119
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.050
she would never do,
she would just very gently argue with her enemies,

120
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.220
but she would smite them with the force of her reason.
She,

121
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:53.221
she likes to say that the way that you take down your adversaries is by painting

122
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:58.250
their arguments in the best light possible and then knocking them down.
Yeah.

123
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.940
So there was also embroidery and needlepoint

124
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:04.963
Lego's.

125
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.430
We actually got a chance to meet the RBG Lego and,
and her creator.

126
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.210
Uh,
yesterday.
Yes.
Like,
uh,

127
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.880
like justice Ginsburg herself small but powerful.

128
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.350
And as mentioned,
lots of Halloween costumes.

129
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.980
We're thinking about doing a contest this year.
Yes.

130
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.770
Keep us in mind when you're choosing your Halloween costumes.

131
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.100
Paga notorious RBG and of course weekend update.

132
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.930
You got gins burned,
Kate Mckinnon,
the brilliant tattoos,

133
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.033
tattoos,

134
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.960
but Justice Ginsburg is still after all an 82 year old Jewish grandmother.

135
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.290
This was a reaction to seeing tattoos on his face.

136
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.330
She said,
ah,
this is in my interview with her.
She said,

137
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.410
why would you do that to yourself?

138
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.770
<v 0>It's permanent.
And actually another occasion in which I saw her,
she,</v>

139
00:09:00.771 --> 00:09:03.120
she had just read the book and she said,
you know,

140
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:06.810
there's something I have to tell you.
And I was so worried,
you know,

141
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:10.470
when she has famously high standards,
and she said,
listen,

142
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.090
no one should ever get a tattoo with me.
This has gone too far.

143
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.700
<v 1>So why is it that people of our generation have become so excited about Ruth</v>

144
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.770
Bader Ginsburg?
Almost obsessive.
Was it just a passing meme,

145
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.380
like men's wear dog or lol cats?

146
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.580
<v 0>I love men's wear dog.
Uh,
but I think that this is something,</v>

147
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.400
there's something more going on here than just fun memes.
I think,
uh,

148
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.790
specifically what justice Ginsburg has devoted her life to and what she

149
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:54.041
represents at a moment in which important civil rights laws and the women's

150
00:09:55.821 --> 00:10:00.710
rights gains that she had devoted her career to are on the chopping block at a

151
00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:05.711
point in which there are still too few women in positions of authority and

152
00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:06.794
power.

153
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.920
She is a woman who has devoted her entire career to bringing along other women

154
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.060
and other people who are historically disadvantaged.

155
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.650
She has done so with intellectual integrity,
with grace.

156
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.900
And as we learned from writing this book,

157
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.240
she knows of which she speaks the causes she's devoted her life to have also

158
00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:29.890
inflicted

159
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:30.850
<v 1>her own life.</v>

160
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.540
So obviously Ruth Bader Ginsburg is more than just a hilarious Jewish bubby who,

161
00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:38.380
uh,

162
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.490
talks about getting drunk and on California wine before the state of the Union

163
00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:44.140
address.
Um,

164
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.310
that was the reason she gave for why she fell asleep at the state of the Union.

165
00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:51.580
But we also know that in fact,
she was up all night working before.

166
00:10:51.581 --> 00:10:56.230
She's a famous night owl.
So she often gets about two hours of sleep even,

167
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.560
uh,
even to this day.
And we,
you know,

168
00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:03.670
we have so much to learn from her and we're so in her,
in debt to her.

169
00:11:03.671 --> 00:11:08.671
So we wanted to bring what we learned about her and writing this book to,

170
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.300
to you guys and to everyone who,
who,
who were able to read it.
Um,

171
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.920
first of all,
her life story is absolutely fascinating.

172
00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:21.250
She's gone through so much.
She actually,

173
00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:23.200
her sister died when she was six years old,

174
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.930
so she ended up being an only child after that.

175
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.640
And her mother passed away the day before her high school graduation where she

176
00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:33.730
was scheduled to speak and she ended up not attending as a result,

177
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.520
I'm in law school.

178
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.390
She went to Harvard law with her husband who was a year above her.

179
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.540
She had a one year old child when she started and at in addition to all of that,

180
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.620
she and her husband actually got cancer while they were in law school and she,

181
00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:53.430
we have a photo of them together.
Yup.
And,

182
00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.450
and she actually would type his papers for him and type has notes that were

183
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:02.740
taken by his classmates after doing all of her work.
After,
you know,

184
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:07.180
taking care of him,
of her,
of her child,
Jane.
Um,

185
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.210
so we,
we really couldn't,
you know,
we,

186
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.610
we took inspiration in her work ethic when we were doing this book for sure.

187
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.650
<v 0>Cancer has been something that has an inflected justice Ginsburg's life as you</v>

188
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:18.101
may know.

189
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:23.101
She herself has had cancer twice and yet with the same kind of stamina that she

190
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:29.131
showed while she was a law student and Karen for both her cancer stricken

191
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:33.370
husband and her daughter,
her young daughter at the time,

192
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.250
she has never missed a day on the bench.

193
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.870
<v 1>That actually includes the day after her husband of nearly 60 years passed away</v>

194
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.140
from,
uh,
from cancer in 2010

195
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.610
even while she was at law school just down the road from here.
Um,

196
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.570
<v 0>she,
she,</v>

197
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.420
I think getting to law school was the point in which this very studious,
quiet,

198
00:12:59.421 --> 00:13:04.421
young woman hoped that she could finally be seen as an intellectual person who

199
00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:09.230
had contributions to offer and not just as a girl who would get married,

200
00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:12.770
get pregnant and leave the workforce.
Um,

201
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.680
<v 1>and she did make Lara view.
She was one of two women to make Lara view.
Here.</v>

202
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:19.850
You can see her on the right there.
Um,

203
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.320
they separated the two women in this picture and said that they were the two

204
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:25.060
roses amidst the thorns.

205
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.130
But even at Harvard law school where she had a chance to,

206
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.970
<v 0>to her interests and her dreams.
The first week of law school,</v>

207
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.200
the Dean summoned all of the women to a dinner.

208
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.560
There were nine of them in the class and they all sat around in a circle and she

209
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:50.310
was sitting next to a professor who had written a fundamental text book,

210
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.830
who she described as looking like a god to me.

211
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.120
She couldn't have been more thrilled to be at this dinner and more nervous.

212
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.520
And the Dean Erwin Griswold,

213
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:03.970
who gave himself a lot of credit for having brought women to the Harvard law

214
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:07.540
school,
looked around and said,
now ladies,

215
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.020
<v 2>yeah,</v>

216
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.490
<v 0>each of you has to tell me,</v>

217
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.270
how can you justify taking the place of a man?

218
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.900
And Justice Ginsburg was so flummoxed that she stood up.
Uh,

219
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.670
she had an ashtray.
She was a chain smoker at the time.

220
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.570
She had an ashtray in her lap and the ashes scattered everywhere.

221
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.600
And when she stood up to answer,
she said,

222
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.700
I thought it would be good to know what it is my husband does.

223
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.910
<v 1>Erwin Griswold would later say that that question was not meant to be serious,</v>

224
00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:46.911
that he was actually just trying to prepare the women for what they would face

225
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:50.370
in the workforce or that he was just kidding.
We don't know about that.

226
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.930
There was another woman who answered the question by saying,

227
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.640
what better place to catch a man?
Um,

228
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.810
but that was not actually what justice Ginsberg was there to do.

229
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.860
And what's so interesting about her life is that had she not experienced the

230
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:10.610
kind of discrimination that she did,

231
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:15.200
she might have gone along the path of just becoming a very good lawyer of just

232
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:18.380
becoming a civil procedure professor.
But in fact,

233
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:22.760
because of the ways that she was denied the chance to fulfill her potential,

234
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.180
it put her on the path of fighting for justice.
Uh,

235
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:29.870
on the left is a photo of Justice Ginsburg and her husband when they were

236
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:33.620
stationed in the military base in Oklahoma.
That's when,
uh,

237
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.300
about a year after they got married,

238
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.530
she got pregnant and was working in the civil service while her husband was in

239
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:44.080
the military before law school.
And she,
uh,

240
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.520
placed within a certain ranking as a,
uh,

241
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:53.360
as a civil servant.
But then they found out she was pregnant and they told her,

242
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.940
but you can't travel.
She was only three months pregnant.

243
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.470
So they demoted her and when her pregnancy became more advanced,

244
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:02.570
they made it very clear that it was time for her to go.

245
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.620
She would later go on to bring important cases in which service members and

246
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:11.900
other women were fired from their jobs,

247
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.960
told that they had to get an abortion or quit or just placed on what they called

248
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:22.190
maternity leave,
which was unpaid basically getting kicked out of your job.

249
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.810
But it would be a while until she would get to that point.
Um,

250
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.850
the right is a photo of her while she was a professor at Rutgers,

251
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.420
10 years later she became pregnant again and a happy accident and still not

252
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:40.670
having tenure.
Was afraid to tell her superior is less.

253
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:41.750
She be fired.

254
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.000
That's when she went to her mother-in-law's closet and wore baggy clothing.

255
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.200
This was a job by the way in which she had already been told,
well,

256
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:56.201
we couldn't possibly pay you as much as Mr x because your husband makes a good

257
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:57.494
living.

258
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.980
She would later break a sex discrimination case class action lawsuit with the

259
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:05.780
other women of Rutgers and they won.

260
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.440
And even before she was a professor,

261
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.880
she graduated the top of her class at Columbia law where she was forced to

262
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:17.690
transfer because Harvard law wouldn't give her a degree.
Um,

263
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.930
if she completed her third year at Columbia.

264
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.300
So she graduated from Columbia at the top of her class.

265
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.270
She was at the top of her class at Harvard Law on both law reviews.

266
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.440
And yet still,
she was unable to get a job at any law firm.

267
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.980
And actually a professor of hers at Columbia had to bribe basically a district

268
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:40.160
court judge in New York to take her on as a clerk.
He said,

269
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:43.550
if you don't take on Ms Ruth Ginsburg,

270
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.470
I will never send you another Columbia clerk again.
And that was the stick.

271
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.770
The was that if he didn't like her,

272
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.910
he the professor would be able to send a replacement.
Columbia clerk.
Amen.
Amen.

273
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.840
But let's just say she did all right.

274
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.490
He did not look for a male backup for that role.
Um,

275
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.610
10 years later,
uh,
in the 70s,

276
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:13.611
justice Ginsburg cofounded the ACLU women's rights project where her experiences

277
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.380
with pay discrimination,

278
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:21.381
pregnancy discrimination being denied jobs just because she was a woman we're

279
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:27.480
all brought to bear as she built a series of cases that successfully convinced

280
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:31.230
the supreme court that women were equal under the law.

281
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.850
Something that didn't happen until what the 70s were well underway.

282
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.880
It was perfectly legal to treat women as if their contributions in the economic

283
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:44.130
and political spheres matters less.

284
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.390
She brought cases on behalf of men as well as women,

285
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:53.160
which she received criticism about because it was after all called the women's

286
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:54.150
rights project.

287
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.450
But she knew that in order for there to be true equality and liberty for all

288
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.284
people,

289
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:06.290
that her vision of feminism was that you needed to be free to be you and me.

290
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.930
So that meant bringing cases on behalf of men who wanted to shatter stereotypes

291
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:16.320
by being primary caregivers for their elderly parents and for their children.

292
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.281
In essence,

293
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.510
what we've learned is that justice Ginsburg's version of feminism still has a

294
00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:25.980
lot to teach us today.
Uh,
this is,
by the way,
I mean from the Beyonce voters,

295
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.330
a tumbler.

296
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.920
We think that one reason that justice Ginsburg has struck a chord among young

297
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.140
people and,
uh,

298
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:39.650
had a reason that we're excited to tell people more about her life is because we

299
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:45.330
still have so much unfinished business of gender equality and the principles for

300
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:47.280
which we thought she fought for,

301
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.150
which was she always said it was not just women's liberation,

302
00:19:51.151 --> 00:19:53.190
it's men's and women's liberation.

303
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.120
It also formed the groundwork for her support of LGBT rights if formed the

304
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.830
groundwork of her support for racial justice.

305
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.660
Those are all very much struggles that remain unfinished.
And in fact,

306
00:20:06.661 --> 00:20:11.070
many of the games that she fought for are now being rolled back.

307
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.880
So I think people respond to this sort of righteous passion and something that

308
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:21.660
we really want to convey through the book.

309
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.030
What we really want to,
uh,

310
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.960
tell as a story is how much more there is to her and how deeply committed she

311
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:35.580
remains to the cause of equal citizenship stature.

312
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:41.280
And I think another point is that anyone can be a revolutionary in their own

313
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:45.780
way.
And for Justice Ginsburg that's always been doing the work,

314
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.190
getting angry is a waste of time as she likes to say.
Um,

315
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.480
she wants you to get to work.
Exactly.

316
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.110
So after the notorious RBG meme took off,

317
00:20:58.111 --> 00:21:02.490
I actually got a chance to go to justice Ginsburg's chambers.

318
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.130
Um,
and uh,

319
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.980
for a minute I didn't know if it was going to happen because she actually had a

320
00:21:07.981 --> 00:21:12.840
heart procedure done just a couple of weeks before I was supposed to go there.

321
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.093
And

322
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:14.970
<v 2>okay.</v>

323
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.430
<v 1>She was,
again,
she never missed a day on the bench.</v>

324
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.260
And we went to her chambers and I asked her how,
how she was doing,

325
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.940
if she had a message to send to her,
uh,
to her fans,

326
00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:27.840
to her followers.

327
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.440
And what she told me was that I could tell them that she'd be back doing pushups

328
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.403
within a week.

329
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.643
<v 2>Okay.</v>

330
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.120
<v 1>Anyway,
that's all out of us.
We would love to take your questions.</v>

331
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.830
<v 2>It seems like you're in your house.</v>

332
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.990
<v 1>I think that she enjoys it,
but she's also a,</v>

333
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.660
a not a very outgoing person in,
in,
in real life.

334
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:12.610
I think as she's gotten older,
she's grown into her role as a public figure.

335
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.150
But what's interesting about it is that most of the people that,

336
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.390
that know her well,
that we've talked to in this process,
uh,
are,

337
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.620
are very surprised by her,

338
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.210
her role as this icon at this point.
And it's,
and so as she,
she said,

339
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:31.210
she said to think me and icon at 82,
um,

340
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:34.660
because she sort of the least likely person to,
to,

341
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.280
to want that for herself.

342
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.230
And so I think that's part of the appeal is that it's,

343
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.130
she is this unassuming person.
Um,

344
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.530
but she means so much to so many people that said,

345
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.550
I think she appreciates that because she really wants to engage as many people

346
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:56.200
as possible in the project of the court and the broader issues that she bought

347
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:57.580
for.
So,
um,

348
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.240
one thing that we were surprised to learn when we were putting the book was
that,

349
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:01.750
uh,

350
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.650
throughout the 80s when Justice Ginsburg became a lower court judge and left the

351
00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:06.820
movement,
uh,

352
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:11.821
formally she was repudiated by the feminist of the 80s who said that her focus

353
00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:14.690
on equality was,
uh,

354
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.980
ill thought out because it didn't account for how men and women were

355
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:21.010
fundamentally different.
And this was this,

356
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.140
it was called difference feminism at the time.

357
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:26.110
And the idea was that women's spoke in a different voice and that we needed to

358
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:28.030
celebrate the fundamental differences.

359
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.750
And something that justice Ginsburg has always resisted is thing that men and

360
00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:35.650
women are essentially one way or another.
So I think for now,

361
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:40.060
for her to become the hot young feminist,
so to speak,
must be,

362
00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:42.610
I don't know this,
but I,
I speculate that,

363
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:45.380
that it is kind of a sweet validation for her.

364
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.960
And her clerks also told us,
uh,

365
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.920
that when she's writing and when they're writing on her behalf,

366
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.160
she always instructs them to write for the public and to not,

367
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.320
and to just think about how to engage people who are outside of the courtroom

368
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.480
and whose lives are going to be affected by this.

369
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.120
So I think she's amused and flattered.

370
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:12.950
And ultimately anything that engages people more profoundly with her work,

371
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.990
I believe is something she values.

372
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.640
<v 3>Okay.
Wake up every morning</v>

373
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.380
or

374
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.350
I'm wondering
how much of this is,

375
00:24:47.351 --> 00:24:50.760
for example,
New York

376
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.750
or other differences in background.
Why did they,
uh,

377
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.970
with the pioneers in certain ways,
did they end up with such care for it?

378
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.710
<v 1>So one thing,
so when for example,</v>

379
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:08.890
when Justice Sotomayor was appointed to the court,

380
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.560
she got in some trouble.

381
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.150
There was a controversy about a comment she made that said that a wise Latina

382
00:25:16.151 --> 00:25:19.500
justice would come to a different conclusion then,
uh,

383
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.870
say a white male justice or judge.
Um,

384
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.930
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked about that comment and she was quick to defend

385
00:25:29.441 --> 00:25:33.160
Justice Sotomayor,
then judge Sotomayor.
And she said,
well,

386
00:25:33.161 --> 00:25:38.161
of course your life experiences are very valuable to the decision making

387
00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:42.040
process,
but that doesn't mean that they're better or worse.

388
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.550
It just means that everything that you've experienced,
uh,

389
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.450
goes into the decision making process.
And I think for her,

390
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.460
she valued the differences between her and Sandra Day O'connor because it showed

391
00:25:54.461 --> 00:25:55.810
that women are not all the same,

392
00:25:55.811 --> 00:26:00.250
that women can have different opinions and yet it's important for women to be in

393
00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:02.320
the room.
One of the most,
you know,

394
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:03.310
<v 3>okay.</v>

395
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.030
<v 1>Upsetting things for her was when she was the only woman on the bench after</v>

396
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:11.230
justice O'Connor retired and was replaced by Samuel Alito.

397
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.900
Um,
I,

398
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.090
I do think it's really interesting to think about the differences between them.

399
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:16.991
Um,
you know,

400
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:20.860
Linda Hirshman who were doing an event with this week has a great book out that

401
00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:24.760
is a dual biography of justice O'Connor and Justice Ginsburg,
uh,

402
00:26:24.761 --> 00:26:28.180
that we like and appreciate also because it has a chapter in it called notorious

403
00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:31.060
RBG.
Uh,
and,
and Linda argues,

404
00:26:31.061 --> 00:26:34.560
I think that a lot of it had to do with specifically,
um,

405
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:39.040
the fact that justice O'Connor grew up as it frontiers woman in this kind of,

406
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:44.100
uh,
self-reliant mythology of the West,
uh,

407
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.130
<v 0>justice Ginsburg very much corrupt within a tradition of American Jews that was</v>

408
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:54.290
horrified by McCarthyism in particular while she was a student at Cornell.

409
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:58.890
There were teachers and other members of the community were blacklisted.

410
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.670
So I think that that gave her a deep appreciation for civil liberties.

411
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.650
The feminism part came later,

412
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:08.970
but actually what first drew her to the law was the,
uh,

413
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:14.210
censorship and oppression that was happening within the United States.

414
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.110
And it haunted her in particular because,
uh,

415
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.760
her understanding of World War II,
uh,

416
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:27.850
when she was born in 1933 was that was that it had been a war against racism.

417
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.000
And then she learned that the troops had been segregated and then she saw

418
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:34.080
McCarthyism.

419
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.260
So I think that shaped her profoundly in addition to all of the gender to,

420
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.480
uh,

421
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.480
experiences that she would have as she grew up and gave her a real strong

422
00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:46.200
appreciation for civil liberties.

423
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.471
<v 1>Oh,</v>

424
00:27:48.471 --> 00:27:52.430
what's your advice for young people or any person for that matter who don't work

425
00:27:52.431 --> 00:27:56.750
in the legal system that could have an impact or voice when it comes to

426
00:27:56.751 --> 00:27:59.360
upholding things that we don't want to see go away?

427
00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:02.330
Like exactly what you're talking about in this,
at the start of the talk?

428
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.070
<v 0>Well,
I think,
I mean,
from where I'm sitting as a reporter on,</v>

429
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:12.610
I'm focusing a lot on the battle of reproductive rights.
Um,

430
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.660
that is something,
you know,
it's not happening in Massachusetts so much,
but that,

431
00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:20.310
that is something that justice Ginsburg has talked a lot about in terms of her

432
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:23.530
worry.
Um,
and I think,
I think honestly,
if in,

433
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.010
in places where it's not such a dire issue,

434
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:29.040
lending support to places where it is a dire issue,

435
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:32.540
if that is something that you support,
uh,
you know,
uh,

436
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:37.500
justice Ginsberg often talks about how the law is not the engine of social

437
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:38.070
change.

438
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.390
It's social movements and it's people making change through the legislature and

439
00:28:42.391 --> 00:28:44.720
through movements.
Um,
and so I think,

440
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.300
I think getting engaged in that process is probably something that she would

441
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:52.140
recommend.
A,
she always says fight for the things you care about,

442
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:55.830
but do so in a way that would lead others to join you.
Um,

443
00:28:55.831 --> 00:29:00.090
so I think she wants to see people move beyond,
excuse me,

444
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.200
move beyond that initial anger and channel it towards something productive.

445
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.680
Um,
and of course I would,
I would say,
you know,

446
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.970
within your own sphere is here.
I mean,
uh,
you know,

447
00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:15.900
I saw a lot of awesome things that Google diversity,
of course,
we know that,
that,

448
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.830
uh,

449
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.160
that women are still underrepresented in many of these fields and something that

450
00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:23.340
she's really committed her life to,
um,
is,

451
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.870
is busting stereotypes.
You know,
the opinion,

452
00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:32.190
the majority opinion that she's proudest of is the United States versus Virginia

453
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.080
where she allowed,
uh,

454
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.200
she wrote the opinion that forced the Virginia Military Academy to go coed and

455
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:43.240
Shi Shi.
People would say to her like,
oh,
like who would,

456
00:29:43.241 --> 00:29:46.150
what woman would want to go to Vmi?
And she said,
you know,

457
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.320
there are women who want to go.

458
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:51.400
All that matters is that getting in is not on the basis of your gender.

459
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.580
So I think she would probably encourage people to continue the good work that's

460
00:29:56.591 --> 00:29:57.940
being done,
uh,

461
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.990
to get more women and people of color in the stem fields since we are a Google.

462
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.913
Yeah.

463
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.970
<v 1>I was going to ask something similar about what does she consider like her most</v>

464
00:30:07.971 --> 00:30:09.050
proud case,

465
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.670
which you just mentioned or what she considers me be the most important case

466
00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.520
she's worked on or something similar about it.
Another favorite of hers.
Yeah.

467
00:30:17.521 --> 00:30:17.671
Well,

468
00:30:17.671 --> 00:30:22.410
so United States were v Virginia is one of her favorites because it allowed her

469
00:30:22.411 --> 00:30:26.400
to actually cite a number of the cases that she argued before the Supreme Court.

470
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.520
It was really the culmination of her own legal strategy at the ACLU applying

471
00:30:32.311 --> 00:30:35.130
equal protection to gender discrimination.

472
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.340
So that was obviously something that she was really proud of.
Um,

473
00:30:38.341 --> 00:30:43.080
another case that she always mentions is lily led better case,

474
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.700
um,
which was a case about,
uh,
the,
the equal about equal pay.

475
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.310
And in particular,
she was in the dissent.
In that case,

476
00:30:50.311 --> 00:30:55.311
she wrote the dissenting opinion and she basically called out Congress and said,

477
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:58.590
you know,
fix this.
The court has got it wrong here.

478
00:30:58.591 --> 00:31:03.150
We need you congress to do something about it.
Luckily at that time for her,

479
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.910
there was a democratic congress and a Democratic president.

480
00:31:05.911 --> 00:31:10.140
So they actually were able to pass the Lilly Ledbetter fair pay act.

481
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:14.370
And in her chambers she has a picture of the signing of that act.

482
00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:19.020
And to her beyond the,
the substance of that case itself,

483
00:31:19.021 --> 00:31:23.260
the fact that it's about equal pay and how obviously important that is,
um,

484
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.610
in her career and her life.
Um,

485
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.060
it also exhibits something that she really cares about,
which is the,

486
00:31:29.061 --> 00:31:31.370
the value of the institutions and,
and,

487
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.290
and the interplay between those branches of government,

488
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.760
the Supreme Court actually speaking to Congress and Congress responding.

489
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.930
And I think,
you know,
when Arin aster and Erin's interview with her,
um,

490
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.160
what she thinks about the current congress,
she,

491
00:31:47.161 --> 00:31:52.161
she is not so optimistic about the current Congress's ability to do that sort of

492
00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:54.360
thing to,
to get things done.

493
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:59.180
<v 0>And I think as a litigator,
um,
her favorite cases,
she,</v>

494
00:31:59.181 --> 00:32:02.270
I think there were two favorite cases that I think are worth talking about.

495
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.290
And one was,
um,

496
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:09.680
the kiss that she thought would guarantee the right to reproductive freedom

497
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.940
before Roe v Wade and it,
for her,
it's the case that got away.

498
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.560
So Susan's struck was an air force nurse.

499
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.910
She became pregnant while on active duty.
At that point,

500
00:32:22.911 --> 00:32:24.830
the rule was you have to choose,

501
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.860
you either have to have an abortion or you have to leave.

502
00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.670
And this is pretty remarkable because abortion was still illegal throughout the

503
00:32:31.671 --> 00:32:32.481
United States,

504
00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:37.220
but the army was actually requiring female service members to have abortions if

505
00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:38.960
they wanted to stay in their jobs.

506
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.610
So Justice Ginsburg represented Susan's strack and a brief to the supreme court.

507
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:48.500
The Supreme Court took the case and her argument was that it violates a woman's

508
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:53.150
equal protection under the law to say that she has to,

509
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.630
uh,
treat her pregnancy in a particular way or another.

510
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.210
If she can take disability leave,

511
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.740
she should be treated just like a man who needs disability leave and only women

512
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:07.070
are punished for having sex.
That was sort of the bottom line of,

513
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.100
of her argument and she hoped that by bringing a case of a woman who didn't want

514
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:15.380
to have an abortion,
just like the male cases that she brought a,

515
00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:17.900
that we're also about vindicating women's rights,

516
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.730
that she would be able to lay the groundwork that would eventually lead to the

517
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:27.350
full range of reproductive options.
Um,
but Erwin Griswold,

518
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:32.351
the same dean who had demanded of her that she justify her presence happened to

519
00:33:32.991 --> 00:33:34.340
be the solicitor general,

520
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:39.341
the top lawyer for the United States of America and went to the military and

521
00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:44.420
send,
you got to change this policy cause I'm going to lose this case.
Yeah.

522
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:47.690
This guy pops up again again in her life.

523
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:51.110
We also have this very mansplaining letter that we quote in the book from him

524
00:33:51.111 --> 00:33:55.610
where he starts to worry roughly in 1978 that white men aren't going to be able

525
00:33:55.611 --> 00:33:58.320
to get into Harvard law school anymore.
Uh,

526
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.330
she assures him that there will always be a place of w for white men with merit.

527
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.340
So the struck case ended up being mooted.
Um,

528
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.600
and as a result in that same term,
Ruby Wade was decided.

529
00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:16.430
So Justice Ginsburg was sort of bemoans Roe v Wade because she feels it went too

530
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:19.130
far too fast.
Even though she liked the outcome,

531
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:22.580
she thought that something grounded in women's equality would be better.

532
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.260
And the other case that she loves her favorite client who she stayed in touch

533
00:34:27.261 --> 00:34:29.120
with for years,
uh,

534
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:33.470
started with a letter to the editor and it was a man who had recently lost his

535
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.060
wife.
She had died in childbirth,

536
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:40.061
but the child survived and he wanted to be the primary caregiver for his son,

537
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.120
but he could not get the same,

538
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.030
we don't wear a benefits that a widow could get.

539
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.400
And the letter says,
I wonder if Gloria Steinem knows about this.

540
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.680
This is 1976 and a quarter said and did in fact,

541
00:34:57.681 --> 00:34:59.900
I think know about it.
And Justice Ginsburg.

542
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.670
Then the head of the Aclu Women's rights project soon learned about it and

543
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:07.340
brought his case all the way up to the supreme court,

544
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.580
arguing that it violated his rights,

545
00:35:10.581 --> 00:35:13.830
his dead wife's rights as a breadwinner,
uh,

546
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.860
and the rights of the child to equal protection under the law and the justices

547
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:20.720
at the time,

548
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.890
all men had trouble even believing that a man would want to care for their
child.

549
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:28.970
Like they were like,
if this case from real,
are you serious?
Who was this guy?
Uh,

550
00:35:28.971 --> 00:35:29.570
but she,

551
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:34.570
she won and she stayed in touch with Steven wives and felt for years and many

552
00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:40.910
years later she performed his son's wedding.
Great.
Well,
thank you guys so much.

553
00:35:40.911 --> 00:35:41.750
So much for coming.

554
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:42.560
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
