00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.050
Patty and I,
my coauthor and I were,
were struck,

2
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:11.840
we had written one book before called womenomics,

3
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.690
which was essentially a look at women in the workplace.

4
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:18.290
And I hope a lot of you know this data because it's really compelling,

5
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:21.920
but there's all this data about the more women there are at the top of
companies,

6
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.160
the more money a company makes.
And just really,

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.290
really interesting case for diversity that's not based on doing things because

8
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.030
it's right.
It's really just because it makes business sense.

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.800
So that's what we were writing about.

10
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.640
But we were doing all these interviews with women who were incredibly
successful,

11
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:41.600
probably like a lot of you in this room and we and certainly looked successful

12
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.480
to us and confident and they would say things too.
It's like,
well,

13
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:48.260
I'm about to get a promotion but I don't think I'm qualified or my bosses want

14
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:51.650
me to try this.
I don't know that I'm ready and it,

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.530
or even talk about feeling like an imposter,

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.420
which was something we all are familiar with.

17
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:59.240
But we were so struck by that because we,

18
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:04.241
I think Katee and I both have felt frequently that we're not confident or

19
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:07.880
failures or [inaudible] but we thought what about this is crazy,

20
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:11.820
these women are so successful.
And so we started digging into that,
um,

21
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.680
to see whether there was data behind it and essentially we found there is a lot

22
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:20.450
of data to support the notion that there's a confidence gap between men and

23
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:22.010
women,
especially at work.
Right?

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.040
Not as much in our social lives or in our family lives or lives with friends.

25
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.750
And we started to try to look at why that is.
I mean,
one of the,
um,

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.440
one of the best pieces of data that I like is this corporate poll that was done.

27
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.690
The showed that women will apply for a job or a promotion when we feel we have,

28
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:47.990
what percentage would you imagine of the qualifications?

29
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.990
Yeah,
100.

30
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:55.850
I heard 100 and I don't think 110 was an option because definitely we would want

31
00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:00.851
110 and men will take the risk at about 60% and of course that,

32
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.430
uh,
what we found over time is that attitude.

33
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:07.070
It's not just about applying for jobs or permissions,
it's about,

34
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.250
is this report ready?
Am I going to participate in this meeting?

35
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:11.960
Am I going to do this?
Am I going to do that?

36
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.900
And women are constantly judging themselves,

37
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.170
not quite ready or not quite prepared.
And in fact,

38
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:21.620
men tend to swing the opposite way.
It's so interesting.

39
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:25.370
Columbia University has studied this proclivity on the part of men too,

40
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.380
to kind of,
um,
be overconfident or overconfident about their performance,
right?

41
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.500
And taking a test,
let's say,
and they found on average,

42
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:38.030
men are overconfident or overestimate their abilities by about 30%.

43
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.230
But what's interesting about that too,
as they call that honest overconfidence,

44
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:45.830
right?
So it's not,
I think for a lot of years I thought that's just bravado,

45
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.490
right?
These men are just faking it.
They can't fit.
They're not faking it.
Right?

46
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.220
They really do have that.
I see that with my son.

47
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.760
They have that ability to assess themselves differently.

48
00:02:55.761 --> 00:03:00.761
And I think what we ultimately found is that that at work confidence actually

49
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.240
matters in terms of success.

50
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.750
There's a professor who's been studying this out at Berkeley,

51
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.110
confidence versus competence and he's found that in many cases confidence trumps

52
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.840
competence in terms of being valuable for traditional success,

53
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.380
which we found sort of appalling.
But um,

54
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.150
but we realize this is a skill women need to build.
That's absolute,

55
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.560
I think a lot of us can relate to that.

56
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.010
And we've actually done some internal studies here and um,
one of the things,

57
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:35.980
I think maybe you even wrote about this,
about this project where,

58
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.990
and some of you might be familiar with this at Google,

59
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:40.000
where women had to put there,

60
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.090
women weren't putting themselves forward for promotions and our engineering

61
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:47.440
teams.
And so somebody recognized that women weren't getting promoted.

62
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:51.640
So they started to send out emails to say,
you know,
you put yourself forward.

63
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:55.210
And once the women were getting nudged to,
okay,
I'm going to try.

64
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:58.180
Then they recognize that they could put themselves forward and the numbers shot

65
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.610
up,
but they weren't seeing women put themselves forward.

66
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.520
I think we've come a long way since that original study.
But I thought that,

67
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:06.850
I think we've really talked about that.
You know what I think I,
I've Kinda ever,

68
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:09.820
if we put it in our book or,
yeah,
we're certainly,
I talk about that a lot,

69
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.340
but I think it's,
I think a lot of us can relate to that.

70
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.620
So as you started to look into that,
then you wrote the confidence code.
Um,

71
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.450
and then do you want to just talk a little bit about how that evolved and

72
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:23.860
thinking about people coming up to you about their children and with,
so we,
um,

73
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.480
we wrote the confidence code,

74
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.250
which really seemed to strike a chord with a lot of women.
And,

75
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:31.090
and the other thing I will say about confidence,

76
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.600
just so we all understand the formula,
because in the,
in the book for adults,

77
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:38.920
we got a little obsessive about the science,
the biology,
the May,
you know,

78
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.000
where does it come from?

79
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.240
How do we get it to men have a confidence gene that women don't have.
You know,

80
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:48.241
we were sort of all of these questions about origin questions and men don't in

81
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:53.050
fact have a confidence g and that we don't have,
which is nice to know.
Uh,
but,

82
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.790
but,
but confidence is partly genetic,
which we thought was really weird.
Uh,

83
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:02.160
and we tested our genes for the genes they know about now to see whether,
uh,

84
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.910
you know,
we had them,
we don't,

85
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.890
Katee and I are both basket cases in terms of confidence jeans,
but,

86
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.170
um,
but it's only partly genetic,
right?

87
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:16.171
And the bulk of our confidence we build throughout the course of our lives.

88
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:18.670
And this is so important for women,
right?

89
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:23.671
So confidence isn't about feeling good or feeling that were valuable or how we

90
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.530
feel about ourselves.
Confidence heavily involves action.

91
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.600
So confidence is what turns our thoughts into action and what we,

92
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.570
and that's important because I think we often get stuck in the thought,

93
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.020
the thinking part of that.
And we say,
oh no,

94
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.510
I'm gonna think can overthink that and not act.

95
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.750
But what we also found is the creation of competence.

96
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.250
It's really a virtuous circle.

97
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:53.251
You build more confidence when you take that risk and you act and maybe you

98
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.950
fail,
maybe you struggle,
maybe you work through the process,

99
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.520
but you master something.
That's the way you build more confidence.

100
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.340
So when women don't act,

101
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.910
they're not stockpiling more confidence.
Right?
So that,

102
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.640
that we thought was pretty critical.
And what we,

103
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.600
we realized this happening with girls is,
um,

104
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.900
and we got pretty obsessed also with girls and young women cause we're like,

105
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.570
Gosh,
they excel at school.

106
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.860
They just beat the pants off boys right now at school rate.

107
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:28.610
It's really people who are worried about education thing or worry more about

108
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:30.770
boys than girls.
So like how does that,

109
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:35.390
why or why are young women still not confident?
Um,

110
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.610
and what we realized is happening,

111
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:41.150
and Carol Dweck who wrote the great book mindset people might hear,

112
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.550
might be familiar with that explained to us that it just,

113
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.020
if life were one long grade school,
girls would rule the world,
right?
But,

114
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.250
but it's not.

115
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.260
And the standards change appreciably once we're out in the real world.

116
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.940
And so what happens with girls is we become perfectionists,
right?

117
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:03.941
We are so good early on because of the different ways our brains works are

118
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:07.580
higher Eeq at pleasing people,
coloring within the lines,

119
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.260
getting everything right,
doing everything.

120
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.080
And parents and teachers encourage that.

121
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.170
And by the time girls are in high school and middle school today,

122
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:19.970
I mean it's worse than ever.
I mean full blown people pleasing,
perfectionist.

123
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.020
And if you're a perfectionist,
what do you not want to do?

124
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.750
But that's way too scary to take risks.
If you're a perfectionist,
right?

125
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.090
You want to stay in your lane,
do what you're already good at.

126
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.100
And so boys still from an early age,

127
00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:38.810
and forgive me because you'll see that this is a positive as I'm talking about

128
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.930
you men in the room.
I mean,
they fail all over the place,

129
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:43.640
typically from an early age,
right?

130
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:48.641
They just do it more naturally and they learn it doesn't matter that much.

131
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.070
Right?
Which is a powerful lesson to learn.

132
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.780
Girls aren't really learning that as much.

133
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:58.781
And then you hit the workplace and that's what you need to be able to do is take

134
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.590
risks and fail.
It's almost as though somebody changed,
you know,

135
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.330
we educate girls in this system and then it's like,
oh,
and by the way,

136
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:09.920
we're going to require something completely different of you right now.
So we,

137
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:14.420
and,
and what we found in some of a little bit of the data we had was that,
um,

138
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.430
the,
the drop for confidence for girls seems to happen about puberty.

139
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.110
And between that and then what we would hear from parents who were talking to us

140
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:27.890
a lot as we would give speeches about,
you know,
yeah,
this is all great for me,

141
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:30.560
but what can I do for my daughter?
You know,
I see this is crazy.

142
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:32.390
What's going on with my daughter?
Uh,

143
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.800
we just thought we wanted to dive in and really take a harder look at what's

144
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:41.750
happening with girls and see if we could just help a bit.

145
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.290
And are there some practical things and all of us can think about who first of

146
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:45.500
all,

147
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.240
who are parents and how we conduct ourselves at home and how we react to things

148
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:54.710
that happen in our own lives.
You have some tips on that?
Yes.
So if you've,

149
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.853
um,

150
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.840
so if you think about what you most want your daughters to do and it's hard to

151
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:03.380
do because our,
remember,
I mean the,
the,

152
00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:07.530
all of this pressure about school and grades and you know,
it's all out there,

153
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:07.830
right?

154
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.830
But you do want your kids to build resilience and confidence while they're still

155
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:15.570
at home with you.

156
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.490
And that necessarily involves struggle and failure.

157
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.060
So I think the heart,
the most important thing,
and it's,

158
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:27.720
it's actually kind of liberating as a parent because you can suddenly say,

159
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.620
Oh,
is your child is striking out the fifth time in a row at Bat?

160
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:35.220
Or whatever it is.
And you think,
oh my God,
this is horrible.
This is,

161
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:39.060
and you have realized,
actually,
if I can help him through this,

162
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.530
this is going to be a great life experience.
So I would say that the,

163
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.690
the overarching tip is look for ways you can encourage your daughters to step

164
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:53.040
outside of their comfort zones and do things they're really not good at and get

165
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:56.670
comfortable being uncomfortable.
And that's going to be different for every girl,

166
00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.570
right?
I mean,
my daughters loves athletics.
She's a tomboy.

167
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.330
I thought when we started working on this,
I thought,
oh well that won't be,

168
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.810
della shall be immune to this stuff because she's kind of sporty.

169
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.560
She's still a perfectionist and I'm never going to try out for the debate team.

170
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:16.680
I'm too scared or I don't want to stand on the stage to do this.
And you know,

171
00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:21.030
it's just so you'll have to look for opportunities where you can say,

172
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.110
try it.
The result doesn't matter.
Really kind of give,
you know,

173
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:26.970
make them feel they have a safe environment.

174
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:31.050
But look for areas where they might be able to do things where failure's okay

175
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:33.300
and they see that they can work through it.

176
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.390
And do you think about how you might react to things that happen in your work

177
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:41.040
day and talk about that?
Well,
so I think for mothers,

178
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:45.210
especially,
the most important thing we can do is be good role models.
And I mean,

179
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.220
especially for all of you,
cause it's too late for me.

180
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:50.220
I screwed up and it's like all over,

181
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.890
but please,
it's not too late for you.
Um,
but it,

182
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.053
when you,

183
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:02.300
we want a model that we struggle too and that we have failures and we have

184
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:07.050
things that are hard to deal with and have those discussions with them and say,

185
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.650
you know,
oh my editor who's here.
Oh,

186
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.400
I remember distinctly talking to Dell at one point saying,
oh,

187
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:17.610
I got notes back from my editor.
I'm not going to want to go through them.

188
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.260
There are things she does not like or you know,

189
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.360
I'm going to have to really deal with this.

190
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:24.930
And then at night sort of having her listen and talk through well,

191
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.220
but that's okay.
I think overall she likes the book and,
um,

192
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.350
some of these changes are going to make sense.

193
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.940
And I kind of opened them up to some of that stuff that we deal with.

194
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:37.950
That's hard.
I mean,
we sort of don't,

195
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.710
it's not our natural inclination to want to do that,

196
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:45.180
but if they see that their parent is trying all the time to be perfect and that,

197
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.380
then that's really not,
um,
that's not great role modeling for them.

198
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:51.960
And I would also say with,
so we did a lot of,
um,

199
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.010
polling for this book because there we wanted more data and we did find in fact

200
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:01.600
that,
um,
girls experience between the ages of eight and 14,

201
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:06.040
a 30% drop in confidence,
right?
That really big up until age eight,

202
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:09.960
it's girls and boys have the same confidence measures.
But the,

203
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.200
the other thing we found is that fathers are better at recognizing a lack of

204
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:16.630
confidence in their daughters than mothers are.

205
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.950
So I think dads can actually play a really important role because it does,

206
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.190
this behavior does look so weird to them typically.
Right?
It's like,

207
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.700
what do you mean you're scared to do this?
It just doesn't make sense.

208
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:30.730
Whereas I think we don't like it,
but we also,

209
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.010
there's part of us that understands it.
Oh yeah.

210
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:36.220
I know why you wouldn't want to get up on stage.
Totally.
You know,

211
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:40.300
or just so I think fathers can,
um,
that's a good can do a lot too.

212
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:45.280
And then you also looked at social media.
Yes,
we did look at social media.
Um,

213
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.830
you know,
look,
we,

214
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.280
we tried to be realistic about it because kids kind of live on social media

215
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:54.220
right now and for girls.
Um,

216
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.230
I'm going to take a step back and say the other thing that happens besides a

217
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:02.560
confidence dropped for girls,
and this is related,
is that at puberty,

218
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:07.561
this instinct to ruminate or overthink kicks in.

219
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.070
And that is something that we all really probably experiences women where you,

220
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:17.071
you get that review and you think about the one area of improvement and not the

221
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:21.610
rest of it,
which was great for two weeks straight.
And you're years or years,

222
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:24.160
maybe years,
as Jen pointed out,

223
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:27.790
she still remembers that trip to that failure in Moscow.

224
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:31.530
It's like we're right there center.
Um,

225
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.240
but this starts for girls at puberty.

226
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:36.780
And I really was struck by that because I thought,
oh my gosh,
they have no,

227
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.630
like what must that feel like?
What your brain is being hijacked,
right?

228
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:44.080
And you don't really understand what's happening and why you can't stop thinking

229
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:45.310
about something.
Well,

230
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:49.240
what social media does the psychologist talk to us about for girls is it just

231
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.090
exacerbates that,
right?
So it's like ruminating on steroids,
right?
You,

232
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.110
you 1520 years ago you might've been able to go home,

233
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.110
have a fight,
have a fight with a friend,
get a bad grade,
or whatever it is,

234
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.460
and you're forced to put that aside at least for a couple hours or overnight.

235
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:09.700
That just doesn't happen anymore.
It just keeps going and going in.

236
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:13.630
It's amplified.
So we,

237
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.230
our goal in the book is to help girls understand that,

238
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:21.760
understand that there are ways you can put it down that are realistic,

239
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:24.700
not just never use social media,
right?

240
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:27.970
Because it's just not something that's going to happen.

241
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.070
But I think also just as importantly,
how do you use it in a positive way?

242
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.900
Because there are really powerful ways for girls to use it right at this age.

243
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:41.290
There's this desire to connect to find people who are like them.

244
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.310
Girls are very open at that age too.
Um,
you know,

245
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:50.320
inspirational advice,
uh,
inspirational,
saying,

246
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:54.650
seeing role models,
people they really admire and how they think about things.

247
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:59.651
So I think we tried to offer a lot of suggestions about how they can find their

248
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:04.280
tribe that way and really focus on that in a positive way.

249
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.140
And you did a campaign with Instagram.
We did.

250
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:10.670
We did a great campaign with Instagram called,
um,
now I'm going to blank.

251
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:15.330
I can't believe we did an amazing campaign with Instagram,
which was true,

252
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.390
which was girls showing there.

253
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:22.190
Basically it was how do you basically showing your confidence,

254
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:24.680
capture confidence,
but,
um,

255
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.630
show yourself doing something that makes you feel confident.
Don't show yourself,

256
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.033
um,

257
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.990
looking photo shopped or perfect or having the perfect life or something where

258
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:39.800
you're going to get a million likes.
Show yourself doing something right.

259
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:43.460
So we have a big focus on action in the book,
but that makes you feel confident.

260
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:47.630
And we just had a bunch of incredible girls who helped us with that,

261
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:48.960
who are very,
um,

262
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.030
out of the box girls and we had a great reaction to it.

263
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.110
I'm curious,
um,
the timing of this book,
um,
oops.

264
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.500
I think with the me too movement,

265
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.710
I'm just curious if you have thoughts sort of on this whole good girl.

266
00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:07.700
Don't rock the boat the way a lot of us were raised and in light of what we're

267
00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:11.030
seeing with me too,
which you thought about that.
Yes,
we will.
We were,

268
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.950
me too was exploding as we were finishing the book again is our editor here will

269
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:17.480
remember and we,

270
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.670
we thought about how do we talk about this for eight to 12 year old girls,

271
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.830
right?
Because it's not straight forward,
but,

272
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.050
but it is true that I think what we realized is if girl girls are absolutely

273
00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:34.850
essential to creating a speak up culture.
And I think one of the biggest risks,

274
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.600
right?
If we all agree that confidence involves taking some risks,

275
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.840
one of the biggest risks for them is speaking up in a way that might mean people

276
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:48.980
don't like them or they're not pleasing the person they want to please.

277
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.820
And so we,
um,
we created a manifesto in the book,

278
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:56.300
which really has to do with,
um,
my favorite part of it.

279
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:01.280
There are three or four bullet points is it's not my job to please people.

280
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.960
And I think for girls to understand that is not their primary function,
right?

281
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:10.580
To constantly be the person who's going to be liked or that adults are going to

282
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:15.260
think is wonder.
You know,
they need to learn a little bit of um,

283
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.950
uh,
bravery on that front if you will.
And I think once they,

284
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.680
once they feel confident about speaking up,
uh,

285
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.610
I think that will be a big boost for the next generation in the workplace.
We,

286
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:32.870
oh yeah.
Well we definitely want to take questions.
So there's there,

287
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:34.820
if you guys could nine apples,

288
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.860
it will require confidence to then move to the mic and ask that question.

289
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.850
So do you have any other tips in the book that you,

290
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.210
that come to mind about language or,
I also a social media,

291
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.450
just the whole idea of just put down the phone for a little while.

292
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.630
He's like that.
I think that just seems too obvious.

293
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:57.450
Sort of have the off 24 hour rule,
right?

294
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:59.430
Which is the cool off rule we have that kind of,

295
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.670
you can write something but don't send it right away.

296
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.410
Wait a day before you send it,
which I still need to actually employ sometimes.

297
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.240
Um,
I think,
you know,

298
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:13.910
one of my favorite rules really is to,
uh,
we,

299
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.550
we call it,
I guess we,

300
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.180
it's not released get out of your comfort zone.
I guess it's,

301
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.130
it's really the rule of,
um,
almost taking it,
giving yourself a timeout,

302
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.600
which is when you have something scary happened to you or you've are processing

303
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:32.870
a failure and you're starting to ruminate and everything.

304
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.720
And this is the same for adults as well as kids.

305
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.530
You have to get your brain away from that for a little bit.
Right?

306
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:45.400
You literally can't process anything when your fear center or you're a Mig.

307
00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:48.420
Dilla is on high alert.

308
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.380
So we talk about changing the channel and essentially that means,
you know,

309
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.290
watch a TV show,
take a run,
eat some ice cream,

310
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:58.500
kind of let yourself get to a different place,

311
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:02.580
read a book and then you can get back in and look at things.

312
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:05.400
But I think especially for girls to understand,

313
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.080
I have some control over what's happening inside and here's how,

314
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:11.180
so we have kind of a,

315
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.230
a series of steps like that that I think will be clear for parents too.

316
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.260
Yes.
I was curious to know,
you were talking about like some data,

317
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.530
some data and pulling that you had done.

318
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:27.060
I was wondering if there was a difference in communities of color because there

319
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:29.160
has to be some disparities when,

320
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.460
especially with parents not thinking they're afforded the privilege of,
you know,

321
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.060
making sure that their kids make mistakes that often.

322
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.640
I was just curious to see what that looked like.
You know,
we did,
um,

323
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.260
in the polling we did with girls,
we didn't,

324
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.620
we did not see a big breakdown in terms of race or ethnicity in terms of girls

325
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.180
confidence in the polling.
We did,
we did,
uh,
uh,

326
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.040
confidence pole or a confidence quiz after our adult book came out where we

327
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.260
women went online and a lot of women went online and took this quiz.
And,
um,

328
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.090
we found that African American women were more confident generally than white

329
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:12.300
women who are more confident than Asian women.
Right?

330
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:17.301
Who that but are the professors who helped us with this and to pursue that and

331
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.350
kind of dig into why that is.

332
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.100
We'd need a larger sample size and we'd want to do additional polling,

333
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:26.400
which we didn't do.
But I do think there's,
um,

334
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.820
there's no question that if you look at,
um,

335
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.480
all of the data on something called stereotype threat,
right?

336
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.290
When you are,
when you feel different.

337
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.590
So like you're one of the only women on a board.

338
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.330
You're one of the only women at a meeting.
You're,

339
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:45.240
what are the only African American women in a me,
you know,

340
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.430
that there are degrees of different might feel that really does affect your

341
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:52.660
confidence and your performance.

342
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:57.661
So I think the more things you have in your life that make you feel other from a

343
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:03.600
larger population,
it's,
it is a real,
and,

344
00:21:03.601 --> 00:21:07.570
and I think it's important for girls and women to understand that,
you know,
it's,

345
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:12.490
um,
it really does have an effect,
right?
So it's not all you,
right.

346
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:14.890
It's partly the society.

347
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.080
And I think understanding that also allows all of us to give ourselves a break

348
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:24.280
to some extent.
But,
um,
we have a lot in the book on,

349
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.140
uh,
you know,
girls who feel different for a variety of reasons,

350
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:31.840
whether it's race,
whether it's their religion,

351
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.050
whether it's being transgender or whether it's,
you know,
and so we,

352
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.420
because that you're absolutely right.
I think that's,

353
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.000
that's an extra burden to try and to be fully confident and it's,

354
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.300
it's riskier and a lot of ways.
Yes.

355
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.210
<v 2>Hi.
Um,
I have a one year old daughter,
rose and rose has two daddies.</v>

356
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.020
And,
uh,
you mentioned that fathers have an important role to play and kind of

357
00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.170
recognizing a lack of confidence situation.
Um,

358
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.130
but I also heard you say that mother is kind of maybe have more empathy or more

359
00:22:01.131 --> 00:22:03.500
understanding of how a girl might feel.

360
00:22:03.501 --> 00:22:07.400
And I was wondering other than surrounding her with strong female role models,

361
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:07.850
um,

362
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:12.850
do you have any tips or anecdotes about ways to essentially bridge that empathy

363
00:22:13.251 --> 00:22:14.084
gap?

364
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.750
<v 1>No.
And I should say,
and I usually say this at the beginning of every speech,</v>

365
00:22:18.751 --> 00:22:22.740
like so we are all on a spectrum,
right?

366
00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:26.610
So not every woman is going to be more empathetic.

367
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:30.810
Not every man is going to be more narrow focus.
Not every one was.

368
00:22:30.811 --> 00:22:35.500
So when I talk in generalities,
because generally speaking,

369
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:39.720
most things are often true,
but it doesn't mean that men or can it be empathetic.

370
00:22:39.721 --> 00:22:43.980
I mean there's really interesting data also that shows that men who,

371
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.233
um,

372
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.300
men who are the primary caregivers and spend an enormous amount of time around

373
00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:55.521
their children actually do experience hormonal changes and really did a real

374
00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:59.130
difference in sort of the e Q factor.

375
00:22:59.131 --> 00:23:03.360
So I think a lot of it probably has to do with proximity to some extent.

376
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.470
Um,
but I don't think,
uh,

377
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:11.500
I think that chess helping girls understand that they can be heard is important.

378
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.930
And,
and I think again,
you're right about the role models.

379
00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:23.280
Let them see people who are like them.
Um,

380
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.970
but not so,
you know,
one psychologist said to us,

381
00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:28.770
and this is why we in the book,

382
00:23:28.771 --> 00:23:32.700
we have some real girls at the end of each chapter who've done some amazing

383
00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:33.091
things,

384
00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:38.091
but we specifically chose not to focus on a lot of girls like say Malala or you

385
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:42.540
know,
girls who are just extraordinary,
right?

386
00:23:42.541 --> 00:23:47.480
But who probably are going to seem far away from what most girls the way they

387
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:48.410
might think about themselves.

388
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:52.550
So I think trying to find role models who are accessible for them and who've

389
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:56.660
done things that are
similar,
but,

390
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.480
but it just seems within reach somehow.
But I don't,
I,

391
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.320
my sense is you're not going to have,
you know,

392
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:04.820
if you're paying attention to your daughter,

393
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:07.970
I don't think you're going to have an empathy problem.

394
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:09.260
I wouldn't worry about that.

395
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.870
<v 2>I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about internal versus external</v>

396
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:18.680
confidence.
Because I know within myself and um,
my friend circles,

397
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.950
we definitely show ourselves very differently than how we're feeling.

398
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.730
I just started working here.
This is my second week and

399
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.580
that's competent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Um,

400
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.630
the fake it till you make it message came to me from a lot of different people,

401
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:35.930
specifically women.

402
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.200
And I'm wondering why we have to fake it if we are here in this room and feel

403
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.730
and feel like we don't fully belong until we have to fake that we belong.

404
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.130
<v 1>No,</v>

405
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.970
we have a section in our adult book on the does fake it till you make it work.

406
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.180
And our conclusion was,
you know,
maybe sometimes,

407
00:24:56.181 --> 00:24:58.370
but it's actually not the best advice.

408
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.990
So I will counter what you have heard from other people and sit because first of

409
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:07.940
all,
women or are saddled already with constantly feeling like we're frauds and

410
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:11.750
imposters and faking it.
And so just adding another layer onto that and saying,

411
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:15.170
okay,
now I'm going to be someone else again.
And,
um,

412
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.470
but I think what fake it till you make it get set is that,

413
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.150
that if you think back to that,
you know,

414
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.970
formula for confidence,
right?
What often,
what needs to happen is,

415
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.760
is you have to take that first risk,
right?

416
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:31.970
You have to just get some experience under your belt.
You have to,

417
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.300
and how do you do that?
How do you get over that chasm?

418
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:40.820
And I think it's far better to tell yourself to recognize that you're afraid or

419
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:44.150
you're nervous to understand that that's normal.

420
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.400
It would actually be odd not to be,
right?
So that's a completely valid feeling.

421
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.990
And then just tell yourself what,

422
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:54.620
I'm just going to do it afraid this is a afraid somebody gave you a switch.

423
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:59.390
It's just acknowledge you're afraid but choose to act anyway.
Right?
It's and,
and,

424
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:02.690
and I also think that,
I don't,
I don't,

425
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.300
I don't work here so I don't fully know the culture.

426
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:09.500
But what I've seen as I speak in a variety of different corporate settings now

427
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:14.210
is it's,
it's so different than it was even five years ago or 10 years ago.

428
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:19.211
I think people are open to more honest conversations about how you're feeling,

429
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:23.810
what are your struggles?
I'm nervous.
I'm not,
I've got my kids.

430
00:26:23.811 --> 00:26:25.010
I'm worried about this.
I mean,

431
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.540
I remember there was a woman who was a mentor for me at ABC who at one point

432
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:33.080
said,
well,
but part of the problem is,
you know,
you this other person,
she,

433
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.190
she doesn't talk about her kids and you,
you made me just have to not do that.

434
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:40.520
And I looked through,
I said,
I,
I'm literally in capable of doing that.

435
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:44.850
I can't do that.
I just kind of talk about this stuff all the time.
And I,

436
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:46.560
and I think we're,

437
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.830
we're past that point where you have to pretend to be something.

438
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.160
I think it's all right to be vulnerable,

439
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.000
let people in and you can still be extremely competent and successful and

440
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.830
actually probably relate to people a little bit better.
Yeah.
Be More authentic.

441
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.790
Yeah.
We actually did a presentation at Tgi off of a couple of years ago where we

442
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:09.510
talked about imposter syndrome and the company and something like 95% of all

443
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:13.140
Googlers experience it.
So,
you know,
a lot of us are feeling the same thing.

444
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:15.870
I don't belong here.
And uh,
right,
right.
It's pretty common,

445
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.320
especially I'm sure at a company like Google where it's just got this kind of

446
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:23.280
name and you,
you know,
you think,
wow,
what am I,
why am I here?
You know?
And,
um,

447
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:28.140
but the,
I would say led authenticity,
Trump,

448
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.680
this sort of feeling of trying to be something you're not good and

449
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.380
congratulations on the job.
Yes.

450
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.820
<v 3>Um,
I'm sorry,
I just wanted to comment on,
on just the previous question.
Uh,</v>

451
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.890
I got a good lesson from,

452
00:27:44.891 --> 00:27:48.100
from someone in my past when I was faced with a difficult decision that kind of

453
00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:50.170
said it helped me know,
uh,

454
00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.080
try to isolate the reasons why you're not doing something.

455
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.530
And if you're left with fear,
then that's not a good enough reason.

456
00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.560
So that's great.
So that's just,
and,
and like,

457
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.940
I agree with what was said here.
You in very good company,

458
00:28:03.941 --> 00:28:08.230
if you're feeling it that you don't belong and you can feel pretty safe about

459
00:28:08.231 --> 00:28:13.130
talking to people about it because,
um,
so in,

460
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.890
you know,
a very common sentiment in,

461
00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:18.880
in lectures like this [inaudible] talked about books like this is a,
you know,

462
00:28:18.881 --> 00:28:23.140
we have,
I think a fair amount of young parents here.
And our main concern,

463
00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:26.230
especially as parents of girls is,
you know,

464
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.230
how do we make the next generation better?
Like you said,

465
00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:31.460
we're already kind of screwed.
You know,
we,

466
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.300
we suffered a lot of society's influence,
uh,

467
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.360
which is I think the biggest factor in,
in,

468
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:41.830
in confidence among women.
Um,

469
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.990
and I wanted to ask,
you know,

470
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.080
so right now my oldest daughter is only three and a half.

471
00:28:47.081 --> 00:28:49.570
I feel like I have a fair amount of influence on her.

472
00:28:49.571 --> 00:28:53.980
I know that once she enters the school system,
the amount of influence I have,

473
00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:58.360
well,
we'll go down and I want to ask what's next for you?
What,

474
00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.170
when are we going to see the confidence code for schools,
uh,

475
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.210
and the confidence code for parents.
Uh,

476
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.980
do you have any thoughts in that direction?

477
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:12.420
<v 1>Well,
you know,
we're hoping that,
um,
I,
I think that,
you know,</v>

478
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:17.500
we are working on a curriculum for schools so that they could use this book and,

479
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.250
um,
and for girls,
especially in middle school,

480
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.780
I think it's for parents.
I think you'll find when you look at it,

481
00:29:26.781 --> 00:29:30.770
it's really self explanatory in terms of following along with,

482
00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:35.150
because it's very much workbook,
like it's full of quizzes and tests.

483
00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:38.270
And I was telling Jen that some grown women have said,

484
00:29:38.271 --> 00:29:41.470
I actually liked this book better than your adult book because of hero.
It's red,

485
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:45.820
it's got the list.
And it's much it.
So I think we hope for parents that will be,

486
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:50.710
um,
fairly easy.
But it is,
that is just one of those I,
yeah,

487
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.740
it's really hard to see your kids face all these other influences.

488
00:29:56.231 --> 00:30:00.850
But I,
I again,
I think you have to as a parent realize,
um,

489
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.080
that,

490
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.080
that the more you can get out of the way and let them experience things and

491
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:14.041
experience problems and issues and failures and encouraged them through that,

492
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.620
you know,
the better off they're going to be soon.

493
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.740
Sooner rather than later because it's like you want him to have him while you're

494
00:30:20.741 --> 00:30:22.450
around and yes,
you're there to,

495
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:24.500
you don't want to wait for all of that stuff to happen.

496
00:30:24.501 --> 00:30:26.110
Well I think that's a good point,
right?

497
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:30.550
The more you can help your daughter and you know,
before she hits Middle School,

498
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.860
get used to doing some failing,
you're,
I like to think of it that you're,

499
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:38.640
you're going to inoculate her because there,

500
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.810
I mean like middle school isn't really not fun.
It's still not fun,
you know,

501
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:48.040
it really isn't and you can't control what friends are going to do and the way

502
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:52.780
teachers are going to treat you.
And so the more you can do early on to,

503
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.100
to let her fail and build up some resilience,
it's great.
I mean,

504
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:59.410
I will say the other thing is,
and it's not for everybody,

505
00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:03.010
but there's incredible data that shows that,
um,
you know,

506
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:07.000
athletics for girls makes a huge difference.
I mean,

507
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:11.140
there's almost a direct link between the longer a girl plays a sport and the

508
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:15.160
higher ranked she reaches in the workplace.
I,

509
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:20.170
I of course did no sports,
so I was like,
oh darn.

510
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.810
But,
but,
but,
and I don't think it's only about athletics,

511
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:26.260
it's just that athletics creates this.
Um,
it's,

512
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:31.470
it's really a ready made forum in which girls can lose and fail over and over

513
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:36.340
again.
And they have no choice.
Right.
They just have to get out there and do it.

514
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.440
And that might be also a debate team or trying out for a play or it's just a,

515
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:43.810
it's just the,
you know,
the athletics,

516
00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:46.270
they're there and you don't have to think about it as much.

517
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.810
But thank you for your question.
Um,
so just a little back story.

518
00:31:50.811 --> 00:31:54.890
I was raised by a single mom and she worked in finance pretty much my entire

519
00:31:54.891 --> 00:31:59.300
life and she was often one of the only women in a situation.

520
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.190
And she's a very confident woman.

521
00:32:01.191 --> 00:32:03.320
And in turn I've been raised to be very confident.

522
00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:06.710
But in then I have definitely in time has been called a bitch.

523
00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.910
I've been called domineering.
I've been told that I'm pushy.
And um,

524
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.520
how do you basically teach girls that it's okay to be confident without intern

525
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.380
receiving that kind of feedback?
You know,
one thing I say,

526
00:32:18.381 --> 00:32:22.280
especially honestly to young women,
and I think with girls,

527
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:26.140
it's important to start early with that conversation.
But I think I,

528
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.290
I really love talking to young women today because there's so much more focused

529
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.400
on all of these issues than I ever was.
Right?
And they ask a lot of questions,

530
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.130
but,
but there's also still this sense of like,

531
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:41.840
I want to navigate things perfectly,
right?
How can I avoid these issues?

532
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.160
So to some extent you'd won't totally avoid it,
right?
You,

533
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.870
and I think what we as women have to understand as there have to be a number of

534
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:55.580
women who are willing to be labeled pushy or a bitch or whatever it is,

535
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.870
so that we can finally broaden the,
the,

536
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:03.740
this box of behavior that women have been kind of confined in.

537
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.390
So,
um,

538
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.440
so I try to encourage people to kind of gird for that battle a little bit and

539
00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:11.660
realize,
okay,
yeah,
this is bad for you,

540
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:15.590
but it's really good for everybody else what you're doing.
Um,
but,

541
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.660
but,
um,
but I do think for,
again,
this piece for girls,

542
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:25.400
if the earlier we can help them understand that they don't need to worry about

543
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:28.440
being liked all of the time.
I mean,
I had,

544
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.150
I remember seeing a therapist once told me,
I,

545
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.640
I was really worried about some work issue.
And I said,
I'm worried,

546
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:36.470
I'm going to seem really mean.
And he's like,
Claire,

547
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:40.950
I don't even know what you could do in order to sound,
you know,
just,

548
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.940
and I think for most of us we can,
you know,
we're,

549
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.330
the world is not going to hate women,
right?

550
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:52.250
We're not in danger of heading over to that dark side.

551
00:33:52.251 --> 00:33:56.630
So I think that the,
the more we can encourage girls to understand,

552
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.290
they don't have to have everybody pleased all the time,

553
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.160
it will become more normal.
Right.
You're straight forward.

554
00:34:04.161 --> 00:34:09.161
I'm sure I'm ambitious leading leadership like behavior will be viewed that way.

555
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:14.870
Right.
Instead of why while she's pushy.
Yeah.
Um,

556
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.790
so,
but thank you for doing that.
Um,

557
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.000
so I have a nine year old daughter and she's been exhibiting a little bit more

558
00:34:23.001 --> 00:34:27.080
like less fear of doing something at school that she would fail out,

559
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:32.081
but fear of like physical things like an elevator or like going over a bridge or

560
00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:34.910
something like that.
And did you notice that?
Is that,

561
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:38.000
is that part of this for young girls?
You know,
I think it's,

562
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.930
I think what it tends to happen at puberty is that there's this,
um,

563
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.491
uh,
and,

564
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:47.900
and forgive me for like doctors or scientists in the room because I'm really

565
00:34:47.901 --> 00:34:48.800
short handing this,

566
00:34:48.801 --> 00:34:53.390
but what happens with our brands and with the influx of estrogen as we're just

567
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.750
even so much more aware,
right?

568
00:34:56.751 --> 00:35:01.280
There's this hyper awareness that happens of people's expressions,

569
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:06.350
what we see,
you know,
around the room,
what we,
what it might feel like to realize,

570
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.530
oh wait,
I'm in the elevator.
Like we're just this,

571
00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:11.810
this like puberty is really um,

572
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.240
an exceptional period that way.

573
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.480
So it's not uncommon and I've heard other people talk about that and I think a

574
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:24.761
lot of what a lot of the tips we have in the book are heavily based on cognitive

575
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:28.400
behavioral therapy because essentially the,
you know,

576
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:33.401
the way to get comfortable taking risks is really to create different thinking

577
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.560
habits,
right?
Habits and the way we think essentially.

578
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:39.120
And that's cognitive behavioral therapy.

579
00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:44.121
And so a lot of the steps in here in terms of acclimating yourself to risk

580
00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:47.010
taking I think would be really helpful,
right?

581
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.950
You sort of go through this process like what's the worst thing that's going to

582
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:50.700
happen?

583
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.660
Then you do step two and then you do step three and you can almost even create a

584
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:58.590
ladder of things and that,
and it makes a difference.

585
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.890
What's really helpful for parents by the way too,
is to have this

586
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.100
broad view over time that your kids will not have an,
actually,

587
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:11.220
it's really hard for me to have,
I have for barely any memory anymore,

588
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:15.090
but if you can literally think back and say,
Oh,

589
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:20.091
do you remember six months ago how you were afraid to do x and look at what

590
00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:25.170
you've done now and sometimes ties some of those things together.
That's really,

591
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.760
really powerful.
How's it being here?
So I'm curious,

592
00:36:29.761 --> 00:36:33.240
it seems as degree have a lot of these conversations we talk about how to

593
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.570
provide women with traits that are traditionally more male,
masculine.

594
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.570
And I'm wondering whether you and the course of your research,

595
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.420
it's how the other side of that people talking about tips for boys,

596
00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:45.780
for men and then generally it's is my point of view.

597
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:48.400
Like we're not having that conversation as much and you don't see bucks in the

598
00:36:48.401 --> 00:36:50.730
child's about that and why that is.
Maybe.

599
00:36:50.731 --> 00:36:54.660
And if you think we should have that conversation too.
You know,
I do think,

600
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:59.580
honestly,
especially in the wake of me too,
I think we could use a book for boys.

601
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.330
I could use one instead of having these really awkward conversations with my 16

602
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:06.450
year old son about,
you know,
well wait,
what are we?

603
00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.640
Wouldn't you think you're going to kiss her weight?
Well,
you know,

604
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:12.490
I'm like talking about all this.
It's real.
I'm like I need a buck.
Um,

605
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:17.490
and I,
but I,
I think,
I think the two things,
so,

606
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.413
um,

607
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:24.050
ideally we're not saying in urging women to think about whether they're

608
00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:27.660
confident or not or girls be more like men.

609
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.250
And so we try to be very explicit about that actually in both books.

610
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.113
I think.

611
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.180
I think it's really important for girls to feel as confident as they are

612
00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:41.480
competent.
Right?

613
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.320
So we got on to this issue with the scientist who studies and confidence in

614
00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:48.150
rats,
it cold spring harbor.

615
00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:51.180
I didn't know they were confident and non-competent rats,
but there are,

616
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.750
but what was so,
cause we really wanted to drill down on the idea of,
okay,

617
00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:59.010
what is the perfect amount of confidence to have if we assume women tend to

618
00:37:59.011 --> 00:38:00.750
underestimate them,
their abilities,

619
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:02.970
men tend to overestimate what do you really want?

620
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.300
And he said ideally to make great decisions in life,

621
00:38:06.301 --> 00:38:10.710
you want your confidence in line as in line with your competence as possible.

622
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.710
Right?
Because that is useful.

623
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.690
But actually it's useful to have a teeny bit more confidence because that pushes

624
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:22.350
you to do things.
That's the kind of boost you get for doing.

625
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:27.330
So I think that,
um,
I,
I think confidence,
the trick for,

626
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:31.140
for women and men and gender and everything is that confidence can be expressed

627
00:38:31.141 --> 00:38:32.610
in a lot of different ways.

628
00:38:32.611 --> 00:38:36.640
So we're not really talking about mad men style behavior,
right?
Like,
Oh,

629
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:39.160
I'm going to be the first one in the room and the loudest one at the meeting and

630
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:42.250
the person telling everybody wrote what to do.
And,
uh,

631
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.680
that doesn't have to be your style of confidence.

632
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:49.060
That's not really even confidence,
right?
That's just behavior.
And it is behavior.

633
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.990
We've come to accept this confident behavior because generally speaking,

634
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.850
that's the kind of behavior exhibited by the people who created the workplace.

635
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.790
Right?
And so,

636
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.080
so there is something to the effect that the workplace was created and you know,

637
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.810
uh,
with men and mind,

638
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.830
I think that the norms will benefit from a big change.

639
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.650
And I think that that is a conversation that has to,

640
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.500
that has to come from the top down,
right?

641
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:17.410
Because that's really a conversation about what does a leader look like.

642
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.310
Are we really being inclusive about everybody's leadership qualities?

643
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:23.830
Are we recognizing that leadership qualities?
You know,

644
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:26.530
women bring very different skills to the table,

645
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:32.160
but we will never bring those skills to the table if we're not willing to say I

646
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:35.530
deserve a promotion.
Right?
So to me,

647
00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:40.210
that's not a male or female asset.
That's actually just a,

648
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.920
I recognize that I'm qualified and competent.
Um,

649
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.560
but that was a really long answer.

650
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:50.170
The short answer is we need more books on boys.

651
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.300
And I think it would be really useful because I think boys and [inaudible] is,

652
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.600
is critical,
right?
Boys need to kind of have a,
um,

653
00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.200
a lot more of those skills that girls and women have.

654
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:04.060
And I think everybody would be happier.

655
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.090
And I think when you were talking about bringing your whole self to work and not

656
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:09.340
being afraid to talk about what's going on with your family,

657
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:12.640
I think that those are some of the things that everybody can learn from.
Yes.

658
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.060
Yeah,
exactly.
Speaking of boys and men,
hold on.

659
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.180
<v 3>It was exactly what I wanted to ask actually.</v>

660
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.820
I have a girl and a boy and I think my girls will definitely enjoy the book,

661
00:40:25.821 --> 00:40:30.540
but I can't show it to my blog.
So yeah,
if you flip the,

662
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:35.360
at least was called the confidence code,
VA could give it.
Right?
Right.

663
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.470
<v 1>But do you think that,
um,
is your boy,
do you feel like he's confident or</v>

664
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.610
<v 3>in some way or is he is,
but I,</v>

665
00:40:41.611 --> 00:40:45.400
I see so many new things where he's afraid to take the risk and you could

666
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.263
benefit from it.

667
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:47.091
<v 1>Yes.
Well,</v>

668
00:40:47.091 --> 00:40:49.490
I think you should read the book and it will definitely help you with both

669
00:40:49.491 --> 00:40:53.010
chapters because I have one of each and it was super helpful.
So yeah,

670
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.640
I think there is a,
there would,
it is huge.
I mean,
look,
we're,

671
00:40:55.641 --> 00:40:59.330
I've had a lot of men come up and say,
look,
we're all,
we all overthink,

672
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:02.360
we're all scared of risks.
We're all,
you know,
we feel this way too.

673
00:41:02.361 --> 00:41:04.730
And of course men feel this way.

674
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:09.410
I think the biggest differences that men typically don't go on to be

675
00:41:09.411 --> 00:41:10.840
perfectionist,
right,

676
00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:15.470
who'd be spent a lot of wasted time on things when they could.

677
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.520
And also I've had a couple men say,
you know,
I get scared,
I get nervous,

678
00:41:19.521 --> 00:41:23.200
I don't want to take the risk,
but I,
but I act any way.

679
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:27.620
But there's still this propensity,
this push to act that,
um,

680
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:33.100
men often have.
And that then results in learning.
But it's,

681
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.890
I think,
again,
we're,
you know,
talk to that woman right there and

682
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.950
we're looking,
you know,
for a book for boys thinking about that.
Thank you.

683
00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.850
<v 4>I thank you.
I have a seventh grader,
a girl,</v>

684
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.100
and I think what you said really resonated when she was young.

685
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:52.460
She was fearless unless you ran for class president and lost a boy.

686
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:56.480
But she was like Gung Ho.
But now she's changed.
I mean I think she definitely,

687
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.610
maybe her pure group of girls are like really into looks really to beauty.

688
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:04.750
She's like,
where are,
you know,
looking at the mirror all the time,

689
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:08.000
shop looking for shopping stuff.
So I feel like her,
her peer group now,

690
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:11.210
it's kind of like influencing her away from being fearless,

691
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:14.420
like trying new things.
And he advised and she's sought on for all the time,

692
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.700
like iPhone all the time,
talking to friends,
chatting.

693
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:22.030
So any tips about how to steer her away from a pure group of other girls who may

694
00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:25.460
be also like not exhibiting and confidence and just focusing on looks

695
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.980
<v 1>it,
you know,
it's hard because especially when they get to be that age,
right?</v>

696
00:42:28.981 --> 00:42:32.910
They do their,
their friends mattered to them so much more than their parents.

697
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:37.250
And almost everything we say a suspect,
right?
I mean,
I can't,
you know,

698
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:42.240
my 13 year old daughter is just really,
really difficult.

699
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.490
She's not going to be watching this.
This is going to be awful.
But she,
um,

700
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:52.880
I think that what you can do as a parent is talk a lot about the things that are

701
00:42:53.941 --> 00:42:58.740
valuable.
The fact that it's okay to stand out,
right?
It's okay to be different.

702
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.810
Look for people who might be interesting role models for her and who are

703
00:43:03.811 --> 00:43:08.040
exhibiting some of this breaking out of the pack behavior,
right?

704
00:43:08.041 --> 00:43:10.930
Or a focus less on,
you know,

705
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.190
we really try in the book to get into this focusing or don't focus as much on

706
00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:16.710
what you look like,
focus on what you're doing,
right.

707
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:20.550
Judge yourself by what you're doing.
Um,
and for girls,

708
00:43:20.551 --> 00:43:23.850
I think that's very powerful.
But for you as the parent,

709
00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.770
you have to find the rate messenger because you're probably not the right

710
00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:33.160
messenger.
So you have to be really subtle about it.
I mean,

711
00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:37.020
and maybe the book is something to use and talk about that maybe,
you know,

712
00:43:37.021 --> 00:43:40.920
there are a lot of great things,
great things on Youtube.
They're greet,

713
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.220
sort of inspirational channels.
People have created that.

714
00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:48.540
Talk a lot about failure rate and being fearless for girls.

715
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.130
The other thing that you can really,

716
00:43:50.131 --> 00:43:55.131
I think at middle school girls hooked on is get them mad about something and get

717
00:43:55.651 --> 00:43:58.350
them to kind of feel this passionate about something,

718
00:43:58.351 --> 00:44:03.060
whether it's animal welfare or the fact that their favorite sporting good store

719
00:44:03.061 --> 00:44:07.170
doesn't stock women's basketball shoes,
which was Scott,
you know,

720
00:44:07.171 --> 00:44:11.820
got my daughter in a rage and then tie that to what do you want to do about it,

721
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.610
right?
So if you can find ways where they get engaged in,
in,

722
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.250
in girls and women especially,
um,

723
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.780
have this drive often to be focused on issues that are bigger than themselves,

724
00:44:24.511 --> 00:44:29.370
missions causes and they can feel more naturally confident diving into that

725
00:44:29.371 --> 00:44:34.140
stuff.
So maybe for something like that you can get her engaged in.

726
00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.000
Hello Matt.
Good luck.

727
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.170
<v 2>I have a nine year old daughter as well.
And um,</v>

728
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.880
in some ways a total risk taker.
I mean,

729
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:47.910
she's the first one to go off the zip line and the,
you know,
whatever.

730
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.220
She's super comfortable with risk in that way.

731
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.570
The piece that I find really interesting though,

732
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:56.820
sort of as a weird paradox to me is she's very,

733
00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:01.170
very uncomfortable with being embarrassed in front of people.

734
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.950
And so she does play a sport as she played softball and just,
I mean,

735
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:09.900
just even last week she was destroyed because she didn't get a hit the whole

736
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:14.100
game.
And I tried to do the,
it's okay.
Even the best players,

737
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:17.400
even the pros don't get,
you know,
I mean all the usual stuff.
Right.

738
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.600
So I guess my question is,
you know,

739
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.700
is there a certain language is,
are certain ways to,
I mean,
God forbid I try to,

740
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.030
you know,

741
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.760
give the pep talk about failing and you didn't fail because you got up and you

742
00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:33.710
bat and you tried and whatever.
Right.

743
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.890
It's not a fact that that really pisses them off.
That's like,

744
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.520
it makes it so much worse.
I mean total shutdown,

745
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:45.600
no conversation to the point where she wants to quit and doesn't want to play

746
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:50.040
again next weekend.
So I'm just wondering,
how do you,
you know,

747
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.190
is there a different language to use?
There is,
maybe it's a different time.

748
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:54.360
Don't say it in the moment.
I don't know.

749
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:57.090
I'm just wondering what's the right way in here?
Susceptive

750
00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.790
<v 1>not the world's biggest expert on sports conversations.</v>

751
00:46:01.791 --> 00:46:05.900
I found it incredibly painful with my kids.
I was like,

752
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.250
oh my God.
You know,

753
00:46:07.251 --> 00:46:11.210
cause I felt like I internalized everything they're feeling and I feel at five

754
00:46:11.211 --> 00:46:13.430
times more than they do.
So it's,
you know,

755
00:46:13.431 --> 00:46:16.790
I'm not a great passive parent,
but what I've,

756
00:46:16.791 --> 00:46:19.460
what I've see is that with this or anything else,

757
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:25.030
like you just have to think about your job as being as calm and unemotional

758
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.110
about it as possible.
The more emotional they are,

759
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.550
the less you are and it's really hard to do.
And you,

760
00:46:34.551 --> 00:46:39.140
and you almost have to treat it like,
yeah.
Yeah.
That really was,
um,

761
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.990
yeah,
that will,
must not have felt good.
You know,

762
00:46:41.991 --> 00:46:45.650
you kind of don't try to do the opposite.
Oh,
it'll be better next time,

763
00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:50.090
but just say,
Yep,
I hear you.
And,
and in a lot of ways what we found talking to,

764
00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.120
you know,
cognitive therapists and people,
you know,

765
00:46:53.121 --> 00:46:55.970
you cannot process that she's not going to be able to,

766
00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.840
she has to go through when kids are upset,
they have to go through that.

767
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.940
I'm really upset,
I'm grieving,

768
00:47:01.941 --> 00:47:06.941
my fear center is firing and you need to think about how do I get her brain to

769
00:47:07.941 --> 00:47:11.810
get out of that zone because when it's out of that zone later the next day,

770
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:16.160
she can then like,
oh look at this video and you can talk about,
you know,

771
00:47:16.161 --> 00:47:21.140
this other softball player who failed a hundred times like a day or two later.

772
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:25.940
But in that moment,
the best thing to do is just that you want to lie in bed,

773
00:47:25.941 --> 00:47:29.030
get some ice cream,
here's a book.
Well here's a movie.

774
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:34.230
Just kind of acknowledge it and try to help her through it and treat it like,

775
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.050
I mean the other thing I've seen with dads a lot more than,
because I don't,

776
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:40.870
and I'm not good at this,
but maybe they're,
they're great sports moms too,

777
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:44.740
is like just,
it's like you take it in stride rate,

778
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:48.250
it doesn't need to be over thought,

779
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.340
which again really hard for me cause I'm,

780
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:55.500
I'm an overthinker but I feel you don't let her quit.
Um,

781
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:56.860
you talked about overthinking,

782
00:47:56.861 --> 00:48:00.220
we also talked about in your book about overpreparing and you talked about women

783
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:00.820
at night.

784
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.140
I definitely observed that when I was in TV that the women anchors would

785
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:09.580
overprepare and the men and I did research for both genders and I'm just,

786
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.200
I see that in the workplace here as well.

787
00:48:11.201 --> 00:48:14.740
I'm just wondering what you saw in the research about the overpreparing and what

788
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:15.700
that was about.
You know,

789
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:20.110
overpreparing I find I can really relate to because that's I being a

790
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:24.630
perfectionist,
the people pleaser and over preparer.
You,

791
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.760
I realize now once we started studying confidence,
what,

792
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.300
what a waste of time that has been.
And I think that's what bugs me.

793
00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:35.620
It's not that I didn't,
you know,
have a great job in journalism or I've,
yes,

794
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:38.340
I've written a book,
but it's just more like,
wow,
I,

795
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:43.800
I could have been doing even more and I wouldn't have been quite as stressed out

796
00:48:44.531 --> 00:48:49.270
about it.
And I actually found,
I had somebody go back,

797
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:50.470
I don't know if I told you this story,

798
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:53.420
but I was so curious about the over preparation.
Cause I,

799
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.480
I spent a couple of years doing on,
um,

800
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.890
being the only woman on that political panel on George Stephanopoulos this show.

801
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.830
And,
um,
I thought I had,

802
00:49:02.831 --> 00:49:05.890
I think the guys are speaking a lot more than I am.

803
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:08.710
And I always thought that every week I think they're going on longer.

804
00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:11.590
I feel like I'm just cutting.
But I wasn't sure.

805
00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:16.770
We went back and measured a year's worth of shows and I had talked 30% less and

806
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.480
I would constantly over prepared,
you know,

807
00:49:21.481 --> 00:49:23.590
I would prepare this way and that way it just makes sure,

808
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.420
but then I didn't want to stray off of what I have prepared.
I felt like,
well,

809
00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:29.620
no,
I know these things,

810
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:34.030
but I'm not going to jump in with an additional comment because I might not be

811
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:38.080
right.
And I,
you know,
and that's it's,
it's so limited.

812
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:39.760
As soon as you do the research after you,

813
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.830
or were you still on the show when you would do the research?

814
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.660
I did it as we were writing the book.

815
00:49:43.661 --> 00:49:47.680
I got all the transcripts and I know it was really sort of surprising.

816
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:52.480
But Christine,
the guard said that to us too.
She said that she ducked catty.

817
00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:55.810
That was a kind of shocking moment for us.
We had a great dinner with her.

818
00:49:55.811 --> 00:49:58.330
She's an incredibly confident woman,
but she even said,

819
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.020
I think one of the ways I let confidence is I over prepare.

820
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:05.230
I never want to be caught off guard.
I prepare upside down and inside out and,

821
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.140
and Angela Merkel and I have talked about this a lot,

822
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:11.630
how we both overprepared carefully.
What,
okay,
so we're in good,

823
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.660
we're in good company,

824
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:18.370
but it doesn't mean it's a great use for experimenting with maybe just leaning

825
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:21.630
back a little and not doing that.
Definitely I create,

826
00:50:21.631 --> 00:50:25.330
I created rules for myself about when I was still doing a lot more good morning

827
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:29.060
America,
which pieces were just,
okay,
this piece I'm going to spend two hours on,

828
00:50:29.061 --> 00:50:29.271
I would,

829
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:33.140
I'd literally have to give myself a limit because especially working for good

830
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:37.040
morning America,
I could potentially work all night.
Right?

831
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:40.280
I literally could work all night on something and often wanted to,

832
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:44.490
but then I'd have my whole team working all night and people weren't that happy

833
00:50:44.491 --> 00:50:46.640
and I was really tired the next day.
So I was,

834
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.770
I had to kind of create little rules.
We do that a lot in our office just to,

835
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.370
yeah,
yeah.
You just,
yes,

836
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:55.340
we could all work here all night and you will never finish all your work,

837
00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:58.610
but at a certain point is it really worth it to keep doing that?
Um,

838
00:50:58.611 --> 00:51:03.250
so I think we,
oh,
we have one more year will be our last question.
Okay.

839
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:07.790
So this might not be confidence for girls,
but I'm going to ask it anyway.
Um,

840
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:12.380
so my mother raised me to be very confident and more competent than she was as a

841
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:13.470
child.
Um,

842
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.470
so I was just wondering when you grow up that way and then you start being hyper

843
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:23.390
aware of like the lack of confidence other women are giving young girls or give

844
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.900
you are giving yourself after you like reflected.
I like now that you're older,

845
00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:30.710
how do you go back and talk to the older women about it and their lack of

846
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:34.310
confidence and like how they are perpetuating that cycle.

847
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.850
Especially like your grandma or your mom and having that conversation with the

848
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:42.240
older women that were in your life without making them feel like,
oh you,

849
00:51:42.241 --> 00:51:45.800
you mess me up.
Or anything like without being disrespectful.

850
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:49.850
And then also a second part to that is like seeing other young girls in your

851
00:51:49.851 --> 00:51:54.830
family being raised that way and then trying to stop it but not disrespecting

852
00:51:54.831 --> 00:51:57.630
their parents also.
So like I guess it's like a two part.
Yeah.

853
00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.330
That is so tricky for,
we'll hand them the book.

854
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:05.540
I came a policy,
you don't have to take the blame.
Right.
I think it's right.

855
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:10.260
I think that is,
um,
that's one area,
especially with family members.
I say,

856
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.430
you know,
don't worry about being liked with family.

857
00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:17.790
I think you still have to worry about being like dre because you don't want to

858
00:52:17.791 --> 00:52:18.840
create a rift.

859
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.410
But I think it's maybe the way to do it is to just talk about the new roof,

860
00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.320
new research that's out there.

861
00:52:25.321 --> 00:52:30.321
And it's so interesting that in fact it's really important to encourage girls to

862
00:52:30.391 --> 00:52:34.850
fail who knew,
you know,
and isn't this great and you know,
and,
and,

863
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.860
and try to bring them along and make them see that it was their idea.

864
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:44.490
Because I think,
um,
it's,
it is hard to revisit parenting.

865
00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:47.460
I'm really dreading this moment with my kids by the way,
right?

866
00:52:47.461 --> 00:52:52.170
When they come to me and I'm like,
what did you do to me?
We tried our best.

867
00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:56.790
We tried our best.
But I think if you would start it as a discussion about,

868
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:57.151
I mean,

869
00:52:57.151 --> 00:53:01.320
and that's one thing we've been really focused on in both of these books is
that,

870
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:05.100
you know,
there's a lot of data about this,
right?

871
00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:08.910
We focused on the data and the science,
because I think for a lot of people,

872
00:53:08.911 --> 00:53:10.410
although my,
my daughter's like,

873
00:53:10.411 --> 00:53:14.240
if I hear you use the word research one more time,
I'm going to kill you.
Well,

874
00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:17.490
some of your crazy research mom.
So,
but,
but you know,

875
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:21.690
most people will understand that,
um,
that there's meaning to it,
right.

876
00:53:21.691 --> 00:53:24.240
If there's some science behind it and some data,

877
00:53:24.241 --> 00:53:27.510
and I think that take the sting out of it.
It's not just a,

878
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:32.320
it's not just judgment,
but great question.
Sure.
Right.

879
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.270
Thank you so much.
[inaudible] a lot in the book is great.
I highly recommend it.

880
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.350
Thank you.
Thank you.

881
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:40.470
