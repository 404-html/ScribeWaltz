Speaker 1:          00:09          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Thanks so much. That was quite the introduction. Thanks everyone for coming today and thank you to Google for hosting us and Sam for being our host today. We really appreciate it. Um, as many of you are probably aware, um, since 1990 over a billion people have moved out of poverty globally, which is really exciting and I think gives us all the idea that it's possible. Um, and that we can make significant progress on our goals towards any global poverty. At the same time, nearly a million people still live in poverty and many more than that live without access to financial services live without access to health and live in chronic and acute hunger. Um, and those people are disproportionately women and people living in rural areas. And so Grameen Foundation, we're really committed to continuing to find solutions that work for those people. Um, many of the advances that have driven global growth, um, that have driven the in the reduction of poverty have been global growth.

Speaker 2:          00:58          But there are also many advances that have been due to investments and development initiatives. So, for example, in India, some of you may know the unheard system, which is the, um, the new national identity and biometric system in India. Maybe some of you may have worked on it. Um, but India has made a significant investment in making sure that every person in India has a national id and that, that national ID is connected to their biometrics so that they're able to access that at any time. Um, national identity is a significant issue for poor people. Many of them don't have identity, they don't have a birth certificate, they don't have any sort of government documentation. And without that, they're significantly limited in their ability to open a bank account in their ability to access government services and their ability to be recognized in their ability to vote.

Speaker 2:          01:47          Um, and so for India, making the commitments to establish this national identity and connecting it to bio metrics has been a significant investment and a significant advancement towards their end to poverty. Once people are in the system, they're able to access their government benefits. Um, they all automatically have a bank account that's open for them. So they're government benefits transfer directly from the government into their accounts without having to pass through other hands what's making, which makes sure that they receive all of their benefits. And the development of that system was a development initiative. It was funded by the gates foundation and collaboration with the Indian government, um, and many other development initiatives. So, um, another one which many of you may have heard of is in Pesa in east Africa, which is a mobile money system connected to the Vodafone system there. So although only 15% of Kenyans have a bank account, over 90% of Kenyans use a mobile money account connected to their mobile phone.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Um, and randomized controlled trials have verified that over six per cent of people annually move out of poverty because of their access to mobile money. And there's several reasons for that. One is that it increases their resilience. Um, if somebody has a health emergency, for example, able to reach out to friends and family near and far to see if they can gather resources to cover that health emergency rather than having to sell off, say a productive asset in their household, having to sell a cow, which may be worth $100 just to pay for $6 a health emergency, you know, needing malaria medication for example. So they're able to increase their resilience through their social networks, through the mobile money platform, um, and able to retain more of their assets. Um, for women it's an important resource to, they're able to save and save somewhere often that is more private, um, and away from say their husband or other family members who may want access to their resources.

Speaker 2:          03:35          So for women in particular, having a safe and private place to save is a very important part of their, um, ability to have more control over their own resources. We live in amazing times and with this technology development, much of it happening here at Google and many of you so hopefully involved in some of it, we're seeing big data, the use of cell phones, um, being part of this, the host of disruptive technologies that are transforming the way we work in the developing community, the way that we engage with partners, um, and giving us really unprecedented opportunities to make impacts on poverty.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Grameen Foundation, we're really passionate about disrupting global poverty. We're working to create breakthroughs that will reach many of those still living in poverty. We just design strategies that women and their families with knowledge and services. We really look at how we engage with frontline workers, people who are already engaged with poor households to improve their ability to deliver products and services to them. And we bring together partners in an ecosystem. So we work primarily with software companies, with private sector entities, with governments to ensure that solutions we develop our embedded in sustainable delivery mechanisms, whether that's sustainable private sector initiatives or sustainable governance initiatives.

Speaker 1:          04:47          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:48          Many of you may know Grameen Foundation. See, I think I got ahead of myself on the slides. Um, through our history, we were founded in 1997 through the work of Muhammad Yunus Nobel laureate for his work as the father of micro finance. His breakthrough idea was really that, that for women were someone you could invest in, that you could lend to them, they would invest that money in their businesses and that they would repay it. And we really have grown on the back of that, um, idea that poor households are good investments and someone you can do business with. In our first 10 years, we really focused on micro finance and developing micro finance institutions globally. But in the last 10 years, we have built on that foundation. We've really focused on using digital technology to develop sustainable solutions to reach the poor, especially women.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Today, our mission is both urgent but also hopeful. It's urgent because 60% of the chronically hungry people are still women and girls. They are disproportionately affected by poverty and global hunger. Though global poverty is on the decline. Global hunger is on the rise. 2 billion people. More than half of them women have no access to formal financial, which is a key enabler to life. More than a hundred million people are driven into poverty every year because of a health crisis and that's not a developing country phenomenon alone. That's a phenomenon here, right here in the U S and maternal mortality rates in Africa remained virtually unchanged over the last three decades, so there is an urgent need to continue to invest in finding solutions to global poverty. At the same time, we're hopeful digital technologies are offering unprecedented solutions, things like human centered design and private sectors to increased focus on working with the extremely poor, provide opportunities that we've never had before. Looking forward to Grameen Foundation is looking to reach 25 million people over the next 25 years and move them sustainably out of poverty. Today we work in three main areas. We work in digital financial services for women. We work in a digital innovations in agriculture, and then we worth in health, health financing and access. Health financing and access is primarily connected to our work, particularly around financial services and agriculture.

Speaker 2:          07:00          I wanted to highlight a couple of our programs. I thought you guys might be particularly interested in. The first one is called the can network, the community agent network in the Philippines. I think everybody's familiar with the Philippines. It's an island nation is made up of over 7,000 islands, which it makes it extremely expensive and time consuming, um, for people to access financial services. And it makes it extremely expensive for financial service providers to build out infrastructure across all of those 7,000 small islands. So we have worked with, um, women like this with Joan who are small, uh, what are called, sorry, sorry. Shop owners, kiosk owners. They run little small businesses. They smell, they sell daily household items. And we have worked with a technology provider to equip these women with a will be called a point of sale or pos device that enables them to PR to do mobile money and digital payment transactions for members of their community. So now Joan who was on a small island in the Philippines is able to be the intersection point for her island and for her community, for people to pay their electricity bill for people to make a deposit or withdrawal into their bank account. Um, and this is enabling financial inclusion to reach these small islands and people who've never had access to it before.

Speaker 2:          08:16          Um, to today we've trained over 18,000 or sorry, 1800 agents, 75% of them women like Joan. Um, we cater to 423 low income neighborhoods across this island nation. We facilitated over 4.3 million transactions, valued at 1.3 billion pesos. So there was a huge unmet demand for these types of digital financial services. And as soon as we were able to put an access point in these communities, um, you saw the, the amount of people who were using digital mobile money really ramp up the other project we're engaged in, which I thought you guys might find interesting as a project we call sat for. It's a project that just launched this year and it's part of our global partnership with Mars, which is the chocolate company, um, makes most of our candy bars these days. Um, and in this project we use satellite digital imagery and data to reach 240,000 smallholder cocoa farmers across Ghana.

Speaker 2:          09:14          It's helped them increase their yields, um, improve their incomes and build stronger businesses. And what we do this the way we do this as taking some of the precision farming techniques that have been developed in the developed world for use on large, uh, large scale farms and large industrial farms and try and take some of those technologies and those techniques and make them work for smallholder farmers. So things like satellite imagery to help understand whether, sorry, um, soil conditions and weather, soil needs, additional nutrients, um, to understand if soil, um, needs, if you're farm needs more or less water drain any particular point of view. Um, you can use satellite data imagery to understand whether the pruning on a particular farm has been done correctly. And weirdly, pruning is very important for cacau trees and helps improve their productivity. So making sure that it's done correctly is, is an important thing.

Speaker 2:          10:08          So we work with, um, Mars and, and some of the partners on the ground who have these field agents, extension agents, we call them who already go out and interact with the farmers. So we're able to use satellite imagery and satellite data to provide information to the extension agents so that when they go out and visit a farmer, they can tell them you need to improve your pruning techniques. We can see that, that your trees need to be pruned more. Um, we can see that, uh, your soil is low in nitrogen and you need to plant additional plants in order to increase the nitrogen, um, nitrogen in your plants. And so it's really taking that technology that's already in use for these large scale farms and figuring out how we can use it to increase small scale farmers productivity and that their income. And many people don't realize that cocoa farmers are some of the poorest people in the world, even though they're connected to this global chocolate value chain.

Speaker 2:          11:00          There are high levels of child labor in chocolate globally. And so part of this work that we do is not only improving their productivity, but bringing these farmers into a global digital system. So their information gets, um, gets into our system for each farm, their farming practices, um, et cetera. And then we are able to work with them, did become fair trade certified to become organic certified if that's what they're looking for. So it's a system that gives both greater profitability to the farmer, but also greater visibility of all of us into the global chocolate value chain. And, um, it's something that we're working with Mars and, um, and looking at blockchain is the kind of next part of that so that as consumers, everybody can have visibility into how your chocolate products through Mars are being produced and whether they're fair trade certified, whether they're apps and of child labor, et Cetera.

Speaker 2:          11:49          So I know that that's something that, um, kind of both sides of the coin can benefit from. One cornerstone that's consistent across all of our projects is our desire to really use data and information to track our programs were, uh, I think in the developing community still at the, at the nascent stage of figuring out how to use big data and some of these big data sources to really bring to the fight against poverty and hunger. But we're trying to use the smart tools and the data and the information that we have on smallholder farmers to bring them more fully into market systems and to overcome some of their, their challenges. Um, one of the things, for example that we're looking at doing now, uh, we have worked with hundreds of thousands of small holder farmers globally. One of the biggest constraints that they all have is access to finance because they don't have a financial history.

Speaker 2:          12:38          Many of them don't have bank accounts. Um, many of them have worked with a, a mainstream or large financial institution before. They may do all of their lending and borrowing locally through their community or through, um, money lenders. Um, so how can we help this data that they've built up in our system? We may have three to four years worth of their farming data. Um, we made a know exactly how much they've spent. I'm invested in their farm. We may know exactly how much they've produced and what they've earned off of that production for two or three years. So how can we help them take that data and turn it into a credit profile or a credit score that they can then use, um, with the mainstream financial institution. So we've already done some of that in Columbia with coffee farmers and we're looking to replicated in, uh, Ghana with sorry, and Uganda with coffee farmers and then in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire with these cow farmers.

Speaker 2:          13:28          So we think that's something very exciting and a real growth area for us in an area where we can really use the data that we already have to really make an impact. Um, I think there's other exciting ways we can start to think about using technology globally to alleviate poverty. I talked about blockchain. Um, it's something that we're all trying to figure out what the best way to use is this new technology and ways that it can help impact poverty. One of the ways that we're thinking about Grameen Foundation is particularly with refugees as they cross borders and are receiving healthcare, say in a country that is not their own. How can they develop a health record on something like blockchain that helps them as they, as they move globally, whether they repatriate to their home country or whether they're moved on to a third country, how can they take their health records with them?

Speaker 2:          14:13          Something like blockchain is something that can really be very helpful with that. Um, we're experimenting with artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Um, particularly in our India office, we've been working with Accenture development partners, um, and using artificial intelligence, for example, we do a lot of financial literacy training. So using artificial intelligence to help us understand how much women have understood and internalized the training that they've received and where women need additional support, uh, to ensure that they, they understand, uh, how to use financial services appropriately. So I've actually done it myself, done the little Q and. A. Um, and it's very interesting to get the, the readout in the reports on, uh, on how you're doing and how well you're understanding of the lessons that you've just received. So it's, it's exciting. Um, and another exciting area we're looking at is remote sensing for agricultural irrigation. So again, it's something that's that's being used by large scale industrial farms and developing countries about can we use remote sensing, um, to help smallholder farmers in India, um, use water more efficiently and water more effectively. So that's a project that we're just at the beginning of.

Speaker 1:          15:24          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:24          So I'm going to end it with that. Um, and I'm really happy to answer any questions anybody has or talk a little bit more about our work. We at Grameen are very excited about the ability to use technology, um, and information, uh, to end extreme poverty and hunger. We think these can help create the breakthroughs that will move women in their communities out of poverty in a sustainable way. And we think it can be helped with the work that you know, people at Google are doing. So we're really excited to talk with you guys today more about the work we're doing, um, and hear more about if you guys think you're working on anything that's, that's relevant or could be adapted. Um, we're really excited to hear about it. I will say that my colleague be is over here, so if you want to sign up for a newsletter to learn more about Grameen Foundation, she's the one to see. Um, but with that I'll end and see if anybody has any questions.

Speaker 3:          16:11          I'm just curious about where are you see the intersections of Google's work and um, development. So antipoverty or anti hunger efforts or job training or other, uh, you know, significant efforts that'll have an impact on, on social wellbeing.

Speaker 4:          16:35          Yeah, I feel probably, you know, you got google.org our philanthropic arm because they work with non profits and Jacqueline pooler. I mean she really understand a lot about that. I think that this, actually, I met with Jacqueline in a renal last week. So I think that they definitely are a good point to one of contact. The other thing is that we are working my cell like working Google developer relations. We deal technology and we work with developers and uh, we have these trainings around the world with the book focused on social impact because of course we work with big companies, but this is based on social impact and we are part of grow with Google, which is becoming a global initiative in the u s Europe, India, Indonesia recently launch in Africa as well in Nigeria, in a Google for urea. So in addition to this developer trainees, we do like a internet in railway stations, the skills training, many of the things that you were talking about, I mean just getting people increase their ability to get employed and that's, we do. So of course we are part of Google cloud platform, which all the technology is there. And then so, uh, whatever, I mean we have the cloud. So interesting. I mean, we can probably follow up and see if we can figure out if we can collaborate in some way or another. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          18:11          Yeah, thanks. That would be very exciting. I think especially with some of the skills training pieces, that's something that we're always being asked for. Uh, so, uh, do you see any, do you see the problem of global poverty getting worse with like desertification, desertification, and the loss of variable land basically due to global warming and climate change? Absolutely. And I think it's, it's very geographically specific, so, and there are parts of the world that are being impacted differently. So for example, you see areas like Mozambique or the Philippines that are being subjected to much more frequent natural disasters. So Mozambique for example, yeah, mmm. Is, is much more frequently being hit by typhoons or significant rains that are causing flooding that are causing crop loss, that are causing loss of life. So we're seeing those issues hit some countries at the same time. We're seeing other countries, particularly kind of the [inaudible] region countries were increasing.

Speaker 2:          19:08          Desertification, um, is impact, you know, encroaching on areas that were former breadbaskets. Um, and that we're producing significant amounts of food. So there are different impacts everywhere, but without a doubt, particularly the developing world is being disproportionately impacted by climate change and they are disproportionately not contributing to climate change. I guess. I guess the actual, uh, the question to the foundation is a, are you doing anything to try to prevent that from happening? Like, is it easier to prevent people getting into poverty because of those then try to pull them out of it afterwards? Oh yeah, absolutely. So one of the projects we've initiated, for example in the Philippines is an early warning system. So it's both a weather and a pest early warning system. So one of the things we're seeing with climate change is very different pest patterns globally, right? Because, um, uh, mosquitoes or one that a lot of people, it's not a, it's not a crop pest, but you know, mosquitoes are coming into areas that they've never been before because the climate in that area has changed.

Speaker 2:          20:13          So similarly with crop related pests, they are coming into areas where they've never been before. We're farmers don't know how to deal with them. Um, and as well as weather related risks, particularly in the Philippines. So in the Philippines we've worked with both the Ministry of Agriculture and a local university that has a, that runs the weather stations in the country, um, to develop an early warning system. So that early warning system sends information to farmers if there's an inclement weather event or if there is a pest outbreak in their area. And not only does it tell them about the event, but it gives them instructions. So for example, if there's, there's a typhoon coming at may tell farmers you need to cover your, your trees and burlap and may tell them you need to, you need to harvest early because there'll be total crop loss. You should harvest what you can.

Speaker 2:          20:56          Now at the same time, it allows for two way communication. So say a farmer finds a pest in their crop, if they're not familiar with, they can take a picture of it, they can send it into the system, they can receive information pack on what to do about it. But at the same time he will triangulate. So several farmers in in an area report the same pest. It will then send out a warning to all farmers in the area that the pest has been spotted in their area and how they should treat for it. So early warning system is something that we're working on that we've piloted in the Philippines. We're working on in ag, integrating it into the scanner project. I was talking about another project. So yes.

Speaker 3:          21:31          Thank you.

Speaker 2:          21:33          So that may have been way more detailed than you want it.

Speaker 3:          21:36          Yeah. Can I add to that a little course as well. So farmers are, the majority of the world's poor, 70% of the extreme poor are farmers. So a lot of what we do is in terms of helping those farmers increase their productivity and the sustainability of what they do, which is part and parcel of adjusting to climate change. So I don't know if you want to maybe talk a little bit about the savings groups work like in, in Burkina Faso and how we're directly doing that.

Speaker 2:          22:11          Yeah, absolutely. I think climate adaptation is, is a big issue. Um,

Speaker 2:          22:17          and it's, it's both a financial issue. And it's an agricultural issue. So when Burkina Faso, we work with women who in a lot of times, particularly in Africa, you'll see that men are often engaged in what we call cash crops. So they grow a crop crop that can be sold at market and women are engaged in household food crops. And so we engage women and working a Faso in savings groups. So they get together on a regular basis. They save weekly, usually a very small amount, um, and they, they're able to pull that savings, then they can borrow from it if they need for an investment. Um, but at the end of the year, then they receive their savings back and they're able to invest in it. So as part of that project, we worked with those women on understanding the impacts of climate change in their region and helping them to modify or adopt, adapt what crops they're growing.

Speaker 2:          23:05          So we worked with a lot of wind, for example, to start growing cow peas or cassava or, and different kinds of, um, orange yams, which are much more drought resistance and tolerance. Given the changes that are having, a lot of times what happens particularly in these rural communities is that people have been engaged for generations in farming a certain type of crop and they really understand that crop and as climate change happens and they need to move into crops that are going to be more appropriate given what their new climate reality is, they don't have that level of skill and understanding of that crop. Um, and so helping them have the information on what crops are going to work for them now and how they should grow it and how to it et Cetera is an important part of our work. And then making sure they have the resources to invest in it.

Speaker 2:          23:50          It's very risky for smallholder farmers. You know, um, I, cassava is one of my, the things I dislike most in this world, um, because it's a very drought resistant crop and it grows almost everywhere. So a lot of people have a lot of incentive to grow cassava because um, it will come in no matter what and you, you will be able to feed your family on it. It is a very low nutrient cause office, like a Yam kind of yellow. Yeah. But it doesn't have the nutrients that yams do. Um, and particularly for young children it's hard to digest. So you see young children who eat a lot of cassava actually tend to be more malnourished then even though they're, they're getting a lot of calories because they can't digest them very well. They tend to be extremely malnourished. But people planted because it fills Belize. And so if we can give people the information they need on other crops that we'll do as well as cassava, but we'll have much more nutritional benefit for the household, like yellow and orange, sweet potatoes, um, like cow peas, which are extremely drought resistant. If we can help them to understand these new crops that they can be using, which are readily available in their areas and how to harvest them, not only will they potentially have a better harvest, but it will be more nutrient rich food for them.

Speaker 5:          25:04          Um, I was wondering about mobile financial services and, and device security. Like a lot of these cheaper android devices basically never get security updates. Um, have you found any practices that help protect people if they're acting as like the financial agent for their whole village of, of keeping their device secure?

Speaker 2:          25:24          Yes. Um, I would say the device security is probably pretty low on a lot of people's priority lists. Um, what is high and where I think we're seeing a lot of momentum is moving people towards a better, more and better smartphones. Um, so you see a lot of people, still, most people particularly in Africa are still using, well Africa, India, most developing countries are still using feature phones. So the big push is to try and get people on to smart phones, um, and to get people more access to data. Um, because even when people moved to smart phones, data can be very expensive still. So the short answer to your question is not really doing a lot on device security

Speaker 5:          26:07          feature phones, like more resistant to malware then typical smartphone.

Speaker 2:          26:16          I don't know the answer to that. My guess would be yes. Only because it doesn't have very many features. You know, they don't have very many features for people to mess with. Um, and usually then when you're using a feature phone, you're using USSD or SMS technology to access your accounts or to do your transactions so high. I was curious about something you said about uh, using blockchain for a medical records. I was curious what makes that specifically about technology specifically suitable that purpose versus, you know, some other database platform or some other system. Yeah, I think one of the things that makes blockchain interesting in that particular use case, and it's one we're still exploring, we haven't implemented yet, is the ability for those records to be transferable across borders and to be accessible through biometrics. So if a person, um, you know, returns to their home country, a lot of times when people, uh, when refugees cross borders, they don't take their national, they don't have documentation with them so they don't have their national ids, et Cetera.

Speaker 2:          27:15          So the ability to build biometrics into that and to make it accessible when people cross borders are what makes blockchain particularly interesting. In a lot of these cases, I'm sort of a, like the, you should only, I think a lot of people are very bullish on blockchain and I'm also bullish on blockchain, but I think people want to use it a lot of times when you could just use a regular database. And so, and there there's, so there is, um, and so, you know, I've heard people tell me, even if it's just a regular database, go ahead and put it in blockchain because that's where the world is moving. Um, and then other people have said, you know, it's, it's a complicated technology. If you could just use a database, just use the database. So we're probably still on the, just use the database side of things, but people are throwing me up. So I'm just, I'm hoping that's the right answer.

Speaker 2:          28:03          Let's help you gain insights from Yep. So I'll just repeat it in case the question was what, because we have such a large amount of data, what our position is on sharing that publicly. Um, which is a good question and I have a good answer because I was just meeting with our tech person this morning. Um, so we are in, we have a huge amount of data in different systems. So we're going through a process right now of cleaning that data. I think we're very open to sharing it. Um, in a couple of ways. One, we're open to anonymizing it and sharing it widely so that people can do research with it. Um, we're also open to sharing it and in ways that allow people to provide services to Pacific specific farmers. So for example, we have a lot of farm data in Uganda and we are working now actively on making that accessible to financial institutions so that they can identify farmers who need to invest in their farms and lend to them.

Speaker 2:          29:07          What we are, um, quite specific on is that that needs to be a relationship that the farmer understands and agrees to. So say, um, centenary bank is one of our partners in Uganda, which is a large bank national bank. So say centenary bank wants to access a farmer's data to see if they want to make a loan to them, that the farmer either needs to receive an SMS and say, yes, I consent to centenary or the farmer needs to be able to push their data. So they, the farmers talked to the centenary bank. If they want to send them their data, they can push it from the system. So the, there needs to be a consent process where the end user is able to consent. Because when we originally collected their data, we didn't understand, uh, you know, some of them may have started five years ago.

Speaker 2:          29:51          We didn't know what, what we could be doing with it. They didn't consent at that time to sharing it widely. Um, going forward, um, you know, we may have different kinds of consent protocols, but I think it's important. And this gets back to the blockchain thing a little bit. Um, for people don't understand all of the things you could be doing with their data and where their data could be going. And, um, even if you, if they sign a consent form, does, is that really meaningful consent if they don't understand what we're all talking about with this big data stuff. And so how can you make their data available but still give them some level of control over it. We talk a lot about particularly because, you know, we work sometimes in refugee situations, what are people's rights to anonymity, right? To be forgotten. Um, and what are the dangers that go along with people's state of being publicly available. So, um, anyway, it's something we think along well.

Speaker 4:          30:43          Um, so I grew up in farming in Florida and a lot of the industrialized techniques that we had were kind of makes sense because of economy of scale and heavy equipment and stuff like that. Um, how much of of that industrialized techniques, how many of those apply? And have you looked into, uh, any sort of research with more specific techniques, smaller techniques?

Speaker 2:          31:11          So that all depends. Um, and I'm going to say I'm not an agriculture expert. Um, but so things like data for farming is something that you could parse out pretty easily and cheaply. Um, other technologies like, um, I don't know. I'm trying to think. Um, like there's a lot of work that's been done, not necessarily by us, but like around cooperative ownership of technology, whether that technology is a large, um, what's the word I'm looking for? Harvest or harvest or there we go. Thank you. Um, or you know, other machinery, you know, cooperative ownership and cooperative movements are big in developing countries as well as in the u s um, but data I think is something that can be parsed out to the individual farmers so that they can take action on it. So to add onto that, I do think even in the developing world, farm fragmentation is an issue we deal with, um, particularly because of climate change as, as arable land is shrinking in some areas. Um, you know, you have a farmer, he has so much land, he has three sons. It gets divided among the three sons. They have three sons, it gets divided. And so there is a consolidation process that needs to happen in the developing world. Um, and it's a lot of what we talk about. Um, it gets to maybe some of the skills training opportunities because there needs to be off farm rural enterprise that can pull labor off of farms, allow for farm consolidation in a lot of countries to make smallholding farming

Speaker 6:          32:43          more profitable as somebody, as somebody at Google who mostly spends time, you know, thinking about consumer technologies and sometimes enterprise technologies in the development world. Um, I am curious what you've seen ouch. You know, in, in the developing world as far as interesting or surprising uses of technologies that we've developed here. You know, big products like, like Gmail or you know, android phones or you know, contacts and address book is, is the, the area where I work now, what have you seen out there? You know, them, them using the products that we've developed in interesting and surprising ways.

Speaker 2:          33:24          Good question. Um, I think it's interesting. I lived for seven years in Tanzania. I came home about two or three years ago and I was amazed how many people here don't use what's up. Like in the W in east Africa, what's up is the primary mode of communication and what's up is now being used and piloted for mobile money transfers. So, um, so I think there's a lot of interesting things that are happening in developing countries that aren't happening here. It's interesting. I went to, um, one of those like, Aha moments for me. I went to one of these women's savings groups in Kenya, um, and we had worked with them with a partner bank. Um, and so they were, they had a savings account, um, on their, on their mobile phone that they could deposit into. And so I was asking the woman, um, one of the women in this group, okay, you have a savings account.

Speaker 2:          34:13          What's the account you want to, you know, what type of financial product do you want next on your phone? You know, do you want access to credit? Do you want to insurance? Do you want Agricultural Credit? She said, just put them all on my phone and I'll decide what, you know, what I want to use. So the hunger for these tech solutions is really, is really, really high. I talked to a woman same day, um, in a different group who said, God, I had to turn Facebook off on my phone because, um, I was just using it too much. And this was, I had flown on an airplane to a secondary city. I had driven an hour. I had taken a boat across the lake and gotten to this rural community. It was like a four hour trek to get there. Um, and here's a woman telling me I use Facebook too much. I have to turn it off because it's distracting me. So the hunger for technology is really, really high in these communities. Um, and there's, I think sort of this myth that a lot of these communities aren't very tech savvy, but, um, they're really, um, taking up a lot of this technology.

Speaker 6:          35:07          Thanks. And I, and I have a another question too. As long as I'm up here you go. Google is full of idealistic people with software engineering skills. Um, if one of those people, you know, hypothetically wanted to put those skills to work and the growth and the growth number or poverty, um, what are the opportunities that are out there, you know, on either volunteer or fulltime basis or whatever.

Speaker 2:          35:30          One of my colleagues will be so excited that you asked. Um, we have a program in Grameen Foundation, inappropriately named Bankers Without Borders. Um, because it started in our early days when we were focused primarily on micro finance, but it is a volunteer program that lets working professionals volunteer their time, um, either here from the u s providing kind of remote assistance or traveling to a developing country to work with a local partner for, you know, two to three weeks. Um, and so it's a volunteer program and we work with our partners in developing countries who have needs for assistance and with professionals here to try and match them up. So, um, if you see be, she'll get you some information and anyone else who wants to volunteer their time and get you some information on the banker's without Borders program and you can sign up. And some of it's as, um, as, and time consuming as say we're working with a small business in east Africa that, um, is thinking about using the technology in a certain way and they just want to have a brainstorm session with some people.

Speaker 2:          36:32          And so they'll set up an ideation session, Grameen Bank, so that board as well. Um, and maybe try and find, you know, five or six professionals here in the US or in Europe who can just sit and on a, you know, a Skype call or a Webex and talk through with the CEO kind of what technology might fit his needs. Um, and then it could be everything from, we have people who do, do, you know, year long fellowships funded by their employers, um, you know, to sit, um, you know, in a partner and really work with them in depth over the course of a year and then everything kind of in between. So if you're interested in volunteering, definitely look at that PR program and sign up for it. It's really, it's really amazing. Great. Thank you. Thanks so much. I'm going to let the Google guy go first.

Speaker 7:          37:18          Uh, I want to understand how, uh, what kind of parameters that you look at, um, you know, on deciding do you want to service this country or this area or not? Cause I'm sure there's like a lot of areas that need, you know, your service. So how do you decide that?

Speaker 2:          37:33          That's a very good question. Um, I think one of the things for Grameen Foundation is that we are really looking at sustainable solutions. So we often have opportunities to work on initiatives that we think can benefit, um, you know, maybe 10, 15,000 people, but we don't understand long term how we would make that sustainable. Um, could we, could we embed it in a government could be embedded in a private sector for us. If we can't understand the longterm sustainability, um, it's a project that we would probably pass up on. Um, it's just not, and, and there are other groups who could do that and maybe do a good job and it has a benefit. But our longterm DNA is to look for something that can be long term sustainable. We are an organization that has a heavy tech history. Um, and so primarily we're looking at opportunities where we can identify ways to use technology, um, in ways that can maybe leapfrog or our fine, you know, disruptive innovations to solutions.

Speaker 2:          38:35          So that being said, you know, it's, it's sort of a case by case basis. Um, we almost always want a local partner on the ground, um, be that private sector or government or a, or a local entity, um, who can do the implementation and who can be the long term owner of it. The local partners reach out to you as do they initiate the first contact or do you use kind of see opportunities and then reach out to the, that really can depend. Um, you know, sometimes if we, if we have an opportunity, if you stayed puts out a call, we may go out and look for a particular partner. Um, other times somebody might come to us and say, um, so Mussolini is, is a good example of that there. The first all digital micro finance institution in Kenya. And so they came to us, um, saying, uh, you know, we're looking at [inaudible], we really want to build out an agricultural financing products.

Speaker 2:          39:25          So can you help us think through that? So we worked with them, um, and we had some EWB volunteers who worked with them to help think through what an agriculture finance project, a product would look like I'm enrolled and how they could roll that out across the organization and it's now become their most profitable product. So it works both ways a little bit. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks you guys so much for coming. I was really a worry. Nobody would come and then we're, nobody would ask any questions. So I really appreciate it. Appreciate your time and the work Google is doing. Cause I know many things that you guys do are really contributing to the work that we'd oversee. So thanks so much.
