Speaker 1:          00:06          Welcome to toxic Google. Uh, so today we have a, a special guest with us, Zaria Foreman, um, who, uh, uh, my wife grew up with her, so I've known her for a while, but, uh, I always remember a few years ago, um, a photo of her in front of working on one of her large scale drawings. I showed up on the front page of Reddit and created quite a buzz, like a just like, I think seeing the artist in front of this giant work of art, a big iceberg was just really visually striking and I feel like the, the momentum from that is still going and she's on a fresh off the, uh, another sold out show. Congratulations. Um, so yeah, here is Zaria Foreman to talk about her new work and uh, yeah, welcome.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58          Thank you for that intro. I yes, my mic is on. Okay. Um, I'm really honored and excited to be here and today. I thank you, Phil for inviting me. Where are you? There you are. And Sad. Um, and thank you all for coming. This is just, yeah, I'm really thankful to be here. So, um, I consider it my life's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work. And to that end, I've traveled to the polar regions to capture this unfolding story of ice melts and also to the equator to document the rising seas that are a result of the ice melts and my drawings exploring these moments of transition and turbulence, but also tranquility in the landscape, allowing viewers like you to connect emotionally with places that you might never have the chance to actually visit. And I choose to convey the beauty of these very remote regions as opposed to the devastation in the hopes that it will inspire people to want to help, uh, help protect and preserve them. So I'm just to start out, I want to play you something that I recorded on the Antarctic peninsula. Um, it's a sound piece that just premiered to my solo show in Seattle, Washington. Um, and I recorded in 2015 the winter on the Antarctic peninsula. And so really subtle sounds. So I invite you to close your eyes or just relax in whatever way feels comfortable for you.

Speaker 3:          03:22          So this sound is fondly referred to as ice is as you might be able to see if he squinted. Um, I've also heard it called Burgee Seltzer and ice sizzle, which I've adopted is my DJ name. Um, but when it is, is the sound of ancient air meeting new air, it's the sound of glacial ice melting and these tiny little air bubbles that are trapped inside of it breaking free. And also there's a whirring sound, which you may have heard in the background, and those are Gentoo penguins. So each of these tiny bubbles popping open contains a treasure trove of information for scientists. And I recently met with one of them named John Higgins, who is a professor of geosciences at Princeton University and Higgins and his colleagues can basically obtain the age of the ice by studying these bubbles. And what they do is use very careful chemical measurements to reconstruct both the local temperature and the ancient atmosphere.

Speaker 3:          04:27          So basically how much carbon dioxide and methane were there from the time when the ice bubbles were locked inside of the ice sheet. So the records from these archives show basically how our climate has changed in the past and what that might pretend for our future. So it's important information that we need to know and these ice bubbles are hundreds of thousands of years old. Then in this picture I'm holding a piece of ice that's a million years old actually. And he, he told me it was a million years old after he handed it to me. I was just like, oh, I got, don't melt my aunts. Um, but actually the results from John's latest trip, uh, suggest that he collected ice. That's two to two and a half million years olds. And it's no news to any of us that these massive ancient cooling systems that we have at our poles that can take millions of years to grow, are rapidly melting and that that could have devastating consequences and we know it actually already is having devastating consequences.

Speaker 3:          05:33          There is all kinds of horrible news out there about climate change. There is the fact that the past three years have been the hottest on record or that the polar bear population in the Arctic is in rapid decline. Um, and now we're faced with as an administration that is choosing to ignore these problems. I mean even just these last two weeks felt like apocalyptic to me. I was, I mean I'm sure you've heard about the earthquakes and the hurricanes and I was just in Seattle last week and there was literally ash falling from the sky, from the forest fires fires in Washington. And so, um, yeah, bad news. But I want to switch gears and tell you about an interview that I read recently where Al Gore is talking about how we're doing in this battle against climate change 10 years after an inconvenient truth. His first documentary and what he said actually surprise me, which is why I want to talk about it.

Speaker 3:          06:25          He said, even though we're behind on the scoreboard when it comes to climate change, that the momentum has shifted and that we're starting to win. And I think he's right. I think he's onto something because we do actually have a lot to celebrate. First, of course there's the Paris accord, which even though the u s has pulled out of, I actually think that's a good thing because what it did was galvanized the whole rest of the world, including most major US corporations to reaffirm their commitment to it. Um, Obama managed to permanently ban offshore drilling and most of the Arctic Ocean and part important parts of the Atlantic, which is a huge, when Iceland and Costa Rica are one on 100% renewable energy, solar power in Chile is selling for half the price of coal. Even just in the beginning of this year, we, um, uh, the world economic forum let us know that solar and wind is either the same price or even cheaper than then fossil fuels, at least 30 countries nationwide.

Speaker 3:          07:27          There's a long backlog. What are for electric cars, there are real solutions that exist and they're already starting. We're already starting to see benefits of them. And I think it's a pretty effective tactic to emphasize the positive, right? Like a bombardment of terrifying news, which I just threw at you is paralyzing. But focusing on the positive I think is empowering. So that's what I tried to do with my work to celebrate what is still here and to give you, give viewers the sense that it is still possible to do something to protect this earth. It sustains us. So with that mission in mind, um, my process always begins by traveling to these places at the forefront of climate change. And while I'm on site, I take thousands of photographs and then back in the studio, I work from both my memory of the experience as well as the photographs to create very large scale composition, sometimes 12 feet wide, like the one in this video.

Speaker 3:          08:37          Um, occasionally I'll like reinvent the water or the sky or maybe change the shape of the ice just a little bit to create like a balanced composition. Um, but I'd say 90% of the time I'm depicting the exact scene that I witnessed because I want to stay true to the landscape that actually existed at that point in time. Um, which just something to take note of is often very different by the time I finished the drawings several months later. Um, so I begin with a really simple pencil sketch just so I have a few major lines to follow, maybe the outline of the iceberg and the horizon line. Um, and then I typically jump in pretty quickly with the color layering pigments onto the paper and I smudge everything with my fingers and palms. Um, I tend to break the pastel into these sharp shards or I work with soft pastel.

Speaker 3:          09:32          I should have told you that. Of course it's basically like charcoal, but uh, colors. So I'll break it into these little sharp shards that I can use to render the finer details on top of the base layer of pigment that I've already put down. And typical paper used for soft pastel has a lot of tooth meaning a very like textured surface so that it's able to absorb as much pigment as possible. Um, I actually prefer to work on a much smoother paper than what most pestel artists would want because it allows me to get those finer details without the texture of the paper getting in the way. Um, the challenge with this though is that there isn't a lot of room for error or reworking since the paper can't absorb so much pigment. But I honestly enjoy this challenge because I think that I get so lost in the tiny details that I would just never know when to stop if you know, if the pigment in the paper didn't provide those kinds of limitations for me.

Speaker 3:          10:29          Um, so I am aware that, you know, most people can't access many of these really remote places that I draw. And so in a lot of ways the environmental issues there might seem remote and disconnected from their lives. So that's one reason why I choose to work on such a large scale to recreate the wonder of witnessing an iceberg or a glacier up close. And I rely on other specialists like scientists to make rational data driven arguments for why we must take action to protect our ecosystems. But through my work, I'm trying to make an appeal on a more elemental level. According to behavioral psychologists, much of our decision making comes from our emotions. And I think art has a special ability to tap into those emotions. And it's not just something I think it's scientifically proven that it does. So when I make these drawings, I'm trying to create immense images that are just overflowing with detail that draw you in and transport you.

Speaker 3:          11:47          Um, and an author named Elaine scarry, she's a Harvard English professor, wrote a book called on beauty and being just, and in it she talks about how, um, she suggested I should say that when we witnessed something really beautiful, be it a wave or a face or a poem or a glacier, that it causes an s what she calls a radical decentering. And she says, quote, when we see a beautiful thing, our own importance is diminished. It is not that we ceased to stand at the center of the world for, we never stood there. It is that we ceased to stand even at the center of our own world. We willingly cede the ground to the thing that stands before us. That is the exact experience that I hope to evoke through my work.

Speaker 3:          12:43          So this past last school year, I gave a series of lectures at Harvard University and in my preparation for my talks, I was scrolling through their environmental center's website and looking at their, um, climate week from 2015 there were a bunch of videos from, from it and there was one that was particularly compelling to me that featured a father and son duo, Bob Cohain on the right, who's the professor of international affairs at Princeton University and his son not on the left who works at, um, on climate issues that the environmental defense fund. And one thing that stood out to me that they both emphasized was this notion of momentum, the same momentum that I think Al Gore was talking about, that for there to be effective climate policies, we need people and parties from different arenas to work together in an ongoing way. So that's how I see my work fitting into the bigger picture.

Speaker 3:          13:41          I just want to be part of that conversation, helping to generate momentum and unity of purpose across boundaries of discipline and geography and political affiliation. So I guess by sharing these moments of stillness, paradoxically I'm hoping to help generate momentum in their talk. I also found it really touching to see how one Cohain had passed the torch onto the other because I think it taps into something essential about climate change work, which is its purview is intergenerational. The work is about passing the torch and thinking ahead several generations. And I think perhaps I might be particularly attuned to that dynamic because of the debt that I owe to my mother. Rena baths, foreman. She was a fine art landscape photographer and in the last 10 years her of her life, um, her work focused on the Arctic and she passed that torch onto me. My mother's love of photography just propelled her to the most remote, far flung places on the planet that she could possibly find.

Speaker 3:          14:55          And my family and I were fortunate to join and support her on those adventures from riding camels through northern Africa to mushing near the North Pole. She always said that she was a polar bear and a past life. And I never doubted that to be true. She could just stay out for hours on end with like frozen eyelashes and a giant smile on her face. And the rest of my family was like, I'm hungry and cold. Um, but she just loved it. So in August of 2010 and 11, she and I were planning an Arctic expedition together to Greenland called chasing the light. It was to be the second ever Arctic expedition with the mission of creating art inspired by the dramatic geography there. And the first was led in 1869 by an American painter named William Bradford. And what was unique about that trip was that its main purpose was art as opposed to science or exploration, which is what was happening in that day.

Speaker 3:          15:56          So my mom thought, well, wouldn't it be fascinating to Mirror Bradford's for journey and travel up the northwest coast of Greenland to seek inspiration from the same landscape nearly 150 years after Bradford had. So she and I were in the very early stages of planning this trip when she was diagnosed with brain cancer. And the cancer pretty quickly took over her body and her mind, and she passed away six months later. But during those six months, during those months of her illness, her dedication to the expedition never wavered. And so it felt like a duty to me. Like I felt responsible to carry out this mission in her honor, which I did in August of 2012 leading a group of artists and scholars on a four week expedition.

Speaker 3:          16:50          My mother's affection for the landscape really echoed throughout my own experience in Greenland. And I felt both the power but also the fragility of the landscape. I mean, the sheer size of the icebergs is humbling and the ice fields, they like vibrate with movement and sound in a way that I never expected. That's what prompted me to bring my recording equipment and my more recent trips so I could bring that back to you. And it's also why I decided to expand the scale of my work to give viewers that same sense of awe that I had experienced.

Speaker 3:          17:32          The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels, which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest lying islands. One year after my trip to Greenland, I decided to fly to the Maldives, which is the lowest and flatus country and the entire world. And while I was there, I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work, drawings of waves lapping along the coast of a nation, a whole nation that could be entirely underwater within this century. While I was there with my collaborators, we shared the concept of our project with children at the Iskander elementary school, the nation's Capitol called Molly. And we basically just invited them to document their landscape as it transforms throughout their lifetime. Um, and hopefully that can help to bring awareness to their island, which is actually still very much needed, surprisingly enough. And I'm also just help them kind of inwardly, emotionally process what is happening around them.

Speaker 3:          18:44          Last winter, I had the honor of serving as the artist and residents aboard the National Geographic explorer in Antarctica. I've traveled to many stunning places, but Antarctica is just in a category of its own. The ice, just like radiated a sapphire blue, as you can see in this video. And it just took my breath away. It's what inspired a whole body of work that I just completed, that I worked on for the last 18 months. Um, and I'll just show you a time lapse of one of those pieces. Um, it's called Wale Bay. It was inspired by a place called Oil Bay, uh, that's on the Antarctic peninsula. And the bay is situated near a glacier that's calving icebergs into the sea as all glaciers eventually do. But the wind and water currents carry the icebergs directly into the bay because of where it's situated. And since the bay is kind of shallow, the icebergs will scrape against the sea floor and become what's called grounded, which basically means they remained there until they've melted completely, which is a process that can take years if the icebergs are large enough, like, like this one.

Speaker 3:          19:57          Um, and bays that enclose icebergs, like these are called iceberg graveyards, which to me just seems like a metaphor for the bigger picture. Um, you know, I had the opportunity to ride around this bay for two hours in a small Zodiac boat. This is a video that I took there. A Zodiac has a little rubberized like 12 foot boat. Um, and you, you'll actually start to see the iceberg on the righthand side come into view. That's the iceberg from the drawing that you just saw me making. Um, it's from a slightly different angles, so if you don't recognize it, it's not my fault. Um, but yeah, we got to ride around for two hours just weaving around the most intricately sculpted, glowing blue icebergs I have ever seen. I mean, the, the longer that they stay there, the more the water and the wind sculpt these blocks of ice into just other worldly shapes. And I shot like thousands of photographs, um, at times I had to just force my camera into my lap so I could simply be present and take in the overwhelming beauty of it all. And so I hope that my drawings as much as you can see on these screens can offer you a similar experience.

Speaker 3:          21:13          Um, so this past October I had the opportunity see Antarctica from a whole different perspective. NASA invited me to join them on operation ice bridge, which is the largest airborne survey of earth's polar ice. Um, we flew 12 hours every single day that the weather permitted on the DC, which has the most comprehensive suite of instruments ever flown on long range flights, including laser radar, an infrared sensor, digital photography, and something called a groove emitter that houses Einstein's brain. But it like measures gravity somehow. I don't know. Um, and it was just, I mean it was an incredible experience. It was humbling to witness the science team and air crews dedication to their seriously hard and grueling work and the data collected provides crucial information about ice loss. Basically what the melting of ice sheets could mean for sea level rise and what the melting of sea ice could mean for the entire global climate system.

Speaker 3:          22:22          This year, the Antarctic Sea ice loss has been particularly swift. We even had to make some last minute modifications to one of our flight plans to account for the significantly diminished cis when NASA measured its extent for this time of year, it was at the lowest level ever recorded and reliable satellite history, which dates all the way back to 1979 and since that year, since 1979, the planet has been shedding massive amounts of cis annually that equal the amount of, um, an area larger than the state of Maryland. The scale of this loss is difficult to comprehend. Um, and similarly, my sense of perspective was completely warped as we flew over the ice. And just to give you an example of that, this is a photo from one of our flights over glacier called land glacier and it covers the equivalent of 54 football fields in that photo is just, I mean, it's crazy to me.

Speaker 3:          23:22          It looks like a little crumble advice like the sidewalk, but that little blue crack is probably a hundred feet wide. Um, so this past April, I was actually able to join NASA is ice bridge team again on some of their art dick missions. And we flew over, um, ice sheets, CIS and glaciers, Arctic Canada and Greenland. And it was just, I mean, totally thrilling to fly once again, only 1500 feet above the ice that's there. The instruments need to be 1500 feet. So it's, it's actually pretty low for a plane and you really get to see the detail and it was just like so exciting for me to compare the ice to it, southern counterpart, um, but also just reconnects with the science team and the air crew and um, kind of chilling to learn of some of their more recent discoveries such as a giant crack that is forming in the Peterman glacier, which could in the future.

Speaker 3:          24:22          This is a picture of the crack. Um, so it could, if it splits off the shelf, you mean a new Ice Island? Basically a giant iceberg that's twice the size of Manhattan findings from this close to a decade now. Long project are numerous and some of them mind blowing to me. For instance, they found a canyon larger than the Grand Canyon under Greenland's ice sheet, just like we had no idea that was there. It was just hiding under the ice sheet bigger than the Grand Canyon. Um, but the most significant data from the project have shown that the entire West Antarctic ice sheet has likely entered an unstable state and might now be in irreversible decline. And although the timing of that retreat is unknown, it's still a powerful reminder that we've entered a new era with significant changes on the horizon.

Speaker 3:          25:23          Our president has already begun to defund NASA climate research and the lead scientist at iceberg named Nathan cards recently emailed the team and I to say, quote, in these uncertain times, it is vitally important that we reach the hearts and minds of people around the world to communicate the importance of the work that we're doing. Right. So I just want to thank you for having this opportunity to share not only their really important mission, but also my own work. Um, and I hope that, you know, you'll spread it as much as you can and it's just an honor to, to speak to such an influential audience. So when I was in Greenland in two back in 2012, that first trip, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice and now she remains a part of the landscape that she loved so much, even as it two passes and takes on new forms. Among the many gifts that my mom gave me was the ability to focus on the positive rather than dwell in the negative. And honestly, that lesson has rarely felt more necessary than now. And yes, it's become far more challenging to stay positive since January especially. But I'm doing my best and I encourage others to do the same. And former Secretary General Ban, Ki Moon said at the most recent climate change conference in Morocco, that action on climate change has become unstoppable. And he's absolutely right. And those are the words that I just keep reminding myself,

Speaker 2:          27:08          mmm.

Speaker 3:          27:09          On our family travels. Every time that we came across a really spectacular view, my mom would do this thing and I apologize in advance because I'm going to have to get loud. She would go, oh my God. And that in taste cause I sound exactly like hers. Um, but it was, she's, it was special. Like she saved it for only the best of the best. And so it would happen once, usually maybe twice if we were lucky on a four to six week trip on each four to six week trip. And so every single time we approached a really beautiful view, my dad and my sister and I would like glance at her wondering if it passed the test. I tried to uphold her reverence, her legacy of drawing attention to the beauty of these remote places. And I tried to embody her, resolve an intrepid newness. I am so utterly grateful for the time that I had with her and also for the time that we all have to appreciate what is around us and to take action to protect it. Thank you. So, but what are we going to do? A Q and. A, but I also have, um, a video piece that is also premiering currently and my solo show in Seattle. And it's kind of subtle. I recorded it on the Antarctic peninsula, same place where I did that drawing that I showed you the timelapse up. Um, and so I'm just gonna let it play in the background while you guys ask me questions. And here it is.

Speaker 2:          28:56          Maybe here we go.

Speaker 4:          29:11          Is there ever a question about a technology and how it's been used to amplify your message? I'm Seth talked about reddit. Oh, I know what the campaign that you raised money too for the trip to Greenland. Um, and then now with Youtube, uh, can you talk a little bit more about how technology is helping, uh, with the momentum as you say?

Speaker 3:          29:32          Yeah. Um, yeah, a few years ago my, as Seth mentioned, my work kind of went viral on the Internet then I have still to this don't really know how it happened, but I'm grateful for it. Um, and the momentum that that started hasn't really ever stopped. And, um, I mean I think like I had done enough work in the 10 years previous to kind of like back to back that up. Like it was like a ripe time for it to happen. Um, but I'm certainly really grateful that it did cause it just helped. I mean, it's so easy to spread these kinds of messages really far, um, across the planet, across the globe. And, um, yeah. And so I really use, you know, like especially Instagram, social media as a tool to, to share, you know, these the missions I went on with NASA and also just the work that I'm doing. Um, what was it? Did I, did I answer everything you ask? Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah. Oh, also, I shouldn't say that like Instagram itself has really become, I think, like the best way for artists especially to promote their work because it's such, it's such a visual platform. So, um, yeah, I mean I've sold a lot of work on Instagram, which is, you know, that never would have happened 10 years ago. It's just interesting how things have changed.

Speaker 5:          30:46          Hi. Hi. First of all, thank you for your very beautiful work and your positive energy, uh, on a topic that I think is pretty tough and scary. Um, my main question is, with your work, what is your main goal? Is it to document and share or to inspire or are you urging people to take action? Like just people like us or organization or politics?

Speaker 3:          31:10          Yeah, good question. Um, my main purpose is to share, to give viewers a place, a time and a moment to feel like they're, they're like they're transported to these places that are otherwise like so not connected to our everyday lives. Um, and to ideally stir up an emotional connection because like I said, you know, when you, when you have an emotional connection with something, when you love something, you want to protect it. And so that's the idea is that I spur that emotional connection and then they go on to take action. And I do, you know, I'll, I'll offer things, I'll give websites, I'd donate a percent of my sales to three fifty.org, but I have a whole page on my website that's like, here's how you can cut down your carbon footprint. Um, but I feel like there's a lot of that out there, which is awesome.

Speaker 3:          31:59          And that's not like my main purpose. Even though, yeah, of course I want to direct people in the right way so that they can take action, but I'm trying to translate the, the debt, like the data is out, like we know the science, but somehow still, almost half of our planet doesn't believe it or just doesn't want to see it. And so clearly that hard science isn't enough. So I'm trying to just offer, you know, the best way that I can communicate the importance of that and the, and the scientific stuff that might not be as easy to digest and have an emotional connection with. Thank you. Yeah, that's very great. I know, me too.

Speaker 5:          32:40          Yeah, thank you as well. It's really inspiring, not only to see some of the context behind what you're doing, but also how you do it. So I liked that you touched on both pieces and actually how you work with the, um, pastels and, and what the reasoning behind it and to touch on your last point of, um, kind of accessibility of the message. Right? So I think the data is out there, the science is out there that's very difficult for a lot of us to understand and many more to understand. Right? And so I think sometimes these decisions are emotionally driven rather than driven by the data and the science backing it up. And I'm just curious, I think the way that you're going about it kind of tried to create an emotional reaction is probably making this a more accessible message then maybe NASA message or something to a much bigger audience. And I was wondering if you could just touch upon that, if you've seen that you're able to, um, make that message more accessible, um, or maybe any lessons learned do you have from making that a more accessible message?

Speaker 3:          33:39          Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and that's exactly what I'm trying to do. So thank you. I'm glad that you think gets it. It's doing that. Um, and I, uh, a big part of that too is the, the, the realistic way that I draw, like the way that I'm, I'm drawing all the details. It's not abstract. It's, um, accessible not only to people who aren't interested in science but also, um, people outside the art world bubble. Um, I get a lot of like people who want to, who have purchased my work and you want to our first time art buyers, like they just want to be able to see that image in their home. Um, cause you know, I think there, there is a lot of art out there that's not so accessible and this is just like you look at an image and, and you know, you know what it's about and you can have a connection to it because it's part of our planet.

Speaker 3:          34:25          We all live here. So yeah, I mean in every facet I try to make it as accessible as possible. And I do think that it's, um, succeeding in that way. You know, hopefully I get, you know, of course the only people only tell me, you know, that they love my work. I don't tell me if they hate it. So, but, um, but yeah, I mean I have had a bunch of people come up to me and just say like, thank you. Like I had no idea. Or like now I've changed these actions in my life because of what you said. And so that's like the most gratifying things that I can hear. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          35:04          Hi. Hi. You said that you take thousands of images and you have access to videos. So how do you choose which images to actually draw?

Speaker 3:          35:14          Oh, good question. Um, that's, it's probably the hardest part of my job, I think. Um, it takes hours and hours of just scrolling through and editing because I, I mean, at this point I have like lifetimes over enough material to, to continue making work for, for many lives. And, um, and, and I still want to go back and, and continue be inspired by these places selfishly. But, uh, it's, it's hard to describe because I think a lot of the time it's just like a feeling like I'll be scrolling through images and then all of a sudden something will really stand out to me. Um, and so that's often how it happens is just like the composition just feels right. It's not about math or like, um, you know, art theory about the horizon line has to be one third up from the bottom. It's just, I was just like, oh, there's something about that that just like has the right feeling. Um, yeah. And it, and it can be hard because even I have an endless amount of photos and video, but then I can also crop them endlessly and zoom in endlessly. So, yeah, it's definitely the hardest part. I spent a lot of time scrolling through and staring at their computer screen and lots of icy pictures.

Speaker 7:          36:29          I'm wondering what comes next after the icebergs and the disappearing islands in the Maldives where you sort of stay on theme with environmental changes or maybe do something else entirely?

Speaker 3:          36:39          Um, yeah, I mean, I, you know, I can't tell the future, but I do think that I could continue with ice and sea level rise for the rest of my life. Um, I don't feel like, and like, and until it stops inspiring me, I'm going to continue with it. And I don't see that end anywhere in sight. And just because there, there's so much more that I still have to learn about rendering. It's different textures and surfaces and, and that's what excites me and just to like learn something new with every piece. And so immediately what's next is, um, from all these trips I did with NASA, I gathered a bunch of aerial footage and photography and, um, and I'll be making a series that's from that perspective. So some of those photos you saw it all kind of look like that. It's a little bit more abstract looking and won't, it's, it's real.

Speaker 3:          37:27          It won't look abstract. But, um, I'm curious to see, you know, how that all unfolded and it's exciting for me, but that'll be my next exhibit in New York, um, in October of 2018. So, but yeah, like I said, there's just so many textures and surfaces and ways that it's like melting. I mean water has so many different forms and, um, I just don't see an end in sight where it, where it will stop inspiring me. And I also think, you know, climate change is like arguably the largest crisis we face as a global community. And I don't see that going away anytime soon. And so it's important to me to connect whatever I'm doing to something, um, you know, meaningful for the rest of the world. So I see myself doing that forever. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          38:15          Anyone else?

Speaker 8:          38:17          So when you're drawing, are we making a conscious effort to stop yourself from exploring and transforming the image, the photograph or like how the hell do you trade off between kind of maintaining the accuracy of the photograph and going into an abstract thing?

Speaker 3:          38:33          Yeah. Um, I mean, I'm, I, I want to portray the exact landscape that I witnessed because I'm trying to stay true to it. And, you know, I just want to be honest about what I saw and tried to give people that same experience. So the only time I ever, um, you know, elaborate or change it, it's a very small percent of the time, but it's really just like if I have this beautiful image and I feel like is like really more powerful than anything else, you know, um, that I've been looking through. But there was like, oh, the corner of the iceberg goes off the corner of the image and I don't, I want it to stay contained inside with a little bit of background behind it. It's just that just to like artistically creative bonds composition so that it gives you, you know, as much of a, uh, a wonderful, comfortable, loving feeling as possible.

Speaker 2:          39:24          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          39:26          Hi. Sorry, ma'am. Could you talk a bit more about, um, the collaboration with NASA in that, how did that come about for you as an artist? Yeah, so, um, one day I got an email from, um, from NASA is, uh, he was a navigator is basically their lead navigator for airborne terrestrial exploration, not extraterrestrial. So like basically flying, exploring arth from, from flight, you know, in flight. And he just reached out. He came from a family of artists and I mean he didn't say that in his first email, but he was just like, Hey, I found your work on, I saw your Ted talk on apple TV in my, you know, preparations and research for my next trip to Antarctica. And I thought you shouldn't come with us. And so here's my phone number, call me. I had, if I remember very clearly this day, I had a friend we know coworking with me in my studio and I was like, wow, I read him the email.

Speaker 3:          40:22          He was like, oh my God. I was like, I think I'm going to call him immediately, but I kinda think this is a hoax. And I called him and he had this like radio voice and I was like, this just can't be a real. Um, and after several conversations in several months and lots of planning, I still didn't think it was real on the plane flying down to Punta Arenas, Chile, where I was going to meet the team. And it really wasn't until like the, that evening when I walked into the first science meeting that they have every night at 6:00 PM where I was like, oh, this is, I'm not being kidnapped there. An appointment of NASA scientists here. So yeah, I, I mean I'm just, I'm so grateful for this opportunity and to collaborate with such an incredible project and, um, and I was so intimidated to at first to, to go meet a bunch of, you know, I'm an artist, I'm a weird, quirky artists to go meet a bunch of NASA scientists was like really scary, but they were so warm and welcoming and a bunch of them had even like known my work before and we're really excited to meet me and, and you know, way more than I expected.

Speaker 3:          41:25          They really valued the, you know, understood the value in communicating their message in a different way that they haven't been able to do. So I think all of them are like really grateful that I was there and doing, doing what I'm doing. So it's, it's been a really incredible experience. I'm actually going there tonight. Right after I leave here, I'm getting a hundred chain and I'm going to be speaking at Nasa Goddard tomorrow. So I'm excited to see all of them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          41:57          All right. Thank you. Hi. Um, there's definitely like an element of scale in your work and I think, uh, also in how you're, you're really amplifying the message and um, you know, this change, I think like you, you had an image up there that was, you know, some cracks and you're like, that crack right there, it could be a hundred feet across. Like I'm curious about how you think about scale, like did your work start at a smaller scale and um, yeah, just more on that.

Speaker 3:          42:27          Yeah, I, I um, I consider it, I guess like my professional work began in my last year in college and I was working pretty big actually. I made a couple of, um, eight foot, you know, step six by eight foot pieces for my senior show. And, um, and I was drawing a really big, you know, sky's storms, hurricanes, um, from like whether photography and, um, so scale has always been important to me, but especially after I got back from that first trip to Antarctica and the winter of 2015, I was just like, how can I do this landscape justice, um, without going as hugely massive as possible, as you know, as, as much as I can afford and can do in my studio. Um, because it's just so epic and it's like you can use all these, you know, grandiose words and it's like nothing really describes it.

Speaker 3:          43:20          And that's why I'm trying to draw them because I don't know how to put it into words, but, um, so yeah, I feel like the scale is really important to make you feel like you're, you're, you know, standing in front of a glacier, you really, you need that scale. It's so important. And so, um, I do work, you know, I make smaller pieces is kind of more like studies, but also just because there are so much easier to transport and, and so, um, but the, the, the larger ones are really where my heart is. I love to spend a whole year working on one piece, making it as large as I possibly can. So if, you know anyone that wants to pay for that, but yeah, it's one thing that people tend to comment on. So I'll just say something about it is like there isn't a lot of the drawings or most of them, there isn't really a sense of scale because I'm not putting a little penguin in there, a little boat.

Speaker 3:          44:10          Um, and, and I, I kinda, you know, I, part of me wishes that there were something I could put in there that didn't seem cheesy like a penguin, um, that would offer that sense of scale. But, uh, on the flip side, I think it's kind of Nice sometimes because there, there are drawings that I showed you in this presentation where, um, like an iceberg was maybe as big as the drawing itself. Um, but people think it's like when people ask me, they're like, how big is that? Because it looks like a mountain range to me. I'm like, oh, that's great. It was this pig. And I actually like when they think it's like larger than than life. Um, but I love especially drawing at like a one one ratio as much as possible, meaning the scope, the scale of the ice was actually as big as I'm drawing it. Uh, cause it just allows me to really get into all the nitty gritty details and just like show you show viewer is exactly what the ice texture it looks like up close.

Speaker 2:          45:05          Thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          45:11          First I think Google should pay for that gigantic

Speaker 3:          45:14          drawing somehow. I'll, I'll, we'll email after.

Speaker 4:          45:19          Yeah. So, uh, I, I really liked how you shared the sound with us and it sound is it, it seems like it's definitely, um, uh, an attribute that will help people get more embarrassed. Um, and so I'm curious if you collaborating also with people that can create VR experiences or interactive experiences and sort of like scale it in a different way. I like you, you know, uh, the topic and everything, but you can probably share it yeah. In different mediums as well.

Speaker 3:          45:52          Yeah, it is definitely a direction that I see myself going in especially, I mean, this exhibit that's up right now, um, is the first one where I've shown that sounded piece, I played you as my first sound piece. The video piece I was playing during the Q and a is my first video and um, the exhibit in Seattle right now, I was really trying to create that kind of immersive experience like you mentioned because it just allows you to feel like you're, they're that much more and Vr is like almost at this point, like the ultimate of that. And so, yes, I would, I would really love to venture into that arena. And, you know, I've, I've been, you know, just starting conversations with people and thinking about projects in the works, but nothing is, is planned yet. But yeah, definitely in direction I want to go in.

Speaker 2:          46:38          Okay.

Speaker 3:          46:42          I feel like everyone here asked a question.

Speaker 3:          46:57          Thank you. Oh yeah. Really fast. And I feel a little bad at asking after a, you've explained why the scale is so important, but can we purchase prince anywhere and well, yeah, no, that's a great sense. Okay. Yeah. Right now. So I'm art star.com sells. My friends used to be [inaudible]. Now we also have, um, a new print that just came out of that, that first slide, if you, I dunno if I want to pull it up there, but I'm the one that I first showed you of me. Like I'm in the corner drawing it. It's one big, the of the time lapse drying. Um, that one is a new print now that's offered through Winston walked her in Seattle. So you just have to call the gallery. But um, yeah. And we're, we're launching a new print soon, and yeah, and then there'll be new drawings available as I start making this next series. Thank you.
