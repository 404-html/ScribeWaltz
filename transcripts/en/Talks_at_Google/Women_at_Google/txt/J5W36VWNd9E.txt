Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Krista tippett is here with us today, which is just absolutely amazing. Um, I'll read a little bit about her first and then we will just dive right into it. Um, Krista Tippett is a Peabody award winning broadcaster, national humanities medal list and the New York Times bestselling author she founded and leads the on being project hosts globally, esteemed on being public radio show and podcast and curates the civil conversations project and emergent approach to conversation and relationship across the differences of our age. Her books include my favorite becoming wise, an inquiry into the mystery and art of living and Einstein's God conversations about science and the human spirit. And I think literally even just with those two titles, you see this beautiful and vast spectrum that Christa covers. And that is so kind of perfect for us here at Google, literally from mystery and spirit to the human spirit to Einstein.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       Like it's, it's just so perfect to have her here in conversation here. We're so lucky. And I think really we were talking the other evening about, um, what it means to inquire and the idea of asking these questions, these fundamental questions, questions that get to the essence of what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be human together? And kind of what are the lessons we can learn in this practice with everyone. So we'll look at that today. But first I'll just share a quick funny little moment, which was, as I was preparing for this, I've been listening to Christopher years a couple of years ago as I was actually founding the lab, I found myself listening to Krista. I'd, I'd, uh, I'd discovered her then rediscovered her and the project. And every day I was, it was kind of over break.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       I was listening to one a day or even two a day, sometimes her podcasts. And what I found is they were so enlivening and they really helped birth the empathy lab. So I feel like I wouldn't be, it wasn't for her. So it's a treat to have you here. But what was, is thinking about preparing for this. And I was like, should I go back and listen to every podcast and find my favorite moments? And, and then it just would have been like this incredible mountain of beauty that I would have, you know, clearly like fallen under because there was just too much there. So what was beautiful was actually reflecting on the thing that touches me most about her conversations and these beautiful moments that unfold between her and other people even across distances. Um, or just this in the moment that you're listening, what comes alive in you, what echoes in you in the days, weeks, months, years to follow and how these kind of sparks come alive in us.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       So that leads us to this form of listening that I feel like I really learned to listen even just in being presence with her before knowing her. And I feel like we're all so lucky to have her speaking to us about listening today. And so I'll just start with one of her quotes that really I feel touched as the core of what this art is all about, which is listening is about being actively present. It's not just about being quiet. I meet with others with a life, right? I meet others with the life I've lived, not just with my questions. So let's welcome Krista with open minds and hearts and of course our ears and share more for gracious wisdom with us. And of course we are trying something a little different today with this kind of intimate gathering. So what we'll do is crystal, we'll share a bit, we'll probably go back and forth and then we'd love to open it up as a real conversation for all of us to live in together. So if you have any questions, definitely listen. Don't think about them the whole time, but as they rise up in the room, please feel brave and courageous. This is what this moment is about. So thank you and welcome Krista. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:35       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       well, it's exciting to be here. Um, I love this invitation. I feel like I made too many notes and so we just, so Danielle and I just liked, cause I really loved our conversation and I, the more I do this, the longer I live, the more I trust that. And I liked being on both sides of it. So I've just said to her, I want her to interrupt me and ask questions and that I really would like to open it up and be in conversation with you. Um, the question, the kind of requests was to talk a little bit about the art of listening and you know, I'm a person who listens for a living, but you know, one of the things what you were saying about that experience of the podcast of listening to the podcast, I mean I listening is about presence, which I'm going to say again, but what's so fascinating and you and I talked about this the other night, is that, I mean, I am usually not in the room.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       In fact, I'm often halfway across the world from the people I'm in conversation with. And, um, the technology of radio of podcast. I mean, so, you know, these are not physical experiences but, but my conversations, um, because of the topic and then because the medium allows for this are very, very intimate and they're intimate between me and the person I was speaking with. And then it's an intimate experience, you know, one of the kind of the magic of radio and of course that's just the old fashioned word for podcasting, um, is, uh, is that it is profoundly individual and also absolutely communal at the same time. And there's also kind of a time shift that goes on, right? It defies time because, because in the moment that you listen, you're in that room when it happened. And you know, I think of a conversation, what I hope for every conversation I have is that it is an adventure and that something will happen that will surprise both of us.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       And if you, as a listener, you also are there for that moment of surprise. Um, so that's, I was thinking a lot about that actually as I was thinking about being here because, because we're talking about human presence and, and there is this miracle, but it's absolutely possible with and through and in technology. And I think that what you're about is figuring out how to amplify that and to explore all the possibilities in that. Um, so I think of listening as a basic social art. Um, I think of social art and virtues as spiritual technologies. Um, and that assists to just a tool for the art and craft of living and have it for a deep end more generative, which is a nuance on productive father. It can be productive, but a more deepened generative, higher quality human experience. And, um, the interesting thing, so it is a basic social art.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       I think it's something we know how to do or we've known how to do, but we've actually unlearned. Um, uh, I think that growing up in this culture, we learn to that listening is, or the experience we have, which we internalize to be about what listening is about, is to be quiet while the other person says what they have to say until it's time for me to say what I have to say. But actually, um, listening is not about being quiet, being quiet as a side effect. Um, listening is about being present. Um, and as I just said, interestingly, you can be present online as well. Um, and so because we've kind of unlearned this thing, um, I think it's interesting to think about what era. It's really basic component parts. Um, for me, um, listening brings a quality musters equality of generous generosity. You know, and in a spiritual technology is always, is always working in two directions.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       It's inner work as much as it's outer work. Um, so especially in this world, we can have it now and there's so many things we're fighting about in so many things were fearful about. Um, this is not as easy as it sounds. Right? In fact, it's not very instinctive. Um, you know, to me a generous listener, it definition of that would be wanting to understand the humanity behind the war, the words of the other. So it's not just about the words that are going to pass between us and wanting to bring your own best words and your best ideas into the conversation you have to muster. Also in yourself. A real curiosity to bring that kind of generosity to bear. And again, this is really kind of a wizard muscle. The thing about curiosity, you can't actually fake it. And again, whether we're online or offline, um, we add an animal level when we encounter another human being, absolutely know whether they're really curious or whether they're just asking us a question.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       We know that in our bodies. Um, so really like even just this basic, this basic component of the art of living, of being curious, uh, becomes kind of a spiritual discipline. Or if you don't like that language, it becomes a muscle that we need to flex and flex so that it again, um, starts to feel like instinct starts to feel natural. Um, listening involves, um, vulnerability. I mean one litmus test, um, about whether you have actually gotten yourself to a curious place that you can ask whether you go into a room, whether that's a virtual room or a physical room, is are you willing to be surprised? And again, we walk into all of our spaces these days, so guarded, so clear about what we have to say, what we have to present, what we have to protect. And also so clear about what we think those other people stand for.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       Um, so to, to be willing to be surprised as it is an unnatural move right now. And then, and then the final piece of this that I want to add is that we actually have to be that actually in, in many of the spaces we are currently working with and living in and meeting each other. And it wouldn't actually be reasonable to ask other people to surprise themselves, their surprise us. Um, so, so, so there's a piece of this I think that get the, that the, that the social art of listening is intimately connected with the virtue of hospitality. Uh, another spiritual technology. One thing I love about hospitality, it's kind of a gateway to all the other great virtues, compassion or love. Um, you actually though it's much easier. It's an easier entry point. You don't actually have to love someone to be hospitable towards them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       You don't have to agree with them to be hospitable towards them. You don't even have to like them to be hospitable towards them. But we know in our analog lives, um, and I think maybe we're learning in our online lives that have the space you create, um, absolutely limits or expands what is possible that will happen there. There is a difference between creating a space with a welcome and an ethos or just opening the door so that anything can happen. Um, something that's very clear to me that I think a lot about that it's fun to say in this room is that, uh, you know, to me, uh, the, the digital world is just a new canvas for the old human condition. There's nothing that happens online that doesn't have an offline, although things can absolutely get amplified. You know, it's the good, the bad and the ugly we're encountering, you know, but trolls, like we have, we all walk around with trollish places in our psyches.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       Now they have this public, this public room to run around and write. Um, that's like visuals, just like, um, but so, so, so there's this, so this has always been true, um, that, that the quality of the encounter of the listening, of the relationship, of the possibility of what can happen between two people, whether they agree with each other or don't or similar don't. It's very much effected by the, by the spirit, by creating the space. Um, and so, and I think there's just a real need it in, again, in the physical world, as much as in the online world to create alternative spaces. And I'll say it again, where it would be reasonable to ask any of us to walk in and bring our best selves and, and be looking for the good and the other, um, and be willing to surprise ourselves and be truly inviting other people to surprise us.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       Um, so that's, those are, I guess the other thing I would want to just mention that I absolutely think of, um, in terms of a companion to, to listening is the, um, the art of asking better questions. Um, in, in American life, we, we mostly trade in the answers and we actually mostly trade in competing answers and a lot of what, uh, calls itself a question or presents as a question is actually, or is actually art, not questioning. It's kind of tools or weapons to incite or corner or catch, you know, or at least entertain. And this is certainly true in my field of journalism. The, the question is often about how it makes the journalist look and not really about what it's going to elicit. What I want to point out and that spectacle, which we're all very familiar with, is how powerful a form of words a question is.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Um, the way I've come to experience it as that questions elicit answers in their likeness, answers rise or fall to the questions they meet. And in then in the negative, uh, expression of that, which we're very familiar with from media. Um, you know, it's very, it's almost impossible to meet a simplistic question with anything but a simplistic answer. It's almost impossible to transcend a combative question. But the positive, the positive side of that is that it's almost impossible to resist a generous question. And we've all had that experience that there is something life giving about asking a better question. Um, can I ask you? Yeah, yes, yes, yes. You May. Yeah, I know, right? You're like, if it's a good one. Yeah. Cause it generous. Yeah. So what I'm hearing is you're speaking is, um, is there's this sense of an opening that happens when there is a generous presence.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       There is an opening in the question. There's an opening in the space between you or things can be put there. I'm so curious. Um, you mentioned that the other night with the word you set an intention before you go in and the listening before the listening and I'm just curious how, how does that work for you? How do you cultivate that opening in yourself? That invitation? Because it is that first step of hospitality is open the door and come into this space that we can be in together. I'm just, when I'm having a conversation or an interview when you're having a conversation. Yeah. And when you're figuring out the right questions, the questions that have the opening in them. Yeah. Um, well I do actually think in terms of hospitality and the work I do so and, and so I think of the preparation I do for an interview as inactive, as work of hospitality. Um, because you know, again, we, we so much is determined about how an encounter is going to go in the initial moments before words are spoken. So just kind of like setting that table.

Speaker 3:          00:17:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       Which is an image of a certain kind of hospitality, but it's the same idea.

Speaker 3:          00:17:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       When we don't do that, then the most obvious things about us that we're all carrying out front right now just to define what's, just define what's possible. And so what I'm interested in is how can we not solve all the problems or make it that way? Because I really want to be in rooms with people I disagree with and who are and who I, who I need to learn from and who I know I want to share life with, even if I really don't understand them. Not Violent people, but most people aren't violent. There's this huge swath in the middle where those, those fellow humans are there. Um, so what I want to do is create the space so that, so that the things that we already know are problematic, um, are certainly present that they don't define what becomes possible between us. Um, in my interviews, you know, when you just asked me that intuitively, you know, what comes to mind is I get excited.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       I'm just excited about the conversation and, and the, and I want to prepare, um, because I want them to be able to relax as quickly as possible so that we can really go deep. And one way I do that is by, by knowing about them, by honoring them, by reading their books, if they've written books or knowing what they do. Um, I mean I do a lot of, you know, I will also read other interviews they've given. I would say. So I think of my, um, interview preparation mode as the Vulcan mind meld mode of interview preparation. It's like, you know, um, my mind to your mind, your thoughts to my thoughts because my, my goal in preparing, it's not that I, um, no what, what they think as much as how they think and, and so that then, and again this works if they're halfway across the world and I'm in a studio in there, in a studio that we all know what this experience is.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       If you meet someone new and you know very quickly, if you're going to have to explain yourself, defend yourself, be on guard, and then that's what your whole body gears up to do. And then that just write that, then you're, then you're off. So, but what I'm aiming for is this other experience we've all also had, you meet somebody and you're just know that they get you. And even when I say that to you right now, like my body relaxes and there was a lot more possibility and it's a much, it's a soft right. It's a soft space in which just going to happen. And I think it's a more playful, adventurous space for the same reason I interrupt to do with my question. No, no, I love that. I, I didn't, um, I did want to, you know, um, one of the things you said to me is that you, you also wanted to invite me here at Google to just say whatever was on my mind that, that I would want to stay and, um, to you.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       And, um, actually, I mean, I have a fair number of conversations about, you know, not about technology per se, but about our lives with technology and, um, and do think about this a great deal. And I, I mean, one thing I want to say is that I, um, and I know you all are, you know, we're, we're now having this kind of reckoning culturally with the civilizational effect of the work you do, the work that happened in this industry and we've all created that civilizational effect who we've all cocreated it and it's so new and these technologies, there's so much in their infancy. And, uh, I think one of the messages that's come through so clearly is, um, with wise people in my conversations is that, you know, that we forget that all of this is in its infancy because it is so powerful and it has so quickly kind of feels like taken over our lives.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       But, but there is the opportunity and the challenge is, is to continue, is to shape our lives with technology and the technologist to human to human purpose. And, and I'm also aware of, um, I do think this is also true in journalism. Like culturally, we're so much more skill that sophisticated analysis and criticism of what is flawed and failing and destructive and terrifying and catastrophic, right? Like, we're really good at that and we're not as sophisticated at, at seeing and analyzing and working with and they're buying nurturing what is generative and beautiful and humane. And, and I think that you, I know, you know this cause that I, there's so much that it's human and beautiful at humane and generative in our lives with technology as well. Um, just, I would just say one of the things that's so clear to me in the sphere I'm in is, is the abundance of poetry, um, that is, that has this whole new life online, um, and how people are making poetry and, and, and, and putting it up there and sharing it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       Um, and I think this is also a civilizational move. I mean, poetry does, in fact in human societies rise up when we are in these moments of cultural and political disarray. It does. Um, it's, it's, uh, it's something we are turning to as our official forms of language and discourse are so broken and failing us so badly. And it, it, it gives us ways to give voice to the best of ourselves. And actually also it gives us ways to throw, to put questions into the room. And I just, I mean the room and a very expansive sense, the public room that aren't, that we, that are there for us to live rather than answer or fight about. Um, uh, one of those, and one of those questions by way of poetry that I work with a lot is from Elizabeth Alexander, who was the poet of the first Obama Administration.

Speaker 1:          00:24:18       And she has this poem which ends, you know, poetry is the human voice and are we not of interest to each other. And to me that is, that is a question that refrains like, can we get along or are you a Republican or a democrat? Like if that's a question that could help reframe, are grappling with all the things we want to grapple with. Um, and then I'm sure many of you are aware that Mary Oliver died last week and I was so, so privileged to have, I think the last big interview she gave in 2015 in which I will share, she smoked the entire c only interview I've ever had where my producer texted me before I arrived and said, she wants to smoke. Are you okay with that? It's like she never gives interviews. Of course I'm okay with that. But it was so perfect because I knew it wasn't remote smoking.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       It was in my face and it was, I was privileged. Um, and she was wearing a new England patriots sweatshirt and, and it was just, it made her so much more perfect that she's so three dimensional because, you know, very Oliver, her critics think that she's like poetry light because she writes beautiful things about the natural world. Um, and I think some of the people who love her most put her up on a pedestal and turn her into a saint. And the truth is like if you think about a sophisticated analysis of goodness and beauty, but you know, she fled to the woods and started writing poetry because she was living in an abusive household. And the poet, you know, she spent years in young adulthood gathering berries because that's what she had to eat. And it was that three dimensionality of her and that, that's what gives her poems about beauty and goodness, such heft. And actually I took, you know, so here a question she put out into the world that is now rippling through it again. And it's one of these transformative questions we can live. Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? And something, another gift she gave me in that interview was to just, you know, bring the six plus is the, the phrase, I like the phrase generous listening. Mary Oliver used the phrase convivial listening.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       There's like a bubbling and that's really I being the protests that she is. I'm glad you brought Marriott because I actually, um, when I saw that and I thought immediately of view because I listened to that interview and um, the thing that touched me the most in that interview with Mary was how she talked about her poetry being being a moving thing. That she would walk to have the poetry come through her and then she'd have to run home and get the, and what I loved about that was just that it was the living the questions. It isn't the, I sit down in this things come stuffs and I think something that you were talking about a few minutes ago with journalism, which is the nature of the questions again, you can go so easily to the places of, um, you know, the darker spaces, the shadow we spaces because it, it works.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       There's a lot of edge there to work with. I think design and journalism is very similar in terms of there's a, there's a curiosity. It's, it's funny, you can almost say like search poetry and replace like design or art or all these things. It's all inquiry into that, that thing. At the core of something that you're going to bring out and make felt and move everything else away. And when I look at design or journalism, I think about this deep curiosity that rises up into us and do we want to just look for the problems we want to solve? The itchy seems that drive us crazy or the things that feel like they're not right. Or is there actually something even deeper than that? It's more kind of unifying them that that is this place of beauty. And the way you describe beauty as, actually, I don't want to misquote you like right here.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       So let me, let me make sure I get this right. Um, in my notes, I literally have the hippies code on beauty, which is always my, like my touchstone, which is state of the world is hopelessly reeling. Stay close to the sounds that bring you alive. And your quote is beauty, is that in the presence of which we feel more alive. So this vitality or speaking about, yeah, and that was, that's actually a language of John O'donoghue was another poet and theologian and philosopher. Um, and I, so he, he was talking, we were actually talking about, um, how a lot of the words that we need them most and love the most also get ruined. Um, and I think that's true of words like peace and justice and love, you know, and kindness. They get on bumper stickers or they get partisan affiliations and, and so we, so I think sometimes we have to, we have to put them to one side and use them less and kind of say what we're saying and use a universe of words, um, and not expect those words to do the work for us. Um, but sometimes we just really have to claim a word and say, no, we're not gonna let this die. We have to resurrect it. And Yeah, I'm trying to do that with the word civility. But he used the word beauty and I said to him,

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       well,

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       you know, beauty is another one of those words. I said, like, if you just throw the word beauty and to many conversations, I said, you know, maybe were where my mind would go is to the flawless face on the cover of a magazine. Right? And he said, no, no, that's glamour. And they said, beauty is that in the presence of which we feel more aligned.

Speaker 3:          00:30:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       And what you just said,

Speaker 3:          00:30:17       um, about,

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       you know, the inquiry.

Speaker 3:          00:30:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       If we're, if we're focused on solving the problems, do we then end up being orienting towards the problems? And I, and I, and I, and you know, I think, I don't think we have to do one or the other, right? I think we can, I think we, we do to some extent need to focus on the problems.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       Um, and

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       it's also just as serious and robust a question to ask,

Speaker 3:          00:30:48       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       what do we want to amplify? Because it is good for us because it, because it speaks to and elicits the best of which our species is capable.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       I think that's so much of the conversation. Just make her Google not to speak for myself. And as part of the community of Google. Um, I think that's part of what's so fascinating about this braces phase, awkward adolescent moment we are in with technology right now. You're right, the power is what has brought us along so far, so fast, but there's so much more to be done. There's so much expansion, there's so much support, there's so much positivity. It's easy to focus on the fear part of it because that's real and that's happening and things must shift. But there's so much potential if you focus on what are the things that we want to expand in people, what are the ways we can support, how can we look not just at the functional and productive needs, but at the generative spacious needs of people. How was the whole person welcome?

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       And I think what's so curious and part of why this listening conversation, it's so wonderful to have everyone in the room here is we are really trying to go back to these core skills that are so easy to forget what the speed with which we all live and, and remember what does it mean to in our process open up moments where we have spaces for better listening, where we are practicing some of these skills in a different way. Um, working with the design process so that it's not, um, it's not kind of the normal way that we make things, but that we ourselves more of us as welcome in that room and at the white board that there is kind of, you know, for the humans on this side and the way that it touches people on the outside and the way that all kind of circles, um, what does it mean to work with new models and open spaces and these places that we all create in this.

Speaker 1:          00:32:38       Also kind of where, you know, you think about that as an intersection of design and the hospitality virtue. Absolutely. Yeah. Um, I'm very clear that as much as we are, again seeing the, the dark well, we're seeing the dark side of ourselves on this great big canvas. Um, and we're seeing this very young industry, which one of the things I've learned here is it's not really an industry, right? It's a bunch of companies competing with each other, but the world actually needs you all to be an industry. Um, um, this industry that ha that it, you know, I, I spent my twenties in divided Berlin and, um, I keep thinking about that this out here in silicon valley because as much as we are riveted by what's happening in Washington DC or in London, um, your, the, your company, these companies are the superpowers of this century.

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       And that's huge now. And I, and we're all now aware of the perils of that and all the, all the pieces that need to be in place for that to be true and to be good for humanity. But I also see that, uh, you know, every, every generation, every century has had it's life altering technologies, right? The railroad changed everything. The telephone changed everything. Electricity Change, everything. Fire change everything. But, but what is new about our technologies? Of course the pace is different, but I don't think that's really it because I think in other generations the pace of those things was, was equally completely disorienting. It is the intimacy, our technologies are woven into the fabric of our days, into the fabric of our lives. They are shifting the way we make and lead and learn and La, they're woven into the human enterprise. And, and what I also see is that these technologies and the interconnected world and economies they've given us have actually given us the tools for the first time as a species to think and act as a species. Yeah. We are not anywhere living up to that right now. Right. Like that's not the picture that this is the reality. This is the potential.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       I love articulation of it. I've never heard it quite like that, but indeed it is. Um, the, yeah, the ability to be interconnected. It is actually, when you say woven, it's interconnected. Not just in kind of our humanity, but actually in the way that we are connected. And I think the inside and outside, yes. But that inner and outer is, is so critical. And actually it's, it's perfectly, you said that because there was, um, there was a moment that you had, that you reflected on, in your book with Dr Rachel Naomi [inaudible] Rehman where you talk about Tikkun Olam and, and what's interesting is I actually had a moment where I was like, oh, shall I talk about spirituality had Google and I was like, absolutely, yes. This is the human heart we're talking about. The language is almost, you can, you can use whatever language you want.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       The thing that we were speaking about, the thing that breeds all of our hearts, the thing that connects all of us is always the same. So that is what this is. But, um, sometime early in the life of the world, something happened to shatter. He knows origin myth, the light of the universe and the countless pieces they lodged a sparks and every part of creation or highest human calling is to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. And I just immediately thought, what if everything we designed had that beauty and service and your version of beauty, you and John's, um, to it, this idea that we can repair the parts of the world that we see in touch, that is a pretty incredible fabric when we think about what filament is at our fingers here at Google, what a great mission, you know, to organize and organize the world's information to light it up and repair it as well.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       I think that's where no one else gets. Also at the one in the same time, it's audacious and it's doable, right? Because that, you know, that's the, that's the Jewish, the story behind the, it's, it's called the birthday of the world and it's behind the moral commandment to repair the world. And I really love, like that's another piece of language that I think is so useful, so much better than save the world, which was what the 20th century was about. And so much damage was done in the name of saving the world. And it also made people, it actually alienated people from their sense of agency, um, but repair the world and you know, ever since 2016 it's just like all the, like all the images that come to mind about what we have to do in our countries like weaving, stitching. So these mending, repairing, you know, one and, and the thing is, it's a big picture, but it's one relationship at the time and the at a time.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       And that's what she said to repair the world, um, is the highest human calling. But you start with what you can see and touch. That's, that's what you're called to. I love that pragmatism. And it also, um, what I feel like is rising up in the conversation too, is this save the world. It made me think there is this really beautiful intention we have in the valley and in technology. Um, how can we solve these audacious human problems, these large scale massive things? How can we, the intention of that is so beautiful. Um, the results of that are not always, um, when you speak about intentionality and hospitality and this whole space that we've started to kind of unroll in our conversation, what's your advice for us with that? Um, yeah, well that's, that's all I'm going to know it. Solve it for you.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       But what I, what I will say, I think the intentionality, your question is so good. You know, that's my highest compliment that it is my birthday. And I thought that was officially the best friend. Um, we all know, we know in our lives, we know in the lives of companies and organizations, um, the intentionality at the beginning of something, the intentionality that's embedded in it has this mysterious power to be in the DNA forever. Right? Um, but culturally and I think especially in the realm of like productivity of every kind, we really privilege the what and the when questions and not the how and the why.

Speaker 2:          00:40:08       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       And I actually think if, um, actually believe that if we are going to wrap our arms around these big civilizational, these intimate and civilizational challenges, we have, um, you know, the end, the problem is as we also know, if you, if you rush to do something, if you rush to a solution, you often waste time. You often end up setting something loose. The didn't have the intentionality that it needed, that you then spend time rolling back and dismantling and solving for, um, which is, which is all by way of saying, um, it would be who of us now. And I, and I mean in every aspect of our lives and in everything we do, whatever our work is, um, because, because this is a critical moment, um, to really invest our time, our creativity, um, our attention, uh, a sophisticate, the sophistication we would give to, to solving a problem to, to, to this, to the, to the why, the, and the how of it. Um, yeah, and what that means and it, but that has some trade offs that are culturally, uh, difficult. Right? That means you would spend a lot more time on something that doesn't look like you're being busy. So like there's a culture shift that has to happen around this though. Langue language I love that actually comes from, from spiritual traditions is the language of discernment. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:03       you know, I mean, I know like these industries you're in are all that innovation and we actually have to hoist in that a lot of the problems, mag, the massive prompts we're dealing with now are the result of innovations, you know, and, and also just like what we did with food 50 years ago, um, where we created convenience and we have actually like w I mean, could, do you know what an innovation it was to have food coming out of boxes and cams, like, you know, life changing, amazing, so bad for us, very lucrative,

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       so bad for us. And so now we are like h and then the, you know, our, our, our government policies followed it, agriculture followed it, all of these things followed it. But now we're now are implicated in this massive complex of things around climate and and Helson and economies that we have to like take apart and saw four, right? So innovation is not in itself a good like innovation is not necessarily progress. And so that's something to ponder. And I think if you say if, if, if these, if, if our technologies and our lives with them or in their adolescence, if art, if, if these super power companies are also, you know, very young, I think that discernment muscle like you know, of course innovation has been a core value, but in the next stage asking will it be good for the world, will it be good for humanity?

Speaker 1:          00:43:36       And that's going to look like wasting time being discerning. Yeah. You use the word imagination a lot to describe that generative, spacious process. And in the end I think imagination and discern my go really beautifully together towards that. I must pick up. So you mentioned that civility is a word that means a lot to you now and just talking about these civil, I love saying that these are civilization level problems because it includes the humanity and the culture and you can just all things at once. Um, please share your definition. No, I'm disability. Yes. Um, well I know it's a problematic word and I always add other adjectives, like I say, adventurous civility or muscular civility. Um, it's not about, I think we have to get past the idea that, uh, you know, it's not, to me it's not, again, like what is it not, it's not being nice kind and tame. Um, those aren't big enough qualities to need this moment. I'm not saying there's not a place for them, but that's not what civility is about. I want to say, I want to say that civility, that the intention, the intentionality behind it is this repair of our lives together.

Speaker 3:          00:44:55       Um, I think, I think there are these, um, kind of, there's the questions that have, um,

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       that had been with humanity and animated humanity and I think animated at us, at us, at our best, that are ancient and enduring or you know, what does it mean to be human and how do we want to live? Um, and the third question is who will we be to each other? And that question across history has been optional in many settings. And I think actually the technologies you created make that question inextricable now for, for humans. It inextricable from the question of what it means to be human and, and how we want to live. Absolutely. And civility, civility in my mind we're, we're also like, there's so many different things happening at once, which is part of what makes this moment dizzying. And we're very focused on what's going wrong, but there's so many ways that we're understanding the fullness of what it means to be human.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       And, um, understanding our bodies and our brains in the interaction between them and also in, in our, in culture fit fully in, perfectly to slowly. But, but gaining a sense of the fullness of like, you know, I wa I want, I don't, I don't, I think these words like diversity and tolerance are like way too small inclusion like still is. There's an INCIRCL but I think we're really moving beyond us. We want the full array of humanity in the room to have its place. I mean we, we have such a newly robust understanding just of the matter of identity. We are the generation that is redefining gender. Um, so I think, you know, one of the things that happened with the notion of civility that was that it was about like these, these phrases like we would all get on the same page, right? Or the thing we do like the democratic instinct, well you've got some people that think that smelled like take a vote, move on.

Speaker 1:          00:47:25       But these intimate civilizational questions of how we're going to live, we all have a stake in them. So to me, civility in this generation is about knowing that we walk into the room or ended the discussion with deep, profound differences that are meaningful and important to us. And the point is not agreeing. Um, the point is getting into relationship. The point is coming to know each other and that thing of opening up what is not letting those things we disagree on define what is possible between us opening up a new space where perhaps what we have in common are questions. Absolutely. Yeah. And in that opening of the space that's a bigger than the differences. Yeah. It allows for all of the questions, all of the voices. Um, something that you were speaking with Pico I hear about and that recent interview was, um, how he talked about how, what was it in the institutions of skepticism.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       He's kind to all of these incredibly decorated universities, which he refers to as the institutions of skepticism. And he says that we learned how to talk but not how to listen, how to put ourselves forward, but not how to actually erase ourselves. And so much of that is this the living of the listening, the living of the questions. If we do that in an artful way, there really is space for all of that. Whereas the way kind of currently it works, like maybe there isn't always space for it because it feels like there's not enough space for us because all of us isn't there. Um, but this, this idea of seeking, I think he also said that everything important he lived or everything important in his life that he's learned has come through his heart and not for his mind. And I think that's something that we, um, you know, as, as good souls here at Google doing, you know, what we want to do good work for the world.

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       There's this tension between the things that we feel and the things that we know, the things we can prove and the things that we intuit. And I'm just curious as well in this, in this listening and in the allowing of all things for this greater sense of stability, um, how does one navigate that, navigate the, this, this space? And I think he'd do it so beautifully with your work because you sit with, you sit in conversation with everyone. Yeah. Um, well we were going to have to innovate some new forms for that, right? Because we don't reward the time or the energy or the, we don't, we, you know, we don't, yeah. We, we reward what comes from the mind and not from the heart. Unless you can cry, you can pitch it as somebody they can write. And that's what we do actually. Cause most of it is, you know, all this language we've always used about your gut, you know, and now we basically learned that what they're calling the biome, the second brain, right. Like we've actually known that we knew somewhere. So I don't think science is our, in being able to make a rational, serious argument about this.

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       But yeah, that's, and so I think right now all of the structures we have,

Speaker 3:          00:50:41       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       They're, they're inadequate. I mean, I, and I mean that in all of our workplaces and all of our institutions. Um, they haven't, they're behind on what we're learning and actually they're behind on how actually the world really works and how change really happened.

Speaker 3:          00:51:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       And on the difference between what is, you know, innovative and transformative generatively transformative. Yeah. So that's part of the task. And there's no, there's no one size fits all solution. Like, and I think that that is one of these things where the repair is going to have to be, everybody's starting like very close to home. What, you know, what you touch the immediate people and structures around you. How do you make space for that to be rewarded? Yeah. That's interesting. The idea of, um, of how to reward the how and the why. Yeah. Um, if anybody has a question for Krista, uh, my question is what is your thought behind always asking someone at the beginning of your podcast? Yeah. Um, what is something from their childhood that is spiritually important to them? Yeah. So, so almost always as some version of the question of what is their religion?

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       Was there a religious or spiritual background, your childhood? So, uh, the truth is that just about everybody has a really interesting story there. It, whether it's a story of absence or presence or something that was good or bad, but, but, um, the reason I, the, the, the strategic reason I ask it is because of where plants the question. So again, it's like the beginning is everything, right? If you get the beginning right, uh, you can go places and if you don't, you're working, you're always working really hard to get it, get it on the rails. What I, so what I've learned about that place, it's true of other questions about childhood or origin. So sometimes I'm, if I'm in a, like a, uh, if I'm in a particular setting with a theme, I might ask, uh, let's say it's a conversation about compassion or I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       And I, I might say, can you, what, can you remember the very first time that you did that? That word meant something to you? Or what, what is your memory of the earliest, earliest understanding of what you think of as compassionate? Now the thing about asking somebody a question that takes them, um, what I don't want to do is start with the, where we all always, how we present generally we in with our credentials and what we know and what we've done. And it's very chin up and it's, and it's performative and the, and that's what we're asked to do. Um, that question takes it plants people. It's not a question that anybody feels defensive about because I'm not asking you also, and I would never ask somebody, tell me about your spiritual life. Like are you religious? I mean that question would be designed to just, uh, make everybody uptight, including me.

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       If you ask somebody that question, it takes them to a very soft searching place and their memory and therefore in their body. Um, it's also interestingly, as much as we think of religion culturally as a matter of convictions and beliefs that answers, it's a place where beautiful questions reside. And it's, it's interesting to me how many people when they start reflecting on that part of their life, it turns out that there's some question they asked when they were four, seven or nine that they end, that it ended up influencing the rest of their life. Like some of their life has been some trajectory on the course of that question. Um, so, so that's it. It's where to start so that, and then everything follows from there. I can get, if I can invite people to be soft and searching right up there and then, then we probably are going to stay soft and searching.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       Um, I used to work for the wealth bank as an economist and you talked about saving the world and um, then I moved to Silicon Valley and here people have the same intentions and it seems that the intentionality is right and speaking for the world. Thank you. Wouldn't believe that. But it's the same. The same is true. People truly believe in what they're doing is doing good in the world. So if it's not intentionality, why did we go wrong? Is it that we think it's intentionality is right, but it's really not an, it's our ego or what is it? Where do we go wrong and how can we fix this that we start off with good intentions and end up with bad results? Right. Well that's a good question. I mean, maladies, not everything. I think then I would want to come back to this discernment piece.

Speaker 1:          00:55:44       And I, and I do think that, um, yeah, the question of ego, which is often this very often is, you know, and of course we are, our egos are part of us. It's not you get rid of that, but, um, it resides so intimately with intentionality. Um, and so I think part of, um, spiritual life of interior of a cultivated interior life, um, is to grow in knowing the difference. Because if they often do feel like the same thing and actually to grow these other muscles around discernment and asking the how and the why question. And, and, and I mean, you know, the scale of what the World Bank is working with or the scale of what Silicon Valley is working with is tremendous. But I do think that there's something we're waking up to a little late,

Speaker 3:          00:56:47       um, about how,

Speaker 1:          00:56:50       about how disconnected our view of the problems and therefore the solutions is. Right. And the, and this is something about the post enlightenment world. I mean, I, I, we, we, we, we turned, we were fascinated with the parts, right? And then we created this world of parts. So in every discipline, there's this challenge in medicine, there's this challenge. We, you know, we have specialists for every part of your body. And we didn't learn how to see the whole and all the interactions. And there's a corollary to that in everything we do in, in the economy, in politics, um, in social policies. And, um, so in some ways, like this is kind of a, this is kind of a civilizational, uh, muscle of discernment, right? Like we actually have to start to think outside the frames that we inherited, um, and see in a new way that I think I, you know, another piece of language that's really important to me now is thinking about having, not just imagination, but moral imagination.

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       MMM. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       Yeah. And then again, like discernment.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       Is there's, there's no prescription. It's going to be different in every, in every setting. But I think, I think there are muscles we can build up and also ways we can help hold each other accountable. So in my role here, my, I served the manager and leader community and my intention and goal is to support them through, um, actually through asking them questions rather what community, the community of leaders at Google. Okay. And, um, so I'm always on the lookout for really solid questions and of course your full of them. Both of you are, and I, it's obviously very difficult time to be a leader here or anywhere, but I'm, I'm seeing, uh, leaders struggle with how to listen to questions that are sometimes just they're so loaded, right? And the leaders don't have the answers necessarily and they're not necessarily responsible for the causes and they have their own questions about what's going on and the struggles. So, um, my question for you is, what advice potentially in the form of some questions do you have for our leaders to, for how to listen, respond, be with, with what's being asked of them right now? Yeah, you're right. I mean, I think when you're talking about loaded questions then are not really questions right there. Their arguments that are presented as question, I mean that just feels, feels like a huge responsibility to answer that question. I, I, I do, I do think that

Speaker 1:          00:59:39       what the world needs leaders in this sphere to be asking is how will we shape, um, these technologies to, to human purpose, um, to be, to be good for us. And, and if, if, if I say audaciously that, that these, these are the tool you have created the tools to, um, whereby we could just start to think and to act as a species and, and we must, if we're going to tackle something like climate change, just to name one of our big challenges, but perhaps the one that had the ultimate one, um, how can that, I mean, how to rap like, I don't want to say it as a problem. Like how to rise to that challenge. Let me take that on as a design question.

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       Um, disrupt our, all the compartmentalization, disrupt all these barriers and walls between all the different disciplines. We need to be talking to each other to wrap our arms around some of these big challenges. I think I'd add to that as well cause I just wholeheartedly agree, um, is we tend to think very fast and we tend to be very reactive because there's so much at stake and it's all happening right now and there's a lot of them, you know, to kind of say the steak thing, there's so much on the line and really this, the, the listening aspect of silence aspect, the patient's aspect of this I think is how do we know there are things about humanity that will never change. They are, the things that are wired inside of us are always be true. How do we think is a slow as we can to the things that never change because that's where the real responses will come.

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       The fast answers are so challenging and loaded as loaded as the questions and is dangerous for individuals too. There's just so much going on in that moment when really when we stop and think about the way that we are as people and the way that we are as people together and what it means to live in a particular way that we can all be proud of. And it feels like it is about human flourishing and civility and the space that includes all of us. Um, those are harder questions. Those are feeling questions. We're not all necessarily in the practice of that. Even personally. Just encouraging and having those conversations here, making space for that. That's the beginning of all of it. So I thank you for doing your work and for asking the questions, you know, somebody else or might say is, um, given that like, I don't think anybody who started any of these companies want it to be changing human nature, like interwoven into people's bodies, brains and psyches, right? I mean, that's not what anybody set out to do, but that's what's happened. Um, a lot of the,

Speaker 1:          01:02:45       the terrible reckonings we're having now, even around things that we thought we'd make great progress on socially, like racial dynamics and, and, and gender dynamics. You know, 50 years ago there were beautiful movements and a lot of laws changed and we kind of came into the 21st century thinking we, you know, we cracked this, we can keep getting better at it, but we basically did this and we hadn't. And one way I analyze that is that we, you know, we have this idea that like if you, you know, if you know history, it won't repeat itself, but the truth is actually that history always repeats itself until you know yourself. And, and we changed laws but we didn't change ourselves. And now again, with science as our companion, we learn about implicit bias, right? Like we learn how our brains were hardwares and we didn't know how to affect that. The beautiful thing. So it's terrible to wake up to the fact that we were so much farther, less farther along than we, than we thought. But the beautiful thing is we actually now, no, we have not knowledge. That can be a form of power. And you are working in a sphere that is actively engaging our brains, right? Actively involved in our inner lives as well as our outer lines. Um, so again, I would say take that as a creative challenge, a generative challenge,

Speaker 1:          01:04:15       and it's uncomfortable, right? I know it's not what anybody wanted, but there it is. I'm going to sneak a question in between you and Peter who will be our last question. Um, one of the things that's come up a few times here is like the poetry art, the space of the heart, the wisdom traditions. These are things that I think live very much in the spirits of many people that are in all of these places. Um, what do you think that we all have to learn from those traditions explicitly? Not necessarily in our own homes and the doors of our heart. That's where it all begins. But what do the wisdom traditions, what do all of these ancient human languages of our souls? Um, ha ha. What place do they have in this space? How can we invite them in? We'll there potentially or they're just, they're there.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       This is the part of the human enterprise where we, where we tried to think about what our soul is and what our heart is and, and actually what the fullness of argument consists there. Also the parts of the human enterprise where we were actually honest about how complicated and messy we are, right? Like are the technocratic 20th century wanted to think that we could just bracket those things out and you could check your personal life at the door and you know, we wouldn't bring messy things into the public sphere and it didn't work that way. Um, and now all of that, you know, now we're in this moment, I think this has something to do also with technology and the just how rapidly things have shifted, that everything that we have been thinking was such a rational discipline, our politics, our economics data, these are just the thinnest of veneers over the human drama.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       And again, it's really messy and uncomfortable to say, oh my God, that's what we have to do. But I actually think that we have to address in order to do all the other work. And these are the parts of the human enterprise where that has been investigated. And we're, again, spiritual technologies have been developed and that's there for us. Whatever, you know, there, there are these great institutions which came out of that. There's the history of religion, but that's not all it is. I love how in, um, in your book he's habit. Um, it was comforting to you as you spoke to all of these kinds of great scientists in minds to know that everyone is equally as like are basically the black holes are easy and humans and the human condition is perplexing and astrophysicists will tell you that are nothing they're working with. Um, no black hole is as complex as any living organism, not just human beings that love that. Yeah. Peter, when I take us home,

Speaker 4:          01:07:11       thank you so much for sharing and being generous with your wisdom experience. There's so much what you said. I'm a, I'm a disciple of, um, uh, actually strategy to look at how we can use the lens of empathy and emotional intelligence and behavioral science to help guide perhaps a better future. Um, but on that note, like there's the things you're saying like repair versus safe, which I thought was wonderful because that's it. It's a admission that we were responsible and you have to admit that to participate in the healing. So I think the stuff that you're giving us and partying us is really going to help us. Um, I asked, I wants to ask because um, you have in your own sense the mastery of listening and interviewing and you say you prepare and you do the ritual of being a spendable and, and um, vulnerability.

Speaker 4:          01:08:05       All of these things are very to your point, dynamic study in gender, uh, uh, reciprocal of vulnerability and generosity. Um, but when you prepare, like you, you kind of stopped the person, right? And so you, you come and, and then you say you're creating an atmosphere of, uh, a safe place. Yeah. And it's interesting cause I'm curious about the correlation with things like trust and how what you believe in genders trust and what you believe are actually builds rapport. What are the human things that you've found that the report, because Google knows stuff about you. In our next session. Yeah. So why aren't you creepy essentially? And what makes your art form of Rapport Building essentially? I'm curious. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       So interesting. Well, yeah, and I have, I have actually thought about, um, how the Internet has changed the work I do because actually when I first started 15 years ago, I was spending a lot of time in libraries, just like public libraries. Um, and honestly, I don't know how else I was finding things. So it was possible. But of course now it's just, there's an abundance of information on anybody as you say. And I can also find things which is sometimes find like I can find things people said 20 years ago that they totally forgot that they said. And that is a really great moment in an interview where you kind of take them to a place in themselves they haven't been for a while. Yeah. Yeah. Why does it not feel like stalking? Because it's appreciative. It's appreciative and um, such an interesting question. I mean, people often say or sometimes say after our interviews that they, that death, that it was kind of like a, gave them a gift of themselves. Like I gave them an opportunity to say things they never even said to themselves before. And I, and I, that I do that by,

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       by being, by knowing so well kind of how they think and uh, and honoring that, that then we can start in a really deep place and go from there. I think the, maybe the honoring word is important and that deep, that deep place that you hold for them to return to and share and open up themselves. I think that that human quality of creating that space, that genuine curiosity, that that authentic moment that's being created out of hospitality, like she said it, it would be curious to see what changes when those values come alive in the space with technology. Yeah. So we will see that is all of our work to share here today. Thank you so much. Thank you.
