Speaker 1:          00:06          I am super excited to have Clara Hemphill, founder of inside schools here with us today. She's a font of knowledge and uh, it's exciting. So just a little bit about Clara so you know who uh, who she is. She leads the center of New York City's New York City at fairs pop policy work on economic segregation of the city schools examining why there are schools with high concentrations of poverty even in mixed income neighborhoods. The New York Times called her three books, designed to help parents choose good elementary, middle, and high schools for their children. The most definitive guys to the city schools in New York magazine culture, one of the 200 most influential New Yorkers for her work in empowering parents. Previously as a reporter, an editorial writer for New York News Day, she shared the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting. New York magazine called her writing on the homeless worthy of Dickens. She was a foreign correspondent for the Associated Press and a producer for CBS news based in Rome. She has two children both now grown and they both attended in New York City public schools from kindergarten through high school. So please welcome me. Uh, please, sorry. Excuse me. Please join me in welcoming Clara Hemphill to talk about the public schools and navigating the very segregated and ridiculously complex New York City school system. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Thank you. I'm really glad to be here. Um, I wrote the first edition of this book 20 years ago when my children were a three and one. They're now all grown up and I thought, Gee, I can figure out this bureaucracy. I was a foreign correspondent in Rome. I covered the Vatican, which I thought was the most secretive bureaucracy on the planet. And then I realized the board of Education is even more secretive and complex. So I thought if I had trouble, other people might have trouble too. And I set aside, I started writing the books. Then a couple of years later, uh, we set up the inside schools website and we just released the fourth edition of the New York City's best public pre-k in elementary schools on sale on the back. I hope you buy it. Thanks very much. Um, the, um, why should you choose public school?

Speaker 2:          02:31          Why to public schools matter? And one of the things that the last election showed us the national elections is how divided we are as a country and public schools when they work. Habs the ability to bring us together to help us understand one another. Um, and we need this public schools. Now more than ever. Uh, this picture here is an example of a school that I think brings together. It's those point base in Washington Heights. Um, you if you know, Washington Heights on the east side of Broadway is mostly Dominican, Spanish speaking kids on the west side is mostly English speaking. Kids dose Puente's brings these kids together in a dual language program where they speak, uh, English one day a week, you know, uh, half the time and they speak Spanish half the time. And it's a really lovely, lovely school and an example of how, uh, children can learn together.

Speaker 2:          03:31          One of the things I like about it is that the, the parents meetings are given, sometimes they're given in Spanish with English translation and sometimes they're given Spanish with a, in English with Spanish translation. And one of the things I liked about going to that school was having the experience of being somebody who didn't understand the language that was spoken and had to have the translation. So that's one of the schools and the book, you know, that I can remap, recommend. Um, public schools are just about the only place besides jury duty and the subways where people of different races, incomes and backgrounds mix. This is a Ella Baker school on the upper east side, which is open to children by lottery from all five boroughs. So it's not a zoned school. It's a citywide school. Um, and the, the, the great, um, Phil Educational Philosopher, John Dewey at the turn of the last century wrote that schools should teach children to be social beings trained for leadership as well as the obedience train.

Speaker 2:          04:38          So they can be voting citizens in a multiethnic democracy, not passive subjects. Teaching them to be social beings without letting the mingle with other children do we wrote is like teaching them to swim without letting them go in the water. Um, I remember a, um, talking to a Jewish father some time ago who was choosing between a Jewish day school. Is My mic on. Yeah. Who's choosing between a d a Jewish day school in a public school? And I told him, yes, I understand you want your child to learn the, the reader about your religious traditions, Hebrew, your values are very important to you, but if you send your child to public school, I guarantee he will meet at least one child who celebrates Ramadan and a child who celebrates Ramadan. We'll meet at least one child who he interrupted me. He said, yeah, I get the idea.

Speaker 2:          05:34          I get the point. And that clinched the deal for him. Um, the, uh, this is a PS 75 on the upper west side, which serves both Columbia University professor's children, but also children who live in public housing nearby. Um, um, one of the great thing a lot of the schools in the book are ordinary zoned neighborhood schools. No special application. You just sign your child up. Um, this is [inaudible] 80 in, in Harlem. In some ways it's an, it's an ordinary school test scores are nothing special. It's just sort of an ordinary school. But a mother told me, I feel like I'm part of a community and a neighborhood in an in a way that I never expected the pleasure of making friends with other parents, sharing babysitters and afterschool pickups, even sharing holiday meals. So one of the things I never felt, I live on the upper east side and I never felt I really lived in the neighborhood until I had children and send them to the public schools.

Speaker 2:          06:36          And there's something about having, uh, being, sharing the responsibilities of parenthood with other people in the neighborhood that really makes you feel like you belong in a neighborhood. Um, now I know some of you will say, oh, well that's all very well and good for you. And you live on the upper east side. But what if you live in the Bronx or in Central Brooklyn? Um, one of the questions I got ahead of time for this, uh, talk was public school. This is a quote from one of you. Public School is not a viable option for every New Yorker. This parent was zoned for one 33 in district five and Harlem. I cannot in good conscience send my children to my zone. School charter is also not an option if you're against rote memorization and some other very regimented tactics they use to teach students. It's true that there aren't as many good schools in poor and working class neighborhoods as there are enriched neighborhoods and racial segregation.

Speaker 2:          07:40          Racial economic segregation is a reality is those of you who are at Nicole Hannah Jones, a talk sometime ago a remember, but in researching the book, we found good schools in every one of the cities, 32 school districts. Not as many as we'd like, but at least a few. And we found some pleasant surprises. You don't have to live on Park Avenue to find a good school. Um, uh, I also want to say that not all the charter schools are rigid places where children are expected to act like robots. There are some, uh, progressive schools where children learn through exploration and play. Um, and it, it's not, oh, not all the charter schools are the same. Just the way all the ordinary public schools are not the same. What about segregation? It's true and it's really the shame of our city. But even predominantly white schools or predominantly Asian schools are predominantly black and Latino schools still have lots of different religions, lots of different languages.

Speaker 2:          08:49          Um, I was at [inaudible] 89 in crown heights the other day in Brooklyn, it's 97% black and Latino, but the children's speaks Spanish, English, creole. Um, there's even some Chinese kids there. There's a range of incomes. There's a pediatrician, there's a, uh, uh, a cab driver, a home health aide. It's a school that has served generations of parents and crown heights, and they have dual language programs where children can learn Spanish and creole. They even learn Latin. So that's the school, which in some ways, these indeed highly segregated. And in other ways is diverse. I remember going to an all black school in, uh, in, in Brooklyn and asking the kids what they liked about it and they said, oh, I love the diversity. And I said, what do you mean? And they said, oh, we have kids from every single island in the Caribbean. Um, another reason to choose a public school is a kids need parents who aren't stressed out.

Speaker 2:          09:56          Uh, commuting time really matters. If you're trying to decide between a great school 20 blocks away in a pretty good school across the street, I would choose the one across the street. Another question is, if you're, if you're working 60 hours a week to pay private school tuition, maybe you're better off sending your child to public school. If working part time means you can go on an occasional field trip, volunteer at the school you may enjoy, you know, being with your child and at that time, uh, it can be very important. I also want to point out that education is not just what you have from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM 180 days a year. Just living in the city of New York gives you access to resources that people, uh, elsewhere don't have. The natural history museum, the Bronx Zoo, um, my children danced with the national dance institute.

Speaker 2:          10:52          Uh, the, um, there are huge numbers of resources that, that you can take advantage of just by living in the school. Um, of course the argument about the 60 hours a week may work the other way. If you're already working, I realize I'm talking to Googlers here. Um, if you're already working 60 hours a week, you may want to choose private because you don't have to be on top of everything at school. But what my point is, is that consider your own convenience and your own levels of stress when you're, um, uh, deciding on school, the children are made of rubber and they can adapt to lots of different situations. Um, another thing I want you to remember is that no school is perfect. As a parent, you have to decide what you can live with, what you can supplement at home. Um, there's some things you can fix and there's some things you can't, you certainly don't want to send your child to a school where there's lots of bullying or where the adults at the children are, where teachers have low expectations and the children are overwhelmed by the problems of poverty. My children's school had physical education just one day a week. So what did we do? We supplemented with west side soccer league, which is a, um, uh, volunteer. Moms and dads will coach kids on the weekend. They take up most of the park space in the city and the weekend you've probably seen them. Um, if there's not enough math thrill, you can have flash cards at home. If there's not a foreign language, you can take the whole family to France for three months for the price of a private school tuition.

Speaker 2:          12:30          It also depends on your child. Some children in there, like a nursery school teacher described this to me. Some children like Dandelions, they're robust and they can flourish. And lots of places, others are more like orchids. They're delicate and they need just the right temperature. Some schools do a good job with children with special needs. Uh, others do not. Um, so it depends a little bit on your own family situation. Um, and on the uh, um, that what your child has. Like the most important thing of friend once told me is to find a school that doesn't kill your child's natural curiosity. A lot of what children learn in the early years is not a, particularly in kindergarten, it's not cognitive, it's social. Learning how to sit in a circle, how to share, how to develop independence, things like how to tie your own shoes.

Speaker 2:          13:28          The tone and climate of a school may be more important than the children's scores on standardized tests. Scores, by the way, tell you where a school's band, it doesn't tell you necessarily where a school is going. A school that's promising and on its way up may provide a better experience for your new child than a complacent well established school that's a coasting on its reputation. Um, so that's my pitch on why public. Now I'm going to give you the sort of the nuts and bolts of how to navigate the New York City public school system. The good news is that all four year olds are guaranteed a seat. And pre-kindergarten, the bad news is it may not be in the school closest to your home. If you're willing to travel a bit, you'll definitely get a spot. Um, the applications open in mid January, the deadline through at the end of February.

Speaker 2:          14:22          But if you're looking for school for your child this fall, um, take hearts seats open up in the spring and the summer for your child to be eligible, he needs to start. He needs to have his fourth birthday by December 31st. That means in, say if he has a fall birthday, he'll actually start pre kindergarten when he's, uh, when he's three. Um, there, uh, de Blasio has also promised that he's going to have a pre, pre kindergarten for three year olds. They're going to start in two high poverty districts, one in the South Bronx and one in central Brooklyn in the fall. They haven't got money for anything else. So, uh, I, I think, uh, asking this, uh, uh, asking the federal government and the state for extra money right now is probably not going to happen. But we do a pre K for four year olds. Um, not all of the pre kindergarten classes are an ordinary public schools.

Speaker 2:          15:18          In fact, most of them are housed in childcare centers or private nursery schools or religious schools. Um, you can see the pie chart here. The city's also opened what they call pre-case centers. These are standalone schools that your child will attend for just one year. We list some of our favorites in the book. Um, it's certainly a good idea to visit, but most of the programs we visited are pretty good. So That's pre k elementary. This is where the big kid school begins. And this is when you're five years old, you, uh, if you are five before December 31st, you're entitled to start school in that September, most of you. So for the, for the pre K, you're guaranteed a seat someplace, but not necessarily in your zoned neighborhood school. In fact, most of you will not have a seat and you're zoned neighborhood school. Some of them just have 18 seats for pre k and 125 seats for kindergarten.

Speaker 2:          16:23          So most of you are going to have to look outside of your zoned public school for pre-kindergarten. However, for elementary school, most of you are Garren or have a zoned elementary school and your child is guaranteed admission there. Um, one of the questions that you gave me an advance was about wait lists. There are, some schools have wait lists, but honestly almost all of the wait list clear and they ask parents to sign up early and many do. And they tell you that you're on a wait list in March. But by September, an awful lot of kids, they've either moved out of the city or chosen a private school or gone into a gifted and talented program. So I would not worry about, there's a couple of, um, schools that have serious wait lists in sunset park, a couple in queens, but by and large, there are, um, uh, it's not going to be a problem.

Speaker 2:          17:21          Um, the timeline is in, do I have another slide for this? Nope. This is the district's. Um, the city is divided. Oh, so I see the timeline is you apply in November if you want your child to be considered for a gifted program. Um, I'm not a big fan of gifted education, but uh, if you're zoned neighborhood school is inadequate, it's certainly an option that you should consider. Um, the testing for children for the gifted program is in January, in February, in by January. Then you submit applications for other schools. Honestly, the deadline is way too early. Most people in the city don't know in January what they're going to be doing in September, and they always almost always extended. By the end of March, you'll find out where your child's been assigned. If you're interested in charter schools, the deadline is April 1st. Um, and then in April you find out if your children, you know what, I'm making this too complicated. Read the book, Ask questions afterwards. I can see that the eyes are getting a little bit panic stricken here. Um, zone maps, sorry.

Speaker 3:          18:40          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:40          Okay. The city is divided into 32 districts. One of the questions was, why are the district so weird? Why don't they just make them according to the voting districts? The answer is buried in history. Um, uh, the, um, districts were set up in 1969 as part of an experiment in community control. They were set up, some of them were set up for, they're all set up for political reasons. Some of them were designed to keep all the white people together. Some of them were designed for, um, uh, the keep give Puerto Ricans power in East Harlem. Some of them were designed to dilute African American power somewhere in the more designed to concentrate African American power. The, I'm, the reason you need to know about them today is that your child has guaranteed a seat in one of these in the district in which you live. And some of the districts are really first rate and some of them are not ready for primetime. Um, one of you said that the, um, whoops, I seem to have missed the inside schools.

Speaker 2:          19:53          All right, well if miss one of you said that the um, the department of Education website is very hard to use. Um, we agree. We at inside schools have been working very hard to develop a new website. We have a development now we plan to launch and in the end of May and I'm hoping to get some Google, um, volunteers to help us with a guided search that will go through, um, help parents answer a certain number of questions. Um, I don't know what happened to that slide, but um, if you go to inside schools.org, you'll see our old slide and if you go to the, um, ah, here it is, um, what we're hoping to get as a guided search. So instead of searching by finding your zoned school or finding schools in your neighborhood, we would also have a ask a couple of questions. Like, how old is your child? Um, how far are you willing to travel? Are you interested in a dual language program for pre kindergarten? Do you need care from eight in the morning to six at night? Are you able to pick up your child after school? That kind of guidance search we would love to have some help with, from, from um, any of you. Um, we have a couple of other, uh, projects for volunteers, which, um, she thought has put on the, uh, Google give. So I'm going to, um,

Speaker 3:          21:26          the, the,

Speaker 2:          21:29          the, um, the best school guides and the inside school guides are a product or projects of the Center for New York City Affairs at the new school. We're not for profit and we rely on donations to keep providing this service to parents. So if you'd like to help us out by making a donation or buying the book or both, we'd be very grateful. The New York City public schools help make my own children, the adults they are today, intellectually curious, morally grounded, every generous and able to get along with people of all races and backgrounds. We wrote this book in the hopes that it can help you have the same experience with your children. So I will answer questions now.

Speaker 3:          22:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:20          Um, can you just go to the next slide?

Speaker 3:          22:22          MMM.

Speaker 1:          22:23          Okay. So I just wanted to let you guys know that inside schools as, as you mentioned it, they, they operate on a shoe string budget. Um, and they have a lot of interesting, a few interesting projects that I put in for Google serve for June, some engineering projects. So marketing strategy projects. Really if you want to get involved, I put a goal link inside schools dash volunteer or check them out. Also. Um, you know, I think as you mentioned, there are nonprofits, so I put a gold link for, for donations. There's also books in the back if you're interested in reading what Clarise book. It's, it's fascinating. Um, I also wanted you guys, if anyone has questions, please come up to the mic and ask, I think where we can spend the rest of the time on questions cause I know you have a lot.

Speaker 3:          23:12          Okay.

Speaker 4:          23:18          Hello. Oh, thank you, Clara for coming here. Um, I have a quick question about, um, I know like many parents, including my wife actually and, uh, six years ago I believe, told me that if we should move to a place where the school is nine and 10, I said what? He's nine and 10. So the inside schools or had the dynamic system, they 10 and that's how we ended up buying a house. There was long, long ago. And now my son is five years old. Uh, so that was too planning towards the ranking it, but I still don't understand like the, how the numbers go because that nine and 10 became six and 10. Then that became eight and 10. So how I learned that it's not really test scores. And how do you lead? Is it worth like giving that much weightage depending on,

Speaker 2:          24:02          that's a good question. We don't, we don't rank schools. It's our dread competitor. Great schools.net. Um, the difference between great schools.net and us is that we live in New York and we actually visit schools and we base our, um, uh, reviews on, uh, our visits to schools. Great. schools.net uses two year old, uh, national data. It's a national website and it's largely based on test scores, which is, as I said, we're a school has gone not where a school, we're a school of span and not where a school is going. I think pest scars are um, uh, rough. We have test scores on our website. Um, and I think they are a rough measure of the quality of the school. Um, if you have single digits of children passing the tests, that's a problem. If you have 80% passing, that's a good thing. The um, uh, we on our website we have, we draw the data from the department of Ed Surveys, which are given to a million parents, teachers and children themselves at the schools. And the data that we consider important, um, aside from the test scores is attendance to most of the children show up. Teacher attendance to most of the teachers show up. Uh, teacher satisfaction. Do most of the teachers like the principal respect the principles? Do they work together as a team? So those, um, those are some of the, we have those, that data for every school in the city and we have um, uh, qualitative reviews for about 800 of the schools. Um, does that help? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          25:55          So you mentioned you weren't a big fan of gifted education. I was just wondering if you could expand on that. Do you think the whole idea is bad or just the way it's actually implemented? Um,

Speaker 2:          26:03          there are clearly some children who need gifted education as there are some children who need any kind of special education and um, you know, when a room of Googlers there probably some very gifted children. I would, uh, I would guess the, um, the, a lot of what, um, if your child is, is two standard deviations from the mean, um, he may well need, he may need gifted education. The problem is that the tests are set up on national norms, not local norms. So your child might be two or three grade levels. You might in the Bronx and your child is two or three grade levels ahead of the kids in the Bronx. Um, but the s the city test wouldn't recognize that. So there's almost no kids in the Bronx who are considered, uh, eligible for gifted education. Um, on the other hand, if you're, if you're, um, and I think the tests also reflect a socio economics as much as they reflect some kind of, um, uh, curiosity or, or natural ability, the, um, in, in more wealthy neighborhoods, your child may be two standard deviations from the mean and, but everybody else is the same in that neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          27:24          So that a district 22 on the upper east side is like lake Wobegon. Everybody's above average. But that doesn't mean that they all need gifted education. Um, I can always tell when I've got a real one on the phone, the parents says that the child has taught himself Algebra at the age of three. Um, and he's having a little trouble making friends and uh, uh, it doesn't get an a in the parents desperately want their children to be invited to birthday parties. That's an example of a child who I think needs, needs a gifted education. Now, if we all had good neighborhoods, schools, there wouldn't be, there'd be a very, very small need for gifted education. Unfortunately, the quality of schools is really uneven and, um, gifted education is, it is a particularly good way to get out of a nasty neighborhood school that you don't want to send your child to.

Speaker 2:          28:13          The, um, the other problem with the gifted education is I think children need to learn that hard work is what matter. And you're not born with gifts as much. I mean, you may be born with gifts, but counts is how hard you work and that there's a kind of, in these gifted programs, there's kind of a fear of, of falling. It was a fear of failure. Um, also I think, uh, the, the tests measure a rather narrow range of academic skills. They don't past. If you're a great musician, they don't test. If you're a great artists, they don't test if you're athletic, they don't test if you're particularly good at making friends and, uh, ending playground squabbles. So, uh, I want my children to be exposed to all of those things and not just to kids who do well on a particular test. The other thing is I think giving the test to four year olds is really too early.

Speaker 2:          29:13          I just think that you can't, you know, the predictive quality of these tests is not that the tests are not that accurate and the divide between the 99th percentile and the 98th percentile of kids at the age of four is kind of ludicrous. The other thing is a lot of what you're learning in elementary school is not cognitive. It's how to tie your shoes, how to sit in a circle, um, how to make friends, how to get along with the classroom routines. So, um, I, I, this is what I think about early childhood education. I think by third, fourth, fifth, sixth grade, the, um, uh, a very good teacher can reach range of children, but the wider that range is, the harder it is for a teacher to, uh, reach that. Um, in my kindergarten, what you'd want to ask of your of the school is how do you challenge children at the top and how do you, um, give help to kids who need it?

Speaker 2:          30:17          And your child might need both, right? Your child might be a math wiz who has trouble making friends or your child may read way, you know, maybe meeting Harry Potter and kindergarten but can't add, right? So you, you, your child can be simultaneously gifted and, and struggling at the same time. Um, my kin, my son was very good at puzzles and when he, in kindergarten, he finished the hundred piece puzzle. The teacher would pull down the 500 piece puzzle for him. Um, when you look in classrooms, you want to see a range of books. If everybody's reading the same book, that's probably not a good place. But if some kids are reading frog and toad and other kids are reading Charlotte's web, that's a sign. If you look at the writing on the board and you see some kids, the writing five pages and some kids are writing three paragraphs, that's a sign that the school is adapting to kids with different needs. So of course you want your child to be challenged if he's very bright and you want them to get the help, uh, if he needs it. But that doesn't necessarily mean he needs to be segregated, um, in, in a classroom with other kids who are, who are, who do well on this academic test.

Speaker 1:          31:37          Um, so, uh, the school that we're zoned for is relatively new. It was just launched like four years ago maybe. So I think there's not a lot of information on it yet. It's um, the school for social social action. Yeah. I know. 27 I think. Yes. Um, so we ideally want to send, our daughter's only seven months old, but we want to send her there, but we're being told by a lot of people to keep our options open and make sure we're planning for the possibility of a gifted and talented program or a private school. Um, so I guess my question is two fold. Like what are your thoughts on that and, and knowing that our daughter so young, like what are the things that we should be thinking about right now to set her up for whatever options, but ideally wanting to send her to public school. Are there things that we should be thinking about doing now

Speaker 2:          32:18          if you could afford to stay in district two? Yeah, I'd stay put um, district to not only has terrific elementary schools that also has good middle schools and good high schools, which is not universally the case at all. Um, uh, then, um, I like five 27 a lot. Um, it's a shade traditional than some of, well I won't get into details about individual schools, but in your district I like five 27. It's in the book, you can meet about it. There's also a gifted program, a flute few blocks away. There's two gifted programs a few blocks away, both of which I liked very well. So what are there things we should be thinking about doing know to like make sure that she's prepared for like the application process for gifted and talented or for getting her ready for elementary school. Because I've just heard from people like in the building who are saying they send their kids to gifted and talented and they're like, oh, there's all these things you have to do these classes you have to take to make sure that they're, you know, on the resume for like, yeah, I, I think it's kind of sick.

Speaker 2:          33:16          You know, I, I want to like let children be children. Right. And I will encourage you to resist that. Okay. My son, I thought he was gifted, uh, you know, he was doing the big puzzles and kindergarten, you know, um, but um, he was at the age of four, he was still throwing blocks and the thought of having him sit down with a stranger and a pencil and paper test just seemed insane, you know? So, um, yeah, sure. There are people who will charge you lots of money to prepare for this test. But I would strongly discourage it, particularly because you live in a neighborhood with his own schools are fine, you know, in neighborhoods with his own schools are not fine. I don't mean to trash gifted and talented across the board, you know, easy for me to say my kids went to the local school and it was great for a lot of people that gifted schools are a good option.

Speaker 2:          34:10          One other, sorry, one last thing then. If the baby, you mentioned that the cutoff is December 31st there's a lot of theories about keeping your child back or advancing them. But it sounds like my reading showed me that in public schools you don't really have that choice. Is that true? Or can you hold your child back? You cannot, you're, you're stuck with the, uh, um, yeah. So this is called red shirting where you hold the kids back year of the idea that there'll be bigger and stronger and smarter. And then, and it's the same group of people who are telling you to get the test prep for your seven months old, you know, you know, um, I, my, I have a November birthdays. My daughter was the November birthday and she was pretty tiny for kindergarten and she was pretty exhausted at the end of the day. Um, so I understand the, um, theory.

Speaker 2:          34:56          Yeah, I understand the impulse to, uh, I, I mean I think it's actually their, their political reasons why these things are set up that don't necessarily have to do with pedagogy or child development. Um, I hope the question you could ask at five 27 or any other school is, um, I have a November birthday, you know, my child has a November birthday. Um, how do you adapt for younger children? You know, do they have a rest time? Um, do they have, um, you know, are, are, are they, or can they accommodate a child who's a little bit younger and, and, and, and see what the answer. I mean, I think that's a, that's a valid question, but they won't let you red shirt and I'm afraid. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 5:          35:46          Yeah. Hi, I'm a couple of questions if I may. Um, first I love to hear your thoughts on non zones district schools. Yeah. Why do they exist and what steps can one take it there a great one year by that you want to get your kid into. Um, and then second, um, the school in my son appears to not be a good school. I haven't looked, haven't I'm going to buy your book. Yeah. You convinced me. But I've, I've looked at like at like a school digger and the ranks are good. Um, and so what, what's the school alpha docs. Okay. I know. That's cool. Yeah. I mean my kids are four, they're, they're already signed up for preschool, but I'm thinking about kindergarten, um, for, you know, a year down the road. Realistically, are there things that I can do as a parent who wants to be involved to really make an impact on the school nearby or it's my time better spent thinking about how I can get my kids into a different school, whether they said the nuns zone district school or moving or something else.

Speaker 2:          36:41          I love that question. That's a really good one. Um, yes, parents can make a difference. Um, you have to talk to, you have to talk to other parents and decide, um, other parents and see if you've got other people who can work with you. And then you have to talk to the principal and see if he wants you to work. And it's gotta be, you can't say this a terrible school, we're going to save you and make it better for some reason that approached doesn't, um, you know, it's not really welcome, but you know, we love the school and we want to support it. Can we do x, Y, Z, um, is, um, now district. So some of the districts have district wide school choice for, so this is again, this is a, um, hell's kitchen. It was right by, yeah. And there's, there's midtown west, which is a school that accepts kids from all over the district.

Speaker 2:          37:35          Um, and um, supposedly by lottery. Um, same as, I don't know if you read the piece in the Sunday Times about one 65 and Manhattan school for children and the upper west side. Another case of a sort of unfavored zone school and a favored cool, groovy Boutique, um, hipster millennium school. Um, and how they got set up was dissatisfied. Parents who were zoned for the unfavored school were dissatisfied and created something new with under the auspices of the Department of Ed. Um, and, um, that the, the use to these district schools use to have their thumb on the scales for parents who wanted to volunteer. The last administration, Bloomberg thought that was not really fair. Um, I think there was one, um, uh, Joel Klein, the previous chancellor may read in my book where I said one family had two mothers and they promise to mothers in the PTA and that that got them into the school.

Speaker 2:          38:43          Um, and he thought that this kind of the skulls chancellor thought this kind of string pulling was willing, not very nice. So we made it, everything's done by lottery now. However, after the first, um, round of admissions comes out, the admissions reverts to the local school. And at that point, pleasant persistence, you know, can make a difference. Um, one pan, this the one 11 year school. I didn't put it in the book, but it's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's moving in the right direction. So I would give it another facet. And I also want to encourage you to go to inside schools.org and not school digger and you know, thank you.

Speaker 5:          39:26          Hi. Thanks for coming today. We love, we love you. We're, we're a bit, we're a big fan of your books and your site. Thank you. That's a general question. What's like a trend that you would like in public schools and wants to try and you're not so happy about?

Speaker 2:          39:37          Oh, well I think preK is wonderful, right? I mean, I paid $12,000 for nursery school, you know, when my kids were little. So I think that's, that's a, a wonderful trend. Um, I think the trend towards progressive education is a good one. I think children learn through doing, they learn through play, they learn by putting together blocks. They learn, you know, engineering and math skills with blocks and Lego. So I like classrooms that have a lot of blocks and lego rather than classrooms for the little kids that have lots of pencil and paper exercises. I like schools where the children read what they call authentic literature that has children's picture books and books that you might read for fun. I think that's um, uh, the extent to which that's increasing I think is a very good idea. Uh, what I don't like is the obsession with standardized tests. Some schools have become just test prep hell where the kids work for hours and hours and hours filling out, learning how to fill out bubble sheets.

Speaker 3:          40:40          Thanks.

Speaker 5:          40:44          Hi. Um, I have, uh, maybe two questions this time about reading between the lines on a school. Uh, one question is how, how, how do you determine if the fiscal is sort of improving? Cause you mentioned how it's not about where the school has been.

Speaker 3:          40:58          Okay,

Speaker 2:          40:59          that's a really good question. Um, in terms of a data, I look to see if, um, enrollments increasing. That's usually a sign of parents voting with their feet. Um, I look to see if attendance is improving before the test scores go up. You've got to get some of the, some of the public schools have very, very high rates of absenteeism and that's the sign that the kids are not happy to be there. And um, so when you see the attendance going up, um, the most important thing is an effective principal. Um, hands down, a good principal will attract good teachers and encourage them to work together as a team. A bad principal can dismantle a good school just as quickly. So leadership is all and you can usually feel the difference within about a couple of weeks of the new principal coming to pound. So in terms of the data, we do look at teacher satisfaction with the principal as one thing to look at, which we have on our, on our, on our website. Um, and uh, the, the, the, those are the signs that a school is moving in the right direction. Again, um, what I was talking to some schools start in the schools that are improving, start getting better in the lower grades and build up one by one. So if you see a good pre k and kindergarten, but the fifth grade is not so hot, that may be okay. It could be that they're building from the bottom up. Um, so look for the lower grades. Is that helpful?

Speaker 5:          42:41          My other question that are not quick. Um, uh, so speaking of someone who's Lil B be parents of mixed race children, I'm thinking of, um, can you determine how could you determine if there's the educational quality of level for all children? Because sometimes some schools we looked at and I think some anxiety of like, oh, they're rating on like school, school crusher or whatever they're rating on some other website, uh, is high. But then I there see like really significant segregation at the gas levels of other things. So I worry about getting, so how could you read into whether it's a good education for all of the studio?

Speaker 2:          43:19          Um, I, yeah, I talked to parents about that. Um, it's funny, I went to ps 75, which was one of my slides with the African American staff member and I'm one 66. 75 is mostly black and Latino and one 66 is, is mostly white. And she felt right away sort of a different vibe, you know, in, in the building about how welcoming they are to people of color. Um, but a lot of the, um, a lot of the schools that are multiracial do have lots of multiracial families also because for them it's very important. You know, if you have a, a black mother and a white father, you may not want your child in an all black school, but you don't want your child in an all white school either. Um, so I would ask, I would ask for the, um, the, the parents, um, I think a, a, a good, you know, I should have brought our, uh, I'll send you a link to our report on integrated schools that work, which is on the center for New York City Affairs website. And one of the things that really matters is that the principal wants the school to be integrated. You'd be at the number of principals who really don't care and are happy with whatever the status quo is.

Speaker 3:          44:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:41          Hi. Um, I'm in the middle of going through the process with my four year old. So it was just wondering if you had any more insight or could explain more about the waitlist situation. Um, and how that movement works. Because being in May now and I were on the wait list at five different programs and wait list at five different programs for pre K or for or breaking yeah. And our wait list now, like when I called the schools were like 114 on the list and number 42 on the list. And since

Speaker 2:          45:13          pre k you're talking about, yeah, when I was being blessed say about the weight lifts I was talking about kindergarten, pre K it's a whole different kettle of fish. You might have, you know, 18 seats and 500 kids. So uh, applying. So don't move or they don't let let, let's talk afterwards a little bit about, through your particular situation,

Speaker 1:          45:34          how do you manage between, so because pre k is so different than kindergarten. Like my understanding from everyone I hear is that you have to go through this all over again for dinner. Isn't it awful? I do believe it. It's just, yeah. And then middle school and high school to even plan. Like what pre k you would want to go to if like for consistency sake for your kid. I mean consistency is nice. It'd be great. You just, it's not realistic. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          46:02          I'm mean I have, I talked to parents who have um, you know, private nursery school for third for the three year old and then public pre k for the four year old and then a public school for the, you know, when he's five and moving three times since three years would drive me nuts. So, you know, I can understand. I think continuity is probably worth spending a little money for if, if, if you have to, um, but more for you than for your child. I mean, I think your child will probably adjust with, you know, the pre k situation. It's only been around for two years. They created 70,000 seats practically overnight. That it's functioning is, is, is a miracle. And that there are, um, uh, but there are, uh, certain neighborhoods of the city, there are just long wait lists and they haven't figured it out yet. It's shocking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          46:51          So you said several times, you know, principles, the most important thing and you said, you know, the principal can make it happen. Now this school across the street from us, it's ISP has 38, the Pacific in Brooklyn, all the comments talk about trouble with the administration and the principal not being good. And is there something that you can do about that or is it just you avoid the school or, I don't know what,

Speaker 2:          47:09          um, parents can lobby to get rid of a principal. They succeeded at two 82 which is in park slope not too far from you. Um, some at 38, they're trying to like work around the principal. There are a couple of schools that managed to build a cohesive staff, an inadequate principle. But um, then you have to figure out why the, you know, some, some parents have also gotten rid of terrible a district superintendents in Washington heights, parents United to get rid of. So um, yeah, get rid of or work around or the two answers

Speaker 6:          47:46          does, does working around work, like what do you think? That's cool. It can be functional or is it really it's, it's kind of in trouble with the principal like that.

Speaker 2:          47:52          I think you should talk to the parents who were there every day. Um, there are, I agree with your assessment that said, there's some parents who were very happy with the situation.

Speaker 7:          48:06          I wanted to go back a little bit to the gifted and a very high functioning district school questions. So I went to a public magnet school that was amazing and it was a really good experience, very along the lines of [inaudible]. So at the high school level and it and where I came from, there was definitely a concept of feeder schools that there were middle schools that gave rise to most of the high schools and their elementary schools like a rose to most of the middle schools. Is there a feeder school style set up here for the high school?

Speaker 2:          48:34          Alas, yes. Okay. There are, um, another one of our reports on the center for New York City's Ferris website shows you what middle school feeders there are to Stuyvesant in Brooklyn Tech and the, and the specialized high school. So, uh, yes, but you don't have to worry in kindergarten. Okay. I think, yeah, I guess, do they tend

Speaker 7:          48:54          to be the sort of like really good neighborhood schools or do they tend to be gifted schools or is it a mix?

Speaker 3:          49:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          49:01          Don't worry about it in elementary. Okay. Yeah, call me in five years and we'll, you know, we'll work it out, but it's, I'm not pretending the system is equitable and works well for everybody.

Speaker 3:          49:10          MMM.

Speaker 2:          49:13          We have three more minutes, I guess. Yes.

Speaker 6:          49:15          Okay. So, uh, I grew up in Europe and I'm a lot more familiar, but the school systems there, a lot of things are different here. Two things that we haven't really touched on. One of them was a that we learn that uh, classes get new teachers every year and instead of like one teacher taking down throughout, I didn't know the first five years of school. Is that true across the board and most public schools or are there differences or what, what's your opening?

Speaker 2:          49:40          Um, it's not the, it's not true. Some schools have what they call looping, which is I teach kindergarten this year and first grade next year and then I go back to kindergarten and then first grade. So I have you have the same teacher for two years. Um, and if you put looping into our search engine and you might find some schools like that or in the book you can, you can see some, the other thing that they signed a few schools have is what they call bridge classes where you have both kindergarten and first grade in one classroom and you stay in that classroom with the same teacher for two years. So we do have some of that. Rudolph Steiner School is private. It's the only one I know of that keeps the teachers for the whole, uh, we keeps the kids for, you know, the whole of their elementary school. Um, the new American Academy might do that as well in Brooklyn. Um, I think they may have that European model.

Speaker 6:          50:32          You don't think there's real value in data, right? It's just not common or,

Speaker 2:          50:37          oh, sure. I mean there's like any of these things, there's, there's, there's a advantages and drawbacks

Speaker 6:          50:43          and sort of other thing I wanted to touch on is about the PTA where like people as how they can get involved and do something where to school. I sort of want as the opposite, like in Europe, like schools, suburb can you can't get involved a little bit, but I sometimes feel there is like an expectation or pressure for people to get involved. And I didn't even know. This isn't like a private preschool that parents who don't get involved are cold out or it's like,

Speaker 2:          51:11          like I think it's, I mean the other difference between the United States and Europe is that our schools are supported through local taxes, mostly property taxes. And in, in most countries of the world, it's a national system where everybody gets the same. All the teachers get the same pay and the same, the schools all get the same resources. So what we do in New York City is we have these insane PCAs that, you know, raise $1 million a year. Um, I agree with you that it's lunacy. Um, some schools will pressure you. Um, some actually have a kind of parents stay out attitudes. So it varies from school to school. Um, yeah. I mean I agree with you. It's ridiculous. Thank you. What are your thoughts on dual language programs and how effective they are for a native speakers of English are very good questions. So we have in the, in the end of the book you'll find a dual language programs.

Speaker 2:          52:14          There's a Chinese, Spanish, Polish, Italian, um, Haitian creole, French, Mandarin. Um, there's even, there's one in Korean as well. Um, and some of the children, the way they're supposed to be designed as half the children speak English at home. Um, half of them speak the other language and they alternate the language of instruction from day to day. And the kids who are supposed to be fluent in both languages by the time they're in fifth grade, the um, some of them work very well indeed. Um, it also depends on the language. I think a Chinese and Korean are very hard for non native speakers to learn just in that, in that six hours a day. Some of the successful Chinese dual language programs continue until five o'clock in the afternoon, particularly for writing. That's difficult for Spanish. I think non native speakers come out doing, you know, pretty well. Um, and there's also a, um, uh, like everything else, there's a range of quality. Some of them, it's just sort of a little smattering the language. You'll learn to sing some songs. Um, others are, you

Speaker 3:          53:26          really learn to write and spell and speak about science and the second language. So there's a arranged there. So it's one o'clock. I think we have to wrap up, so thank you so much. [inaudible].
