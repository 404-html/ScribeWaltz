Speaker 1:          00:08          Standing next to me is Winefred Winefred Riley. She is a psychotherapist specializing in marital therapy and relationship issues in a private practice in Berkeley, California. In her 35 years of clinical practice, she has treated hundreds of couples who are convinced they're headed for divorce. Ms. Riley has been a guest lecture on marriage and sexuality and her writing has appeared on the Huffington Post, the good men project x chain and her blog speak of marriage. I'm so excited that we get to hear Winifred Riley. Thanks.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Thank you so much. So I'm going to start first. Thank you so much for having me. I'm going to start first by telling you this personal story. So my husband and I were married early on a Sunday morning. By late that afternoon we were in the car driving down one o one to spend a few days down in big Sur. So our friends had painted, just married across the back of our car. So as we're driving along, people are honking and waving and giving the thumbs up. And then this guy in the pickup truck comes on pulling on up to our car and he's honking from my husband to roll down the window. And then at about 75 miles an hour, this guy leans across the cab of his truck and yells out the window, don't do it. So I there, I married what, maybe five hours, six hours, and I'm thinking, Nah, that'll never be us.

Speaker 2:          01:44          Not not the business of yelling out of the car, window and newlyweds, but the idea that we would be disgruntled or unhappy, it never occurred to me now you'd think that it would've known better given my work, given that I'm a marriage and family therapist. I mean you think I would have been better prepared in some way for what marriage would be, but actually I was as naive, an unprepared as my clients. I had ideas that were fairly useless. Like we have so much in common and we're so in love. How hard could this be? So here's what a client of mindset on the eve of her third anniversary. Yeah, I know marriage takes work. Everybody knows that I was prepared for that and I knew we'd have our difficulties, but I never ever imagined that the biggest difficulty in my life would be my husband George.

Speaker 2:          02:38          So I'm here today to talk about my book. It takes one to tango. I'm going to talk about why marriage is hard and I'm going to tell you a little bit of my personal story, how I changed my own marriage by taking a leadership role and how you can create a vibrant and satisfying relationship too. So the question is, why is marriage so hard? Well, here, marriage puts two people into a small space with the expectation of keeping them there for a lifetime and then says, good luck. Marriage doesn't come with a guidebook or a roadmap. And none of us come in with all the skills that we need. Many of us have had terrible role models. We've had parents who fought to the death or hated each other and finally divorced, or we had over idealized romantic role models like grandparents who were married 75 years in swore. They never had one single argument now. And then there you are in your honeymoon on the third day and you're ready to kill each other. So you've completely blown it right out of the gate. Then we also have these mistaken ideas, like marriage is harder, marriage shouldn't be hard, or people who fight should get a divorce or those people look really happy. What's wrong with us

Speaker 2:          04:08          then? You know, so we have the negative role miles and there was a confusion about the difference between marriage and courtship. Courtship is that wonderful drunk on love beginning phase where it's all about sameness and loveliness and you just can't believe that you finally found someone so perfect, someone so much like you with so much in common. And unfortunately courtship doesn't last. And many people really do think that's, that's what relationships are. So when court ends, they just move on to the next one. Or when marriage gets difficulty or the long, the longer relationships start to, they start to struggle. People think, Nah, I better move on. So the, so when people struggle and they find marriage to be difficult, what I want people to know is that nothing is wrong. It's just that marriage is a really tough teacher and we all have plenty to learn, but many of us don't like the idea of being beginners. We think somehow we're supposed to be good at everything, even without any practice at all.

Speaker 2:          05:19          No. My graduate school training mimicked some of these myths about marriage that that were not particularly helpful, but worse. It seemed to me the trouble that people had in marriage be more of a pathology, sort of an aberration, more than the norm. But I was thinking there are some really lovely people that I see in my practice and my husband and I were not preparing exactly crazy, but we were going at it in ways that didn't make sense. So I thought something is wrong with this idea. So I decided to figure out why and in order to do that, I decided to turn myself into a marriage expert. Now, back then, none of this existed. I couldn't just sit at my computer. Well actually I didn't even have a computer back then and I couldn't just sit down and Google. Why is my husband driving me crazy?

Speaker 2:          06:15          What am I supposed to do? It was none of that. So I went to the bookstore. I had to, you know, I went books and I took workshops and trainings and went to conferences. And here's the most interesting thing that I found. It pretty much turned everything I understood about marriage and relationships upside down. So most of us think that marriage is about agreement and consensus about compromising and meeting halfway. It's our need for consensus that's driving us crazy. We need this agreement, we need this validation. We need somebody to say, yes, I hear you. I agree with you. I perfectly understand you. Oh yes. What you're saying makes perfect sense and yes, let's do it your way. But of course it's this, you know, of course we all like that. I mean everybody wants validation. And what I like to say is that validation is a perfectly fine thing to want and it's a really dangerous thing to need.

Speaker 2:          07:20          So here's essentially what it comes down to. We need to learn how to disagree, not agree. Now, I'm not saying that we have to fight all the time and that that's the key to happiness. I'm just saying that what we have to do is we need to learn to effectively deal with being two different people. This was 180 degrees off of everything that I believed up until then, but somehow it made perfect sense to me. I didn't know how to apply it to my life, but I knew that I was onto something. So let's consider this quote from Einstein central to the advancement of human civilization is the spirit of open inquiry. We must not only learn to tolerate our differences, we must welcome that, welcome them as the richness and diversity, which can lead to true intelligence. So I read this quote and I'm in a workshop for therapists and we're, we're working with how to deal with our most impossible, difficult couples.

Speaker 2:          08:29          So I thought immediately of this couple up, or Bruce and Cindy, they were my couple from hell. They fought about everything. They just, you're there the corner. And they couldn't decide, you know, if they're just taking a walk, whether they should go right or left. So I try to imagine die hard, Vegan Bruce, welcoming as rich and diverse, his wife's Cindy's interest in any hamburger when this pi would not even wear leather shoes. And what I realize is that's the point. We don't have to get the person senior, never going to agree on anything. And the good news is I didn't, we didn't actually have to make them agree. But here's, here's one of the pieces of trouble with consensus. Okay. So have you ever noticed that your version and your spouse's version sound nothing alike? Have you thought that maybe you're living in alternate realities, parallel realities on a good day.

Speaker 2:          09:35          So here's how I observed this in my office people. So somebody's there and they're starting to talk and they say, you know, and this thing happened and that they have near Portner moves like some micro movement. Why brow little suddenly happens in what, what? And they, there was a completely riveted, they can't finish a sentence. They can't complete a thought. And they say, see, this is what I mean. We can't talk about X. I'm not allowed to bring up why. And I say, why not? Who made these rules? And so if you want to know who made these roles, I'm going to ask you to take a minute and I want you to think about, imagine, remember the two of you back in the early days of your relationship. There you are. You're in Starbucks sharing cafe lattes. Maybe you're actually drinking one tea with two straws and you're, you're planning your weekend away romantic the first trip to the country.

Speaker 2:          10:40          And now meanwhile, in some smokey back room, your people and your partners, people are back there negotiating the terms of your relationship. Okay, fine. Uh, I won't question how many times a day she has to talk to her mother. Okay, fine. And she's just not going to bring up what the cost of those club level seats are at the ballpark and all right. Really? Ah, okay. They'll never, ever, ever talk about sex. So this gets signed into law. They shake hands. Meanwhile you're out there, you know, having a Lark, you have no idea that these are actually the rules that will confine you. They will define you, they will make you miserable. They will make you feel like you were living in a box until you have the strength and stamina to change them. Now sad about courtship, about courtship being about all things lovely and wonderful.

Speaker 2:          11:41          These rules, you made these roles back in the beginning when the goal was to keep the peace, to fall in love, to preserve your bond, to keep your partner essentially from thinking you're completely awful and deciding to leave you. So all of these things are hidden, but you, you make these rules and you will have to live with them. So that's, that's what courtship is. And so here's marriage. Marriage is essentially about the rest of your life together. You can't keep up the facade of, of not being yourself when you, when you're, when you're in a long relationship. So marriage is really about coming to terms with the fact that you're two different people that you want different things that you liked, different things that some of the things you're going to want are going to clash with what your partner has in mind. Now, this is really, really important.

Speaker 2:          12:44          We have to figure out how to deal with this, our differences with grace, and in order to do this, you're going to have to learn how to stand on your own. This is crucial. This is the whole, this is the whole point that I wrote and this is why I wrote this book. If you can't stand on your own, if you can't take a position, you're never going to challenge the rules. You're not going to live your life. You're not going to like your partner. You're not going to like how you feel. You will have compromised your core values. You will have sunk below your own bottom line. You will be fearful. You will find yourself spending a year saying things like, we're not allowed to do this and I'm not allowed to do that. You're going to feel trapped. You are going to blame your spouse.

Speaker 2:          13:35          If you, if you imagine yourself one year, five year, 10 years, I'm married almost 40 years, find yourself all the way down the line. You won't even know. You would've been able to recognize yourself. You will have turned yourself into a pretzel of accessibility and you won't, and you won't be able to standard. Why this is important is that you have to realize what's at stake. You've, you've sacrificed your eye for your weed. And in order to be happily married, to be in a satisfying relationship, we have to be as connected to ourselves as we are to our spouse. If you can't do that, what's at stake is your vitality, your wellbeing, and really even possibly your entire relationship. So here's where my personal story comes in. I come home from this workshop I've taken, I've gotten this new idea and I'm ecstatic. I'd finally figured out why my husband and I are fighting like a couple of junkyard dogs.

Speaker 2:          14:44          I figure this is it. I've got it. So I come home and I'm all excited and I said, essentially, honey, this is the greatest thing that's ever happened. I'm going to dismantle our entire marriage right down to the rafters and we're going to remodel this whole thing while we live in it. And I'm going to be the architect and the carpenter. So I has been, you know, we didn't embrace the, all of these ideas with quite the relish that I did. And you know, pretty much what he said was, I pretty much think our marriage is fine as it is. So I know it didn't deter me. I decided no, I'm going to keep at it. I knew that this was right. You know, but, but then actually, so to be honest, what he actually said after, I think our marriage is fine as it is, he actually said you went to a workshop for the weekend and you came back brainwashed and you are essentially, you're going to save our marriage.

Speaker 2:          15:43          You were about to destroy it. So I mean, I can't blame him for thinking this. I mean, I'm seeing things like in order to be close, we have to be separate. In order to stop fighting, we have to disagree. You know, this is so many, could be sense. And so I can, I can understand. So, and here's the other thing. I was pretty much, here's the picture. If this is exactly what I was like, I came home like a lunatic. Zelle, I'm, I'm, I'm, you know, I, I knew that this was right, but there was some way in which I couldn't actually sell it to him. So I kept trying out my good ideas and books to read and things to do. And, and it was, and it was, you know, it's like a door to door salesman trying to sell a reluctant housewife, a new vacuum cleaner.

Speaker 2:          16:33          I don't really need this. Mine works just fine. So I was about to give up and then I realized that maybe going about this all wrong, I realized that my, my, the instructions, what I was going by was that you have to stand on your own. You have to take risks. But what I was doing was he was exactly the opposite of what I needed to do. I was trying to get my husband's buyin. It was, it was as if I was saying, honey, I can't very well stand and be separate from you if you don't join me. I can't take the lead if you don't come along. And that was when I realized that this business of changing my marriage was going to be a whole lot harder and a little more complicated than I had first anticipated. I realized then that if I was going to change my marriage, I was going to have to change it myself. So I didn't have, I didn't have any real, um, real rules for how to do this. But, but, but this, these are the principles that I had. You can't change your partner. You have to take risks. You have to challenge the rules that can find you and frustrate you.

Speaker 2:          18:05          You have to recognize and accept that this is not a kind of a beeline to change. You're going to have to learn by falling seven times and standing up a eight. And most of all, you're going to need to focus on yourself. Well, I decided that focusing on myself was the best, was the best place to begin. So instead of focusing on all of the ways in which he was contributing toward difficulties, when focusing on myself, I discovered a handful of things. I'm a stubborn, is my husband. I'm as likely to start a fight as he is. I am maybe even less likely to allow it to end. I will be willing to fight about anything as ridiculous and stupid as it might be, as long as I have to end up being right. But the worst thing, the most painful observation that I had was that I realized that I have the staying power of a dandelion under pressure.

Speaker 2:          19:13          I would just crumble. And it, it didn't really match my sense of myself who I am out in the world. But somehow at home there were these ways that our interactions would switch, you know, would just make me dissolve. So, so I decided that further than just this focus, which helped, I learned how to stop being pulling my end of the tug of war rope. What I realized that I needed to do was I needed to pick this most frustrating mind boggling interaction that I would have with my husband. It's what I refer to as our loopy logic fight here. Way kind of start with, we didn't matter what we were talking about it, but within a short period of time he's throwing things in from left field and right. I'd be saying, wait, wait, wait a minute. Where are we talking about shoes? Wait a second, I thought we were talking about and then it's what, what's going on?

Speaker 2:          20:11          And I would just lose my ability to think he was very good. I really have died by or competence. He was terrific and I would make me lose. It would just, I feel like I was losing my mind. So what I began doing was experimenting with what would it take for me to maintain my thoughts, to feel like I'm staying in one piece. So I tried deep breathing and I tried counting backwards and I tried writing down points that I wanted to make, but none of that worked. So then one day I decided to take a physical step back then I noticed I was able to maintain my thinking better but not very well. So I took another step back and then I experimented. I come back in the room and I'd look, I would just lose it in about six seconds I come back out of the room and so I did this.

Speaker 2:          21:05          Honestly, people say, how long did it take? It took a year. It took a year for me to actually be able to, to stand there and this is how it happened. One day in the middle of one of our stupid go rounds, I realized I didn't have to leave the room there I was an and it was like suddenly this words for like snowflakes falling through the air and I was perfectly calm and I knew what I thought and I knew what I wanted to say and it was like, like being popping outside of the pull of gravity and just floating free through space. And so here's what I'm going to ask for you to do. I would like for you, here's my question.

Speaker 3:          21:54          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          21:55          What experience do you have? What's, what is it like for you? What experience do you have where you lose yourself? Where what you want it feels out of reach. Where what goes on makes your head spin and frustrates you or makes you shut down or cry or blow up. What one situation would you like to master? So I'd like you to just take a minute and write it down. One way to think about it is this, instead of x, I want to do y instead of blowing up. I'm wondering remain calm instead of crying when I'm angry, I want to be able to hold my thoughts together. I want to be able to express myself. Now. In order for you to do this, you're going to have to do two things.

Speaker 2:          22:56          You're going to have to give up trying to change your partner and I mean really give it up. I don't mean just lip service. No, no pun intended there. I didn't mean lip service to the idea of secretly believing your partner should change. People come in and they, it's like they bring in a broken toaster to the fix it shop in my office and they just, it's like here I finally brought, I'm bringing my situation to an expert. I've tried to fix my partner and here it goes and so it's not like that. The thing about marriage is that it's a choice. We can stay with our partner or we can leave, but if we're going to stay, we have to really, we have, we have one of two choices. We can, we can be completely driven nuts by our partner or we can figure out what we're going to do with ourselves.

Speaker 2:          23:55          So the other thing you're going to have to do, you're going to have to totally give up the, it takes to paradigm. You're going to have to throw out all this stuff about fairness and needing both partners to work as a team and change. See, this is one of the things that surprise me in my own marriage, that then as I was busy focusing on myself, my husband was actually changing in ways all on his own. He was calming down and occasionally he was even the more levelheaded arguing when we would get into something. He, he, you know, one day he completely surprised me. I came home and I was, I know I came home to make lunch and left all his stuff all over the counter and the plate and the fork and that, all of that stuff. And I was immediately incensed and um, and so weeks we started that into it.

Speaker 2:          24:55          Oh, like, well what a nice way for you to come home and say hello. Well, you know, I'm, I only have 15 minutes and I have to deal with your math back and forth and back and forth. We went and then, then he stopped and he said, okay, hold on a minute. Let's back up. So in other words, you come home in a rush and complain about my mass. I get defensive and you feel despair. You said about right? And I said, uh, yeah, now I really, I was about to fall over. And he said, yeah, I can see that. And then he began to clean up. So what happens when you stop focusing on your partner and you focus on yourself? That was what he did. He began, he was focused on me and then he was focused on himself. So you're going to have to completely give up the one, the, the, the two to Tango Paradigm in order for this to work.

Speaker 2:          25:53          Now here's the interesting thing that people say, you know, in business people, people you know, are, are impressed with leadership. They call leaders decoding, being an innovator. They, you know, they say, you know, you're, you're a twin center. But when I suggest that people have to take it in their own marriage, they think that I'm centrally telling them that they're going to have to be some sort of doormat. So I promise you, I'm asking you to roll over and play dead or give up on the things that are important to you or just live with conditions that you can't stand. I'm really suggesting that you recognize the power of being a leader for change in your relationship. And, and it really is going to start with that one thing that I'm asking you to look at. The one thing that you can change, the one thing that you can control and, and, and don't be surprised if it takes a long time for you to master that, that one thing that I asked you to do.

Speaker 2:          27:04          It's an incredibly, it's, it's so much more empowering than waiting for your partner to change. So, you know, in, and, and basically what I, you know, what I want you to understand is that you have more power than you think. If you're skeptical, you're not alone. I mean really I'm asking you to let go of one of the most cherished beliefs that people have to change as a team that that it's not worth doing if your spouse doesn't join you. So I'm really just asking you to take the challenge, challenge yourself. The goal is not here to turn you into a little island of self sufficiency. It's about turning you into a partner who's capable of change is capable of leadership. One person must take the first step in change. My invitation to you is why not let that person be you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          28:09          I love this so much. Thank you. And one of the chapters in almost every chapter there was something where I had to put it down and think about it, but almost everything in chapter six when it says it happens once, what happens once you calm down? And that for me has been in my marriage and very difficult thing to do is just to calm down because I was high pressure. Yes. Under the same impression or feelings that you were talking about where we have to do this together. We have to agree, and my husband really likes for me to agree with him. And so it's very, it caused not surprising kinds of issues. So, um, but calming down, it's just such a great thought and a great, yeah.

Speaker 2:          29:01          Honest and it's not something that's easy to do. You know, when you're really upset and somebody says to you, calm down. I mean, how useless is that? Right. You know, so it actually has to happen. It has to happen from inside and it really is another one of those kind of try this and try that. You know, like I was saying, in order to stay present in my loopy logic fight, you know, I tried counting, I tried digging my fingernails in my hand. I tried planting my feet, you know, it really just, it ended up being that I needed the physical distance. And little did I know that what I was doing at that point was kind of calming down my, my neocortex. I was staying in that little sliver of reasonable nets while the kind of flood of the whole rest of my brain was taking over and acting like it was some kind of emergency and that I'm in on page one 31 you talk about how, and this, this is for me a revolutionary thought for most people. It takes some time to grow comfortable with the idea of being responsible for comforting ourselves when we're disappointed our hurt and somewhat longer to discover its benefits.

Speaker 2:          30:20          And you'd recognize the point of self soothing with your children. Yes. We all, you know, yeah. We want them to self soothe so that we can get a night's sleep. Yes. And to self sooth ourselves as a partner in the marriage. Yeah. I mean if you think about it, you're in the middle of a, of a thing with your partner. If you're reliant on them to be soothing, you mean they're busy, they're brain is lit up at that moment. And so where are you going to do go into some sort of free fall? I mean you have to actually settle down and tell yourself I'm really going to be okay. Well, one of my clients had a wonderful phrase. He said that the thing that would help him the most was that when he got anxious, he would remind himself. He would say, okay, I might get her here but I'm not going to die.

Speaker 2:          31:11          That was his self soothing and so we find something, uh, what are some of your suggestions? Okay, well like I said, you can breathe, you can, I think you have to start with, with the, the novel idea that it's actually your job. And I think that's a big beginning part. It, you know, being, being able to lean on each other and being together. Like I said, we're not, this is not about being a little island, it's just about, it's like it stays to be able to lean on each other, but you have to be able to stand on your feet, especially when you're not agreeing. You know, you can't lean on somebody else while, while they're agitated or holding their position. So you can breathe, you can talk yourself down, you can take breaks, you can say, hold on, I'm just getting flooded. I'm going to step out. I'm not suggesting that you come back two days later. Um, you know what I'm saying? Just five minutes. Quiet your brain down. So it really is an experiment. Uh, sometimes there are issues that are so hot to deal with that you, you pick them up tomorrow.

Speaker 4:          32:18          Okay,

Speaker 2:          32:19          that's great. Um, did you want to ask a question and we have stories of questions right here. Okay.

Speaker 2:          32:32          I'm going to read the Dory questions and feel free to add as many as you would like. And there it is anonymous. So the first question we have is how to convince your partner to go to couple's therapy and is it helpful to do it alone? Great. I love that question. You can't convince or persuade someone to do something that they're uncomfortable with. You can ask. It's actually your job to ask. I mean, nobody is going to advocate for you except you. But you know, there are reasons people don't want to go to couple's therapy. They, you know, they think it's a first step toward divorce. They're fearful. They think that, um, things were fine. They are, uh, what's, you know, don't walk the boat, um, or the, or the or, you know, or they just don't believe in it. And so I, it's, it's this, it's the one to tango principal.

Speaker 2:          33:30          If there's something important to you, go on your own. Take the lead. I do work with some people by themselves without their partner. Uh, and so a good couple of therapists will actually help you, not just take your side. It's not that helpful means it's lovely. But if you, if you're talking about nonsense in your relationship, you actually have had somebody who, who can, you know, not just commiserate with you but actually help you take charge of yourself. So, you know, I think sometimes what people, I, it's very, it's kind of a sort of seems obvious. Uh, just you can start by saying, this is really important to me. Uh, and I'd like you to go at least try it once and uh, but really go by yourself, go by yourself. It a lot can happen if he, if you don't just go there to complain, but you go there to say, like, I did, you know, saying, oh wait, I'm as big of a hothead. Oh, here's my contribution to the difficulty and I want help with that.

Speaker 2:          34:38          What are some of the steps one can take when they're screaming, name calling as well as verbal abuse in the relationship, but the partner refuses to stop this behavior. Or the partner says it will stop if the partner does such and such a few change. Okay. Well, all right, so, so if somebody is screaming and yelling, I differentiate this from, you know, where there's physical violence. So let's just take that off of this off the table. It's just, it's kind of bevel on it, your house. Um, I think the surprising thing is for you to be able to remain calm. I learned this from my son's kindergarten teacher. The room would be chaotic and she was a whore. Her voice, she would get really quiet and the energy in the room would change. Now, if your spouse is off the rails, the last immune or it could be able to reason with him or her anyway. And so I suggest you sit down and be a witness. Also. You don't have to argue every single point. I mean, we don't, you know, you don't have to argue. If somebody is saying the earth is flat, you don't actually have to say, we'll actually hear here is his wife's round. You have to calm down. You also might want to try with a really nasty, uh, spouse, uh, saying, you know,

Speaker 4:          36:03          w

Speaker 2:          36:04          do you, do you actually think I can hear you when you talk like that? How about if we sit down? What did you tell me what it is you want you to understand or I don't really have any idea why you get so frustrated. Do you have any idea why you totally lose it? You know, that you start to become the ambassador for sanity in a crazy situation. It's least that's a start.

Speaker 4:          36:29          Okay.

Speaker 2:          36:29          Next question. You talked about standing on your own and taking a position in the same vein. Do you think it's absolutely necessary to spend time alone explicitly, um, be single for many years before being married? Well, I, I wasn't. Um, and you know, and so I was very young when I got married and I, I, my sense of self, I, Oh, I sure thought I was an adult, but what I had lots of growing to do. I think that that any coming in at any phase in your life, you're still going to meet challenges. That whole list of why is marriage hard that I talked about in the beginning, it's still going to be difficult. You know, you're going to think, oh, I'm a really saying, well adjusted person. I can, I can handle just about anything. And then, you know, you put yourself in a small space with somebody and you're going to just see, we know all the little holes in your, in, in yourself. You know, this is quote a man. A man can be a fool and not know it, but not if he's married, you know, and a woman can be a fool and not know it unless she's married. And so, um, so I think that the more solid and strong we are as as people, the better is, but you're still going to hit the trenches. You still going to have to learn how you live with this person when, when agreeing to disagree, it does not solve every problem.

Speaker 4:          38:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          38:02          This next question is great. Any advice for single people trying to find or choose a partner and wanting to make that relationship work? Okay. Yeah. Well, you know, it's the same as anyone. Even a relationship.

Speaker 4:          38:20          Okay.

Speaker 2:          38:20          Be Clear about what you want. Know as much about yourself and be willing to be brave, be willing to reveal yourself. I have, I have clients who come in 20, 30 years down the line and, and they've hidden so many parts of themselves, but they feel strangled and you know, and so, so the, the, the thing of when you're looking for a relationship, find somebody who's curious. Find somebody who wants to take an adventure. But, but if it isn't going to be a lark with anyone, it's just not going to be a walk in the park. But, but somebody who's willing to laugh, explore, grow, um, you know, it's, it, it, it's, it's, it helps.

Speaker 2:          39:10          And it's, I appreciate what you said just about knowing yourself because yeah, it seems like no matter what, how much you, you in, uh, investigate the person or interview the person or try to analyze the person. It's always comes down to that when you are on your side, that's to it. I mean, it really is. You know, you can't, uh, if you don't know what you want and who you are and what you think, if you have no connection to your inner most reliable witness, you're just going to be moving about and, and you're not going to actually be able to, to, to have it, have your relationship go in any direction. And so, you know, it's not for sissies is what say, you know, people say, but longterm relationships. Very true. And this one, this question is about long distance relationships. Okay. How would one approach this when a couple is in a long distance relationship and what are your thoughts on each partner seeing a separate therapist?

Speaker 2:          40:14          Um, you know, so, so this may sound like a kind of a jokey answer, but therapy can be one of the worst things you could do for your marriage. I mean, there's statistics about it, so it doesn't mean don't do it, it's just that you will sometimes have, you will, you therapists will take sides. Um, you know, you're, you've got two people. If you're focusing, if you're doing relationship work, not just in a work in a work is a different thing when you're doing it with an individual therapy. When you're doing relationship work. I've actually worked with people where someone flies in and I see them for, you know, two or three hours and maybe a couple of times in a short time. And then we, and then they go back and they do their own work that, that in a long distance relationship, some of the pressure is off. You know, in the beginning I showed this cartoon that was the definition of marriage is two people in a row boat and they're rowing in opposite directions. So that's some of the stuff that happens when you're, when you're living together, things heat up. But you know, if you, um, you know, but, but it's the same I suppose, you know, any work, any, anytime that you're together, pay attention to yourself what you want, you know, don't, don't shy away from challenging things. When you mentioned that therapy

Speaker 1:          41:34          isn't necessarily the best thing, it reminded me of what you told us at lunch that you had a therapist and a recommended,

Speaker 2:          41:39          but something that wasn't, my therapist said, oh, your husband and you know, you're so frustrated, he's really never going to to, you know, really take a hold and, and grow. You really should, you know, just move on. Which was stunning. And, and, and I actually stopped that therapy pretty quickly, uh, realizing that, you know, I would've much rather somebody said, you know what I what I'm saying to people, well this is challenging. You know, fast new seat belts. You don't put on your work boots, get going, see where you can go. It wasn't that my husband was immune to change, it just was, she used to come to, I'm more content with things as they were. So I came in with these ideas for how to have it go better and, and you know, and at this point he, he would, he would not argue that this, that our relationship is, you know, much, much better because we both basically grew up.

Speaker 1:          42:36          And that leaves me to a question of how does one choose a therapist? Because if you have a therapist that is quick to say, yeah, this isn't working out, you guys should just get divorced.

Speaker 2:          42:48          I don't think you should allow anyone to tell you to get divorced. Remember what I said about marriage being a choice. You can stay with this partner or you can leave, but if you're going to stay, you have two choices. You can figure out what you're going to do with yourself or you can allow that person to drive you completely nuts. And this business of figuring out what to do with yourself is really pretty extraordinary. There were a lot of things we call, you know, it's not just we calm down, but I later in the book I have a thing about what, what, what some people discovered to be changed. Like one person said to his wife is just a busy person moving around, always drove him really crazy. And then you realize it's a little bit like living near train tracks, but people eventually stop hearing the train and he's just stopped focusing on, she was always running around and doing stuff. He figured out how to regulate his own state and be peaceful in the midst of all of her people coming and going and calling, you know, so, so, you know, rather than I need to be with you, you need to slow down. He figured out how, how to just maintain his own shaping the context.

Speaker 1:          44:06          Next question, how to get, how to agree or to disagree on parenting issues. How we approach parenting if we are coming from very different places.

Speaker 2:          44:17          This one, you know, I could write an entire book. This one is not a quick answer because it's one of those things that you can't have two philosophies. You can't say we're never going to spank the kids and somebody going to spank the kids were, or you're never going to do timeout or you're going to do, you know? And so I think, you know, I, I can't, I can't actually give this one a quick answer, but it actually I think comes down to needing to collaborate in some way but more to be persuasive in terms of uh, the seat. Okay. When you have to, when you have two things and you're only going to have one outcome, the only way you're going to get anywhere is it somebody is going to have to yield, somebody is going to have to be generous. They're going to have to say, all right, this is not my first choice.

Speaker 2:          45:12          But from a solid and strong place, we'll do what you want. We can't compromise. You can't have, you know, half a time out. You can't have one parent saying we have no sugar in the house and the other one, you know, feeding the kid sugar. So or screen time. I mean these issues you have to, it's, it's, it's, it's sorta like this, you're going to even move over here or you're going to move over there and how you do it I think does it requires sense of self. Don't expect these conversations that happen quickly. Hang in there with it, see if you can both come from the most curious and generous places in yourself.

Speaker 2:          45:54          Thank you. There are a couple more here. How amplified is the, it takes one to tango message when one of the partners can't change much. For example, Asperger's. Okay. So I do work with couples like that and, and um, and so here's the, here's the piece that, that if the Asperger's person actually work igniters is that there may be ways that he or she isn't going to change but can acknowledge that it drives their spouse nuts. That's one thing. And then for the other spouse to give up all hope of this person being different and to, and to make your own moves and think your own thoughts. You know, I work with one couple where the guy would, would be, would begin every you'll begin every answer or every piece of a conversation was begun with the word no. And he eventually stopped, you know, she'd say, I'd like to go to the moon.

Speaker 2:          47:01          And he'd say, no, I think, you know, Pluto would be better. But every no is the beginning of, so she eventually got to, I can just ignore that word and I can, you know, I can listen and he big and he actually did change. I think people actually can change or be not everything, but I don't put a ceiling over what's possible for people. But I think you know, you pick this person, you know somewhat of what you're getting and what you're not getting and you have to figure out how to make yourself happy in that context.

Speaker 4:          47:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:33          Have you ever seen the technique you describe work on a marriage that has already failed, where the partners are divorced and separated or separated? At which point, um, would you recommend as a professional with experience giving up?

Speaker 2:          47:48          Okay. Well, if it's already failed in your already divorced, I mean I have seen people we married, but I don't think that's quite what you're asking. So I'm going to answer a question of like how far gone is too far gone. Um, I actually in my book opens with this quote, it's a Turkish proverb that says, no matter how far you have gone down the wrong road, you can turn around. So I never give up. Uh, it's not my job to tell people, you know, you can do it or you can't do it. But I never give up. I never put a ceiling over what's possible for people. But here's the thing, marriage is a choice. If you want to try and make it a go, I say you don't have anything to lose. Give it your all. See what happens. There is no guarantee as to how it will come out. But if you have even one shred of hope, start working on your side of it and don't and don't give up. You still might not end up married, but I like people to at least come out of it. Being able to say, you know, I feel as if I really did everything I could.

Speaker 4:          48:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:57          This is our last question. You mentioned getting, uh, giving up the idea about 50, 50 fairness and working as a team. How do you then balance day to day obligations such as parenting, working without being completely run down or a bearing? Most of the weight?

Speaker 2:          49:18          Well, you know it's tricky because this is a, this is a common concern, especially for the person who feels like they're already carrying more weight. It's not, this is the, the, the Ma this, this idea is not about how you should be doing all of the cleaning and watching all the kids and doing, you know, and it's turning your, turning cartwheels about everything. It really is about. So if you're in a situation where your partner is not doing much, this is a time where you actually might need to really step forward. And instead of saying, you know, like what's wrong with you? You might say this would be like what I would say to somebody in my office. So what do you tell yourself while you're sitting there reading and your wife is running around doing the dishes, unloading the dishwasher and, and, and juggling three children.

Speaker 2:          50:10          Like tell me how that makes sense to you. And so you know, you, you want to find yourself in a position where you're not working on changing your spouse, but that doesn't mean you know blooming where you're planted. It means you, this is why I said it's going to take gumption. You're going to have to move toward your difficulties and talk about them in ways that figure out ways to talk about them that are affective, that aren't about changing the other person, but are really about coming forward and being yourself. Great. Thank you so much. Oh, it's been really a pleasure.
