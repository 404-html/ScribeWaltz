Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Well, come to talks at Google in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Today. It's my enormous pleasure to welcome I William Pollack, author of the recently published book, the only woman in the room, why science is still a boy's club. Mrs Pollock is professor of creative writing at the University of Michigan. She is a published author of novels, nonfiction and textbooks, but she was not always as we see her now at one time, she overcame many obstacles, most of them external. A few, uh, if I read the book correctly, internal probably to become one of the first two women at Yale University to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in physics. She graduated summa cum laude with honors and yet chose at that time not to pursue a career in physics, which you had dreamed of her entire life, but rather to pursue a career in writing. Part of this book is a memoir that explains how she got to that point. What she did after that, it picks up again as a research study sparked by Larry Summers. Infamous comment or famous comment and 2005 g, why aren't there more women teaching and the hard sciences? Could this be because et cetera. Uh, so she took it on herself to interview former fellow students and teachers and women who had since made careers in stem subjects to find out the answer. I won't spoil it here. Um, there may not be a happy ending yet, but perhaps it's something we can work toward. Please join me in welcoming Eileen Pollock.

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       Hi everybody. Can you all hear me back? Roads and everything? Thanks for coming out. I can only imagine how busy you all are. And, uh, it's really, uh, an honor and it's exciting for me to be in a Google space. I've, you know, we all the outsiders here, how mystical it is for you guys. And it turns out it's true. I've just never worked in such a place. Um, but I have a lot of attachments to Kendall Square. So back in the 80s, my ex husband was doing his mdphd at Harvard and MIT and his lab was right on the other side of Ames street. But of course, none of this looked like this. It was just this huge wasteland because they were supposed to build the Kennedy Space Center here. So they destroyed all the buildings and then Kennedy was assassinated. So it became the Johnson Space Center in Houston. And for all those many years, there was just this big, vast nothing here.

Speaker 2:          00:03:09       I'm, the only place to eat was there was the old bnb deli. It's not, it's still here. Anyway. Um, so it's, it's interesting for me to be back and I, my first job was at MIT. I, I worked for the head of the civil engineering department, um, that he would get assigned from the UN to write books about how to build low cost housing in third world in developing countries. And I researched and wrote them for him. And considering I had never even built a birdhouse and had never been to a developing country. I have always hoped that really nobody ever use those books at the UN for anything. So what I thought I would do was talk a little bit more about the book, um, because my publisher would want me to do that. And I do hope you'll be to get a copy and I would love to sign them for you afterward.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       And then what I'm actually gonna read to you from though is a more recent article that's more directly, um, focused on, on tech and how, um, some of the issues affect a place like maybe Google. Um, so yeah, so the book is divided into a bunch of parts and it starts with, with sort of an investigative memoir. Um, when Larry Summers made his remarks, uh, you know, I got upset, but I had actually known Larry for years. We went way back. I was a debater in high school. I was just nerdy in every way. You could be nerdy. And Larry was older as he, he judged our team and then I, you know, kept track of him later and, and, and knew him. But, um, so I got all upset that he would have thought that there was even a possibility that one reason there weren't more women physics professors at Harvard was because of any kind of innate aptitude problems or that women didn't want to work hard as hard as men.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       The other reasons he gave seem to be more on target that they were cultural reasons is and bias and things like that. So I actually sat down to write him an email to explain why I had really not gone on in physics, even though I so passionately wanted to in the email, just went on and on and I ended up with this like 20 page email and instead of sending it to him, then I decided to write a book. And then I sent the book to him after it was done and he was good enough to, there's a blurb on the back and he said, oh, now, now I see the light and I understand what I didn't understand before. So that made me feel good. Um, but I realized that I didn't even really understand why I hadn't gone on. It was so painful for me to have walked away, to have worked so incredibly hard to get that physics degree and do, do this research and stuff that I, when I walked away from it, I really didn't want to ever think about the part of my life that had wanted to be a physicist.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       Um, and so then I had to go back and really revisit everything and you know, part of it was, um, as Jonathan said, sort of these external factors. So I went to a not very good rural high school and I actually wasn't, we didn't have any AP courses, but there was a sort of accelerated track that a couple of boys got to take in science and math. And I wasn't allowed to do it because as the principal said, girls don't go on in science and math anyway. So you would just be wasting a seed and besides it would ruin your social life. I didn't have a social life because if you're a girl at that age and your interest really good at science and math, that does help anyway. But, um, so I got very bored and angry and I stayed home and taught myself what I thought were, I was really reading about physics, but I thought I was actually studying physics and I taught myself calculus.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       But when I got to Yale, I was just blown out of the water, right? Because first of all, there were 118 guys and two women. Um, and they, almost all of them had, had, had gone to really good schools and had two years of high school physics, two years of advanced calculus. And I had taught myself this stuff from books. So I flunked my first midterm and I was going to drop, which is what happens to many young women in minorities. You get there, realize that you have had a terrible background, you flunk your first test. And of course those courses, or even cold weed out courses, right? So there's this ethos that if you get there and you're not already like top of the pack, you couldn't possibly be good, are worth saving. And so let's weed you out. Luckily I had, you know, the book is not a story about villains.

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       Um, uh, I know that the 70s sound like a really long time ago. You're mostly really young, but it was actually didn't feel much different from now in terms of sort of feminism and sexism. And we, we already, we felt even then that all the battles have been fought and, um, that women could do anything. And I didn't feel like a pioneer. And I had really, really nice. I had all male professors, there were no women professors, but I had really, really nice guys teaching me math and physics. Um, but, and so when I was going to drop, actually my, it was very unusual, but my freshman year of physics professor wouldn't let me drop the course. And he gave me very good advice and I stuck it out and I worked incredibly hard. Um, and as often happens, if you come from behind, you overshoot the mark.

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       Right? And by the time I was a senior, I was top of my class and I had done all this research. And, um, and so the fact that I didn't go and I had almost perfect grades, but I didn't think that I was good enough because no one said you're good at this, right? No one said, are you going to Grad School? You know, and I thought if I were good, someone would have said go on. Which is a big difference between most young women in most guys, that guys are raised more to, you know, make their own value. Like not look to other people to pat you on the bed, you know, head and say, yes, you're, you're pretty your queue, you can do it, whatever. Um, and, and to women more need this encouragement from the outside to go on. I didn't have confidence because I had come from behind and I still thought of myself as behind.

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       If you're the only woman in the room, the only black person in the room, the only whatever in the room, there's this, it's called a stereotype effect. But this self consciousness where everything you do you feel like you're representing your whole gender or your whole race, um, you feel self conscious every time. I would cross my legs in class, even though I was wearing jeans. So like the professor would stop talking. You know what? It was so distracting. So there were just so many distractions and I was so isolated. Really. None of the, all the guys did their problem sets together and I was off just working all by myself. Nobody ever even talked to me in classes. Um, and so those were the factors that I started to realize had really been debilitating. Um, and the reasons, the main reasons that I didn't go on.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       Um, so when I, the second part of the book was, um, I wanted to see whether my experience had been unique, whether anybody had ever felt anything similar. Um, and I was really interested in how it compared to young women today. I assumed that, um, that things really must've changed. And so I was shocked, uh, when I, so I went back to Yale to talk to the young women there. Um, I followed up with people I had been in school with, but I was really interested in, in young women today and young women at University of Michigan where I teach so I could compare a public school to, you know, an ivy. And I was really shocked. Um, there were a few more young women in the classes, but most of them seem to be saying that inside itself, the same as I had felt right, that they weren't getting encouragement, they didn't have the confidence, they felt isolated, but also, and what I think this is, it was very hard for me to admit it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       And then I think for them to admit it to me too, they felt that these beautiful, smart, charming young women at Yale or saying to me, nobody wants to date us because they, when we say we're a physics major, that's the end. Um, is anybody going to marry me? You know? And I was like, can I really be hearing this at Yale in, in, you know, 2012 it just couldn't be. And then they started telling me stories of the teasing. They had been getting like in junior high and high school, um, you know, oh, I'm going to grade you on the girl curve and your physics class and the boys will be graded on the boy curve. I mean, this me from my childhood, this is like from people your age, um, or uh, one friend's daughter was told by her teacher, you're too pretty to be good at math.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Um, and very recently I heard, so I heard from one young woman who, um, uh, walked into, she wanted to be in the robotics club. She walked in and it was all guys, she turned around and walked out. But um, three young women who are on a robotics club in high school and they were preparing for a competition. The club was going to host a competition and the advisor for the robotics club said to the three young women, you can be in charge of RefreshMints right. Show they, they just dropped the club. They never told him like, you shouldn't say that. Um, so this stuff was still going on and that, um, that really shocked me. Um, so I think what's different is there a few more women, they last a bit longer. Um, there, there are a few more organizations for support groups and things, but, um, I was really surprised how little had had changed.

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       Um, for the third part of the book, um, I did look at the studies that had been done on gender bias in the science and more and more of those studies are being done now partly because of Larry Summers remarks. So again, I think he inadvertently did a real service because a lot of people got mad and said, all right, he wants us to give him the reasons for this, let's figure it out. And um, and some of those studies are being, are very recent and are really very powerful. So the one I quoted in the excerpt that appeared in the Times magazine two years ago, it's in the book by Joe Handlesman at Yale, which really shocked me. So it's about implicit bias. Um, she ran the study at mostly research institutions, but one of the categories was engineering. So it was engineering, physics, chemistry, I think math was the other one.

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       And what they did was just mock up, um, job applications for an entry level position. So it's sorta for someone who's between Undergrad and thinking of it one day going on for a phd and in the meantime, once like a lab manager job. And so they're exactly the same job application, the same cover letter references, you know, grades, everything's the same. And uh, but once it's John on it at once, it's Jennifer. That's the only difference. And if you see the bar graph, um, for the statistical difference, it's so significant. It's not like some little sliver. It's huge, right? That John was judged more hireable, more competent, and more worthy of being mentored. Then Jennifer by huge margin and if Jennifer was going to be hired, her salary was a good four to $5,000 lower than John's. And we're talking really small salary. So I mean, John would get like 30, 32 and she was going to get 28 or it's 26 and 30, something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:37       So that's huge. Right? And what really shocked me was that the, the degree of bias did not vary according to gender. All right. So women who were going to hire a lab manager, John, just as much as guys who were going to hire a lab manager and it didn't vary by age, right? So if you were an assistant professor or full professor, you were 30 or you were 65, you were just as biased against Jennifer, except the Jennifer was much more likely to be judged. Likable. Like who did you think was more likable? Jennifer. All right. So what you could see how insidious some of these things are cause shit. People are Jennifer. And you went in for the job interview. You didn't come out thinking, Huh, they really liked me. I got the job. And you wouldn't even get why you didn't get it because the people hiring you wouldn't get why you didn't get it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       Okay. So that I thought was shocking. Um, one study that's not in the book that I'll share with you, that also shocked me. So this one just came out literally last week and it was done by actually a friend of mine from the old days. Um, Bob Saggy, who's in Boston. They came out in the Journal of American Medical Association. So you tend to think too that these problems aren't as bad say in biology cause those are now women's fields and people fields or whatever. Um, so this was in biomedical science and the study measured startup grants for first time hires. So if you, in academia, you get your first layup, you need money to set it up because you haven't been able to get grants yet. Right? So the money comes from the institution that hires you show the average for women starting their lab, their support money was $350,000, which sounds like a lot, right? She could imagine a young woman getting hired going, wow, they hired me and they gave me $350,000. Yes, thank you so much. When do I start? What was the average for guys?

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:16:31       $890,000

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       as a half a million dollars difference to start up your first lab. Now imagine how that accumulates in terms of your whole, right. And nobody knows, right? The guys don't know that the women are being screwed. The women don't know, the guys are getting 800. It clearly has to do with, they don't know the reasons cause this is a new study, but you can imagine it might be the people offering the money. Don't even realize they're offering more to the guy because he's a guy. But then the guy knows to bargain, to negotiate. Right. Well I want even more than that. Whereas the woman's getting lower and going, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Right. So there's still much work to be done. Um, the fourth part of the book is sort of an epilogue in that, um, after the piece came out in the times, I just, I got thousands of emails and heard from all sorts of people, mostly people who agreed about the encouragement, the confidence factor in.

Speaker 2:          00:17:27       And I heard more so I focused the book more on say physics, but I heard a lot from people in tech and finance and the issue seemed to be very similar. Um, I heard from women who would say, I'd be in a room and I'd get an idea, um, you know, or I know how to solve the problem, but I didn't have the confidence to just say it right out and somebody else says it first. And then I kicked myself. So that, that kind of thing in the implicit bias. Um, and then of course the issues for childcare and, um, how much of the house work you're doing and all the, you know, benefits for policies for I'm taking time off if you're having a kid or, or other family problems. So that's, that's the final part of the book. Um, so again, rather than read from the book and because I'm hoping that maybe you'll take a copy, I thought I'd reach you a piece that I just wrote the times, um, wanted me to write an op Ed piece that sort of is a, uh, a new angle on this.

Speaker 2:          00:18:25       And so this piece is, um, focus more on computer science and, uh, somebody else's research that just came out. And I don't know that I'm right. And so afterward, I would love to hear your responses and if it doesn't jive with your experience or it doesn't sound right, let me know. Okay. The largest high tech companies such as Google, have finally begun to devote serious resources to attracting and promoting women in minorities. Unfortunately, if young women and students of color continue to shy away from classes in computer science and engineering, these firms will compete for the same limited pool of employees who aren't white or male. Figuring out why people who choose not to do something choose not to do it. It's like trying to interview the l to live inside your refrigerator, but only come out when the light is off. Women already working at a company might tell you what makes them unhappy, but these complaints won't necessarily pinpoint the factors that frightened girls away from studying computer science in the first place.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       As one of the few women who's lived in both worlds, I earned a bachelor of science and physics from meal in 1978 but have lived the past 35 years as a writer, an English professor. I've long been interested in why women like me, who loves science and math switched to other fields and so many other women flee in horror at the site of the simplest equation that young women who love science and math grow tired of being teased about their interests seems easy to understand. Rather than receive encouragement, they face discouragement. They may dislike working in a competitive aggressive culture that demands they give up any outside interests that might keep them healthy and sane. They face very real difficulties trying to raise young children, walk, carrying out research that might earn them tenure when might strike people as less plausible is that many young women avoid studying computer science or engineering simply because they fear they won't fit in with the students who do take such classes.

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       For the past six years, SAP Cherian, who's a psychology professor at the University of Washington, has been studying white girls in high school are significantly less likely than boys to sign up for class in computer science, take the AP exam in that subject or express interest in computer science as a career. And why? Female college students or four times less likely than men to major in computer science or engineering, even though they test extremely well in math. What Sherry is research reveals is that many girls just don't think they would feel comfortable in such a class. This shouldn't be too surprising when most of us are deciding whether to move to a new town, join a club, or take up a hobby. We are as perceptive as Sherlock Holmes and picking up clues as to whether we might belong over and over. Cherry and her colleagues have found that female students are significantly more interested in enrolling in a computer class if they are shown a classroom, whether virtual or real.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       So if it's for an online class, right, the classroom, you can make it look like anything. Um, it's decorated not with star wars posters, science fiction books, computer parts, tech magazines and boxes for video games and software. But rather with art and nature posters, water bottles, coffee makers, lamps, plants, pens and general interest magazines. So one is sort of this stereotype of what you know, computer science room is going to look like in the other incident meant to be feminine or masculine. It's more neutral. Interestingly, the willingness of most male students tend to not to change significantly whether they're shown a room decorated in a stereotypical manner or a room with a more neutral decor while about a quarter of the women reported being drawn to the more stereotypical setting. Okay. So there's some women who are like, great, I like Star Wars. Here I am. Um, the importance of what Sharon calls an ambient sense of belonging proves equally strong with female college students considering a job in an office that does not conform to their image of what a computer company might look like.

Speaker 2:          00:22:39       Sherry and in her colleagues also found that cultural stereotypes about computer scientist strongly influenced young women's desire to take classes in the field. At a young age. Girls are ready hold stereotypes of computer scientists and we know this doesn't apply to anybody. We actually know as Pale, awkward young men who were socially isolated, obsessively devoted to playing video games and intensely focused on machinery and whose genius is inborn rather than the result of study and hard work. Given that such stereotypes run counter to the indoctrination, most girls still receive that they should be feminine, whatever that means. Interested in working with other people and modest about their abilities as well as many girls beliefs that they are not in neatly gifted at science or math. It's no surprise that they cannot see themselves as happy successful computer scientists. In another experiment Cherian and her colleagues arrange for female undergraduates to talk to an actor pretending to be a computer science major.

Speaker 2:          00:23:41       If the actor wore a t shirt that said, I code therefore I am and claim to enjoy video games. The female students express less interest in studying computer science and less confidence in succeeding in such a class. Then if the actor war, solid tee shirt and claim to enjoy hanging out with friends, even if the actor was another woman, such stereotypes might seem laughably outdated and yet studies show that the basic stereotype of a scientist the most people have hasn't changed since they first started testing for it in the 1950s and these stereotypes do still have some basis in reality. In some ways, young women today might have an even harder time imagining themselves as physicists, engineers, or computer scientists than when I was a physics student in the mid seventies back then, women were still rebelling against the norms of the 1950s most of us wouldn't have been caught dead pretending to be princesses, even when we were little girls or wearing high heels and fancy dresses.

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       As adults, we issued manicures, makeup and hair salons, fancy weddings. The required a year of planning were anathema and we weren't about to devote every minute to hovering over our children the way or stay at home. Mothers hovered over us. I'm not making a value judgment about women should wear or shouldn't wear or how much time they should or shouldn't devote to their weddings so their families. But young women today clearly face more pressure to dress in a feminine, sexy manner than they did when I was young. Which means that the gap between the way women see themselves, this most women and the way they see scientists has only grown wider in the past few decades. Not to mention that the messages young women continue to receive from their teachers, parents and classmates convinced them this gap is real. For instance, one girl I know was recently told by her high school teacher that she was too pretty to be good at math and research demonstrates that female undergraduates who have watched commercials in which women focus excessively on their appearance demonstrate less interested in careers in high tech than students who haven't viewed such commercials.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       Cherian and postulates is similar theory to explain why the percentage of women studying computer science has fallen since the mid 1980s citing evidence that high school students get their ideas about scientists from popular culture in the media. She wonders if there might be a causal link between the decline in women to interest in computer science and the rise of movies and TV shows such as revenge of the nerds and the Big Bang theory which portrays scientists and engineers is white or Asian male geeks. The media intense focus on the startup culture and geniuses such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates might also have inspired more young men than women tend to the field. That's, that's her theory. Even though very few jobs are located in startup companies and very few computer scientists, Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, again present company excluded some people scarf that if young women are going to let such nebulous factors deter them from careers in physics or computer science, while the women are simply exercising their own free choice and if girls were tough enough, such exaggerated stereotypes and feelings of discomfort wouldn't discourage them.

Speaker 2:          00:27:05       Yet the stereotypes are still pervasive. Just yesterday. Well, yesterday from when I wrote this, I was standing in line at my corner pharmacy in New York when I realized that the covers of the magazines I had been staring at for 10 minutes showed a god like portrait of Steve Jobs. It was the subject of a recent movie at the top beneath him, a big busted model in her underwear. Then a heroic, clear eyed portrait of Mark Zuckerberg and then at the very bottom, another scantily clad female model. All of us are bombarded by such images. How can we not absorb the lesson that computer geniuses, they're men. While the chief goal of a woman's life should be to look fabulous in her underwear. I wonder how many young men would choose to major in computer science if they suspect that they might need to carry out their coding while sitting in a pink cubicle decorated with posters of sex in the city and film in Luis and copies of vogue and cosmo scattered around the lunchroom.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       In fact, Sherry hands research shows that young men tend not to matron English for the same reasons. Most women don't major in computer science. They compare their notions of who they are to their stereotypes of English majors and decide they won't fit in. All of this meshes with my own experience, even though I felt more comfortable in a tee shirt and jeans and address or a stylish shoe. Sue, after four years of majoring in physics at Yale, I experienced so much pressure to dress and act like a man that I began to feel extremely uncomfortable about my identity as a woman working as an intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee or attending a conference on theoretical physics in Austin, Texas. I felt out of place among my mostly male colleagues because I hated drinking beer or eating barbecue and didn't like getting teased about reading novels.

Speaker 2:          00:28:58       I've heard similar stories from countless women, even the female students at Olin College of engineering right here in Massachusetts complaining to me about feeling out of place among male classmates who were always engaging in pissing contests or burping the periodic table. Those were their words or male coworkers at summer jobs who continually cursed and made vulgar jokes. The good news is that women's stereotypes of scientists can be surprisingly malleable. In one experiment, young women who read a fake article claiming that many computer scientists no longer fit the geeky stereotype demonstrated, is significantly greater interested in computer science than their counterparts who read a fake article saying that the stereotype remains true to make computer science more attractive to women. We might try to change how women think about themselves, but we might also diversify the images of scientists the women see in the media, along with the decor of classrooms in which they might want to work to study your work.

Speaker 2:          00:30:03       This would be especially easy to do in the case of virtual classrooms for online courses, and the office is in which they all they might apply to work in this way, we could retain the men and women who are drawn to the current images and environment while attracting women and men who might previously have shied away because they felt they wouldn't fit in after all. High Tech Company isn't like the army where the stereotype of a warrior is inextricably linked to the actual requirements of the job. Uh, stylishly dressed woman in a cheerful room with a beautiful painting on the wall is just as likely to write a brilliant line of code as a man in an I code. Therefore I m t shirt sitting in a dingy cubicle decorated with a star wars poster and littered with Soda Cans and pizza boxes. Even small changes might make a big difference.

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       A thoughtful male computer professor once wrote me to suggest that changing the name of the major from computer engineering to computer arts or computer arts and sciences would double the number of female students overnight. Of course, Lauren Young women into a field by showing them images of offices that don't exist and letting them read fake articles, the complainant's claim computer scientists or more suave and socially adept than they really are, might be unfair. But as Sherry and points out this stereotypes or at best only partially true, and women who actually take classes in computer science don't hold the same negative views as women who get their ideas from movies and TV shows. Besides if companies do succeed in attracting more women and minorities, this stereotypes will change as well. Presumably the grubby decor. Of course, as I'm reading this to you, I realize that this is the least grubby decor that I have ever seen in my life.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       So then that part clearly doesn't apply to you guys. This is why Mayor Bill de Blasio, his recent announcement that within 10 years all of New York City's public schools must offer at least some training in computer science to all students is so important as Cherian herself suggest requiring all students to take computer science. Not only would change the stereotype as to who does your doesn't take such classes, it would provide girls and students of color with the opportunity to experience the material and decide for themselves if they like the work at the college level. Some fairly simple changes could allay the anxieties of female and minority students at Harvey Mudd College at college strategies such as renaming courses. So they took introduction to programming in Java and renamed it creative approaches to problem solving in science and engineering using python. Well, I don't know that that, that's a direct, but you can see the difference in the kind of name it is creating separate introductory class just for students with zero programming experience and students who already know how to code discouraging show off behavior, exposing students to non Geeky computer scientists and allowing them to work on projects that fit their preferences, lead to an increase in the percentage of computer science majors who were female from 10 to 40% in only four years.

Speaker 2:          00:33:20       So just making these like ridiculous kind of sounding changes. They went from 10% of 40% female computer science majors in four years as an added benefit. [inaudible] research on the effects of stereotypes and what she calls an ambient sense of belonging and career choices might have important lessons to teach us about how we might persuade more young men to enter fields they traditionally avoid such as nursing education, early childcare and yes, even English and creative writing. So, um, so that's, that's the piece I'm working on now and I would just be happy to take questions or hearing your disagreements, your viewpoint. You are the ones working in the field. So, um, I would just love, love to take questions or hear what you think and if you have a question, if you could go to one of the Mikes, that would be great.

Speaker 4:          00:34:15       Yes. Um, so one thing I heard like as a refrain throughout that is that if we hide away geekiness thing, we'll attract a more diverse culture. And the problem with that is that like geeks exist and many geeks in nerdy people and weird people throughout high school experience extreme Austria Austria's is right for sure. And um, like kind of retreat into hyper intelligent, you know, kind of approaches. I think I, I don't think this is an accident. I don't think this is just an arbitrary thing that happens for no reason at all. Um, those people feel very, very invested in tech culture and they feel that they are being attacked by the bullies that bullied them in high school. Right now we're all supposed to grow up and become adults and realize it's more complicated than that. I'm not justifying their position. Right. But I mean this is a very real conflict, right? Totally metastasis. I think it needs to be addressed respectfully and with, with an understanding. So my question to you is to answer those concerns. I think

Speaker 2:          00:35:28       what, what, what was, um, in the piece that I read was that we need to be open to more. Okay. So we're not changing or denigrating what is there. We're opening to more possibilities. Okay. So what it was saying is that there are uh, people who, who were nerdy, Geeky, whether by choice or that's just who they are or they they want to do it. And um, we want to keep those people and respect them. So it said 25% of the women who were surveyed actually were drawn. They, they were drawn to the classroom that had the star wars posters. Okay. And so I was very careful to say, and Sheridan is very careful to say we want to keep that right and respect those people. So it's not taking the people who were bullying the Geeky kids or the women who feel that they can't show their inner, you know, math and science self.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       Cause then they get bullied or teased or nobody last them out, right? It's trying to have both groups now want to be free to take whatever kind of court, not to be ruled by stereotypes and bullying. All right? So there's this anti intellectual culture that affects young men and women who are ha let their inner geek and nerd out. Right? And they get disrespected. But then there are these girls who, and probably some young men who would like to be doing that, right? But they're scared off because they've been socialized by these images to say, that's not me. Or to fear that if they're like that no one will like them or date them or you know, be nice to them. We want both of those groups. And, and that was what I was kept trying to say is that we want to make the images more diverse to show more possibilities so that anybody, so we'll, we'll draw in.

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       People will keep who we have now and respect them and draw in people who are being scared off by the bullying and by saying, but I'm different from um, the kids who at least have each other in the robotics club or the computer science lab, but I'm not like them. And they think that's the only way to be. So even though if you're in that room, you feel like you're being bullied or disrespected. There's this other group that's looking and saying, at least you have an identity and you're doing this thing where it's, I don't fit in with you and I don't fit in with them. Right. So it's how do you get more, first of all, how do you get rid of the awful stereotypes from the movies and the TV shows that are really not doing anybody any good. And how do you say that?

Speaker 2:          00:38:04       There's room for many different kinds of people that are currently in tech and the way, so de Blasio saying everybody has to take computer science. At least you didn't get everybody in the room. And there's no more sense of only those kids do it. Or you'll be stigmatized if you do it. And if you do it, it's because you have to take the class and then you discover you love it. Right. So in a way to one way to literally get everybody doing it and lessen the stigma is to require everybody to do it. The other way is to have more in it, to be for all of us to be much more alive to the stereotypes, the images, the decor, and who, who was being attracted by it and who's being turned off by it and why. And to realize that even though it sounds like small stuff, it's very powerful stuff. So yeah, I totally agree with you and, but there were lines, there definitely were lines in here that we're saying that we want to keep, you know, and that there are women and men that are attracted to this. They're great. We want to keep them, they should be happy, but that there are other people that they're actually being kept away by thinking that's the only way you have to be. Yeah. Hi.

Speaker 5:          00:39:13       Um, Lord Mitson a two fuels I can think of where there's been an increasing number of women that uh, certainly not equal yet, but much better. And they both seem to be Philly geeky fields in the St math or computer sciences. Have you, do you have an opinion on whether we can learn any lessons from those fields and transfer them across to sciences in general?

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       Which fields, um, are, are we, are you talking about the law and Benson? Okay. Yeah. Great. So yeah, I do. So I'm especially in medicine. Um, what happened in medicine is really interesting. They, the big stumbling block, there used to be medical school training, right? Um, well first of all there were rules and women couldn't be doctors. They wouldn't let him into med school. But once they got past that, there were women who wanted to be doctors, but the training system was a grueling hazing system where you had to be on call for like four days straight and you couldn't go home. And it, it was incompatible with human life. Right. And especially if you, if there were children at home, you couldn't just disappear for four days. Right. So only men who had a wife at home who had stayed with the kids could do it, but it wasn't even good for the men.

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       And it wasn't good for the patients because a doctor who's been up for four days straight off and screw something up. Um, so long about the time my ex husband was in medical school, we met him through medical school, but we made it through phd. We didn't make it prepares much past that. It was just because these issues are so hard. Right? So he was never home. So there was a movement to change that. And it was partly because women were entering the field and it was keeping them out. And partly because the men were finally admitting that it was destroying their lives too. So there was a move to humanize medical school training so that you didn't have to like give up your marriage, your kids, your whole life to do it. And that was a reason that more women could go into the field.

Speaker 2:          00:41:13       They picked certain areas that seem more girl friendly, like being a pediatrician, but you know, it's spreading now even to some of the heart, more hardcore specialties. The reason that's relevant is because I think phd training is still a hazing like that. It's still much more like medical school, the old days where the idea is if you're not sick, you know, if you're not willing to be in the lab 24, seven and give up every other interest and you know, forget about your spouse and any responsibilities to any other human being, you're not serious. You won't be taken seriously and you don't belong. And so we still lose a lot of women. Um, so it's just Grad school's miserable for guys too, but they tend to be more socialized to tough it out. They have to have a career. People don't let them just drop out as quickly and easily.

Speaker 2:          00:42:05       Um, so that hazing, um, period in a profession tends to be a, um, a block. And if you can get rid of that. Um, so I think in terms of fields that where you need a phd, that that's the, if you can do for the phd program, which is humanize it, the way medical school training was humanized and convince people it's not going to lower standards that, you know, if you're trying to run a program or a blog after you'd been up for four days, you're going to screw it up the way you would have killed your patient. Now for tech, I think it's more like what Anne Marie slaughter was saying in her article, which is just that if, if being in the profession, like that article about, I was at Amazon where you just have to, like, you're treated like crap and have to work 900 hours a week and you know that those, that idea of what is needed to be good at your field, I think is still something we, you know, if that, if that applied to all fields, if you can have things more humane, right.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       And that's not the standard. The other part of it is the stereotypes, right? So there's still this very American idea that somehow girl, you know, girl femininity does not equate with math, computer tech, right? These, the stereotypes that girls who picked up by second grade. And one thing I was really interested to discover in researching this book is that's not true in other every other culture. There are a lot of cultures where women don't have certain other rights, but it's inconceivable to the men in those cultures. The women wouldn't be as good at science, math, computer programming, whatever, coding, right? Which if you're American, you go, wait, no, you know, we, that's such a basic stereotype for us and yet in other cultures is maybe the woman needs her husband's permission to go to a tech conference because they're going to be other men there.

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       But he doesn't think, but no one thinks there are cultures that think women are better at math because women are more creative than men. Right. And that whole business about how, you know, women used to be the software people until, because it was seen as just the secretarial work until the guys decided that was the cool part. And then they kicked him out. So just these being alive to sort of the hazing aspect, the part that makes it in human, but also the, the way the stereotypes are just, I think they're more pervasive today than they were when I were young was young. There's even more on women being really traditionally girly, feminine spending all their time, you know, on planning weddings and stuff. And that's just not, and then they get a stereotyped idea of what tech is like and the two just don't Mesh. So it's being really, really alive to the stereotypes that are so different. Yeah. You were next.

Speaker 6:          00:44:53       So, um, I don't know if you've seen, uh, there's a, there's a woman online who known as the key cast. She was doing Linux colonel programming and she's just decided that she's going to step out because she's done with the hazing. Um, she's done with the combative attitude of, of having to take a lot of crap, which of course speaks to what you were just saying, but what you're, what you're addressing is what I think we at Google tend to refer to as the pipeline issue where women aren't coming in, but there's also a substantial issue where a lot of women once they're in and have been here for a while will then drop out. Right. I know that that's something that we've seen with the numbers inside of Google. Right. I don't know if I'm allowed to actually say what those numbers are, but certainly the higher up the levels you go, the fewer women there are. Um, do you have any ideas on how to address the lack of role models as given that there are a few women to act as role models for women who are joining the field? It's much harder to then stick around because you don't have a model on which to base your, what your

Speaker 2:          00:45:54       for. Sure. Um, well first of all it's, you know, I focused in the book much more on sort of the pipeline issues because I, my whole question was why didn't I go on? Right. And if I had gone on and I, you know, spent 10 years working for a tech company, I would have felt more secure focusing on that. I should say that I did do pro, you know, I taught myself four Tran when I was an Undergrad and did a program for a professor of scattering program. We didn't have, there were no pcs, there were no screens. So you had to do, everything came out printed on paper and you had a flip. It was like a flip book to make the simulation work. And then I worked at Oak Ridge programming a simulation there and you know, I mean, so I have some sense of this, the sexism there was just unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:46:38       It, I think that was the worst I've ever experienced. There were stuff called job control language. So you'd needed certain codes to even get time on the computers and that it was run by guys and mirrored sunglasses who literally would make the women say, say, or do something sexy and suggestive so that they could find out that they as JCL language, you know, so I'm going to have some idea of it, but it's not, I can't, I feel like you guys are the experts that said, I've talked to a lot of women and I think there's it. What's really insidious instead, it's so many relatively small, uh, obstacles, insults, you know, just the hardships that no one of which is enough to make you just go, that's it. That's the way a straw. But they accumulate, right? And in some ways, so, so a lot of what happens is somebody finally can't take it and says, I'm just going to stay home and raise the kids, or I'm going to do something different.

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       And then people say, use that to justify that women are no good or that they actually prefer something else. So the fact that I eventually became a writer caused people to write to me and say, we'll see you prefer to people field. And I'm like, no, it was made so miserable for me. But it's gradual. So the analogy I sometimes use is if you were at the gym and you're on a tread master and there's a guy on the next one, right? And you both think that the, um, inclined, the resistance is the same, but what you don't know is yours to set higher, right? And she, you're both going right and then you speed it up and like you're sweating and huffing and puffing and he's not so much and you think what's wrong with me, right? That it's harder for me. And he's looking over and going, why is she sweating and huffing and puffing?

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       We're both on the same treadmill. And then you give each person one of those balls at the gym that look the same, but one is much heavier and you don't know yours is heavier, right? Cause I don't know this data that you're not sharing, like right, if everybody doesn't know the data, that's childcare. That's parent care, that's house care, right? And at some point you're just like, not only am I exhausted, but he's not, so I must not be as good at this. This isn't worth it. I'll go, just go take a yoga class and see women look just like yoga classes, right? Show, talking, right? Registering what's going on. So the more that you can be aware of what's going into the fact that it seems harder, like to articulate that, to bring it out, to make as much public as you can, to be aware of it, and to know what you're at least experiencing and fighting that he got $890,000 to set up his lab.

Speaker 2:          00:49:15       And I showed the women at Mit in the late nineties to whom this first occurred. Like, why are we so much more tired than the guys? Nobody wanted to share the data. They forced the issue. Let's see, salaries, they were on their hands and knees measuring, um, lab space, right? So whatever it is that you can articulate, can, I think that that's actually even more important than literally having a role model. Right? There were a lot of guys who are very sympathetic. I'm sure many of them are in this room, right? Having a sympathetic male supervisor or a role model can be just as powerful. And unfortunately sometimes it's so hard for a woman to get to a certain point that by the time she gets there, she sort of like, I did it, I did it my way. And it can be harder to have her as a role model than a guy you because you stuck out so much to defend.

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       Um, so I sometimes hear from women who disagree with everything in my book and say none of this is true because it didn't apply to them. And I'm saying, right, that's why you're the only woman where you are and it's great. I loved what you did. But they are denying that their reality, they're saying their realities the same for everybody. So it's also like not depending, not taking your role model as maybe the obvious choice. Right. Sometimes my greatest role model is as a writer, it was an African American male writer who was just brilliant and said everything I needed to hear and he was my role model, right? Worse. There were some women writers, older women writers who were, I don't know where did, they were trying to toughen me up or they forgot that their age at my age, they weren't so tough either or that they needed encouragement when they were young.

Speaker 2:          00:51:02       So sometimes you just have to pick different role models or say, oh, I can do it on my own because I'm not on my own bit bit. But with other women at the same level, and some men bring in men, male allies, just trying to articulate some of those hidden stressors and differences and see if you can work on those rather than just let it all accumulate the way I did and walk away from it. Right. And then be my age and regret that you let people, not that it's your weakness or your fault, but if I had known what I was coping with, I don't know that I would've walked away. Okay. Here's another question. We have time for it. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:51:44       Hi. Um, so here I am. I made it. I did finish my phd. Uh, and um, I am just really fortunate. I went to an all girl high school, which set me up in college to not even, I really did not notice that I was in a room full of men. I have a very funny story that I will spare you. Um, and then I was fortunate to find a female professor who thought highly of me and went out of her way to mentor, not just me but other female scientist. She was my phd advisor and I mean my, my research group at my university, we had parody because the two professors in charge of our group went out of their way. But I also have friends who are software engineers, women who are software engineers at other companies and they, they really do not have a good time and these other companies. So I was kind of scared. I said, Oh, thank God I'm going to Google where they have these things like unconscious bias training and they care about this. Um, so I guess the question is like, if we are here and we made it, what do we do to help? I'm not willing, I mean I'm not going to go and be a teaching high school cause that's not my temperament, but what, what can I realistically do to help the women behind me?

Speaker 2:          00:52:51       All that's great. And I'm so, and I have to say that, um, although I don't have it as study, I don't think studies have been done to back this up after just six months doing the research on that book. I felt like I could tell if a woman had gone to an all girl high school or if I'm an African American student, had gone to a historically black college because there was something about that experience of, especially if in junior high and high school, um, you're, you're saying that a single sex institution, it's almost like you get inoculated against the stuff that really was so hard for me. The, the encouragement, lacking the confidence. I don't know how it weighs out against whether there are disadvantages of it, but even later when women say then they're in the room with men, they just don't seem to experience the same psychological, um, hindrances.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       Um, and I think that's really important. So with that Harvey Mudd College, what they're doing now, that first course separating people out so that there's a room for it tends to be mostly women, but some guys too who have had no experience, right? So they are not kind of intimidated away by the mostly guys who feel really good about their skills and are all too ready to show, you know, so that, that keeping things separate at least long enough that people get their legs under them I think is important. So if you're working at the college level, that's one way. So you're not really separating by gender accepted ends up being gender influenced with the experience. I think really, um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:24       the work to do is trying to, if there are things that work here, trying to get other industries to adopt, like what are the best practices? Can you publish? Can you write op ed pieces? I'm the one, they're asking the right, the op Ed pieces. If you were writing it, you'd know even more what to say. Right. And then people read it and it spreads to other companies. And to work on these images, like, you know, if you're watching a show or movie and the imagery of who is or isn't a computer scientist or what it's like to work in the field, you know, you can exert, get people to exert pressure on Facebook or wherever on whoever made the movie or selling the product. Um, so yeah, I think there are are things to do, um, get support groups going, um, go into other companies to be a role model or a mentor. Um, but yeah, I think that, um, the, especially what you were talking about with the single sex institutions, it's very, um, it's very powerful.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       Any other questions? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:55:33       All right. Uh, so you talked a lot about how the images of who computer scientists and programmers are influences people's perceptions, but has there been any study about what computer science is used for? So sort of the popular conception of Silicon Valley, you know, disrupting industries and sort of, it's tends to be very aggressive language. And does that turn off people who just don't see what programming could be used for that sort of constructive or creative or artistic?

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       Yeah, very much so. And, and Sharon works on that and some other people have too. So she, there two levels of that to their, the, the students who are just maybe thinking of going into the field and taking up first class are thinking about maybe do I want to major in that then that is extremely important. Like, well what would I use this for? And basically people have no idea what you do with coding, which seems, I know if you actually do it, you know, it's everything you right. But you don't get that if you don't know what it is. Right. And so, um, one of the things Harvey Mudd lets students do is pick their own projects, right? So that would make it easy for you. I mean, you're given some guidance, but you can pick the thing that seems important for you to work on.

Speaker 2:          00:56:53       You know, there's some notion that young women want to work on people fields or things that'll benefit humanity. I, I've never really seen a study that proves that to my satisfaction. And I always wonder where that notion comes from. I think it gets drummed into your head if you're a girl that you should want to work on. Some people feel that's good for humanity because I remember people saying it to me, like I'd say I want to be a physicist. And I remember my social studies teacher saying, no, you should want to work on a people field. So like, where does it really come from? Um, but that's a lot of the work that's being done with like girls coding clubs, robotics, clubs like that. A lot of work is actually being done. It's never enough, but they're trying to work with like seventh and eighth grade girls in clubs.

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       Like what would you use coding for? And this is something that's enjoyable to you and it's not like to blow people's heads up or, you know, on a video game or something. Um, and then there's the level at which once you're in start to be in the culture, the aggression and the competitiveness. That's more the hazing stuff that I was talking about before the culture. And again, a big part of what I'm trying to do, especially in physics, but it's the exact same thing here is changed that culture because I just don't think it's healthy for anybody. And I think there are a lot of guys who don't like it and get caught up in it because it's the way they think they have to be. Um, the other woman, so I was one of two women who graduate. We were the first graduates with a physics degree.

Speaker 2:          00:58:32       The other woman became just a whiz programmer. I mean she's just brilliant and she's, well she started at bell labs, worked at all these other places and she's been kind of edged out. She's currently unemployed and she's utterly brilliant. But the competitive, sexist, ageist stuff, just, she got edged out. So it's working on that culture. When you see it calling it like, why did you have to talk to the person that way? Or like if somebody presents something, do you have to jump on them first? Could you maybe say like what was good about what they did before you make suggestions? That's, that's the difference. Um, one last thing is, um, one thing that struck me, so was trying to recruit more minority employees and they had one African American engineer was pretty high up and he went, I don't know if it was his alma mater, he just decided to go to, I think it was Howard University.

Speaker 2:          00:59:38       And he said, how many of you would be, how many of you use Dropbox? And like a lot of them raise your hands because like we, a lot of us use Dropbox. You said, Whoa, once you like to come work for the company that makes this happen. And they're like, yeah, we really would. Would you like us to come? Nobody's ever recruited anybody here and we'd love to do this. Part of it was they didn't know, Oh yeah, I use this thing. It would be fun to create stuff like this. So that's part of it. Knowing what, what you do with it, but also thinking you're wanted because you look at the, you know, the room or the movie or the whatever, and there's nobody who looks like you there and nobody's coming to your school to recruit. So yeah, all of the above. What do you had to do with this? And I think what happens is once you're in the field, it's so obvious to you that to get that back down to the level of like an eighth grade girl or an eighth grade boy, or who are, you know, or an African American kid, you know, why is it not obvious to them? Where was it that you picked up the ideas and how are these people either being welcomed or scared away? Um, that's, that's sort of where it, where it is.

Speaker 2:          01:00:54       Okay. I think that I'm being signaled that we have our time up, so I will, I will stick around as long as you'd like me to see if anybody wants the book. But thanks so much for inviting me. I really am glad I got to meet you guys.
