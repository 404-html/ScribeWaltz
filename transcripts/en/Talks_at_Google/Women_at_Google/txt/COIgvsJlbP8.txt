Speaker 1:          00:08          So I'm really excited to have Lauren leadership, a and Alicia Reiner here to talk to us today about diversity and diversity in all aspects of media and industry. And, um, this is exciting for me because Lauren used to be my boss and my old job before Google. I know we don't talk about life before Google, but I did have a job before that and um, she was my boss and so it's super exciting to have her here to talk about this book. Um, which has been something that has been in discussion for a while. Um, so with that I'm going to welcome Lauren leadership. Ayub thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Hi everyone. Thank you so much for being here and hi to everyone and other Google authorize, uh, outside of New York. I do really appreciate that you're here and uh, it feels like a particularly important time to be having this conversation. Um, I started working on the book crossing the finish line well over a year ago and when I started writing I did have some sense that with the election, uh, we might have a somewhat contentious election cycle. You could sort of sense that there was a stop brewing in the contrary, but I had no idea that we would be where we are. Um, I can't say that it's the happiest place. Uh, it's been incredibly painful to watch. I think it's been incredibly painful for a lot of Americans to watch in the middle of this whole cycle as things were beginning to, uh, ratchet up in terms of the noise in the country, um, about the election.

Speaker 1:          01:46          But then also, uh, the emergence of the black lives matter movement over the last few years. The sort of continuing a intensity around complex around race and gender and the sort of breakdown in a way or the national conversation, I thought down to try to write a blog about how we can do better. And I will say that having a book like that come out right now is actually really challenging because it's not what people want to talk about. And when you turn on the news, and I'm sure if you had any channel on last night, uh, you saw the kind of, um, intensity and conflict that is just dominating every minute of the new cycle. And there's been very little conversation about the role that we all can play in doing better. So I'm going to backup for a second and just give you a little bit about me and about why I wrote this book.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Um, because I do think it's important, especially because I am the, you know, white privileged woman that I am standing up here to talk to a very diverse set of Google employees and out there in the world and talking to a very diverse country about this topic. And so I do think, and I felt in writing the book that I needed to stay a little bit about who I am and how I got here. Um, so I, up in Washington DC and Washington DC, uh, has always been and remains one of the most diverse cities in the nation. In the 1980s when I was growing up, it was over 90% African American. Uh, and my experience of that childhood was, I'm realizing now, and I've come to realize pretty unique because most Americans don't grow up in communities that are anywhere near as diverse as the one that I grew up in now.

Speaker 1:          03:23          My immediate neighborhood, the block where my house was, um, we're actually almost entirely white. And Washington is actually segregated in these very strange ways. It's segregated by race, but it's also even segregated by political party. We didn't have any Republicans on our block. I mean, it was like, it was like all peace corps x Peace Corps volunteers, right? Like, so, you know, not the most diverse neighborhood, but the city itself is so diverse that all my schools, we're incredibly diverse. I always had 30 to 40% of my classmates, you know, from kindergarten all the way through high school. And I write a lot about high school in the book where at least, you know, 30 to 40% diverse in some way because the city is also the home of all of the embassies for the United States. And so there are families from every corner of the world.

Speaker 1:          04:05          You know, in kindergarten I probably had nine different nationalities represented and that left a big impact on me. And I also had a lot of African American friends as a child. The thing that I came to learn though, and I really was, I think like many kids, you know, not especially conscious of the things that divided us as a child, but I was very lucky because two things happen. One is that in about the seventh grade, and I write a lot about in this inbox, in the seventh grade, I had this really painful personal experience, which is that I was the, and this is like a very seventh grade thing to put in context because you know, we're all a little emotional and a little awkward and sensitive in the seventh grade. But in seventh grade, I went to this very exclusive girls' school in suburban outside of DC and suburban Potomac, Maryland, which was, you know, very conservative in entirely wait, by the way it stayed in the school.

Speaker 1:          04:57          And the two years, partially because of this, and in the seventh grade, someone in my class had a birthday party and I was the only one in the class not invited. And it turns out that the reason that I wasn't invited because the party was being held at the Chevy Chase country club, which in 1988 did not have a single, uh, minority or Jewish member because we were Jewish. I was not invited. My mom, when she explained to me why, uh, why I hadn't been invited, used it as a sort of opportunity to recount to me, you know, all of the discrimination that American Jews had faced. And it turns out that my own grandfather had changed his name, uh, in the 1950s from Goldberg to Gilbert, because in most of America, he couldn't get a hotel room with the last name Goldberg. It's a piece of American history that most of us don't even think about anymore. But it was true.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Was it the biggest, most transformational personal experience in my life? Of course not. Does it compare in any way to the kind of exclusion and challenges that visible minorities in this country? Faith, of course not. But something happened for me at that point in my life, which is that I was humiliated and angry and hurt and I could not stand the injustice of it. It made me crazy. So to fast forward, I was lucky enough to go. I left, I got out of that school as soon as I could and I went to a school in Washington called Georgetown Day school, which was actually built to be the first integrated school in Washington. It was established in the 1940s at the time when DC was a highly segregated city. Uh, which many people don't know the history of Washington and how segregated it really was. But it was, uh, you know, in many ways a sort of microcosm of the bias that was happening in the nation.

Speaker 1:          06:40          But GDS was set up as this place for, uh, for, um, you know, for diverse communities in Washington to get educated. And so when I got there, it also turned out to be a place where people talked about race and different all the time. And the school did something really amazing, which is that in my freshman year, when a bunch of African American senior girls were feeling angry and, uh, like second class citizens in the school because they felt they were not being treated fairly by some of the white students, the school, to their credit, they suspended classes for three days in my freshman year of high school and brought in one Williams who had not long before written the book eyes on the prize to facilitate a summit on race for a bunch of high school kids with life altering. But the thing about that and the reason why I tell that story is that part of what made me, um, have made me able to relate to and understand or at least try to understand the pain that these amazing African American girls who were seniors at the time who I worshiped and thought were like the coolest girls in the whole world.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Part of why I cried for them, it was because I had had some experience of being an outsider, that that experience of having been excluded for something I couldn't control, right. That I was Jewish helped me understand something different about them. So fast forward because I actually happened to thank, first of all, I've come to realize how lucky I am that I had any of those experiences because it has created. Um, and, and I am in no way less bias than anyone else in this country. I am in no way. Uh, I don't understand it in any greater detail than anybody else, but it has made me want to try and it made me commit a big part of my career to trying to create the context and the environment. And the opportunities for us all to do better. And that's what I committed to.

Speaker 1:          08:36          And writing this book, could we find a way to do better? Well, one thing that I think is fundamental to that, and you can look at what's happened, uh, you know, the, what's happened in North Carolina and Oklahoma or any of the other places around the country now where there are now, you know, these sort of endless stream of hashtags that kind of in a couple of letters try to the pain and the complexity of what's happening in the country right now. We need desperately for more Americans. And I absolutely believe that we especially need more white Americans to have a deeper appreciation for empathy, for and understanding of the experiences that a non majority, although that even that is changing. So we'll talk about that in a minute. But the way how all Americans or experience or in our country, if we cannot get to a deeper level of empathy and understanding, we are doomed to continue to repeat these same cycles over and over again.

Speaker 1:          09:36          I, um, do a lot of media and I've been spending a lot of time on Fox News. Uh, I've become the like sort of progressive punching bag on Fox News. They love having me as often as all come that they so they can scream and yell at me. Uh, but I was invited to speak, um, after one of the major incidents a few months ago. I can't remember Dallas after Dallas had been so many this year I lose track. But after the Dallas shooting, I was invited on Meghan Kelly's show to do, uh, be part of this discussion on race. And I was kind of optimistic about it because I thought, all right, you know, they're doing it. It's going to be nationally televised. Um, that's promising. And I get to the green room and it's actually a very diverse room and I'm kinda like, well done Fox News. I'm impressed with who you pulled into this room to have this conversation.

Speaker 1:          10:19          And we go in and we sit down in the chairs and they, before the cameras come on and the producer says, we really need a thoughtful and meaningful conversation about this. This is the time where the country is in crisis. Uh, we want all of you to bring your best. Please don't scream. People will change the channel. It's not good for ratings, but it's also not good for this conversation. So I'm feeling great. I'm like, yeah, we're going to have meaningful conversation. Yay. Fox News. I'm sure you can guess that it didn't quite go that way. So it opened with a one guest who started with the following. Black lives matter is more racist than the KKK. That was the opener. So you can imagine where it went from there. Uh, by the way, that it was an African American person who said that. So I'm not really sure what they found it.

Speaker 1:          11:01          But anyway, uh, and then the next conversation with somebody else who said, we should just disband the entire American police force. We don't need police anymore. So, you know, very productive, rational conversation that was happening. And then in between it was just people like literally screaming at the top of their lives, like as loud as they possibly Clyde and in between. And this is the part that I think that is so heartbreaking to me in between Megan Kelly who I really do respect and think is an incredibly smart and gifted person. Megan Kelly was thrilled and other commercial breaks. She encouraged us to keep at it because it makes for great rating. So thinks about that. Like is that really where we want to be as a country? So in the context of all of this, part of what I try to do in crossing the finish line is paint a picture of what we, not just what's at stake and, and what did they cause enormous.

Speaker 1:          11:54          And we have a lot at stake economically. We certainly have a lot at stake socially. Um, it is critically important to the future of our country that we do better in terms of inclusion and this sort of overall approach that we take to the fact that our nation will in less than a generation, be a minority majority nation. You know, we are seeing the sort of anxiety and the backlash against that really come to the fore in this election. I think that is actually probably one of the most uh, sort of salient pieces of what's happening today is this sort of discomfort that many especially white Americans have with the changing face of our nation. I don't think you can deny that that is a significant undercurrent here, but what it takes to do better, I think, and we're going to talk about one small piece of it today.

Speaker 1:          12:40          You know, the, the media in Hollywood piece of it, which you know, might seem like the least important but actually has a role to play in the book. I try to make the case that it's actually a whole bunch of things. It's not just about how do we, how much better do we do on diversity at a company like Google, where at any American company, which is mostly where we're talking about diversity today, we are mostly talking about it in the corporate context, right? How'd he got more women and people of color to go into stem? You know how our businesses can do better, how to have more women and people of Color on corporate boards and in the suite that matters. But there's a whole kind of panoply of factors. One of them is what's happening in education, and I talked about my own formative experience.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Unfortunately the trends in the country are not going in the right way. If you look at the charts of what's happened to school integration since Brown vs board of Education, it is a bell curve and the trend is reversing. So American public schools are now becoming less diverse and it is actually the private school in many ways. So for the folks who can afford it, who get to send their kids to private schools, the private schools are working overtime to try to make sure they're diverse. But our public school system is becoming more segregated than ever. And I talk a lot about that in the book. So we, we're, we're maybe preparing the next generation to potentially reverse some of the gains that have been made with Gen y and Gen z and some of the younger Americans. I don't know. It's a question we have a three of challenge around mass incarceration, which you absolutely cannot separate it from the larger question of how are we doing on diversity in this country?

Speaker 1:          14:05          We are locking up an entire generation of minority Americans. And if we don't address that and see that as part of the overall picture of diversity in the country, we are missing a very important and significant teeth. Obviously the business piece is important. Immigration continues to be, uh, especially in this election cycle. A really intense topic of, of dispute and debate. But of course, and I know you all know this, when a company like Google immigrants to this country, including by the way, those who are here who are undocumented contributing enormously to the American economy, undocumented, they were going to pay billions of dollars in taxes every year, which is sort of an extraordinary piece of the picture, which doesn't get much attention. And then what I want to invite Alicia to talk about with me in a minute is this sort of entertainment and media piece, which seems kind of Billy and the context of talking about, you know, some of the big issues we have around criminal justice reform and education and some of the an immigration right.

Speaker 1:          15:01          But part of what I argue in the block is that what we see and what we see intensely all the time now because of the sort of limitless that, you know, the boundary list, uh, sources of information that come out at what we see in the media, in Hollywood, on television, maybe matters more than ever. And the challenges is that we have not made the kind of progress in ensuring that the images and the stories that we see actually represent our country. So I'm going to invite up Alicia Reiner, my dear friend, who I'll also introduce to come up and join me. We'll have a bit of a conversation. We really want to encourage you to participate in this. Um, this is not just about me and fundamentally for us to make progress as a country. It takes a lot of conversation. Um, so the, and then the last thing I'll just say about this is that I do think, and I write a lot about this in the book, I do believe that White America has an outsized responsibility and white male America in many instances has an outsized responsibility in solving these issues.

Speaker 1:          16:02          And in finding a way to understand, the one point I managed to make on Meghan Kelly's crazy show that day is that in the end, it doesn't matter whether or not I can understand in a personal or a deep way the experience of what it's like to drive, uh, around the country. As an African American, I will never understand that I'm, I'm awake person. I can never fully appreciate what that feels like, but I have a responsibility and I believe we all do that. If any American, if any American feels that they do not have full access to the American dream or that they are in any way less than a full, let have less than the full rights and privileges and equality of all other Americans, then we all have a responsibility to try to make it better. Whether we agree with it or relate to it or not.

Speaker 1:          16:51          And so all the conversations we're having today about, I believe it's racist, they don't believe it's racist. I think the cops are racist. They don't think the cops or it doesn't matter. None of it matters. Because if any Americans feel, if any Americans feel that our country is not a full meritocracy, is not fully accessible, but the American dream is not accessible to all Americans, then we all have work to do. So with that, I want to invite up to Reiner. I'm the amazing and talented. I know many of you know her. Um, I'm very lucky that, uh, Alicia and I had been very dear friends for a long time. We're actually neighbors. We both live in Harlem and was there for a long time. Our little girls are the same age. Uh, and Alicia doesn't need a ton of introduction. I'm sure you have seen her on the amazing show.

Speaker 1:          17:35          Orange is the new black, which is one of that sort of few shows out there. It's certainly one of the only shows it's an all female cast or a majority female casts. Um, one of the few shows that also has really focused on the mass incarceration issue as part of that, one of the themes of the show, um, Aleisha along with many of the cast members and the writers have also put a lot of time into calling attention to criminal justice reform and not incarceration of women, which is important. And her new movie acquity, uh, which she was here at Google when like a month ago. Yeah, a month ago to talk about on is the first all female driven movie Wall Street film. Um, that was written by, directed by and starred in by, that's not really offended. Um, all women. Uh, and I've been talking with her about that movie for a very long time. So please join me in welcoming Elise Reiner.

Speaker 2:          18:26          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:31          Hi. How are you? I'm good. He thinks he's thought, is he on? She's not on. Uh, are we on the screen? Can they see us in California, California? He's been, are you there? Okay. Um, so, so I started to say that in many ways it's hard to think of Hollywood or movies or TV, which is kind of, you know, fun and fluffy, right? That's the invite and fluffy. It's hard to think about that as having, um, an important role to play in the context of all the rest of the, um, but I know that I often talk about it as, and I say that I told the story in the book that when I was a kid, one of the most influential women that I saw on television with wonder woman and wonder woman with at her, uh, height of power in my early childhood, uh, Linda Carter lived in Washington.

Speaker 1:          19:26          And that was also a big thing. And she would live like in my neighborhood and my youth like ride my bike path or house, always trying to get a glimpse of her, cause I'm so obsessed with her. I never saw her. But you know, wonder woman kicked off, right. I mean, she was an absolute feminist icon and for, you know, for me it was, it made a big difference, but you know, it, it does feel like in some way then I think the numbers bear this out and I know you know them really well. You know, the sort of early eighties, late seventies, early eighties in many ways was kind of a high point. Like we haven't really seen a substantial increase in like women role model, uh, in the movies and on TV since then. And that's, you know, I am here later today for the Dean Davis Symposium, which we'll talk about, not only be actual statistics, but perhaps a piece of technology that Google is involved with to look at these statistics and, you know, I just want to roll it back for a second and say thank you for everything that you said.

Speaker 1:          20:25          Also as a very privileged white woman, like I grew up thinking I was outrageously lucky, um, and I was teased mercilessly. We now call it bullying, but I was the fat kid and he's mercilessly, and there was this interesting dichotomy of like, oh, I feel like the outsider, I feel like crap. But I went to a very privileged white, the fairly diverse school, but um, was made aware because it was a very, it was ethical culture, which makes you very aware of your privilege and aware of the world around you. And we learned ethics in first grade and um, and I felt very like, how dare I feel anything but lucky. That's pretty much how I grew up. Um, and never really like an felt a similar responsibility to make change for others, not for myself. So I think coming to a place where I was really looking at the statistics about women in the media was took me a long time because I had this how dare I mentality.

Speaker 1:          21:44          And then I did become aware of the statistics and a lot of it had to do with becoming a mother for me. Because what you said about if, if you see it, you can be it. I became the mother of a girl, have a daughter, and I wanted her to see certain things. And I then did some research and Stacy Smith does some amazing research. The Gina Davis Institute doesn't some amazing research. And what I found out, it's 77% of the people you see in all of media, which includes film, television, cartoons, everything. 77% are male. So when you're looking at that as a human being, as a female human being, you feel like a massive minority. You know, as I explained it to my work because it's not. And as a male you feel like you're in the world. Um, and that is something that we're seeing every day.

Speaker 1:          22:48          By the way, one of the most interesting things that I heard someone say to me about the movie Yackety, which I encourage you to all go see first time I bought, then go buy it. Go see acronym. I'm sorry, I get to do that. Movie's been out for a little while. Mine just came out this week that you in my book just came out this disease. So, um, but one of the most interesting things that I heard somebody say after seeing equity with a friend of mine went with her husband. And, um, and if you've not seen the movie, you know, the, the female characters really drives a movie. And it is the story of women as a very important story. We've been on Wall Street, it's also with thriller. Um, it's not overtly like about women in a traditional way, but it is driven by women.

Speaker 1:          23:23          And one of the things that, um, my friend's husband said to her was the male characters are so one dimensional and Finley's on. And she was like, yeah, welcome to our world. Because if you look at movies like Wall Street or any of these things, I mean I think, you know, when I, when I watched it the first time I started laughing because of course the first time you see a woman in the wolf of Wall Street is Martha Robbie naked in the bubble bath. And you're like, seriously guys? Like really? That's like, and then the next one is like the never laying insecure secretary, like not, so anyway, you get the point. Um, but the, the point is, is that one of the things that I thought was so interesting is this week with the Edney is and of course after the Oscars, so white controversy last year, which is by the way, not over.

Speaker 1:          24:06          So stay tuned for February. We'll see if we see any significant improvement. Unlikely. Um, but one thing that's super interesting is that the ambiance this year, you know, we're so focused, there was so much attention on diversity, you know, shows like transparent and others that got a lot of attention. So you might conclude the TV's doing pretty well right there, Shonda land and all these things, right. And it's, it's disturbing when there's fault, there's elevated and lay that, yeah, that makes us feel like, oh, we're doing great. Um, because statistically speaking or not, and statistically speaking, 80% of directors are women, similar to 8% of female CEOs. And we do have, you know, it's I think one or 2% cinematographers. Um, we do have that 77% gap, even in like the extras you see in the background didn't like bazonkers crowd scene. So how do we change that?

Speaker 1:          25:14          Um, and, and that equity was a big piece of that. So, and I think part of it is true. I mean, so, so you talked about your daughter and I haven't talked about my kid, but it is, um, sort of important piece of the puzzle, which I didn't mention, which is that both my daughters are African American. And so when I think about, um, what I want for them, uh, you know, I'm obviously as this at her age, you know, I'm glad we have doc McStuffins, which by the way, just got canceled. Uh, if you didn't know tragic loss and Disneyland, doc McStuffins has been canceled, your daughter's devastated. She's seen every episode at least a hundred times. Uh, but you know, that, that question of like, what an impact it really makes. And I talk a little bit in the book about the impact of the Cosby show, right?

Speaker 1:          26:01          And how sort of groundbreaking that was for so many Americans. And I think now in some ways, master of none is kind of breaking that territory for Asian Americans that we've seen so few Asian Americans ever. And in his speech at the Emmy's, right? Fresh off the boat, I fresh off the boat. I mean this is like the biggest deal. I mean, and if these are huge segments as American society and yet they'd be like barely see them. So, so at least you're like, what? What's the problem? Like why is, you know, given that there was a good economic case, certainly in Hollywood, right, the movies and the shows that you actually reflect the country do really well. I mean, you look at like how frozen became the, you know, the highest grossing animated film of All time. So what is, why is it so hard to make change and to see, uh, disease stories in Hollywood that look like America?

Speaker 1:          26:48          In my experience, it's a couple of different things. One is our unconscious bias. I think there are so many parts of us that were simply not aware of. And I, it's, you were talking earlier about these sort of over responsibility of the white now and I really believe that to be true because they're in power, they are a, they're in power and be, I, I feel like there are so many systems in place that our habit, we all have our habits, you know, and it, some of them are good and some of them are bad. Hiring our friends is a big habit. A lot of people have hiring people that look like you, that feel like you, that you're comfortable with is just a truth that most of the world does. I mean, I always make the joke that like, Karen's my key demographic, right?

Speaker 1:          27:50          Like Nice Jewish girls, you know, similar backgrounds and hey, you know, I totally was biased in my hiring of Karen. Like, well, we all do it. We all do it. I, you know, I was at a screening of equity. I did a Q and a and this girl who looked just like one of the girls I grew up with, like look like an upper west side girl came up to me and started talking to me and her daughter goes to banks for and my daughter grocery extreme. And like all of a sudden we're friends and I don't know if that would've happened if it was a man, like probably not first of all, because I had married and, and I only, I only say that because if I was a man and a woman came up to me like that's not cool. So I'm not going to hire that woman because, or I'm not going to make, be friends with that willing cause.

Speaker 1:          28:46          What is my wife gonna Think? And these are the like thing, these unconscious biases, these stereotypes that we aren't aware of sometimes that we have to make ourselves aware of. I mean I'm kind of controversial on this though because I will say that I don't, I don't actually subscribe to it always being unconscious. And I actually, it makes me a little crazy cause I often feel like the constant conversation about unconscious bias sometimes lets people off the hook. Like, well I just wasn't conscious. Like no, no. Like it doesn't work that way. Like you don't get to be unconscious. Like there are things that, and by the way I think and I think sometimes it is absolutely blatantly conscious, you know, some of the biases that we are seeing in this election cycle, you know, you can't tell me that people aren't conscious of the fact that we don't ask men to smile when they're running for president.

Speaker 1:          29:37          And yet we asked women just my Al Right. So I get really part of about this. One thing I just wanted to share is that part of why I am the, and this is not to be like a pain the off about it, but I do think like it's not an excuse anymore. Like unconscious bias doesn't get to be an excuse forever. Oh, I wasn't conscious. And so I just, you know, oops, my bad. Like we had to get beyond that as a country. We have, we have to do better than that. And one of the things that I, one of the reasons why I called the book crossing the finish line, then they didn't want to just like briefly tell the story at he knows the story, but I'll tell it briefly is that, um, I have these two fabulous colleagues, these lovely guys who worked with me in Boston, and there are these sort of central casting, you know, wait Bostonian Catholic guys, and you would not look at them and think that they were, you know, I made a lot of assumptions about them as we always do about everyone that we meet.

Speaker 1:          30:29          Well, it turns out that my colleagues, Brian and Sean are part of this incredible prison ministry in Boston. And Day along with a bunch of the other, mostly white male executives from a bunch of Boston companies are part of a parish that goes into largely minority because that is who the prison population is, uh, you know, maximum security prisons around the Boston area and do these amazing sort of collaborative ministries. And the thing that Brian said to me about it is why I titled The book the Way I did and he blew me away when he said this. He said after visiting these prisons and he was terrified to do it. He thought, what am I going to have to say to these people, what I have in common with them after the first visit he walked out and said the line between us and so very thin.

Speaker 1:          31:17          If I had made one different decision in my life, I might be where they are. But they had made one different decision or had one different opportunity in their lives, they might be where I am. And I was so blown away that he thought of that as a thin line that he actually saw there being so little difference between them. And I thought that's what we need. Like that's what we need in the country is we need more people to see these lines as thin. And so, you know, one thing that, and then I want to open it up cause I do, I think we should have a conversation, but you know, Hollywood does have this amazing abilities through storytelling to help people relate to other human beings they might not otherwise relate to you. So like what have been the, what are you seeing that you, what are your signs of hope?

Speaker 1:          32:03          Like what do you see changing people or what do you think is the sort of possibility for that? Are we moving, I mean the pace is glacial, but are you optimistic, pessimistic? I'm very optimistic. I think I am a by nature an optimist. And when you were talking about how we like unconscious bias and that, that sort of lets people off the hook, I believe that we're good. You know, there's, I, I was, um, at an event yesterday and they were talking about, um, Einstein had this like core question like, do you believe the world is good or not? Do you believe that we're all trying to make it better than that? And, and that really is a core question because if you do believe in the good, like then you act from the good. And I really believe in good. Um, so I believe that we can only teach with love and compassion, you know, and, and empathy and compassion.

Speaker 1:          33:15          And so I, yes, I believe we are changing for the guys. I really do. I think it takes a lot of conversations like this and a lot of talking about the things that are really painful and uncomfortable and making art about it and it that's, you know, I became an artist because I felt like that was the place where I could reach the most people with true that there are sometimes afraid to talk about in other areas. Have you seen people changed through shows? Like orange is the new black, like I know you've had lots of people come up to you and say things to you about it. So what was what anyone stand out like what do you think has been the change that a show like orange? I think it's simply, it's that finish line. It's people relating to those women and feeling like I that could be, well, that's what the show does.

Speaker 1:          34:14          So well, right? It was those stories of like, you know, that Piper's story too. And, and it, it's true. And how do we, how do we tell stories that create more compassionate? How do we, you know, the first movie that I made as a producer was a short about grief and loss. I lost my dad really suddenly to cancer. He was 55 and everyone, I felt like a pariah. Everyone was afraid to talk to me because they were so afraid to talk about that and they didn't know how to talk about. So they just wouldn't. And so I made this movie and I worked with 10 grief counselors and social workers and we created like basically some art therapy with all these sort of a different phases of grieving. And we created a discussion guide and a journal that went with it as a way to help people process.

Speaker 1:          35:06          And I do believe deeply in this healing power of art or I wouldn't be here. Um, I think it's hard in moments like this, like in what's going on in the world because you almost can't make the art fast enough to really make impact. So then I think for me in a moment like this, especially as a white privileged woman, how do I make impact? What, what? That's the biggest question I sort of turn over to you in, in these moment. Well, one of the things and then I want to like open it up to conversation. So one of the things that I, and I mentioned my kid, one of the things that I learned, I learned, you know, having worked on diversity for years and those things I learned in researching the book is how often minority Americans talk to their children about race and how rarely white Americans do.

Speaker 1:          35:59          And one of the sort of, so, and I had a personal experience of this, which I really had to face, which is that when my daughter cells is now seven, came home from preschool when she was three, she came home one day and said, Mama, I'm Brown. And wanted to talk about the fact that she was brown and some of the other kids in, in cough warrants. And you know, she wasn't probably as diverse of a preschool as I would've liked for her, but it was sort of the one that we picked and she wanted to talk about it. And my immediate visceral, so here was my unconscious. The thing that I, you know, thinking I'm so progressive about it, my immediate visceral, visceral reaction was I wanted to change the subject. And I thought, well, why am I trying to change the subject? Like it's just an objective truth.

Speaker 1:          36:36          Like what am I going to do with no teller? You're not like, it's ridiculous. Like I have to be able to talk about this and you know, and so I had to like take a deep breath and kind of face my own discomfort. But I tell the story because when I was researching the book, one of the things that I learned is that there's been all this, like a lot of all this psychology, the psychological research that's been done about conversations around race with children. And it turns out, you know, so much of white America, we, we want to be colorblind, right? We want to just see everyone is the same and not as a big theme in the collection. By the way, if you watch five minutes of conservative news, if you watch Fox for five minutes, you will hear guest after guest after guest challenge the assumption that there is racism in this country.

Speaker 1:          37:15          Challenge the assumption that any of these big issues that we're facing are about race. I mean that is this and that. And you got to listen to that because it's actually a very significant part of the American perspective. And if we deny it, we're missing a whole thing. But here's the thing about it. So even the most well intentioned among us who think that by not talking about race with our kids, we are raising colorblind children. Well, turns out that psychologically it has the opposite effect. That in the opposite, in the absence of conversation, in the absence of information, our children actually draw a negative conclusion. So the very thing that so many white Americans do to try to, you know, be good citizens, right? We don't need to talk about that cause we're all the same. It's actually the wrong choice because it's actually reinforcing our kids assume that when we're not talking about it, it's because there's something wrong or bad that were uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          38:07          Piggyback on that. I feel many media, we're not talking about it either. So where are they going to get wrecked? And I feel like it's almost, it's so much better and easier with kids because there's so much more open. When you guys have workshops on diversity, it feels a little forced sometimes. And I think with kids it's, you know, at our school we have, since first grade she's had racial justice and advocacy classes in fourth grade. And my favorite part, yeah, my favorite part is they talk regularly about, there are four different kinds of their bored, not kind of the people. They would hate me saying that there are four different categories of human in any situation. So in any situation where there was a conflict, there's the mistake maker, the target, the bystander. And the ally. What I love about that breakdown is that the mistake maker and the bystander, or almost neck and neck as a mistake makers, that if you are a bystander, that's not okay.

Speaker 1:          39:25          And I love that my daughter goes to a school, the teachers, it is not okay to be a bystander that it is your job to be an ally. That is your job in life. And that's that unconscious bias. Like how do we train ourselves and how do we train our children? So I want to open it up in conversation in the room if there's lots of better perspective than ours. Right. Um, I wanted to talk about something you mentioned earlier when you mentioned the mes and they're pushing for diversity. So at the Emmy's, you know, Jeffrey temporary, like you won an award for a transparent, and in his speech he mentioned how important it was to, you know, uh, let Trans Women actually be on TV and control their stories. But you know, like the obvious irony of that is that Jeffrey Tambor is himself, you know, assessed man playing a trans woman.

Speaker 1:          40:13          And so my question is, you know, how can you make sure people in positions of power like that actually do sort of vacate their spot and actually do maybe room for people who need it. That's a great, I love that question. You want to, what do you think? I think they got it. They know first of all. Yeah. I think a big piece of it is, by the way also a white actresses playing minority characters where they had no business with doing [inaudible]. Right. Hello everyone. Um, there's a long list of both of which I talked about in the book. Like they should never have said yes to this part. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And um, so I want to start by saying one of my favorite parts is that Jeffrey tambor called himself out on it and we have to like, that takes a lot of balls.

Speaker 1:          41:01          You're winning an award and you're like, dude, this is not okay. Um, and I think creating art that talks about what you like. I love Jill Solloway so much cause she told her story. She didn't look for like the story she, that she thought would make the most money or whatever. She told the story that needed to be told in her heart and the story that she was afraid to tell the story. She was probably most afraid to Dell because as we, as she's now put out is like her, her family's story. Um, and I think that's what we all have to do. She also said, you know, top of the Patrick Marky, I don't know how to do that. I thought about it a lot. What I know how to do is make my art and make my own choices. When I made my movie, I said from the beginning before we even hired the writer, I want to play a woman, married to a woman, married to a woman of color.

Speaker 1:          42:04          Because if I'm making this movie, I want to create an extra role for a diverse woman and extra woman from the LGBT community and um, and like basic and a woman. So I, I hit those three checks now I, I did hire an actual, um, African American woman. It was tricky. It's tricky then to go like, oh, is it okay for me to ask people, are you gay? That's actually discrimination. I'm, when I'm casting that role, I'm not allowed to ask that question. Just like I'm not allowed to ask their eight, even though there's incredible reasons and men ages, um, and, and so many isms in Hollywood. So there's a lot of tricky navigating there. Um, is it okay, like here I was an actress and producer trying to create more roles for women, women of color, LGBT women. Was it wrong for me to play it because I played a lesbian?

Speaker 1:          43:15          Should have, should I have hired someone else to play my own role? I don't know. Um, I've never thought about it that way. Yeah, it then that is I think in some ways like, right. I mean, I don't know. Other people may disagree. I think there are some, it's not always bought. I mean, there are gray areas in these on these issues. But I do think to me, there's no gray area, no grey area whatsoever when we are hiring white actors to play minority characters. Like it's just unacceptable. This happened in the star trek movies. It happened in the movie Aloha. Like we continue to do this is absolutely unacceptable. And I will say I just did 23 in me so I know exactly what I am so that I make sure not to lie about that. Do you know what I mean? I did that exactly for that reason cause everyone's like, are you Italian? Are you Russian? Are you, what are you Armenian are you, and I, you know, my grandparents would tell me one thing, but I, and I've played Armenian and I believe I am in fact Armenian, but I was also told I was Egyptian and I'm doing 23 and me to find out if I really am okay.

Speaker 1:          44:23          Let me know. Okay. Yeah. Um, I, um, I've lived in Oakland, California for the past several years. Raised both my kids in Oakland. We're like the most progressive humans on the earth. It's, I just, and so I find that I just get, so all my friends who are less progressive, I have some friends that live in the central part of the state of California and places like Arizona. And I just like, I watched them evolve and you said the pace is glacial and it is glacial. But like when they finally get it, it's like how do you, I mean I'm super optimistic, don't get me wrong. But I, these people, they just, when they are so slow to about makes me crazy and they just, how do you have patients? And one of the things for people who are, are people of color who deal with this crap on a daily basis, loved ones being murdered.

Speaker 1:          45:15          And yet they get up there in front of the press and there's so lovely and articulate and understanding and compassionate and I just don't know how they do it. Right. So I wanted to say one thing about one part of why you had said um, cause there's a lot there and I want to unpack one thing about it and that is when you talked about you know, people you know who are left progressive and I'm going to say something really crazy and I say a lot about this in the blog. One of my biggest lessons in the last couple of years has been about my own biases around people's political orientation. And I run now a nonpartisan women's organization and I established it. It's a pull a women's political organization, which I didn't have time to talk about, but I established it to be nonpartisan because I believed so much that we need more women in the political process, whatever their political affiliation.

Speaker 1:          46:05          And there's actually a lot of evidence that when women get into elected office, women on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat are actually more bipartisan, more productive, more likely to put the issue, be interest of the country ahead of their own. So I had to actually go out and this is my own, like I've talked a lot about this. I didn't know any conservative women. Like I didn't have any conservative friends. I thought I had nothing in common with them. And so I went through a process of seeking out, um, some Republican women who were very well respected in the political world and my relationships with them were life altering, life altering. And I see you shaking your head. I know we don't agree on everything. We won't agree on everything, but the, the, the challenge that we have in the country today.

Speaker 1:          46:50          Now if you ask me do I think I do, I think that there is, um, that I want to sit down with someone in the alt right or with a white supremacists, uh, or somebody who is a virulent antisemite and I try to have like a rational conversation so we can understand each other better. No, I will say that no, I have nothing in common with somebody who is that hateful about entire groups of people. I cannot relate to that. And I wish I was a better person that I'd be willing to take that on account. But the truth is the vast majority of Americans are nowhere near those polar ends of the scale. And it is the sort of dystopian world of the current media cycle that makes us think that is the case. And it means that we're less likely to have some very important conversations.

Speaker 1:          47:40          And there are a lot of common bond between people who have different political views. And if we can't have those conversations, if we're so uncomfortable with, I'm like, it's another piece of the equation, right, that, that we have to be able to do that and defined common bounce around and to respect each other. And look, I think that is in some ways happening in this election. I mean, you know, the Republicans who had subscribed to never Trump specifically because of the racism and the misogyny that has been so, uh, such a critical part of this campaign. You know, I may not agree with them on a lot of things, but I certainly agree with them on that. So, you know, my only point is that I think we have to see those conversations across the political divide. It's still a part of the same equation.

Speaker 1:          48:28          If it's hard and it's uncomfortable and we all hate it, cause the challenge and make it look like challenge and we're not, I don't like watching Fox News and make me mad because I don't agree. But I do it and I go on the show and I do it because I don't know how I understand the country if I own, if I'm totally tuning it out, just as I would want them watching it. And I said, why, why, why? I just thought that would want more conservatives watching MSNBC. Right. So, I mean, these are the ones he's like big, hard thing that like we're going to have to fake, you know, or else like in length, we're okay with where we are today, which I think most of us probably aren't. Okay. It's in no way meant as a criticism. And I think, you know, we're all, we're all doing our bath to try to like to contribute to, you know, about her death cards. But I, but how does it to say something about that? Yeah, please.

Speaker 3:          49:13          Yeah, I have a more like similar on adding on that I thought you would give you an easier question there. I live in Queens, um, which is I guess the word is, yeah, it is, I believe the voice most diverse, uh, neighborhood. Now I'm 64. I'm lucky on battery. However, when I was growing up, I grew up in India where, uh, I had my own beatings about that, that before a nineties, um, I would go and do each other like neighbors homes, whether they were Hindus and Muslims, doesn't matter. I would go into a mosque right away without much issues. Suddenly I realize something happened. Everybody was talking about, it was like 91 92 and then we stopped going to each of their houses unless they were the same religion. We stopped going to across the mosque and dumpers something happened and I realize, oh, some Moscow's to [inaudible] 91 and the God issue. And then that segregation, to my surprise when I went back a couple of years ago, he's still there. Yeah. So now that actually I taught like somehow in my mind I had ah, that's the temporary, it will go away when no, across the generations still there. So segregation has been, they just stay. That's what my take is, unless you do something about it. So

Speaker 1:          50:32          what does it end? People ask us all the time and I get off all the time with someone who works on this stuff. I get asked all the time like, do you think that just the rise of Gen y right, that the Gen y in the United States as the most diverse generation in it and had three most well educated generation in history that like that's just going to like change things, right? Um, I don't know that it does automatically. Like I actually think it does take work and I'm glad you mentioned the religious piece. They, I wrote a little bit about that. But you know, that's another place where like we make choices every day, right? About the kinds of searches that we go to and whether or not we're choosing churches and then a guide that are, you know, are mosques that are welcoming and inclusive or not.

Speaker 1:          51:11          Um, you know, I think in the Christian community, especially because, you know, you could, there are so many different sort of, there's just a thousand flavors, right? Uh, that, that question of like, do you think churches that are more diverse or lots of earth, and it's another way that we make those threats with birth families and, you know, create conversation or not. But, um, you know, these are very closely held beliefs and people get very uncomfortable when they're closely, I'll believe, or in any way challenge. But I mean, not the parality of our nation. I'm like, how do we not do that? Like, I dunno. And you know, the, in the film, like there's been so much on that. Anyway, I was just going to, sorry, did you have anything else?

Speaker 3:          51:50          So on that, I think with four year olds, we'd have an easier shot there because then they had, they have, they can keep three things in their mind. Right? And if they decide the hey, um, if they talked to everybody and uh, Jack with everybody had been, that's the best star. So I have a four year old and he asked me something that he wants to be a guard. Like he wants you to be best. He wants to be that. I thought, Oh yeah, you can choose the board has come to this, you can be whatever you want later on, but not now let's figure out what you wanted to be. Um, so if he asks me how is like meeting different people, are different kinds of people is useful? Like how is diversity useful to him? And you have to say only three things because it's a four year old, right? They can't remember more than three. Hey, what would you say? How, why would diversity be useful to you growing up later in life? Okay.

Speaker 1:          52:39          I took her to a four year old. You're saying here for y'all, I don't know what to do say,

Speaker 3:          52:44          but

Speaker 1:          52:47          yeah, four year old love [inaudible] what would your thing, um, I love that question. So if my four year old ass, I just want to make clear with my four year old asked me why is diversity important?

Speaker 3:          53:03          Yeah, yeah, yeah. Useful to them growing up, crossing the Timnath Lane.

Speaker 1:          53:15          My honest answer if she said that right now, so I'm a mat, I'm an actress, so I have to like imagine that I'm doing a new playground. No, you're too pretty. Uh, no, I uh, I would say baby like don't, don't know. I wouldn't say that because we need more time to prepare. I do, but I would, I would really say the more experience we have of life, the more, the more we know of the more people and the more experiences, the more compassion we have, the more we can serve. And then I would give a concrete example because that's all like bad me, man, my man, my man. So that I, what I'm thinking about right now is what's the concrete example? And I would, I would probably get a book about two kids, like, and I'm sure they had their summer reading this beautiful book about like, you walk a mile in my shoes and I walk a mile in yours and how do we then appreciate each other's lives?

Speaker 1:          54:32          And it really is what Lauren was talking about, about like make friends with that super conservative guy that you don't understand. Because if you understand him in that process, he'll understand you. I was actually thinking, I dare anyone to come make this with me. I want to make like a little, it's sort of like a Saturday night live sketch up like we're friend, you're conservative white now. Um, like, because for me that's really hard sometimes because their opinions are so not mine. And I can, I, can I have my own unconscious bias about that and how do we create more situations where we're in rooms together where we're understanding and then can have compassion for each other. I'll say like my, my little wrap up without, I'm sorry about, um, what I talk about, and this is a direct quote from Effie Brown who's an amazing producer and she talks about three things you can do to change things for women are higher mentor and in bath.

Speaker 1:          55:44          So hire more women, investing in women. And if you can't do either of those mentor. Yup. So we're out of time. I don't have all the answers and I definitely didn't write the book because I had all the answers. Um, I tried to ask some questions that I hope we'll all keep thinking about it and I would really, I would love for you to buy the book for free leave. Um, but I would especially love for you to continue this conversation, you know, through social channels and with your friends and online. Like we need this conversation now maybe more than ever before, certainly in our lifetime and we need it thoughtfully and inclusively and, um, we need to bring our best to it. Um, because this is some of the most complicated and difficult challenges of our time, and I think it takes all of us working towards it, working towards a solution to make it better. So thank you so much to Karen and to everyone in Google. Thank you for having us.

Speaker 2:          56:37          Thank you.
