Speaker 3:          01:27          for someone who high, hardly finished high school. Well those honorary degree

Speaker 1:          01:31          received very ironic. Yeah. It's to say that we shouldn't have gone to high school, but um, no, we're, we're absolutely thrilled about all the works that you've given us to the world. Um, and you continue to give back. You give yourself back with your, the sub l again, the foundation that empowers women and girls and all throughout cheating California and were amazed by the words that you have for us and the actions that you continue to give. Thank you. Thank you. So I think would like to start with, um, but from the beginning, from like how you became the person you became, someone born, a girl born in Peru, which lane girl born in Peru and came here and had stories of love and mystery and coincidence is, can you tell us a little while? Um,

Speaker 3:          02:17          I wasn't planning to be a writer really. I was born in the middle of the second war, world war in a very conservative, Catholic, patriarchal environment. And I was supposed to be somebody's wife, somebody's mother. It didn't work out for me. I didn't have the raw material for that job. I, no, not at all. So I was very rebellious. Even when I was very young, I sort of realized that being a woman was not to my advantage because I saw my mom, I saw that my momma in the household where we lived, we lived with my grandfather and my uncles. The males had all the privileges and the W my mother, who was the woman, didn't, I, she didn't have any money and she didn't have any independence. I didn't want to be like her. So I think I became a feminist around age five before that word was invented in Chile.

Speaker 3:          03:11          And then, um, I became a journalist until it worked as a journalist. I did everything except radio. I did television, newspapers, magazines, you name it. And then we had a military coup in Chile in 1973 and very soon I had to get out of my country. And I went as a political refugee to Venezuela where I could not find a job as a journalist. So I worked in all kinds of odd jobs to make a living and support my kids, two kids and at least one dog. And um, and then by 1981, I was working, administering a school in Caracas. That was not the job for me. I can't even add or subtract. And I had to deal with checkbooks and with money and it was just a total disaster. But they get me for like four years. And during that time in 1981, I got a phone call that my grandfather whom I adored, was dying and I could not return to my country to beat him farewell.

Speaker 3:          04:20          So I, um, I started a letter, which was like a spiritual letter. I would write to him often, but this was a different letter because I wasn't sure if he was going to be able to read it. And I wanted to tell him that all the stories that he had told me, and he was a wonderful storyteller. I remembered them, I had them all with me. It was my, they represented my background, my roots, my family, everything that I had left behind. And I think that in a way, as a political refugee, I felt an overwhelming nostalgia. You, you sort of idealize the country that you left. There's a reason why you left because you couldn't live there, but still one idea license it. And the idea is to try to go back all the time. So, um, the letter from my grandfather was about the stories that he had told me.

Speaker 3:          05:17          And the first story was a story of my aunt Rosa. My, my great aunt Rosa was my grandfather's first fiancee and she died in mysterious circumstances before they could get married. So eight years later, he married the youngest daughter in the same family with the idea that if he had been accepted once, he would be accepted the second time too. So that's why he married my grandmother who nobody wanted to marry because he was so weird. She was, she was adorable, but totally weird. She knew she lived in another world. She was always experimenting with the paranormal. So my first few years were with this wonderful grandmother and there was a table, a very heavy Spanish table where my grandmother would have the same answers and she would call the spirits with a table and they say that the table would jump twice for years. One for now I have the table in my house. I've tried to

Speaker 1:          06:22          everything you need to men to the table. So I don't know how she did it, but there must've been some trick

Speaker 3:          06:29          there. So with that background, with that family, I think that it also only natural that I would have to write about it, about that grandmother who is clad in the house of the spirits. My first novel. So the idea was to tell my grandfather that I remembered what he had told me on the first story in the letter was a story of my aunt Rosa, my great aunt Rosa. And then I kept on driving. He died and I couldn't stop. And it wasn't the memories of the family, things that I invented that I made up and the history of my country for 17 years. So it wasn't micro world of the family that reflected the macro world of the country. And so that's the house of the spirits. Of course, I didn't plan it that way. It just happened later in this book was written 35 years ago and now that the book has been studied and whatever, people tell me all this

Speaker 1:          07:28          because I didn't plan it, you asked me what the book is about. I'm telling you what the reviewers upset, not what I had in mind. So knowing now the reach that that book has had, would you have done anything differently? Would you have?

Speaker 3:          07:41          Well, you know, I was, we were talking in the car that I never read my books because there's so much that you can correct. You can correct forever. Well, it saw what it was. Okay. At the time is totally politically incorrect today. There are certain terms or certain things that you can say today, not even in Chile. In Chile, we have very little idea of what politically correct is in Venezuela. Even less. But, uh, but still there are things that you don't say anymore in this century that we live in today. Too Bad,

Speaker 1:          08:14          we're very colorful actually. Do you think, do you think that the Spanish language, um, has morphed the way that you think in terms of femininity and masculinity? And as that's being translated to these other books, is there anything that's lost in translation?

Speaker 3:          08:33          Well, as we all know in the Spanish language, you cannot change everything. Every, every adjective has gender because it applies to a now that has gender, which doesn't happen in English. So for example, I have a granddaughter who is into the LGBT, et Cetera, and she, um, she has asked me to change the pronouns in English being the second language. For me it's pretty hard. But to translate that into Spanish is almost impossible because every adjective would have gender. And so I can't handle it in Spanish that well. In that sense, it's a very different language. The other thing with, with Spanish also is that it is a less flexible language than English. In English, everything can be turned into a verb. You can add other words. You can put words together in wonderful ways. Spanish is very strict, so you have to stick to grammar and spelling of course.

Speaker 1:          09:36          And you've been called the most widely read Spanish language author and you have got a CMR kiss and Jose, um, and so many other amazing authors. Now that you see your name among those, does it change the way you approached new books and new stories?

Speaker 3:          09:55          No, it doesn't because I tried to write from the womb, from the brain so much and I tried to write the best I can, whatever the critics say or how many books are sold or if they are compared to somebody else's writing. I can't worry about that. And uh, I don't even read the reviews because I get either, I would say I get influenced. I don't get upset because I understand that if you do anything in public what we do, people will criticize you. Some people will like you or some people will not. And I have to be ready for that. So I don't get all upset because something is bad and I don't celebrate too much when something is good because everything passes, it doesn't matter in the long run, nothing matters.

Speaker 1:          10:51          And out of all these authors like Jose Donoso and Garcia Marquez, was there any, any one off there that influenced you and that you looked up to?

Speaker 3:          10:58          I was in my late teens, early twenties when I started reading the big names of the boom of Latin American literature, at least 25 all male. Many of them would mustache man who wrote this fantastic books. They were different books in different countries of Latin America, but all of them was formed as sort of harmonic choir of that that you know, in a way, told the world what Latin America was about and told us who we were as a whole. So I grew up reading them.

Speaker 1:          11:37          Yes. And did you ever know, you know, being them male authors, was there anything about you that you wanted to share differently that would impact Latino literature?

Speaker 3:          11:48          I didn't plan it. I didn't think that way. I just wrote what I knew and had been working for women and with women and being a woman all my life. So, so it was only natural that my protagonist would tend to be more female than male. So when, when my book, the House of the spirits was published, they said that I was the only female voice in the boom at then. They rapidly said, no, she doesn't belong to the boom. She's possible. They didn't want a female in the boom of course. So, um, so I'm possible whatever posters and um, I never compared my writing to what they wrote other people did, but I don't,

Speaker 1:          12:32          you're writing was definitely influential to too many other authors after

Speaker 3:          12:37          is that because my book was so successful that even from the, from the start publishers all over, not only in Spain but all over realize that there is, um, a readership of feminine readership that wants to read female voices. So there was a market for, for, for female authors that before they had not maybe noticed. Yeah. And so in a way, that book opened the door for other women to be published. And I feel very proud of that.

Speaker 1:          13:13          Well, yeah. And within these books you'd have powerful women, powerful women. Are these women portrayed and from real life people in your life? Do you know any weak women? I do not know. I just pick up

Speaker 3:          13:31          people in the street and people, women that I know through the foundation, extraordinary women who are survivors of sometimes the most horrible trauma, and they not only survived, they become leaders in their communities. So that kind of of person, if a woman or man, it's always fascinating. Yeah. And, and I'm always attracted to those people who are, who stand outside the big umbrella of the establishment, immigrants, refugees, and people who have other gender choices. People who are come from different races, from different ages. I've been writing a lot about very old people and some readers say, why do you write all these people who don't even read? Because they can't even breed. No, I, I'm interested always in, in what is outside. Yes. Not the main stream.

Speaker 1:          14:27          So including these diverse characters, of course, there's a part of magic to it that Magic's not normal. You don't see that every day. And well, let's, let's, yeah, let's imagine to you, magic to me, or I guess the way I was, I was phrasing it is, you know, the fire and the poof in the, you know, out there, but, but the magic that you see in the night reading your books

Speaker 3:          14:52          is natural, is in the one in the room. What I understand is that we know nothing. Maybe you hear hearing Google are, you know, more, but, but normal people, normal people know very little. Uh, normal people have very little control over their lives and everything that stands outside that control, that explanation of life is mysterious. And some in some cultures like American, many play places in Europe who would, you don't, would, you cannot explain what you're going to control and what you cannot sell, you ignore. It's not in the realm of reality. However, in most of the world, and I would say all of Latin America, all of Africa, all of Asia, we understand that there are dimensions of reality that we don't control them. We don't understand it, but we accept them. For example, in everybody's lives, they are coincidences. Those moments in which you, you think, I have been here before and you, I know this place and you know that you have never been there, but somehow it's familiar or a person that you meet and you have the idea that you've met that person before or I am thinking of someone on the phone rings and it's that person that kind of, or dreams, that kind of thing that happens in everybody's life.

Speaker 3:          16:14          You all ignore it because you don't need it. But, but in my life, in my country, my culture, you use it, you use it in everyday life. It becomes part of, it's integrated to life. For example, my, my mom died two weeks ago and she, she was wonderful and we had a very close relationship and she would write to me every single day and I wrote to her every day for four years or more. So I have 40 years of letters in boxes. Every box has between 600 and 800 letters. So multiply by 40 I can't multiply, but you can Google it. It's a lot. And now that she's gone, I thought, well, why can't I write to her? Maybe she cannot write to me anymore, but I can try to her. Why not? And so then I started writing to her and establishing a connection that is perfectly natural to me.

Speaker 3:          17:18          And I know that, that if I write about it in a novel, it would be either crazy or magic realism. It's just life. It's a d like when people say that your work is part of magic realism. I think that my work is very realistic. It just accepts what is mysterious, but it's very realistic. You know, Garcia Marquez, the master of magic realism explains it very, very wonderfully. He says that in his book a hundred years of solitude, he has Romaleos, Labeija, Eh, rises to heaven in, in, in body and soul. The original stories that in the village where he lived in the town where he lived, a girl had got the air girl got pregnant and the family made it disappears, centers centered away. And the explanation the family gave was rose to heaven in Seoul and, and body like the Virgin Mary. And nobody asked more questions because everybody understood that no questions were accepted. But when he wrote that in the book, it didn't, it didn't work. And he said he wrote it several times and he'd never worked until he had her hanging the sheets to dry and a winter came and lifted her with the sheets. And then there is sort of explanation, you know, it's a parachute that elevated her with a sheets is magic. Real listen without the sheets is fantasy like Harry Potter.

Speaker 1:          18:54          Hmm. It, yes. It is interesting. And it's interesting to hear that magic realism within the Latino literature is almost easier to understand because we have, you know, spirits and we believe in, but we have spirits here too. I mean, all my friends see psychics, they

Speaker 3:          19:11          please start here. They see the whore horoscope. Everybody has a sign. I mean, yeah. Sodiank sign or whatever.

Speaker 1:          19:18          So what's the difference? It has a different name. Yeah. That's interesting. And do you do speak to them about that? Like do you connect those spirits into the, into the Latino community? Meaning for those that go to psychics and, um, before we go to psychics to oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah. Is there a way that you use this to impact, um, Latino literature are not Latino literature, but literature globally, like this idea of, of everybody believes in the same things. It is.

Speaker 3:          19:50          They're wonderful literary devices. When you can't solve something, you, you introduce a psychic and it's wonderful. The only time that it didn't work for me, I was writing a crime novel and in a crime novel, everything needs to fit so I couldn't introduce it. Astronomer, other psychic. Unfortunate.

Speaker 1:          20:11          Sure. So, um, I'm curious because you've had a lot of impact and not just Latino literature, global literature in representing the Latino Culture in Tulane culture and history, how do you see that this is impacting others and seeing, you know, Chilean history and books and those,

Speaker 3:          20:30          I don't know if how it impacts how this, but, but um, I hope it does because I try to, what I have written several historical novels and, well, when you write fiction, you have more freedom of course. And that, that's wonderful. But I tried to present an event, historical event from the perspective,

Speaker 3:          20:54          from another eye, not the perspective of the winners. For example, I have a novel, a novel called Island beneath the sea, and it is about the slave revolt in Haiti. And of course all the history books were written by white men, French or American or whatever, winners. The winners always. We never have the perspective of the, of the, the poor people, the slaves, the people of color, the children, the people who really experienced the event. So that's where I try to stand as a writer and as an observer. When I research for, for a historical novel, I go to if possible, to pry the documents because if I read the history books, that's the official history. And I want the other history, what people were saying in their letters. I have a, an oval about the gold rush. We all know the gold rush because we've read about it here, written by the 40 niners or the people who follow the 40 niners but long before the 49 or so arrived, people of color were here, native Americans, Mexicans, Peruvians, Chileans.

Speaker 3:          22:05          We were all in the minds before and that those voices have been obliterated. They don't exist. And the women who came also, they don't exist. So in that, for that book, I went to the library in Chile to research letters that Chilean miners wrote to their families in Chile in 1850. So, uh, I got a perspective from, from another angle, but we never hear in the United States. Yeah, that's interesting to hear that letters, the stories, the stories, stories, a person in a, in a letter for example, someone can explain that. Um, Eh, a bottle of champagne was cheaper than a glass of milk. You never see that in a history book. And the reason is that there was no one to make the cows. They were all looking for gold and at champagne came in ships from France. So that was available.

Speaker 1:          23:04          Interesting. So here at Google, um, similar to you being a storyteller and expanding the stories, reached to people around the globe. We write code and we make products and try to make these products accessible to the world. How do you see Google being our, you know, yourself in reaching out to these greater audiences with stories that had these little details that aren't communicated in other ways? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          23:31          I love the process of building a universe of details that it is in the details that you get the, the setting, the theater where the characters move and the more details I can find to make it believable, then the better that the reader will believe. The unbelievable, which is the fiction. So I create fictional characters that move in a real world and that makes it more believable for the reader. Now, how that reaches other cultures, I don't know. But I love when I read a book, for example, written by an Indian author and I can see how life is in India for, for that group of people and learn about them or it's, I find it fascinating. And do these stories impact your stories, stories from all over the world? I mean, you don't, you my latest book, um, what's the name? What's your latest book?

Speaker 3:          24:33          And I forgot Laurie, in the midst of winter. Sorry, because this is a memoir, right? No, it's not that my leg, my latest book is fiction and I forgot the name because I write in Spanish and I remember everything in Spanish. I can't remember anything in English, and in that book I have a character that is what the Marlin undocumented migrants, she's a refugee and she's running away from the gangs in her country that they have exterminated her family. I didn't have to invent that character. I had to reconstruct her world, but that character, we have cases like that. In my foundation, we work with refugees and a story like that. I don't have to create the story. I just have to recreate the village, the house, the grandmother, the food, the market, the voyage, traveling, all the way from what the Amala Gross Mexico to come to the United States, the border living in clandestine it in the United States, undocumented.

Speaker 3:          25:34          That's the world I need to construct very carefully and sticking to the truth because if I can be very believable in that aspect, then the character of Evelyn Ortega will emerge as real. And in sharing these stories of other people and you have memories of your own life and line and recent one, is there a difference in the way you go about writing other stories versus your own story? Yeah, Eh, when I write a memoir, I'm not writing about me alone. I wrote about me and the people who are around me, my family friends, and I asked myself, is this my story to tell? Am I betraying someone if I have to choose between betraying my mother or telling the story, I tell the story. Yeah, I can't. I can't a system, I tell the story, but I understand that, that there is a limit to how much, so my, my way of handling, when I write a memoir first the problem is I write in Spanish, but once it's translated or I have this sort of idea, I, I show it to the people who are named by name in the book. And if they don't approve, I take them out. I don't change it, but I think I take them out. It has happened only once. And I, with the latest memoir that I wrote a long time ago, I promised my son that I will never write another one. And I have so much has happened since then. I have so much to tell and I can't because I promised Nico I wouldn't.

Speaker 1:          27:18          Hmm. So you have your family here or your, um, your son having your family near and, and having your mother be a huge inspiration. Does that come across very well in the love that like Latinos usually, you know, very communalistic, uh, community.

Speaker 3:          27:34          Yeah. But I don't have the extended family. You know, I've tried to put together an extended family and it worked for a while when my grand children were little. We sort of adopted friends with their children that were part of this almost compound where we lived. And uh, kids would come to the pool. It would be an open house, always open house. And I had the feeling that I belonged in that little tribe where we all belong in Latin America, but now all that is gone. The grandchildren are older. They have gone to college, they finish college, they have their own lives. They don't remember me at all.

Speaker 1:          28:14          You can adopt me. Yeah. Yeah. Good. And so, um, I like you're saying, a lot of us have immigrated over and there's been a consistent or the bureau, um, consensus just recently in the seventies and eighties, started using the term Hispanic, Latino. Um, and we've been here long before then, so in, but we're still kind of creating our identity within the United States. How do you think is created already? And so how do you see us showing to the world that you don't? We've been here long before anyone else

Speaker 3:          28:53          and you know, I don't think it matters. I don't think it matters who came first because we all came from somewhere else. Yeah. Except native Americans. Every single person who lives in this country has some ancestor that comes from another place. So who came first or who came second is not that important. I think that what is important is how we sort of blend into the culture without losing our identity. And we contribute or not to court. This is this large country made of so many different colors and voices. So it is the diversity that makes the United States so, so powerful and so unique. It took country created on an idea, most emerge historically out of circumstances, geography, um, tribes that get together or not language that is common, but the United States was created with an idea and the idea of the founding fathers was very clear. And it's a country that with those ideas has been so powerful and so, so important in the world. And we tend to forget what made this country so extraordinary. The ideas, the values, the principles in which the country was built and the people who came from all over the world, all that is so important to keep going, to keep being what we are. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:28          That's inspiration on. And we're very excited to continue to build and show the world our identity from these, you know, the American dream of coming here. Um, yeah, but the American dream is not white supremacy and its diversity. No, it is all of us. Absolutely. Yeah. Um, I have one funny question then since we're here at willow. We did read question. Yes. Yes. Have you, um, have you ever googled yourself and no. No. Never googled yourself? I hadn't thought about it. One. Interesting. Maybe we should try to, would I did Google like guy? Um, yeah, that's the only time I've googled me buddy.

Speaker 3:          31:11          I was, um, I separated from my husband after 28 years of marriage. I'm in good terms. It wasn't something awful at all, but I was in a sort of dark mood because I was 73 years old and I thought the rest of my life I'll be alone sleeping alone with my dog. Not Nice.

Speaker 1:          31:30          Not that my daughter, no, no, my dog is nice. And um,

Speaker 3:          31:35          and then a guy out of the blue started emailing me

Speaker 1:          31:40          and there are a few stockers, but not many. As you get older, the stockers diminish number.

Speaker 3:          31:47          Um, I saw, he started emailing me and then I googled him. But I had a wonderful assistant, Shandra who was like, like Sherlock Holmes.

Speaker 1:          31:57          She could get in Google. And yet, I mean the brand of underwear, every everything. So by that time I met the guy five months later, I knew absolutely everything about his life, his family, his kids, his car, everything. Wow. So Google has a big dollar all the time that I have used to Google for that. Well, thank you so much. I think at this time we'd love to open up the, that will be great. The floor to questions from the audience and we'll have to Google yourself. Sometimes he won't care. So he's interesting and sometimes flattering or I'm sure with you often, I'm sure it's not flattering when you start seeing your pictures. Yes. Hi, my name Monica. And um, you used the word blend in an interesting way. Um, blend to sort of blend culturally so that um, we're, you know, we're seeing for who we are and how we are. The way that, that I've experienced blending as a Latina and trying to fit in is in contrast to how you described it. And I'd like to know, have you had experiences of trying to blend that have been at compromise or at odds to who you are?

Speaker 3:          33:19          Well, sometimes I asked to speak to Latino youth mostly who feel, who are either calm recently or they descend from Latino parents who speak Spanish at home. So it's a very Latino culture at home and they feel outside, like outsiders. They feel that they are not the blonde kid with blue eyes that is popular at school. And I keep telling them, you don't have to let go of anything. You can have everything. You can have your culture, your language, your food, your music and you can still have everything that this country offers. Why compromise for less. You can have everything and keep what is your, your roots and makes you different and special and richer. I, but because I speak two languages, I feel that I have two different visions of the world. When I read my books in translation because I have to check the translation into English, I realized that it is, that that language is like blood. So personnel, it comes with your upbringing, with your DNA. So keep it, don't, don't forget it, and just incorporate more and more and it becomes a richer life. And I, I, when I say blend, it doesn't mean that you, that you forget or renounced to who you are. Not at all. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          34:57          Hi, my name is Marissa. Uh, and yeah, thank you so much for your talk. And, um, several times you brought up letters like, uh, you know, how you, you've written to your mom and, and how you've researched, uh, people's letters from so long ago. Um, and, uh, I worked in Gmail for a while here. So you know, a lot of data privacy and things go to, uh, uh, about people's letters. But my question is about, you know, now that you have a foundation, um, and you're, and you're working with some of these groups that each person has some stories that, that they are important to, um, to our history, right? Um, how can we like empower those voices? Um, you know, do you in your foundation tell these people like, Eh, you know, even though this is something difficult, like we have to write some letters, we have to, um, make a way so that these voices are heard, you know, a hundred years from now, 200 years from now.

Speaker 3:          35:52          Well, there is a program in the United States tell your story in which they record people. They record migrants, people who go, who will come here from all over the world. And they go into this little cabin, which they record their, their story. And all of those stories are being kept somewhere and archived. So now with all the media that we have with all the inquiry, if the fact that everybody's taking selfies on, um, youtube sign, everybody's in social media, this is a huge way of recording. What, what before would be lost without the letters. You know, I think that there are three, four up photographs of me. When I was a child, no one was taking pictures to take a picture. It was a major thing. Today you take a picture of a hamburger for God, everything is recorded. We have a baby that was born in the family and the mother every single day since at least two or three pictures of the baby. I mean, I know the baby's bumped by heart. That was impossible before. So I think we, we don't have to worry about that. Their voices are being recorded better than ever.

Speaker 5:          37:03          Hi. So actually I'm, my question is kind of a continuation and what you were saying is that, um, you know, when everyone's taking a picture and everyone's a writing stuff and, and making movies, uh, then it all gets lost. So, uh, what it is that you're a piece of technology, the printing printing press 500 years ago made literature is such an important part of society and now technology is making it disappear because uh, you know, the attention spans are under two minutes were read more than ever before but only you know, half sentences or 140 characters. What are your take on where it's going in the future?

Speaker 3:          37:44          You know, I'm fairly optimistic about the future. Um, I don't think that technology will, um, will destroy culture. I think it contributes, I need, creates a new form of culture. Yeah. I think that very soon we will start filtering more the formation we get because we are overwhelmed with, with trivia and more and more, our brain gets a little bit overloaded with things that are not really important. So we will learn to handle that. It's a, it's, it's, we are in the process of change. Our brains have changed how our children are born different. When I see a three year old working in a computer, I mean playing games and I can't even turn it on. It's, it's interesting how, how humanity adapts to new forms, you know, and I'm very optimistic. I don't think that the stories will be lost or literature will disappear. We, we all need to hear stories as part of our acumen, human heritage, like music. We needed him. And you can say it's more accessible now because of the internet and you can get ebooks and have them make on you at anytime of the day. I traveled with 20 books in my iPad. That's great. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          39:09          Hi, I'm Marcus left media, like a nice to have lots of questions. But, uh, one day, I know you were saying that when you write about a specific person, a real person, um, usually go and ask him what, what happens with a big character like, uh, uh, uh, Neto, the, and about the agenda that you wrote about. I'm here all day. I know, I know. What I mean is, uh, do you, uh, do you try to do in Jerusalem under shoes and try to imagine what would they think about the way you wrote them?

Speaker 3:          39:47          I have never written about someone that, I mean tap someone like and I do that. Why that person is still alive. I'm trying to create a fictional character out of them. I don't do that. If I, if I'm writing about some awkward really exists, I stick to the, to the person, whatever the person has said I would, I would quote that person but not invent something that that person said because it would be so easy to, to prove me wrong. I like when I, usually my, my historical books are from the far past. It could be 200 years ago, a hundred years ago. I have a book about the conquest of Chile 500 years ago, but if I have someone who now I'm writing a book in which one of the characters is still alive, he's 103 years old and he's my friend and when I, I don't, I used him for the book as a character, but not with his name and I have used the information that he has given me. Ask you gave it to me. I didn't make up anything about him because he's alive. He'll be dead by the time the book is published. But still thank you. Out of respect. I mean,

Speaker 3:          41:11          hi. Um, some of the things I love about your books is how they transform me to a different time, especially in Latin America being Latin American. Um, my question is, it's been a long time since you left Chile and a lot has happened politically. What are the major changes you see when you get to go back there? Chili's and other country from the country I left, but that has happened everywhere in the world. I mean, um, I left healer 40 years ago, more than 40 years ago in 1973. And um, I left a country that was under a dictatorship living half the population living in terror and the other half, uh, very happy with what was happening with the dictatorship because they were in control. And, and uh, 17 years later, that's how long the dictatorship lasted. I went back and I found a country that still had, was a very cautious society. People didn't talk much at the time. Now everything has changed. But the, the, the fabric of the society has changed in those 17 years. Plus the world has also evolved. So Chili's and other place, I go back with this romantic nostalgic idea of the chiller I left, which was a poor sober country that was struggling to find its way in the world. And I find a totally different society that is a neo capitalist place that sort of doesn't fit my idea of Chile, but, but it's still chilly. People are the same.

Speaker 3:          42:50          So I did have one last question. Um, are you writing another book? I am. I just finished it like, well, I will finish it tomorrow. I thought I had finished it last week, but no, I will finish it tomorrow. Um, because I write in Spanish, I don't have the possibility to share the writing with anybody. And when the book is finished, I don't have anybody to show it too because my mom died and she was the one who would read the book and, and, but I showed it to my brother and then I showed it to my former editor in Simon and Schuster who speaks Spanish. But she left Simon and Schuster. So still I showed her the book and so I'm getting their input and by tomorrow I should have a clean copy of the book. And the book is, I won't say historical because it's very recent, but it starts in 1936 in the civil war in Spain and it, it ends many years later.

Speaker 3:          43:57          Well, we're very, really excited. I'm excited too because every book is like, you know, it's like like a bottle, like, like a message in a bottle that you put in the sea and you never know who's going to happen if someone is going to pick it up, if it's going to be read by someone. I have written so many books and still have that, that feeling of total uncertainty. Does it help that feeling? Because I feel like if you were, I don't know the other, I don't know what were the other in gray. I don't know that feeling.

Speaker 3:          44:35          I think we're in the same boat here at Google. We're always aspiring to be great and perfect, but like we're very excited to read guys expecting new things every day. Yeah. Which is how I feel about the writing that every book you have to invent everything again, and I try not to make the same mistakes that I've made before, but I make new ones. There's always new mistakes. Right. That's always comforting. Yeah. Well, thank you so much. He said in the end, it's been truly an honor speaking with you and your very soul. Last week we had to here to speak with everyone. Thank you very much.
