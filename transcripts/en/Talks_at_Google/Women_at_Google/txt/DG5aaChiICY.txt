Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Hello. Good morning everybody. Happy to be so great to have you here. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you for all of you. Thanks to everybody here who's joining us on video on live stream, or it's potentially watching this later. Uh, we met, we met for the first time, uh, at one of our camp events, uh, in Italy if fire her. Remember

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       that's my kind of camp. I can tell you that it was so fun. It was, it was, it was amazing. And we had,

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       there's so many interesting discussions and, uh, I think from that we had the idea of why don't you, why don't we bring you here, uh, and basically talk about some of those real, really insightful things a little bit more in public, uh, in as part of the Google public, uh, within the Google family. Um, but maybe just a little bit of an introduction about who you are. I think that most of the people here, obviously a no, you have one of the most impressive cvs that I frankly ever seen. Uh, you are the,

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       yes. Yeah, that's actually a worthwhile, that's worthwhile.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       Pause a, you're the president of rel investments, uh, in Chicago. Um, that's a big role. That's a very, very big role. Um, you are also a regular contributor and analyst for CBS News and you're very passionate advocate for financial literacy and investor education. You're sitting on the board of Estee Lauder or you're sitting on the board of star, uh, of Starbucks. Um, I was just about to say star wars.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       Okay. So this is a, you are,

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       that's actually a, that's actually funny. Maybe German humor. So you are, you are a obviously deeply involved and the George Lucas Education Foundation, a lot of, lot of different things. I could go on and on a Time magazine voted you as being one of the most influential people in the world. Uh, congratulations. Um, uh, so it's a real, really interesting, I was very lucky to have you here. Uh, but let's get going right away. Let's start. The first one is obviously a top off mind for all of us. You've heard me talk about it quite a bit or leadership team. Uh, I have to address it. The US presidential election.

Speaker 3:          00:02:11       How do we move forward from here? Well, I think two people that I admire very much. I have said it very well. So one, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, um, I think we're both very elegant and eloquent in their statements after the election that the people have spoken. We have a democracy and we all have to respect the outcome of a democracy. This is how the system works despite if the end result is one that makes you excited and happy or one that doesn't it. Um, I think that's sad. Clearly there are some tremendous, uh, dissension and a d there was tremendous division in this country right now that it's hard to mess. It's particularly hard to miss when you're a woman, a person of color, a Muslim and immigrants. Um, we are in a new day for us. Some people are calling it civil rights 2.0 and while I respect the decision, I do and I hope with everything in my heart for the best, um, I think we have to, um, recognize that we all have a role in making this better no matter what side you were on.

Speaker 3:          00:03:23       And recognize the troubles that exist in our country right now. It's just factual. This is not speculation. And that's everything from protesters who are exercising their first amendment rights to free speech to um, what we've seen in terms of some of the things happening. Um, in terms of cabinet picks on the, like this is the process and together we're going to have to come up with a better solution. And I'm not saying that with rose colored glasses and not trying to buy the pie in the sky about it. Um, I think America is best when we're at our worst. And so I'm hoping this will be one of our moments.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       So we obviously have to respect, you said that a democratic process and we have to respect that there are many people who obviously, uh, exercise their political choice, their freedom to do that. And, and, and in a sense of full inclusion, we obviously do this and we do this at Google as well, but what would you say to the people who, for the good reasons you mentioned, are actually really concerned at the moment? Like what would you say specifically?

Speaker 3:          00:04:21       It's been what I've been telling myself. So, um, I was very sad. I mean last week we had the 30th anniversary of our mutual fund, the day after the election, we were like, what is wrong with us, right that we picked this day. So we had all the press coming in and everything. We had all of these, we had hundreds of people that were coming to Chicago for this event. And all morning I'm sitting at my desk weeping, you know, like, pull yourself together, pull yourself together. And I wasn't weeping for myself. I was weeping for stories that I was being told to have. One of our, uh, women in our firm, her sister was a teacher in an inner city school in Chicago and she said the kids were going up to eight year old kids saying like eight year old Hispanic kid sang. So I guess you have to move.

Speaker 3:          00:05:05       And my heart was so sad. I mean, it's still, I can barely speak those words without, you know, feeling, feeling awful. Um, and I thought, what would it be like to be eight years old and feel that level of insecurity? I have felt that before. And so knowing that level of insecurity would exist for a child and how that destabilizes you and how it leaves a mark. That was something that really affected me. But what someone said to me that completely forced me to snap out of it is many of us, not just people of Color, black, Hispanic, Muslim, Jewish. We can go through all, you know, Italian immigrants, Irish immigrants, we can go through everything when it comes to America, our answers, ancestors dealt with much worse with less. Yeah, that much less than we come at these problems with. And when they were dealt, you know, horrible blows.

Speaker 3:          00:05:55       They got up and so said, our goal right now, we must get up. This is not a time to wallow and be overly, overly emotional. This is a time to recognize what is at hand. This is a time for us all to stand for what we believe in. And I, I, I, I respect the other rat other sides, right? To believe in that too. And hopefully to find, that's my mentor. Bill Bradley would say, you're better angels that we can find our better selves in this situation. And, and I really do believe that with us all taking that stand and being vocal around the core values of America, a country built on inclusion. I went back and read, I have the constitution and my purse. I know that sounds really, I was reading it on a flight. I was like, I just want to go back.

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       And someone gave me a little copy of the constitution. I found it and I said, I need to reread it to remember what we stand for. Then I went and looked up the statue of Liberty or liberty, giving your, you know, your poor, your huddled masses, et cetera. When you read these words, you know what America is all about. And I am just confident that even those of us who may have voted, um, with Donald Trump, president elect Trump and I again, I respect the office. Um, I hope that they will understand what, what is that risk in terms of what America is?

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       Yeah. It's, um, it's a touching or your tired, your huddled masses. Look, I were fully respectful if everybody who was voted the other way. Um, obviously, uh, I mean, I had this mentioned the story with your kid. I had my four year old walk up to me and he knows that he's the only American in the family. And he basically said, well, I'm the only American in the family. Uh, it seems like you have to leave. I will still miss you. And he was crying. Yeah. But he was, but he was, but he was crying and shaking when he said that. Right. And, and, um, like just, it even happens to, to like somebody like me, although, yeah. So, um,

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       and I think, you know, there are moments and society has those moments over and over again. You know, Rahm Emanuel, my mayor from Chicago is very famous for that line. You know, you can't let a crisis go to waste. You know, a crisis becomes an opportunity and we have to use this crisis. I think we could come out of this better, stronger, faster, something like we've never been before. I think it will unite people in ways that we have never been United as we stand up for Truth and justice. And I mean truth when I, I'm, I'm so happy to read and see all the things that are coming out of silicon valley right now about making sure fake news doesn't exist and making sure untruths can't be perpetuated to become truths. Now. The thing that I think the challenge for all of us right now, and I do think it happened a little bit in the election, we can't normalize and justice, you know, that's what I'm worried about. We can't become so numb to these issues, seeing hate seeing these moments that you just sort of walk them off.

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       And we're seeing early instances of this with some of the hate crimes rising and aggression rising and bullying rising a little bit. And so, so although there, there have been clear statements that people should stop doing that. Right. But, but still, yeah. Well, you know, I hope from war. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, okay. Let's hope for more. Let's talk about, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:09:15       but we all have to do our part. You know, we have a role. We are not bystanders anymore. Yes. So, you know, we all have voices. Absolutely. You all are best at it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       Yes. Uh, yes. Um, let's move on to another super important subject. And when you have referred to the subject of race as a conversational third rail, could you explain that a little bit more?

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       Yeah. What do you know what I mean by that is in a lot of conversations when race comes up, it's one of those things that is like you, you know, you've stepped on the electric rail on the train car and did their shock, you know, and there's this sense of, of it's a taboo subject even in this day and time where we see race so prominently figured into our headlines. It's still this very uncomfortable conversation. And, um, I'm asking people to actually embrace the uncomfortable, to become comfortable with the uncomfortable and to be willing to step on this third rail in conversation and everyday life. And I think to the extent that we do that, we will find new ways to understand each other. And I think that it will lead to heightened levels of tolerance and inclusion. And so even though it is the third rail, there's certain things we'll all taught not to talk about.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       You know, you don't talk about money, you don't talk about religion, you don't talk about race. These are things that when you're growing up, you know, there can be fighting words there. I'm saying not talking about it has somewhat put us into the situation that we're in and we have to actually, uh, subject matter that I'm talking a lot about. Also be brave. We have to be brave and go there on this subject. And in going there, I think it will lead to great moments of enlightenment just like now and both sides. They help us. Can you give us a side? Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:01       Yeah. Give us a few examples from your own life. I mean we talked about this quite a bit. I know you, you, you, you've really helped me understand a lot deeper and they're things that just have happened to you and that are part of your life that are, are, are very, very hard to understand. Uh, especially for non black people. So, so, so,

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       oh, the one I led in my ted talk that I just have to give because it's the one it's so easy, is Harold Board, who was a congressman in Tennessee, was running for us Senate at a time when obviously the Senate and still is not very diverse, the a hundred senators we have. And so he called me one day, we're contemporaries were peers and he said, I need to get some national press. Can you help me? So I had a friend who was vice chairman of one of the largest media firms in the world. Yes. And I called her and I asked her if, um, she might have some ideas for Harold and what we can do when she said, let me host a editorial board for you with all of our people. And she's like, it doesn't get better than this. So we were, and she said, you come with him because you're from the business world and you give them a different kind of credibility than just pure politics, even though Harold is phenomenal, you know, and impressive in every way.

Speaker 3:          00:12:09       So Harold and I meet in New York, we'd get to this building. We're so excited. We literally, I told this story many times, I'm literally wearing like my best suit and you know, he, we looked like starched and pressed and we get there and we walk in and we get to the receptionist and the receptionist, we get to the floor and she tells us, follow us, you know, we said, we're here for the lunch, we follow her, we follow her through all these corridors, et cetera. And we finally end up in this room and it's just completely blank. And she looks at us and she said, where are your uniforms? And we were like, and she thought we were the waiters. And so we said, we're here for the lunch. He's the gas. And the person who was hosting us runs into the room because we've obviously been announced that were there and she realizes we're not where we should be.

Speaker 3:          00:12:58       And literally as I explained this, the, the white drains from her face, I mean, literally all the color Janes from her face. And she looks at me and she's, you know, at a loss for words. And I joke back with her, I said, don't you think we need more than one black US senator? It doesn't this prove it. Yes. You know, that this person can't even see us in another way. And interestingly, if you watch that Ted talk, I'm wearing a black and white dress, white color, black dress, white cuffs, and I called it my uniform. Yes. Now it happens to be Valentino. But the idea was to, you know, really sort of say, how is it, do we get so stereotyped where you can't see beyond that story is one of hundreds that people like making share. It's all the time meetings where someone won't make eye contact with me, you know, a plane rides.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       We just had something very recently, I was on a private plane and the, um, the person on the ramp kept saying, you know, ma'am, your catering is not here. And I said, okay. You know, it was like, all right. And he said, um, you know, you need to go and get your catering right now from the, you know, the building. And it was like, uh, she does that, you know, like talking, finding to the flight attendant. And he's like, no ma'am, you're not listening to me. You're catering is not hearing. You need to go and get it. So the pilots now come out, the flight attendant comes out and literally I'm the only black person amongst the four. And I'm like, they do that. I don't, and he looks at me with such disbelief, you know, it's like, well, you can't be the person on this plane. It's just not possible. And I, you know, we all sit there and there was nothing to say, you know, it wasn't his, his, it wasn't, I wasn't angry with them. I just was, why couldn't it be me? How, how does it make you

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       feel over time? I had quite a few discussions with our black cougar a network and, and they told me the stories about, uh, being singled out more frequently as part of the normal security controls when people are coming in. Right. I mean at a higher likelihood if you're a black, uh, you were being asked, can I please, can you please show your your badge. Um, I heard from them the second they leave the Google environment, the hopefully slightly safer, uh, environment in that context. The probability of them being stopped by a cop and even feeding aggression and being afraid to significantly higher than for any, any non Black Cobra. So they taught, they taught me the word [inaudible] [inaudible] which is a term I wasn't really familiar with before off microaggressions. And I'm a hoe wears you down and hotel like over time. How do you feel? Like how does it, what do you think it can do? What does it do for you? How, what you found to protect yourself. Why like help help me understand the emotions behind that.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       So the emotions are very clear. One, and I've explained this to people for years. Black kids are taught this is going to happen to us. We are taught this when we're very young. When I was seven years old, my mother explained to me that everyone would not treat me well. Seven now that was also at the same time she told me that

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       crossing the, the, the non black we are, it's really important that you're taught, you're being taught and, and everybody is being,

Speaker 3:          00:16:12       we were taught how to deal with police. We're taught to how to deal with people of authority. We're taught this and that goes back for generations. I mean obviously you had black kids who were told never look a white person in the eye in during slave times. So Emmett till died because he supposedly whistled at a white woman. You know, I don't know if it's true or not. So that goes back into our history. We are, we are armed for what we are going to deal with. And I mean that in the best of ways. I appreciate our parents and mothers and fathers for doing that for us because there is no surprise there isn't. So in terms of micro aggressions, we know there will exist because we're told very early and we've seen them, we've seen how our parents have been treated. That then becomes not to be, you know, defeated by it. So when you said, how does it affect me emotionally, et Cetera, I actually become stronger. I become more clear about my place in the world. I become more certain about what role I must serve. I become more emphatic about being brave myself on top of it's like this about race. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       What helped you? Who helped you? How, how, how, how do you manage to turn this negative energy, this, this tension, this additional layer of stress on a black person's life into this?

Speaker 3:          00:17:25       I definitely, I guess I'm one of these people, you know, partly glass half full, not being, you know, a rose colored glasses as I said before, but just like, how can I use this to my advantage? So I'll give you one example. In the investment business, there aren't a ton of black women in the investment business. Uh, there are few. I probably am the only black woman chair by mutual fund board in the United States, only one. There are thousands and they're more than mutual than there are stocks in the New York Stock Exchange. So I remember going to lots of investment conferences when I first started working at air wheel and I would go to investment conferences and people would come up to me and they're like, you're a melody. And I was like, how do they know my main? And then it very calm, very clear to me.

Speaker 3:          00:18:04       I was like, I'm the only black person here and there'd be hundreds of people in the room. So I was like, I'm melody like Beyonce or share one word person. Like I don't even need a last name. And I was like, I am using those to my advantage. So it's like instead of seeing it, it's like I'm the only one here. It's like I can stand out in such a big way and then feel like I'm melody. I'm like, yes with two L's, you know, you know. So owning it now I want more people in that room who looked like me and I'm working really hard to make that happen, but I'm not going into that room afraid or defeated. No, I don't also need swagger. As someone said to me once, they said, they said this about me and I thought it was an interesting comment.

Speaker 3:          00:18:50       They said, you're not threatened and you're nonthreatening. And I was like, that's a fine balance because a lot of times, you know, you have to come on really big in order to, you know, feel secure or you're, you make yourself really small in order to fit in. And I've tried not to do either of those, but when I've been in those situations, I just said, okay, here's the situation. What am I going to do about it? And it can serve me very, very well. No, I don't believe in standing on some platform being excited about being first and only, I don't think that's a good thing, you know, in our community, in minority communities first and only is something that people brag about, you know, and they want to be first and only for a long time. I'm not that way. I want to be first of many, at the very least.

Speaker 3:          00:19:37       But, um, you know, I think that instead of being defeated by you have to ask yourself, you know, for the same time, which my mother did something genius. On the one hand she told me what to expect. On the other hand, she told me you can be anything. And I believed her. She was like, this is going to happen too. I remember going home when I was in second grade and I told my mother I had first grade, I had this teacher that I just did not like and she did not like me and I really, I was like sick going to school. I couldn't stand it and it was chaotic and she wasn't nice to me. And I remember saying to my mother, I said, my teacher is not being nice to me and I think it's because I'm black. While I was the only black girl in the class and my mother looked at me and she says, I never want to hear that from you again.

Speaker 3:          00:20:20       Ever get over it. Life is not fair. There was no, Oh, let me go to the school and shake it up. Let me do this. That near there. It was like, get over it. I was in first grade, so on the one hand, you know, she was making that clear, but she was like, you can't use this as an excuse. Step over it, step over it, find another way. But you can't come and complain to me about this, the world not being fair, because that is the world that we live in. And that's a fantastic message to, in some ways it's, it's very, very pragmatic and probably more unvarnished truth. And you maybe you should give a five or six or seven year old. Yeah. But at the same time it's also inspirational and saying nothing's holding you back, but you, you know, your mind can be the one to hold you back on this issue. Yeah. Proof or wrong. Get the answers right.

Speaker 2:          00:21:14       You, I have a quote here that I heard from you, uh, be unapologetically black and unapologetically

Speaker 3:          00:21:22       a woman. It's not an original idea, so I'll have to tell you that. Yeah. I learned it from, uh, John Johnson, who was the founder of Ebony and jet magazines. One of the most successful American entrepreneurs of all time, his funeral. So were at his funeral in Rockefeller Chapel in Chicago. Literally thousands of people literally does, you know, probably two dozen eulogies. And it was one of those things where you sat down and you see the list of all the Lila gs and you're like, oh my God, this is going to be a really long morning. But every eulogy is better than the next one. And it's like President Clinton, it's, you know, just the most amazing people. So he has, um, Tom Joiner, who's a very famous disc jockey in the black community called the fly jack because he used to fly every single day to do two shows, one in Dallas and one in Chicago every day for years.

Speaker 3:          00:22:14       So Tom Joiner, who's very, very well known in my community, got up and did the eulogy and he used to work for John Johnson at his radio station called Wj PC Johnson publishing company. And Tom Joyner said John Johnson was unapologetically black. And I literally, it was like someone threw cold water on me. Like I was like, this idea is profound. I know it doesn't maybe seem that way to you. And I was like unapologetically black and I said, imagine being unapologetically back. I immediately thought about it and I said, that's exactly what I want to be. I want to be unapologetic genetically black and I want to be unapologetically a woman because I find even though I had this mother to told me I can be anything, there are times I'm apologizing for who I am in the smallest of ways. So I'll give you a little example.

Speaker 3:          00:23:02       I was at an investment conference speaking to another woman, my business partner who started aerial, John Rogers walked up to the conversation. The woman and I were talking and we were literally talking about close 100% and some dress. I was wearing something she was wearing and we were going back and forth about how we loved it, et Cetera. He walks up, we're still talking about it and she says, Oh, I'm so sorry this topic subject must really bore you. We can talk about something else. And I said, no. I said, how many times have we walked up? Two guys talking about like the hockey game from last night. They didn't apologize to us about talking about the hockey game or something we totally weren't interested in. Yeah. And we sat there and you know, they went on with their conversation. We waited until they were done. Why are we apologizing to him?

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       And he's like, wow, melody. Okay. You know, it's just a little strong. But it was the exact point. It's like this idea of apologizing. I remember I went to a board meeting once. This one's small, I swim. One of the things I do, so went to go go swimming before this meeting, not one of the boards I'm on where we were representing. Um, we were pitching business for Ariel and I walk in, my hair is slicked and one of the people looks at me and they said, what happened to our girl? And I started into this thing where I was like, oh, I went swimming this morning and this, that. I'm like, wait a minute, you're wearing Nike's and uh, you know, a sweatshirt and Khakis with stains. Why am I apologizing to you right now about coming in with flip tear? I know that may sound really small, but we see it sort of time and time again that it shows up in our lives and we have to remind ourselves they're not apologizing. They were showing up as who they are owning and an embracing it. And so when I heard that comment about John Johnson, I was like, it was life changing for me. And I said, that's what I want to be. I said that to Cheryl. And Cheryl says in, in lean in, and one of the opening statements, my friend Melody said this to me, looks at Facebook.

Speaker 3:          00:25:03       Yes, you know her. Um, but it's just, you know, it had a follow on effect. And so again, I can't take credit for it, but I can take credit for embracing it and saying, I'm taking that message out into the world because that's a big idea.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       So you take an amazingly important message all to the world openly talking about race, openly talking about diversity. There is a better business angle to this. I'm the business representative in a way of Google and actually deeply believe in this. But I'd love to hear an and my teams. I've heard from me many, many times about it. Why? Why do you think that diversity actually matters from a pure business person?

Speaker 3:          00:25:38       And that's the thing. This is not the people of Color's problem. This is everyone's problem because this is about enlightened self interest. This is you're your own best opportunity is leverage through having someone like me and others like me around you. For this reason, there's a book that I love called the difference by Scott Paige Scott Pages at the University of Michigan and he wrote a mathematical formula for diversity. And his point, which again I talk about in my ted talk, is that if you are trying to solve a really hard problem hard, you want diversity of thought, diversity of experiences and diversity of intellect in that room. The example that he gives is the, the um, smallpox epidemic that was ravaging Europe. The best scientists in the world were brought together to try to solve the problem. They were stumped. People were dying. And the person who led them to solution was a dairy farmer who recognize that the nope maintenance, we're not getting small pox.

Speaker 3:          00:26:35       So smallpox vaccine, the smallpox vaccine is a bovine based vaccine. Because of that dairy farmer, no, he couldn't develop the formula for the vaccine, but he could lead them to sell the solution through his own observation, which is very different than the scientists who were sitting in the room with the best training and the best, uh, pedigrees. [inaudible] spent so much time on a form ever, right? Yeah. Probably we keep, we don't know. We can't know. But the point being is in solving a real hard problem. They had this person, they'll maybe the science, this farmer was a genius. I don't know. But he did notice something and, and noticing it led to the outcome. So what I tell people, when you think about a room you want to ask yourself is everyone in the room is every or all the people who wreck, who can help me solve this really hard problem?

Speaker 3:          00:27:20       I give the example of a friend of mine who was the editor of a major city newspaper that was celebrating one of the two anniversaries. It was selling burning the hundred and 50th year of this city and the editor of this newspaper had put two of the best reporters in the city on a task them with doing a special pullout section on this anniversary hundredth anniversary, excuse me, of the city, and it was a very diverse city and the special section was finished. They threw it on his desk and just like in a fluke there running the presses, printing it, he opened it up and he starts going through it, going through it, going through it, and the entire, this, this majority minority city had a special edition on its hundredth anniversary, would not one person of color in the entire pullout section. And he said, what went wrong?

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       He said, these are two great reporters. They are two good people. They have no malice against anyone. They couldn't see these other things. So he came up with the saying that I love so much. He says, is everyone in the room? And it's a very simple idea to check yourself on diversity and inclusion is everyone in the room. So I have everyone here that it can help me to solve this. And I can tell you in our world of picking stocks, which is hard, we're picking stocks that are undervalued, that something's broken. You want everyone in the room to push sides of it. You know, we have a a democratic leader at Ariel Ceo, I'm more democratic than not a president, but one of our senior most people has a book about an culture on his desk. And you would say like how do those worlds come together?

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       Well we want those ideas. We want everyone's perspective. And that's cause he's a fan of the book was there. And that's until you'd say, well how is that possible? It's possible because we said we're inviting that into our life. And ultimately I think that's led to this cassette success of our investment portfolio. So it is in your own interest to invite those differences. And it's not just race, it is religion, it is diversity of thought. It is different schools, even different political views, different political. It's all of it because the, even the political views can shape things. You know, it's interesting in the investment world, obviously policy can affect companies. We all know this, it good, but regulation, et Cetera. And if you hold a point of view very as we like to say it, Ariel dearly, you in our world, you have to hold an idea lightly used to be able to change your mind because new information comes to you that may force you to change your mind about the investment that you've made.

Speaker 3:          00:30:01       When you hold it dearly, you're working really hard to prove that you can write and you can lose a lot of money like that. Until the interesting thing about political perspectives, views on regulatory views, on politics, et Cetera, can actually, in fact you're thinking, okay, so you want someone pushing from the other side, um, and bolt all sides. Yes. Um, that, that is helpful to us to make, to allow us to make better decisions. When you're picking companies to invest in, you want all the information you possibly can have and you want to try to make the most unbiased decision that you can make. And that is knowing that we all from the world of behavioral finance, we all have biases that we've worked really hard to overcome and sometimes can't overcome it all, which is also true of life. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       So talking about everybody in the room. I mean we have our own challenges here in the Silicon Valley, uh, as we know, I mean we have women in leadership positions, but not nearly enough. We have women in stem positions, but not nearly enough. We have a women on very prestigious boards, but not nearly enough. Like what can we do about it? What, how can we be better at it? What? What are we still missing?

Speaker 3:          00:31:04       Right. Your card. We're trying hard trying. You don't get points for trying. Yes, exactly. No, it's like there are no, you know, you know what? You remember you were a kid and you in math they would say, sure you're working with give you extra credit even though your answer was wrong. That's not how it works in real life. We know that it just doesn't work that way. You don't get extra credit for showing your work. Yes. Remember when we were talking about sales quotas? Just a little reminder to everybody. You have to make your numbers. Well, it's interesting. I'll give my own time. I told my team this morning, we're doing budgets. I was sitting with our CFO here in San Francisco yesterday for hours and hours working on 2017 and I miss my numbers this year in terms of new business coming into Ariel. So I told the team on the phone, I said, I own that is what I'm telling you right now. I get no raise, nothing. I said, because I said that's not going to happen to you, but it didn't happen. It doesn't matter how many flights I took, how hard I work, it does not matter. When I go in front of that board, I'm going to tell them I did not make that number and that number was aggressive, but I, I put the number on the page.

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       So if you could give us advice, what should we do better? What are

Speaker 3:          00:32:09       we demanded? So this is the point. Google is huge. Let's just do one small thing. What if every vendor that you worked with you at the ask them about their board diversity, do you think that would get their attention? That will give their attention? Yes. And we have a lot of the amount of money that you spend. Yes. If you say we want to work with companies that have diverse boards, we want to ask you some questions about your board diversity as we look at approving your contract. Yes. Even if you don't have enforcement, having asked the yes, we would have this ripple effect. And then if you asked the question, apple would ask the question if apple has the question.

Speaker 2:          00:32:46       But you know what the great thing is about us talking here. I actually run the largest vendor operations at Google. I can control this. Alan and Manuel, I hope you're watching on video, right? This, this is right away. Go out with and ask them like literary, I controlled it. It's my budget. Do it. Write literary. Do it. Let's just do it. Let's see how easy and literally asking a question. Yes, it's a great, great more ideas to come on here. We are actually that's,

Speaker 3:          00:33:16       I mean you all are colleagues with people throughout Silicon Valley. Yes. And you can influence them in terms of talking about what you're doing and what you're standing up for. The thing that amazes me, you've got iconic leaders here globally iconic and Larry and Sergey, Eric, Eric and I sat on a board together. Now your new CEO. So I did, I mean you got it here. The amount of influence those people have just by asking questions and raising this issue with peers. Clearly leading by example and you've done that with you know, your woman, CFO, a woman treasurer. I mean there's so many things happening here that are so good in so many ways and obviously coming from behind. So I'm not going to make this into you know, utopia yet, but there has been an effort and there has been some signs of effective change. Obviously Cheryl was here who casts a big profile in the technology space and she was born here in some ways. So there, there is a legacy of success that you can lean on but then leverage, which I think is so interesting and, and I think that if you were to do that because of your leadership place in the world, it just would have all these knock on the facts. Yes. So

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       I had to, I had a Google of recently challenged me and said, Phil, you meet basically every CEO in the world, probably the relevancy or at one point, uh, just during your normal job, do you actually talk to them about diversity or do you challenge them and ask them how they think about diversity? And I have to say that's not what I've done so far and thought that was a great idea, actually

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       think about how much wealth has been created here, which we know and how generous Googlers are and they're giving to hospitals, universities, etc. Imagine if Googlers, as they were donating money, ask questions about the diversity of those institutions, which are some of the biggest institutions in the world and the most prominent ones. Imagine if huge Stanford donors, we're asking these questions about, you know, if Stanford started asking their vendors about diversity, but Googlers sent on the Stanford Board, you know, this has a ripple effect. You've hospitals that are giant, you know, it's not just in, in, in pockets. You know, if you are about diversity it in what you do as, as you live in this world, you don't compartmentalize this issue.

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       Yes, great idea. Great. Great ideas. Thank you. Um, well we should actually go on and move. I'm watching time here because I promised everybody time for, for, for the, the Q and a. But I have to ask you about, um, and we could've gone on this subject for him and we'll spend more, uh, we'll spend more time on those ideas as well. Um, dreamworks, Jeffrey Katzenberg, uh, which I think everybody here knows well, um, has referred to you as the Jeffrey whisperer. You just sit, you sat on their board. Um, so you have a very close relationship, a amazing experience. Um, how did this actually shape your own experience of how you do things, how you run things, what you've learned from the laughing?

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       Because we sold the company this summer. Yes, we officially closed in the beginning of the fall. And Jeffrey, I talked to Jeffery more now than I've ever talked to him. And then that last, you know, couple of years of dreamworks as Chair, I pretty much talked to him multiple times a week now. I talked to Jeffrey Multiple Times a day and um, Jeffery has had a dramatic impact on my life in a good way. But dreamworks in general, that Board Room was one of these board rooms and talk about walking into, I called it moguls are us. When I got there, you know, one of my friends said he didn't put together a board. He cast it. Nathan Myhrvold said best, and if you know Nathan Nathan from intellectual ventures, but before that Microsoft, Nathan was on the board as well. And so the board when you walked in was Paul Allen, Nathan, David Gaffen, Meg Whitman, Howard Schultz. Jeffrey and me and I was like, Oh my God, I'm the scrub.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       Like, like this is like crazy. This is, you know, the most amazing thing. We went to dinner once a day that Gavin's house and I said, and David is one of my dear friends, I love him so much and he's, he's one of the truth tellers to me. Like he hits me right between the eye with truth and he does not allow me to be intellectually dishonest with myself. And I so appreciate that about him. But we went to his house once for dinner, first dinner, you know, when the first centers in David lives in this unbelievably beautiful house, like one of the most beautiful houses I've ever seen. And I've seen some pretty houses. So we walk into the house and I was like, oh my God, this is like one of the most beautiful houses I've ever seen. You know, and I'm like, like, like a running chatter.

Speaker 3:          00:37:51       And I'm like, it's so beautiful. And I'm literally looking at MAG and Paul and I'm like, isn't this house really pretty? And they're looking at me and all of a sudden I'm like, wait a minute, you all have really beautiful houses. I was like, I'm the one who changed. So, so it was one of those things of, you know, sort of being in this room and what Jeffrey did for me and Roger and Rico was the chair that I will never forget is I was a peer of everyone in that room. I was equal. Roger Enrico called me one day and I, it really taught me about how to treat people. We were early in the board, having been a started the company, it just IPO and he called me one day and he said, hey melody, now this is the former and CEO of Pepsi. We manage money for Pepsi at Ariel.

Speaker 3:          00:38:39       So it's like, you know, this is the big boss, you know, this is my client. He calls me and he says, hey melody, it's Roger. Roger have just passed away very recently in the last year, which was very sad. And I said Hi. And I remember being a little nervous and I like stood up, you know, to make sure I'm like just, you know, be your best self. And I was like, hi. And he's like, hey, just calling to check in. And I was like, I'm thinking to myself like, what am I supposed to say? You know, it's like, what? Check in. He's like, what's going on? I was like, nothing. Like Oh really? I was like think of something to say. So he would call like once a month and just do that. And what I thought was really great, he just wanted me to feel comfortable and as included as everyone else, he probably worked overtime on me then.

Speaker 3:          00:39:31       I don't think he was causing a call meg every month to check in. But I think he was just saying, I want her to come into this room. And Jeffery would always say your eye, you know, your ideas are as good as anyone else's. I want the ideas. And I wasn't afraid, but it was interesting. I mean, you literally are in a room with capsules of vendor street, and this is, you know, 15 years ago, this isn't melody today, this is melody at 32 you know, walking into a room. So it was something that was a gift. And so I give Jeffrey a lot of credit for that because I saw what it was like to be a peer, which was so different than all we're talking about when you're in rooms with microaggressions where people make you feel differently. Yes. So then when Roger was no longer chair, Nathan went to Jeffrey and said melody as chair.

Speaker 3:          00:40:16       And I was like shocked. He's like, she's earned it. And she's the person who should be chair. And she's the one who we have the most faith and confidence in. So again, it's the people in the room, you're thinking, well, they've picked me. No, I did always made sure I did all my homework. I showed up, you know, really ready to go, et cetera. But from Jeffrey, I learned about what it was like to see people for not anything that comes in packaging purely on ideas and the merit of those ideas, purely not to be an influence about anything else. And two, and then Jeffrey and I had a constant conversation and what I joke with with Jeffery, I said, I am Jeffery's head deflator of gravity boots because this is a guy with a million ideas a minute. And sometimes I've just take a pen, a pen and stick it in and his head just Tryna shrivels up.

Speaker 3:          00:41:03       And other times I have to like keep them down on the earth like Jeffrey, stay with us so we're losing you. Um, and it became this wonderful working relationship that Greg gave me. Great Joy. I was, I was so sad when dreamworks was over because I loved the work. Talking relationships. You were raised by a single mother, Dorothy. Um, talk a little bit about this experience. There was something very special about it. Well, my mom was, I was one of six kids. I'm really young relative to my siblings. My oldest sister is more than 20 years older than me. My siblings continually told me that I was left on the doorstep and that really wasn't their sister. Um, and that's very weird when you're like five years old and the person telling you is 27. Um, uh, but ultimately they were great. Um, five girls, one boy and my mother, I already given you a sense of this brutal pragmatism that she had.

Speaker 3:          00:41:59       Um, she was very impractical in every way you could possibly imagine. Like she would buy Easter dresses instead of pay the phone bill. So we always got evicted and our lights got disconnected and our phone got turned off all the time. Our cars got repossessed. And that was talking about that sense of insecurity. I felt that I think about when I think of that Hispanic kid thing saying, so you have to move. Um, but at the same time she was great. And one of the things that I think that has come through with my mother is that she did give me great optimism and hope I was never downtrodden. I may not have had things and I may have had some serious setbacks along the way. Um, but I was not down tried and she did not have, let me accept that idea. And you know, I once heard Magic Johnson say, um, you can be poor, but you don't have to have poor dreams. And I was like, I think my mother sort of intuitively understood that, you know, during some of our more challenging time, she always had these fantastical dreams. She was totally unrealistic and a lot of ways

Speaker 2:          00:42:52       to share those dreams with, oh my God, my mother, my mother was

Speaker 3:          00:42:55       blind at the end of, of starting when I was in high school. She went blind every single day. My, I mean, my mother was blind, but she would not acknowledge it. And she, every single day she was like, oh no, I'm going to be healed now. I mean, she would literally, she was blind. She was like, no, I'm going to wake up tomorrow and see tomorrow. I'm going to be able to see tomorrow, every day. Like, what kind of faith is that? Right? Every day, you know, she was blind from when I was in high school until she died, you know, four years ago. So that's a long time everyday, oh, tomorrow I'm going to be able to see. And we're just like, no. But you know, you don't want to take that away from someone, you know, at the same time. Hope and faith, I'm very important. You know, that you don't play around with someone's optimism. And I learned that. That's inspiring.

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       Okay. We want to go to the questions. Um, we just to just end on a lighthearted question. You, you're, you're married to a, let's say a star wars fan. Um, uh, you're, you're actually, um, I always say I'm married to Yodas Dad, dad married to so and so. Um, how, how it doesn't go backwards. How does this, I mean, how does this feel? You actually, um, I, um, when it was sold the last time, I actually realized that you're actually a character in one of the movies. Um, not the movies, the television. Yes, yes, yes. That's, yes, that's, that's correct. Talk to us a little bit about how this, how this fields, and by the way, there's a big value piece in this

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       as well as well. And, and that's something I actually only realized by interacting with you and George A. Little bit more is just talk to us a little bit about like this part of your life. Well, I have to say it's a crazy part in so many ways and it's fantastic. Um, George is iconic, you know, he's known around the world wherever we go, you know, literally we walked down the street, people are wearing star wars tee shirts. Um, we, um, it's a part of society in the world, you know, the sayings, the, you know, there's so many examples. Um, and we'd literally, we joke and bring them into our lives all the time. You know, it's just so funny. Um, which is really, really great. Um, my husband knows I'm always like a hawk around like commuting desserts and things like that, cause they say, you know, he's much older than me and I was like, I need 20 years, so I've got to get you to live 20 years.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       So they're like, he'll have an ice cream cone. And he's like, this is not the ice cream you're looking for. You know? And he's like, starts to of convinced me that I didn't see a meeting, nice cream or would have you. But the thing you know that he, when he set out to write star wars, he wrote it to teach 12 year old girls and boys values. And it's a story about following light versus darkness. And he says very clearly that in the movies the darkness can give you more power. The dark side can have more power. We've seen that with the emperor and Darth Vader and it can et cetera. But the light will bring you more joy. And he's very, very clear about that in life of the pursuit of joy over power and the, the certainly the pursuit of joy over pleasure. You know, he talks about, and he's told me a lot about pleasure being fleeting and joy being permanent, that when you seek pleasure, you always have to up the ante, which is why drug addicts become drug addicts.

Speaker 3:          00:46:16       They need another level. We see that with people with great wealth. It's like another car or another boat, another house. You're always trying to up the ante. And he's like, the thing about life, it's the pleasure that stays with you don't need to up the ante on pleasure because it's in you watching a child grow up or smile or some of these things that are really just sort of deeply in you, memories that you know that will bring you joy forever. And so that's been something that, especially in this time today, I've been thinking a lot about are we going to go to the darkness? Are we going to go to the light? And the delight, the darkness may being bring power. And we're certainly seeing that. But the light will bring joy. You know, I still, if you don't even like Barack Obama, you can't look at him and not see light.

Speaker 3:          00:46:59       You may not like a thing he says, a policy that he has, but there's an elegance and lightness to him that is inspiring that you would like your child to have. And so I think about that. Not a lot. And it's not about he, he lifts us us as opposed to putting us down. Yeah. And you know, again, that is something that means a lot to me and it means a lot to me now that I have a three year old, I want those examples and George tapped into that. That's why it's gone on for 40 years. That's why people keep going back to the stories because there's such depth there to them and he has, he's teaching us in those movies. He's teaching us a lot. And you know, I tell people, I've learned, I know more stories. There's facts and you could possibly ever imagine I'd probably have the largest collection of star wars tee shirts of any person walking, watching, walking the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:47:44       Because every day, every week, George gets everything that has ever been made with star wars on it once a week that week. So the archives are gigantic and he brings home all the things that he thinks will like. But in, in, in doing this, he's explained so many things to me about what he was thinking. For example, with Yoda, Yoda talks backwards because he said he was trying to teach 12 year olds and if Yoda said everything he says directly it was preachy. So he said if I turned it around the kid had to listen and untangle it. So it forced them to listen in a different way. So when you hear do or do not, there is no try. It doesn't offend you. Yeah. Versus how it may have come across. If you say, you know, try, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       you don't think about this level of depth and thinking at the time this was basically created,

Speaker 3:          00:48:29       well there's nothing accidental and star wars. That's the thing about it, and this is the piece which I find fascinating, like Yoda is the dimensions of a two year old. And the reason that that is true, the face we are cutest. A human being is the cutest they ever are between the ages of two and three. And that is actually for a reason. They say you have the terrible twos. This has been studied. George has lots of facts on that. Children are so awful between two and three that if they weren't cute we would kill them. And when you think back to caveman times, so they made them so cute so you couldn't kill them. So he said he actually intentionally made Yoda all the dimensions of a two year old. He's an 800 year old, two year old to make him so cute. All of his eyes, the spatial dimensions, nothing is accidental. Nothing. He's like thought it through to another level that you would never imagine. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:22       Okay. I'll be cute. Does of two year olds. We have a few minutes left. Maybe we can go a couple of minutes over, uh, on the question. So I want to get started right away. We have our doors here. Uh, let's start. Animated movies are lagging behind as far as diversity is concerned, not that real movies are perfect. Is this something you discussed in board meetings? Do the hero's ethnic ethnicity and gender have an impact on the revenues and so on?

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       I love this question because I have a real life story on that. So we're in the dreamworks board meeting. Jeffrey knows I tell this story. So I'd been very open about it and we saw the movie mega mines, which was a dreamworks movie, cause we would watch the movies in the board meetings all the time. So we watched mega mines, we come out of the theater, we're in the boardroom. And he always say like, well what do you do? Think of the movie. So I wait for everyone. I'm sitting around waiting, waiting, waiting. And finally I'm like, the city was metropolis. He's like, yes. I was like, the only person of color was blue in the entire movie. There was one scene where the hero kiss a baby that's black. And I was like, it didn't even have a black parent that went with that. And I was like,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       there are no people of Color in this movie. None. None. Except for the, you know, the main character. So Jeffrey sort of a couple of people pile on and then the meeting is over. So I get a call from Jeffery when I land in Chicago and he's like, I need you to come to La and have lunch with me. And I was like, come back to la now. We don't know each other well at all. It's early in my tenure at dreamworks. And I said, okay, I'll come back. So I get back and we're sitting in this, the grill in Los Angeles and he looks at me and he's like, you know, you really embarrassed me in that board meeting and I'm thinking like, get ready for a fight. You know, like in my mind I'm like, like in my mind I'm like this. And he's like, and it will never happen again.

Speaker 4:          00:51:14       I'm mortified. I didn't see it. It will never happen again, ever. And he's like, that's why you have to be in the room. And I said back to us, everyone in the room, right? And he said, I didn't see it. So interestingly in tip, uh, the mood, the character tip in, um, oh my God, the name of the movie just went in and out of my head. Rihanna is the main character. Um, Oh God, it'll come to me on one second. Sorry. Yeah, it's Google home. Excuse me. Home. So thank you, Jamie. Clara. So in home, Rihanna is the first mixed race protagonist, main character j lowest her mother, and it's very clear of father's black based upon her hair. And so we don't see her father in the movie. And so Rihanna has obviously this huge following. We do the movie and all of these people start writing Jeffery these letters and these letters are things like, I just want you to know my child has never seen a character in a movie that was the main character, animate it with hair that looked like hers.

Speaker 4:          00:52:23       My child has never seen an animated movie with a main character where the child was participant Mac. My child does. And so Jeffrey was like, melody is the reason that we did this because she's the one who told us mega mine nest and we want it to push this. And the thing was, which I explained to you know that it didn't take rocket science to figure out again as this in your own best interest African Americans and Hispanic overindex and movie going. We do. And so there are certain things where we over index in a big way and movie going as one. And I just said, this is one of these things, this is not only feels great and it's wonderful and the movie, it was this tremendous success, but it's also great that we've inspired all these people because they see people who look like them when most often than not, that is not the case.

Speaker 4:          00:53:07       Now we've had the princess and the frog. We had will Smith as a main character and one of our movies, I mean we've had a lot of diversity but this was one of the, you know, the most direct and outward signs of that. And that was really invigorating. Is that enough? No. So we need to do a lot more, but that certainly was one where that was a good example on a great start. Yes. Yes. We have a live question. Thank you. Hi Melodie. Thank you so much for being here and um, on behalf of Google, I think you just, you're such an inspiration and what a powerful message, and I know the room is not totally full because it is the Friday before thanksgiving, so apologies on that, but everyone is on the live stream and we will absolutely share it on demand to.

Speaker 4:          00:53:44       Thank you so much for your time. My question actually is about your two or three year old beautiful daughter, Everest and thanks to your great mother and all of the values and messages she instilled in you. What is that hopeful optimism that you're planning to instill in her as she becomes a beautiful lady? Well, the most important thing that I believe in is making sure she's a good person. I think that trumps everything. It's not what you do, what you achieve, you know, anything else, how successful she is. I just want a good person. I want a person who is empathetic, who has concerned for others. My child that Warren Buffett has a saying that if you're born in America, you've won the birth lottery. My child won the birth lottery in America. She has two extraordinarily devoted and successful parents. She has a life that any person would dream auth in every way, a life that I could never have even remotely understood.

Speaker 4:          00:54:38       She has devoted CareKit caretakers. My child does now fluent because we started when she was born in Mandarin, so we started teaching our Mandarin. She goes to a Chinese immersion school with no English, so she's, she's been to China three times and she's three. You know, these are things that are just not normal. Right? But at the same time, what I have told people, I have very clear and high expectations of the contribution that she must make and give back to society. And people say to me, you can't burden her with that. I said, hell yes I can. Because she got way more than her fair share. She will never wake up in the morning wondering about food or clothing or shelter. I've been there and I don't want to put all of that on her, but I want her to be aware of what that is like as it relates to other people.

Speaker 4:          00:55:26       One day she came to us, she would go to the Chinese American Service League in Chicago to play with the kids starting when she was one years old and they're all immigrants. Children who were the parents would go to learn how to assimilate in America and the kids would be put in a room to play together. And Everest, the little brown child was the only non Chinese child in the room. Beige, she's not quite brown as my husband said when she was born. What happened? I already ordered a brown one. Um, but anyway, she um, she goes to this class one day, she comes home, she's two years old and she starts picking up her toys and she starts putting them at the front door in our apartment in Chicago. And we said, what are you doing? And she said, we have to take these toys to school now in broken sentence.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       You know, she can't even form a full sentence at that age. And so we said, she said, the other kids need the toys. And I was like, that's the kid I want. That is the kid I want. Where she saw they were playing with broken toys. She, we were, she was born, we got 600 baby gaps. Even though I told people no gaps, 600 someone sent us 2000 bucks, 2000 and so I said to, I said it was such an Mba, we got literally like 30 copies of goodnight moon literally. So we're sending them the hospitals and everything. So I want her to understand like this is too much. So when she started putting, they get her and she's like, their toys are broken. I was like that is what we have to instill in her for the rest of her life because she has more than her fair share and that will be where I would be most proud of her if she has that goodness in her and she sees now they say bilingual children are naturally more empathetic because they understand when someone doesn't understand, which was part of the reason I wanted her to be bilingual.

Speaker 4:          00:57:10       That was the start to this life of empathy that I hope that she has not sympathy. Empathy. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:57:19       can we go on for a few more minutes? How are you guys? Okay. All right. Okay, great. Thank you. Um, you've been actively engaged in financial literacy with all of the new apps tools available today. Do you see more opportunity for women, minorities to dramatically improve their financial literacy? And if so, are you involved in any interesting projects in this area?

Speaker 4:          00:57:34       Yes, I think this is, we're at a precipice of a moment. The thing about America is we are not financially literate, literate. That's everyone. You can go to high school in America today and take wood shop or auto and not a class on investing, which always leads me to ask people who whittles, right? Who is cleaning their own carburetor when you can't. The class on investing in America. So all of us, even if you've gone to the best schools, you may have taken corporate finance at an Ivy League school, but you didn't take a class on the stock market and investing most likely. So we hand people the keys to their financial future when they go to work at their first job because we tell them, here's your 401k plan, pick your investment options. And no one taught you how to drive. So I said it's the equivalent of handing literally the keys to our core bat to a 16 year old with a bottle of Jack Daniels and no driver's license and say have a good time.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       Like it has dramatic implications for your life as well as your children and your parents. If you help support them, it's, it's a big damn deal. So as a result of that, I've been an evangelist on this idea of financial literacy. That is why I wake up when I'm out here on the west coast, I had to go to CBS at like they come to blow dry my hair like one in the morning. My husband is literally like, you have a night shift. Literally because I'm getting up to go to dcbs and by 4:00 AM in the city. And people say, well why do you do it? I don't do it for publicity. I don't do it for money. I do it because it's my opportunity to educate people about money. And I see that as part of my calling in life because I've gotten this opportunity to understand.

Speaker 4:          00:59:08       And because we don't learn about this in school, the good news is that there are more tools than ever before. Four one k plans have gotten so much better at providing financial information of people would take advantage of it. I just, uh, actually invested in, I say this not because of it's an investment. I hope it works out, but that's not the reason I'm giving them a plug. I've invested in this company called Ellevest, which is a, um, Robo advisor targeting women, which I think one, the name is great and Sallie Krawcheck who started the company who came off of Wall Street, uh, first alliance Bernstein, then Bank of America. She is fantastic and I think she's put together something really special to appeal to women. Um, I've been here and I've gone to talk to Sal Kahn about what he's doing when it comes to financial literacy.

Speaker 4:          00:59:53       So I, and he has some great things, uh, at the Khan Academy that will help people and he's doing great things with Bank of America in that regard. So I do think there are more opportunities than ever before. But I do think also we have to understand as a society, we hold the keys to our own financial future. The days of working for a company for 30 years and require retiring with a gold watch and a secure pension are over. The average American will have 11 jobs in their lifetime. And even if you have done right by yourself, if you've saved and invested appropriately, if you're maxing out with your four one k plan, you have may have someone in another office or the next cube that has done nothing. And it's because of that, they will be a burden on society and ultimately affect you. So this is everyone's problem.

Speaker 4:          01:00:37       And the one thing that we can do about it, because we'd say an area, one of our famous sayings, we have admired this problem long enough on this one. You can take this cause into your own life demanding your children's schools, your, your, your nephews or nieces, your God children's, that they ultimately have financial literacy programs in those schools. And that ultimately that we start to develop a language around investing for young people so that when they hear about the Nasdaq, the Dow and the s and p, it's not a foreign language to them and that they ultimately become more comfortable and fluid in these ideas of a saving and investing which have profound implications for our society. Anyone who thinks this is social security as a safety net, especially the people of this generation in this audience and in this company, millennials, it's a safety net with holes. If you're under the age of 40 it is a question of what the social security will look like and not to mention the average social security check in America today is $1,100 that is not when any of us would consider the golden years and yet 80 million Americans ate oh are currently working in companies where there is no retirement plan for them and so security will be their only option.

Speaker 1:          01:01:52       By the way, if there's anything we can do to help more, especially in the youtube side, we work closely with the Canada Academy and so on. Maybe there's some interesting ideas because that's obviously a great medium to um, uh, to, to display and show some of this information. Let's do, uh, let's do one more question here. Just looking at time. Uh, it's so important. Children grow into leaders that are accepting of all, I have a biracial niece that is eight years old and has already felt discrimination. Do you have a recommendation for a book or something? Children of all types, especially girls can read that emphasizes leadership and equality.

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       This is hard one. Obviously I have a biracial child as well and I always tell my husband, he is always kind of reminding, trying to remind me. He's like, you know, she's part white and I'm like in America when you have any black in you, you're black. That's just how you're seeing. You're not seeing as part white people don't look at Barack Obama and say he's part white. They said we have a black president. And so, um, again, in the, in the spirit of truth, even though my child, we, my husband told her that Baba, she calls him Bob Bob because it's Chinese for Father Baba is a white and Mama is black. And he said Everest is black and white. And she said, and Mandarin because she thinks she's parked Chinese. Her favorite food is me, fat rice. And um, so we have a long way to go before her.

Speaker 4:          01:03:08       She really does understand that she's part black and white. I've got to get some sweet potato pie to her or something, a bean pie. But anyway, she, um, I think the one thing we can do, especially for girls, I just, when I was a kid, I read all of these. There were these little red books in my library at school. Um, where I grew up in these little red book. We're biographies of famous people and they had, they had literally had books on any Oakley and Louisa may Alcott and Harriet Tubman and all these people. And I had this desire before I graduated from eighth grade to read every biography that was on the shelf. And there were a couple hundred of them. And reading about people makes a huge difference in your life. You know, when you can read about their struggles and what they went through.

Speaker 4:          01:03:46       I don't think there's any one book. I think it's just the idea of reading about, uh, individuals, um, that makes a huge difference in inspires. And so I, there's no magic bullet on this. Knowledge is power and information. We all know that. And hopefully the, in reading about the struggles of others, she'll get the confidence to the eight year old biracial niece to take this world on, uh, with great energy and enthusiasm and confidence. But you know, it's, it's, it's uh, it's not, uh, one thing, uh, one book, a one conversation. It's a, it's a narrative and that narrative has to go on for life. I mean, I still feel like I have to be infused with that. When I was having my hard time last week, it was someone else who told me, think about your ancestors. You're not in a field picking cotton. You didn't give birth to Everest and a field and have to get back to work.

Speaker 4:          01:04:38       That's the truth of what happens. So get over yourself and um, you know, I have great optimism for the young kids that are out there, but what I tell people do not tell them not to see race, tell them to embrace it. You know, I think that's just as important. They can't look beyond it. All these people talk about how they're colorblind and I, you know, as you give real life examples, I had a friend who worked at MTV and they said they did a survey of millennials and they asked them all these attitudinal questions and they were all like, spot on, you know, in terms of views about things. Just lined up exactly with what you want with society. And then the ask them what would they do? Would you date a black girl, the college football, uh, captain? He was like, no. And I was like, of course I know that because the black girl in all white schools doesn't have dates.

Speaker 4:          01:05:29       I was one of them. That's just what happens. So, you know, let's, let's not have them in this vacuum of, I don't even see that because it's not real. That's not the reality that we live in. Let's embrace those differences. And so telling your eight year old niece, making sure she understands where she comes from, who she is and all the people are out there who are like her, who've done extraordinary things and Barack Obama is one, you know, one of my heroes. It doesn't have to be yours. I, you know, we all have a right to our different ups differences of opinion, but there's some people out there who, you know, are pretty remarkable and have been pretty remarkable who don't live anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       This is so interesting. Are you okay to go on for a few more minutes? Yeah, I mean we are fine. A couple of more minutes. Are you guys okay? Sorry. What did this I feel we have, um, it's just, we should, I mean we stream and we record so, so even if people watch it later, you want people to have uncomfortable discussions about race. But for some of us, that discomfort is because these discussions have a nontrivial probability to be quite literary career ending. How can we have these discussions safely?

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       I have to tell you, this is one where I understand the trepidation. I think that my profile and opportunity, the opportunities that I have in life had been magnified by my willingness to go out on a limb. People told me not to have this discussion, that it would be a career ender for me. And yet having this discussion has allowed me to be invited to be here and one of the greatest companies in the world to sit and talk to you. And so I see it a little bit differently, but I know it takes a tremendous amount of bravery, which is why a lot of my speeches right now are about being brave. I talk about this article that I read about a woman who every single day told her daughter to be brave when she went to college. All of her letter she signed, be brave, not, I love you.

Speaker 4:          01:07:19       Be Brave because she wanted that to be the message to her. And that's what I tell Everest. Be Brave her, my George, the other don't tell the Everest she was silly. She said, I'm not silly. I'm brave. And I said, that's exactly what I want her to feel, but this is going to take bravery. And what I tell about tell people who says it could be, you know, you lose your job, your career, you have to have confidence to believe you can get another job. You just have to have that confidence. I know that sounds really cavalier and people say, Oh, you can see that sitting where you are now. I have always believed in my ability. If I did excellent work, excellent, killed it every single day I would be wanted. And I believe that to this day. And if I can't get the benefit of the doubt for talking about something that I think is important, I think that is what is killing us.

Speaker 4:          01:08:08       Every one is in these rooms. And they're not saying it. You know, people keep telling me what is happening to them. My soul being crushed by the nots. The people who are not speaking up. And a young woman come to see me the other day who was busy on being just beyond stunning, like Mussai warrior beautiful. You know, literally she was six feet tall, chocolate brown, unbelievably beautiful, had just graduated from college, works in this um, company that's very big company that you would know. And she said that her boss keeps calling her cookie. Um, who was the woman from empire cookie? What's your last name? Lions. She goes, he goes, her cookie Lyons. So was a cookie. Lions come here, Cookie Lyons do this, cause their lines. So she finally, she came to see me to say, what do I do? She's 22. I am in shock, right?

Speaker 4:          01:09:10       And she says, there's another woman who works there who is black. There are two of us. I'm 22. I said, well, how long has she been there? She said, she's been there for eight years. He calls her cookie Lyons to, so I said, oh my God. So he said, her name is Taylor. So she said, I said, you got to go and tell him. So she goes and tell him. She said, listen, my name is Taylor. I want to be called Taylor. I don't want to be called Cookie Lyons. I want to be called Taylor. And he said to her, what if I call you Taylor Swift? And she said, my name is Taylor and no one else on this whole floor has a different name. You call them by their name, I just want to be called Taylor. So he says, okay, I understand he stops calling her Taylor.

Speaker 4:          01:10:02       So the other woman who's eight years older than her walks in and says, oh my God, he stopped calling you cookie Lyons. Do you think I should walk in and say something? So for eight years now, I know cookie came into existence, what? Three years ago? I'm assuming there was something before that maybe, I shouldn't assume, but at least for the last three years he's been calling that other woman who's been there. You know, this woman just graduated from college this summer and that is what she's dealing with, not doing her job being called Cookie Lyons, who's like a sister girl. I had got no problem with Cookie Lyons, but if you saw this woman, I was like, I don't even get it. She's like six feet tall. She's, you know, there's nothing about her that you can't say like, you look just like, are you seem like her, you know, she didn't know why even are a Gucci trench coat.

Speaker 4:          01:10:56       And I was like, really? I just don't get this. So, but it's the silence of the other people that allows that to perpetuate. And people come to me all the time with things that happen in rooms and I'm like, it can't just be us fighting for ourselves. There were other people on that floor who knew. He called her cookie Lyons and they didn't say anything. She actually gets the, the, the metal here because she's the youngest most defenseless, no experience, probably most afraid. But she had the foresight to say, help me, what do I do? And I was like, go stand up for yourself and if this does not work out, I told her, I said, you can roll yourself right into here at Ariel and I will make a place for you and you will be a superstar here.

Speaker 1:          01:11:40       So wow. So, um, let me say one thing here, just from my perspective. I'll give you a pledge here. If anybody ever at Google cause worry about speaking out about race or fields, they have a negative career impact from that. Tell me all sorted for you. You should not ever, ever feel in such a position. Feel free to contact me. And I think from the other part of the story, also important. If you are in a situation where you observe behavior like this, I feel if you're not black, if you're not a minority, it is your responsibility to observe, learn, understand, speak out. And if you're not being he heard about it, feel free to contact me at any point in time. I will engage. We'll, we'll sort it.

Speaker 4:          01:12:27       So let me just give you one example of this. At Princeton we an honor code. So some of you had this, so we, every time we sent to take a task, the honor code was on the front. You signed, then you broke the seal and the Honor Code said if you cheated or you saw someone cheat and took, didn't turn the men, yes you were accountable. You could have the same repercussions for not turning them in. It's interesting. If we could adopt an honor code around these issues. And so we're actually going to take it upon ourselves that when we actually see this injustice, yes, we're going to call it out. Yes, we're going to live within the honor of having this fair and honorable society. We have to look at it exactly right. We're used to that. Many of us have already lived with honor code. Yes, we have. We have to learn. We have to understand this better.

Speaker 1:          01:13:08       Part of the reason why we're having this discussion here. Right. So, uh, so, so people that are, um, that actually have a non diverse background understand those issues better and that they own, because only if you know, you can realize what it means and only then you can actually go ahead and, and speak out and you actually, you have to speak out. Like I fundamentally believe you have to speak up. Speak Up, speak out. Yeah. We have one more live question that's, go ahead

Speaker 4:          01:13:30       melody. I love your voice. Thank you for being here. Speaking of jobs, have you considered running for president? No, I haven't considered that. I, uh, you know, no, I, I actually, you know, there are moments now that I have to say I'm, we all have to do something. You know, we all have a role and I'm taking mine very seriously. So on the phone on the way here, I was on the car for two hours. I was on the phone with planned parenthood's Cecile Richards. I was on the phone with someone representing the head of the Naacp and the legal defense fund. Those are my three calls on the way here about mobilization and what we will do. So I plan on, you know, rising to the occasion and, and hopefully giving all that I've got doing everything that I can. I don't think I'm the right person for Washington, but I do think, um, I have a lot of hope that there's someone here or someone else that we can all get behind and help change the world and make it what we want it to be. The one thing I am hopeful despite being disappointed and discouraged in some ways and again, being very cognizant of other people who have different of opinion and respecting those opinions and the other side. Um, I'm, I am going to push for the light as opposed to the darkness. I'm going to fight for light.

Speaker 4:          01:14:45       Yup. Thank you. I think you could be right though about the office being there. Thank you. Should we just finish off with the two live questions please?

Speaker 4:          01:14:58       It's a little tall. Hi. Hi. I've looked up to for a really long time because they feel like you're amazing at succeeding environments that aren't necessarily built for you. Like I read your essay in Sheryl Sandberg's book about going to like a mostly white, proper twice school, like going to Princeton. I'm working in finance and that's something that I could personally relate to. Going to a private boarding school, it was mostly white, um, and studying econ and math at Harvard and like working in tech. Um, but I think the differences are you've been in one job since you graduated college. It's very rare. Um, you've also kind of achieved a lot of professional success before you've settled out in marriage and having kids. Like do you have any advice for millennials who are kind of navigating places that aren't necessarily built for them but are also having to adjust like, you know, seven jobs in a lifetime and um, you know, like the career clock in your biological clock not necessarily be in sync.

Speaker 4:          01:15:56       My major advices, um, what I think is just true, if you follow your passion, you're going to be successful no matter what because one, you'll be happy. Um, and I think happiness is really important. You can't do anything. Well if you're not happy, you can't be a good parent, good spouse, girlfriend, boyfriend. You can't be a good coworker. Happiness is important and that doesn't mean euphoria everyday, but a basic sense of peace. And for some of us, especially type A, and especially people are hard on ourselves, we don't give each other give ourselves a break. And so the pursuit of happiness as we have it written obviously in our declaration of independence is something that is, um, challenging. So pursuing happiness. I do think is important as a pursuit of anything else. I also think my big advice is to millennials is stand up for you what you believe in.

Speaker 4:          01:16:49       Do not back down. And that doesn't mean you have to do it with a fist in the air or um, you know, with, with the, with the aggression you can do it with grace and um, I cannot be talked out of what I believe that that doesn't mean like in my core values, you cannot me that racism will ever be a path to something good. You cannot convince me that excluding people is ever leads to a better outcome. You cannot convince me of that. I will not be moved. I will not compromise that point of view. And so as a result of that, I'm going to do everything I can to keep pressing those perspectives. And I think if any, any issue I have with some of the millennials that I've had the opportunity to work up close with, don't be compliance. You know, just you know, you were, you were taught.

Speaker 4:          01:17:37       Sometimes winning is the path of least resistance. And I think this is now more than ever, or your voice and you know, being, being willing to put yourself in harm's way. It's like the question of losing a job. I know it sounds like I'm being flip. I've often asked myself, do I belong here? Should I walk out? Nothing is worth us. And you know, I think that, you know, just really pushing yourself to understand that sometimes certain things are just going to have to walk away. If you really, really, really believe it, you've got to stand up for something. So, you know, I, I would, I went to this program at the Aspen Institute, the Henry Crown fellows program, and we were in these small leadership groups, 20 people and skip battle, who's this amazing guy and known in Silicon Valley was my moderator. I have so much respect and admiration for him.

Speaker 4:          01:18:21       And one day we were in the room and he said to me, melody, I know you will do good. I was like, 30 years old. He goes, but will you stand in harm's way? Will you put yourself in harm's way? He's like, you could go through your whole life just doing the easy path and feeling good about yourself and patting yourself on the bat. But when you allow yourself to be hurt, will you allow yourself to have a tremendous setback because you stood up for what you believed. And that forced me to really think about the path of least resistance and saying versus believing that I will allow myself to be harmed. And then I started to think about people like John Lewis Standing on the Edmund Pettus bridge. And I start to think, I literally cannot even say this without calling up saying, could I have that kind of courage? And I think this is the moment we're standing in right now. We have to have that John Lewis courage, that Martin Luther King, courage, that dog's turned on. Teenagers, fire hoses turned on people courage. Because I think that if we were standing there, I was standing there, I think I would run. And now I'm telling myself, stand. So millennials, you've got so much power and control. Use it.

Speaker 4:          01:19:35       Last question. Hi Melody. Um, I was actually watching via live stream and then I realized, well, I might as well just come and see you. And you said instead of just through the computer. And so as a Latina and as someone that has had to exercise my muscle of bravery all year at Google, it's just thank you. Thank you for reminding me. Like even this week I had to be very brave and I was very scared. And so I help lead our efforts for Latinos here at Google and, and really like this, the past two weeks, I just, there's so much more that we can do as Googlers for our Googlers, but our users. And so I want to know like, what do you think we can do as Googlers for our, our, our family of Googlers, for our families as Googlers and for our users. Because, you know, we're, we're really trying to, to figure this out, um, with, with everyone.

Speaker 4:          01:20:34       And so the good thing is that the intention is there and that will lead to a good outcome. The one thing I should say, you can't be brave without fear. So just always understand that it's a necessary ingredient, ingredient to courage and bravery is fear. It's overcoming it. You know, it's, it's not the absence of fear. It's overcoming the fear that leads you to be brave. So we all just have to understand that that's a vulnerability, but an honesty. Um, the other thing in terms of what I think you all can do, you have the most magnificent voices and you have the most magnificent platform, probably one of the best in the entire world. And when I'm saying use that power for good, I do think you have unique opportunities to do so. And to me, I think your opportunity is to preach tolerance. It's not about one idea being right or wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:21:16       It's been tolerant of ideas that are different. And that's where it seems like our conversations have really broken down in our society. Respecting someone's right to have a different opinion. And that's why I said at Ariel, it's hard to do. You know, in the different Scott pages book, he said if you were in a meeting and you find yourself violent leak disagreeing with a colleague, you just stand up and clap because you're going to have a better outcome just from that disagreement. And so I think the idea that you can use this platform for, of tolerance and use these voices, which are magnificent, as I've said multiple times now, because I really think they are, you are so unique, so educated, so bold. You are innovative. You've done something that has never been done before. You show growth that we've never seen before. You've created an environment that I literally, I could just move in, you know, literally, um, what do you need here? It's up for like a toothbrush, but I'm sure those are in the bathroom, right? So, you know, bottom line, I mean, I think that there's something so special here to galvanize that the way you've galvanized it with this great, tremendous, never before seen corporate success can be galvanized into greatness globally with this voice and you representing Latinos, um, is wonderful. And you knowing them, knowing the responsibility you have, you have a responsibility. Own this. It's not about Google, it's about you. Thank you so much.

Speaker 5:          01:22:38       Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you everybody for coming. Thank you so much.
