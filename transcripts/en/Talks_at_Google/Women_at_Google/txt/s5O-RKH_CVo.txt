Speaker 1:          00:07          Welcome. Thank you for being here for happiness. So let's start, um, what, start with your sports. You both are in fairly uncommon sports. How did you initially get involved in losing and flipping multiple times a year on skis? Uh, at an early age to become an Olympian?

Speaker 2:          00:27          Okay. Uh, so I grew up close to lake placid in upstate New York and my parents volunteered at the Olympics in 1980 at the lose track. So I had been skiing already and I went with my parents to, uh, to see lose every day. Uh, so I saw the best athletes in the world competing and lake placid is, it's a really small town, so I kind of got the Olympic bug and saw other, I saw a figure skating and hockey and I saw Eric Heiden when is metals? So I was like all excited about the Olympics and after the games there was a two week, a luge camp. So my parents let me skip school and go to luge camp. Uh, God, honest led, loved it from the very first time. And at the end of the two weeks I won. I won the junior Olympics race in my age group. And that was kind of, that was the beginning of the next 18 years on a sled.

Speaker 1:          01:18          And how old were you when you first went to lose you? Really? You're gonna lose camp. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:25          11, 11, 11 which is pretty typical. So in a, in Luge, there are tracks like a dozen or so tracks around the world and you, you know, you don't get very many runs on each track every year. So it really takes years to a, to be good and to be successful internationally. So 10 or 11 is pretty typical for a jumping on a sled. Yeah. And what about you? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:47          well I, it's kind of a family affair in our house. So my brother was actually an aerialist on the US ski team for many years, way before I got into it. I was 21 when I actually got into the sport, so a little bit later. But um, yeah, so he, my brother was in it and I was actually at school going, uh, going to school down at Florida State University. And Yeah, a lot of good skin down that way. Um, but uh, you know, there wasn't a lot athletically for me to get involved in down there. I was actually riding horses and doing gymnastics growing up a time and both my brother and I skied since we could walk, come from a very, very avid skiing family. But, um, anyway, so I decided I was either going to take a semester off and go to winter park, Colorado and ski.

Speaker 3:          02:31          Um, w where my brother was skiing with a freestyle club there or I was transferring to the University of New Hampshire where there was an equestrian riding team. So I first went to winter park, went out there, always thought I'd be a bump scare, a mogul skier. My brother did Ariel's I thought he was nuts. There is no way I would've ever done that. So anyway, when out and with air, with freestyle, you usually do all the events at a regional level. So I did and I actually did the best in. So, um, obviously it didn't transfer to Unh. I ended up coming out to Salt Lake City and training with a coach out there and basically I was the only woman, um, training with five other men out there. And, um, it took a little convincing for the coach Steve and let me come and train. So, um, yeah, so it's been kind of, you know, then I, then I was on, um, basically about 12 years on the US team. So. So what was that training like from when you first started to, right before your first Olympics? Was the schedule like and the effort that goes into two becoming one of the best in your sports in the world? Yeah, absolutely. Um, do you want,

Speaker 2:          03:39          sure. I can start. So I, uh, I was on the national team for 14 years and I think Tracy will probably agree, a competing on the level that we did is basically a full time job. Uh, so the, uh, the off season is when most of the like really intense physical training takes place. So, uh, for Luge, it's a, it's, they're kind of two components a and it's the start, which is the only chance that you have to accelerate the sled. And then once you pull off from the handles and you wear spikes on your fingertips, paddle down the ramp, uh, and then you lie down and then it's all about skill and how well you can drive, uh, drive the lines. So, uh, in the summertime we would do a lot of sort of, you know, basic training at first and then it's all about sort of power and quickness and speed, uh, on the start.

Speaker 2:          04:27          So a lot of upper body back core work and a lot of like Olympic Olympic lifting, uh, in the, in the summertime. And then in the, in the winter we would be, uh, on the road from usually at the beginning of October until December. So usually 10 weeks in the fall you'd come home, uh, for like a week at Christmas and it was kind of enough time to wash your clothes, eat a couple of meals that your mom made. And then I'm back on the road for another eight weeks for the World Cup and world championship season. So, uh, definitely a kind of year round and, and I, I was able to work actually a undergrad into that schedule because a, I went to Dartmouth and it had, it's on quarters. So I would go with the luge team in the fall and winter and then I'd go to school in the spring and summer. I was there for a little longer than four years.

Speaker 3:          05:16          Yeah. So for Ariel's, um, basically it starts on a trampoline and there are hours and hours of, you know, refining your skills for doing back flips and twists and multiple twists and multiple flips and all of that. And you're in a big a harness as well, which has a spinning belt, so that's attached to a rope. So there's a lot of trampoline training is a really, really big, big facet of it. Then you actually transfer it to water ramping where you coming down. Um, there's a lake placid and park city have to water ramp facilities and you come down the ramps. I'm on plastic surface, go off and land into a big swimming pool with all your, your skis, your boots. Um, you know, you have a life jacket on, usually have a dry suit or a wetsuit and I'm helmet of course. And uh, I've always had the question, do your ski boots get wet?

Speaker 3:          06:06          And I'm like, Oh yeah, they get wet and we break skis and all sorts of things, but, and water does hurt. Um, it's a great way to train. That's where you, like I said, you, there's a very long process in taking what, um, what you see on snow. Um, there's a qualification process for every single jump that you, that you do on snow. So you'd have to do it a certain number of times. You have to qualify it in front of a u s team coach safely five times in a row, um, and then then you're able to transfer it onto snow once the season starts. And then, you know, I think like what Cameron said, I think one of the misconceptions about, um, you know, Olympic athletes is that the only thing they train for and compete and are the Olympics and we have a World Cup circuit that we are on every single year.

Speaker 3:          06:55          And so it goes to our sports, uh, the Olympics. But right now we have world championships every other year. So we were on tour from December all the way to April every year. And then our summer training also, we would do trampoline starting in May, um, you know, through October. So we had a little bit of time off in April, a little bit of time off in October. But other than that it was, it was year round training for sure. Yeah. And so you've obviously did a lot of the trampoline training, all these things. How have you seen the training evolve from when you started doing it your first couple of years to where we are today with the technology and the advancements that have happened? Yeah. Well, I I know for Ariel's, you know, it, I think, um, the water ramp facility itself has become better.

Speaker 3:          07:40          The jumps are the jumps that we used to use for water ramping. We're not as similar as the jumps that we now, you know, create on snow. But now, now they are very, very similar. So that transition from water to snow is not nearly as different. And really the only thing that you have to modify for on snow is the Landing Hill. Cause we obviously land on a very, very steep landing hill and water your landing pretty much. Um, you really don't try to land straight up and down. But we tried to land with our tips going into the water. But um, you know, aside from that there's still tons of trampoline training and um, I don't think that there's, I think where at least for Ariel's it's changed as more time on snow. The more time that we can actually train on snow. So more training camps have come about where we've been able to, where the team's been able to be on snow more often. So,

Speaker 2:          08:33          so with the, with Luge, the a, it's hard to see when you watch it on TV or even when you're standing at the track. A sled goes why it, you know, 90 miles an hour. But they, uh, the sled is, there's a lot of technology that goes into the sled. So a single sled and women, a women just do singles. Men can do singles or doubles, but the single sled weighs 50 pounds. So it is a, there's a part that you lie in your body is sort of in a fiberglass shell, a their handles that you hold onto. And then runners that go the whole length of the sled attached to that on the bottom are steals. And, uh, they are, um, there's sort of a lot of technological espionage and the in the sport. So people are always trying to see what other countries are doing.

Speaker 2:          09:21          Uh, and, uh, when I was on the team, and it's, it's definitely still true today. Uh, our coach would make the sleds, so everything, uh, so it's, uh, you know, from the fiberglass to the runners, the steels are a, that's probably the most technologically a complicated part of the sled and the most important. And it's really, um, it's like very nuanced sort of what a metals comprise the runners and what goes fast. And it's, and sometimes it's just really hard to know. You might have a steels that are made like two made exactly the same material at the same time, and one will be faster than the other. So a, so it's like, yes, there's a lot of technology, but there's also some art to it, uh, as well. Um, so I, I had a, one of our assistant coaches from Italy one summer, he said, okay, so, uh, you know, we think these steels are really fast, but what I want you to do this summer is to, and I'm not joking here, um, bury them in your backyard so the, the sun and the moon can get on the steels.

Speaker 2:          10:25          And I think we'll go even faster. I was like, okay, I'll do that. I'll try and eat. And they were fast. I have no idea if it was like burying in the backyard, I it required a lot of sanding to get the rust off. But um, so yeah, so there is a, there's definitely a lot of technology in the, uh, in the sleds I didn't mention before. A one part of the training in the summertime is practicing the start, uh, on ice. So in lake placid there's an indoor start ramp facility, so you can, um, you can practice the, the start on ice, you go down the ramp and then up up the other side because it's a, it makes a really big difference sort of being on ice versus being on, you know, wheels, which is possible, but you don't really get the same, uh, the same sort of feel when one of the star ramps in.

Speaker 2:          11:13          Um, it's actually the one, uh, at the track and laplant in France where the Olympics were in 92. Uh, so the ramp is so steep that when you're so it would lose, you know, you're sitting on the sled at the start, hands around the handles. Normally you can see the, you know, you can see the ramp, see the first curve, this ramp, it's so steep you can't see it. So you're sitting at the start, you can't see the ramp and you just see the first curve. Okay. I hope I'm going to go straight down. There was a Dupre a little, so that leads into my question, which is most of the audience, I don't want to assume anyone, maybe some people have, but most of the Saudis has probably never gone down a loser ramp, 80 plus miles an hour or flipped multiple times on sees

Speaker 3:          11:54          what's, can you describe that experience of being in the air or what'd you get down that ramp and the first curve? Go ahead. Um, oh goodness. You know, um, cash. It is so difficult to describe what it's like to be 60 feet in the air. I was actually the first woman in the world to do a triple twisting double backflip and a double twisting, triple back flip. Can you demonstrate? Yeah. But, um, so, you know, um, oh my goodness. It is, I think, uh, you know, I'm scared of heights. So if you put me on top of real, I know everyone says, oh my gosh, you're an aerialist, how can you be afraid of, but just looking out, you know, in down is just a the nerve wracking to me. It makes my legs all week. But, um, going, you know, you're doing something in the air, you're coming down, you're not focused on really how high you are, cause that's what you need to get your feet under you.

Speaker 3:          12:48          But, um, you know, it's just an amazing, amazing feeling of, um, you know, like I said, it's hard to put in words. You're at the top of the Enron and you definitely have to figure out how to channel the fear in a really positive, productive way. Otherwise, you'll never be an aerialist. But you know, the adrenaline rush that you get, um, you know, coming down and doing a triple flip and landing and skiing away when you're down at the bottom, it is such a intense amount of emotion in all of six seconds. Um, and it is, it's just amazing. I always say this and I love my husband to death. I really haven't found quite something that's given me quite the adrenaline rush, the areas that might be too much information, but nonetheless, um, that's the way it goes onto you. Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:41          Uh, so, uh, so, uh, Lucia solutions, the, it's the fastest of all of the sliding sports. So it's faster than bobsled. It's faster than skeleton, and it's actually the only Olympic sport time to that. That was in the of a of a second. So I'm the fastest track in the world is a, is Vancouver, uh, from the men start is about 97 miles an hour. Um, so I've not gone that fast. I've been from the, uh, the men start in park city and go on about 87 miles an hour. So fast enough. Uh, so if you've driven that fast in your car, uh, imagine sort of that speed lying on your back on a fairly small sled going down in an ice track. Um, some of the tracks are a, and every track is different, so some tracks are sort of wide open curves. Um, of course like you have to steer on all of them, but some, some requires less, some required less steering.

Speaker 2:          14:36          So the one in park city is a little more like an autobahn. It's very fast, not a ton of steering of really fun kind of smooth ride down. There are other tracks, however, that are really technically difficult. And if you don't steer in exactly the right place at exactly the right time, you'll crash. So, uh, I'd like those tracks and I was, I was good at those. Great. So let's go to the first Olympics. As you both are multiply, uh, time Olympians at first Olympics. What was the emotion when you first qualified and then what was the emotional at the opening ceremonies when you're there? Were you really excited to be there and ready to go? Or were you really nervous about the competition and kind of what was going through your head? So my first Games wiz and 88, and Calgary and a and that year to qualify for the team, there were a series of races, uh, in lake placid.

Speaker 2:          15:25          So I qualified, uh, and, and I, it's like, you know, when you qualify, it's like, okay, I've made the Olympic team super excited about that. But it wasn't really until I walked into the opening ceremonies that I thought, oh my gosh, like I've made the Olympic team, I'm here representing the United States and, you know, all of that. I was 19 at my first game, so I had spent sort of eight years preparing for that, uh, that moment. And, uh, with that games, I didn't really have any particular expectation about my finish and like, I didn't really expect that I had a chance to win a medal. So I was really just going to, you know, to do my best and, uh, and hopefully have, you know, as good at race as I possibly, uh, as a possibly good. Uh, so I, that games, I was, uh, I was ninth, I had great runs. I was like the happy with the happy with the results and, uh, had a few more games after that. But, um, yeah, so it's a, it's at that moment I think when you walk into the opening ceremonies is a, is a pretty special one.

Speaker 3:          16:24          Yeah. Yeah. So Mine, mine was 1994 and I was 26. Um, but, and actually Cameron was the flag bearer at the 1994 Olympic Games. So that's, that's a huge honor. And that they're voted, the flag bearers voted by there are our teammates. So she was voted by all of us to be the flag bearer, which was amazing. Um, for me also, my brother was actually after he retired, went on to coach the Australian freestyle ski team and Ariel's, so 1994 is a, again, a family affair. We, um, he was coaching aerials while I was competing, so it was, and my parents were over there. So that was, um, something that was just obviously amazing. And like Cameron said, the process of, of at least for freestyle, um, you know, of qualifying for the Games is a pretty long one. And so we know, one, we didn't find out our team until like two weeks before the game. So yes, that's, that's a step. Um, but my mentality going into all the Olympics as well was to make sure that I had a degree of difficulty that if I, if I want or could win, I just put myself in a place to win. And that was just always like the Olympics is not a place to hold back. So, um, that was, yeah, that was just, I mean, Lillehammer just for sure was just an amazing, amazing first games. Um, but I will say my last

Speaker 2:          17:49          games real quick is that it's rare that an Olympian gets to compete in their own home country when, um, during your career, let alone your own backyard. So I, I live in Park City, Utah. So the fact that Salt Lake City held the 2002 Olympic Games was amazing. And that was how I got to end my career. So it's been, it was, it was pretty cool. So that's thought about going for a fifth of 1998 was my, a was my last Olympics in Nagano, Japan. And for that reason, because 2002 wasn't in the United States, I thought, oh, maybe one more, but, uh, uh, decided to go to law school instead of nearly as much fun as, although I was a, I was in park city because, um, uh, as Tracy mentioned, I, uh, I carried the flag at the opening ceremonies in 94, which was a huge honor and really humbling and to be there, you know, sort of for the u s team and really for everybody back, uh, back home, uh, as well.

Speaker 2:          18:50          So, uh, although when I was at each, each sport nominates someone to carry the flag and then the team captains of all of the sports vote on who will be elected and, uh, Dan Jansen and Bonnie Blair were nominated and I was like, okay, so this is kind of going to be like the Oscars. I'm really honored to have been nominated and this great pool of people. And then, uh, and then I got picked. Yeah, it's a, so I was, I was super surprised and really, really honored. But in a, in part, in a Salt Lake City, the organizing committee invited all of the flag bearers to come and run with the torch from the opening ceremony stadium to the first metal ceremony. So a, and everyone who had carried the flag from basically who was living and who could come and manage to, uh, carry the torch and they said that they're like, well, you're young and in pretty good shape and all of that.

Speaker 2:          19:43          And I was like, okay, I'm working in a law firm on Wall Street, like 20 hours a day. And I can't remember the last time I worked out. So, um, so when we were running, you had to run behind like the van with the camera on you the entire time. So I thought, and I was like, oh my gosh, my arm's really tired. If I drop it, like, should I switch hands? Like that's not really going to look good, but if I drop it, that's even worse. But it was all, it was a huff and puff. I know. It's like, oh my gosh. Yeah. So is that more nerve wracking or carrying the flag and the opening ceremony? Well, before I walked into the, uh, to the stadium at the opening ceremonies in Lovell Hommer, the director of marketing for USA Luge said, Oh, uh, so you know, like 2 billion people are watching the Olympics, so don't trip and fall with the flag. I was like, really? Like you had to say that, tell me that right now. I did it. It was a, it was all good. But, so Tracy brought up good point that you got to compete in your home country and really hometown. Yeah. Did you ever feel when you went on the road that you didn't get enough practice time or the courses were different or I guess what was the experience being

Speaker 3:          20:49          at a road course or was it common practice since you traveled? Yeah. Yeah. No, you know, I think one of the things that I, you know, even in, in Cameron Sport, it's, you have, that's one of the things as an athlete you have to be able to do is be able to change from site to site from week to week and you have to be flexible. You have to know how to adjust and deal with obstacles and, and all that kind of thing. So, um, and you know, not really, I mean that was something throughout all, all our years of training that we were used to on a weekly basis. Like I said, World Cup was a different site every single week. So every Sunday we would travel somewhere else and then train a couple of days and compete and do it again somewhere else. So you just learn to adapt. What about the tracks lose track?

Speaker 2:          21:35          Well yet, so lose tracks are very different. But I'll just mention that when I made the national team when I was 15 and my first couple of years on the team, there was still east Germany and Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and like we went to all of those places. So it was, I mean, it was a really great adventure among other things being on the, being on the team at that time. Food was always a challenge. I'm like, I cannot identify that thing, whatever is on my plate right now. So you'd always bring like peanut butter and jelly with you just like just in place. Um, so yeah, lose tracks are uh, definitely like very, very different from track to track. And a, the u s we were at a little bit of a disadvantage because Germany has four tracks, a German sort of run the international federation and there tend to be a three or four World Cup's on German tracks every year.

Speaker 2:          22:31          Uh, so usually the way it works with countries is that if you have a track, uh, us has a track a that everyone else wants to train on your Germany, they have attract, people want to train on, you might swap a training times. No one wanted to train on the track and lake placid. So it was kind of worth nothing, uh, in, uh, in sort of track time leverage. So, so we ended up getting, you know, like not great training times. And uh, with the, with the lose track, it's about, uh, so loose bobsled and skeleton all go on the same track from the top of the course. The, some tracks are nearly a mile long, so they're, most of them are concrete, their pipes running throughout the entire track. And there's a big, um, refrigeration plant that pumps some ammonia compound throughout the pipes and you spray water on the track and it makes it makes ice.

Speaker 2:          23:21          Um, so, uh, however, uh, one thing that the Germans like to do when we were training on their tracks was like, give us track time at like nine o'clock at night. Uh, and yeah, great. And then six o'clock the next morning, uh, and then, uh, they would crank up the refrigeration. So, uh, it grows like frost on the ice. So it would, the track would be really slow when we were training and in, in Luge, the, you know, it's, it's so fast and it's time to the thousandth of a second. So if the track is even like half a second slow, it makes a really big difference in your timing and in how you steer. So training there would be like all sorts of frost on the ice and then race day, I mean literally you would sit on your sled and like look at the ice at the start and think like, oh, like I can see my reflection in the ice. And it's like, so I used to be like really hard and really smooth and very fast. So that was always a little bit of a challenge. But like Tracy said, you adapt it something that you know, you learn how to do as an athlete.

Speaker 3:          24:19          Yeah, yeah. I, you know, I, that's, it's so different for Ariel's. It's like, so, you know, we have, we have four jumped and there's usually two double kickers into triple kickers and we arrived there and they're just big, you know, piles of snow that are, you know, that we have to basically go shape. So there's certain shapers on our, um, you know, from different countries. And so each jump likes to be his shape, just a little bit different. Sometimes people like Steve Jumps, some people like a little bit less, um, at the top, so it doesn't throw you up quite so much if those you out. But everybody, I don't know, you know, that, that, that definitely we all trained at the same time. Everybody was very supportive and, and not that that's not an extreme sport, but, um, we, I don't know, there was definitely a camaraderie between, um, between our countries and between everyone to make sure that the jumps were just right for everybody. Um, so yeah, we have family that's a coach from another countries will, yeah, exactly that too. Um, but yeah, um,

Speaker 2:          25:24          it definitely a little different dynamic I think. And, and I think the, the Olympics in Vancouver probably pretty good example of that because a, so prior to Vancouver, the two other times Canada hosted the Olympics, so Montreal in [inaudible] 76 and then 88 and Calgary, uh, they didn't win any gold medals zero at home, which is really, really unusual. Usually you kind of have the, like the home field advantage and you're going to win more gold medals. A Canada had not done that, so they were determined, I think in Vancouver to make sure that they won gold. So one of the strategies, they funded, a lot of athletes they thought had the chance to win medals. And then the other strategy was to limit access to Olympic venues for a athletes from other countries. So if you, I mean, if you are a figure skater or a hockey player, maybe, you know, not such a big deal because a lot of the rinks are like fairly similar and maybe a little bit different, you know, ice quality or it's slightly different dimensions, but you know, fairly much the same, uh, loose, not so much. And that was the fastest track in the world. So actually the day before the opening ceremonies and athlete from Georgia, uh, died, uh, on the track. So he had 25 runs and I think the average Canadian head, like 250. Uh, so

Speaker 3:          26:40          yeah. Yeah, it matters. So let's pivot post Olympics. Um, so there's a lot of Olympians in some cases struggle posts, a professional athletic career and pivoting to a new career. Um, Youtube I've done very well. So can you tell us what you're doing now and talk about maybe your foundation as well? Sure. Um, yeah. So Gosh, I am retired after obviously the 2000 actually I retired after the 98 games, took two years off and went down to California and started a division of my brother's sports marketing company. Um, it a warm place for two years. I needed a break anyway. Um, yeah, and started a casting a sports casting a company and placing athletes in different sports production, mainly commercial and print stuff. Um, it was a great break and I came back obviously for the 2002 games and then afterwards, um, went back to casting.

Speaker 3:          27:36          So, you know, I, I feel just very fortunate. I mean, I did, I did finish getting my degree, took me 10 years, but I had done that while I was, it took me seven now I had my 10 year high school reunion that weekend. I was, uh, walking. I'm the my college degree. Yeah. But anyway, um, yeah. So I, I, you know, I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty smooth transition. I also was very much in the eye. That's just my personality. Like I knew I had to have something to move on to. And um, so having a business that was already somewhat set up was, was great. And I did that for a long time and still doing that. But also along the way, I, um, went on a volunteer trip to my mother's prompting basically. And, uh, um, ended up starting a foundation called kids play international.

Speaker 3:          28:30          And this really truly is my, my absolute passion without a doubt. And it was really this one little boy's words, 10 year, 10 year, 10 years olds, and name's Thomas. I went out and volunteered trip and he said to me at the end of the trip, I can see girls can play. And the background to that is that we were there, um, in Africa and in Malawi, Africa. Yep. And, um, basically, of course we are playing soccer. Um, but we also introduced a new sports with the boys and girls over there and obviously developing countries. Girls just are not encouraged to play sport. So when we actually pulled out, um, you know, baseball and softball after playing soccer where the boys were just absolutely aggressive and the girls stood there like orange cones and wouldn't interact very well together. But we, we pulled out baseball, softball and it just leveled the playing field.

Speaker 3:          29:22          They had never picked up a bat, never played, never heard of the sport and never played the sport. And it was just for me to watch how differently boys and girls we're learning side by side and um, you know, just that everything that sport and the Olympic values have taught me and I, I'm really came back after that trip and decided that I wanted to do something with, um, gender quality and sports. And so, um, you know, it's been about 10 years in the making. We have a year round program in Rwanda, Africa. Um, and it's really all about building better relationships between boys and girls from a very young age. And you know, boys and girls are so segregated, um, um, in developing countries from an early age that it's just, you know, through our program it, it definitely goes from simple to complex learning. But, uh, it's been an amazing, amazing journey and a such a great way to be able to take everything that's sport has given me in debt. Pay It forward a bit. So cool. And you're involved too.

Speaker 2:          30:28          I am an athlete ambassador and I've been, I've been to Rwanda where our program is a a couple of times and I went first in 2011 and, uh, and it was really like one of the best things I think that I've done sort of at the, uh, you know, using a sport in a, in a way that makes it, makes a difference. So, uh, so I went back this last summer on a trip that was, uh, funded by a State Department grant and it's, it's amazing to sort of see the difference that the program has made in the community. So, not just with the kids, but the parents and teachers and everyone, uh, had like really great stories of how, uh, the, the let's play fair program has impacted them personally. So you went to law school after I did. So I, uh, my 98 was my last games and I went to law school that fall and I decided, I decided to go to law school because I had been on the US Olympic Committee board of directors and on the Athletes Advisory Council for eight years.

Speaker 2:          31:30          And, uh, there are a lot of lawyers in sports. I, you know, NBA is, you know, nothing but attorneys. Uh, so, uh, it true in Olympic sport as well, a lot of lawyers practicing or, you know, working at a sports organization. And I thought, oh, well maybe that's an interesting way to sort of combine professional career with my interest in sport. Wasn't quite sure how that was going to happen, but it seemed like a, a, a good sort of general, a direction. Anyway, so I went to a, I went to BC for law school and a, and Yay. Right on. Uh, and, uh, uh, I spent, uh, I, I've worked, uh, in new, I've been in New York since, uh, since I graduated law school. Uh, so I worked on Wall Street at a big, big from Milbank tweed, uh, for, for two years. Kind of went through the, uh, you know, law firm bootcamp.

Speaker 2:          32:20          And, uh, and then I went to a smaller media and entertainment. It's a boutique, um, that had, you know, really interesting clients. So, uh, we had, I worked on the last JD Salinger copyright infringement case. A Nike was a client. So I, I mostly litigated a intellectual property cases. Um, while I was there, I also had a, because I'd been involved with the US Olympic Committee after I graduated law school, I put my name, there was like a list of lawyers who were available to athletes who had, you know, some kind of issues. So I put my name on the list and I got a call from an athlete who had tested positive for, uh, some drug called modafinil and the rational for like three or four athletes that I represented, uh, the all of them. And, um, so that I'd settled that case. And, and when you're a lawyer, it's like you're learning something new all the time, especially when you're litigating.

Speaker 2:          33:12          So I knew, of course, like new, the whole drug testing routine, but, uh, it was, it was, you know, from, uh, from the lawyer's perspective, I kind of enjoyed the, enjoyed the process. But at the end of, at the end of that first case, one of the, one of my clients, uh, Christy gains, so she was a two time gold medalist and ran on the four by 100 meter relay team with Marion Jones and probably see where this is going. They, uh, she was one of the athletes who were sort of caught up in the Belko a investigation in California. Uh, and that ended up being like a 16 month long, uh, sort of, uh, made new law in a, in doe, in the doping world, a kind of case. But, um, so I practiced law for 10 years and, uh, the, the spring of my last year, um, I got a call from Nyu and they asked me to come speak on a panel about women in sports.

Speaker 2:          34:05          So I did that. I went out to dinner with the faculty a afterward and, uh, and want the academic director at the time. I said, Oh, we'd love you to come teach a class. I'm like, right in my free time. Oh, New York. Okay. Uh, so actually I left my firm, I went to Rwanda with Tracy, and then that summer, uh, Nyu, uh, they sent an email, uh, was a Monday and they said, uh, would you be interested in teaching international sports governance? And I thought, well, I know that world. It's like the IOC and national Olympic Committees. And I said, great. I, you know, I'd love to. Uh, so I said yes to that. And uh, and then on Friday they called and they said, how about sports law? Can you teach that? I'm like, well, I don't know what's, uh, what are the topics?

Speaker 2:          34:47          So, um, so I looked at this, it's a pretty broad survey course and a lot of the things like Ip, I'm like, fine. Like I, you know, did that for 10 years. It can certainly teach that. But antitrust and labor law were on the, on the syllabus. And I said, okay, just, you know, full disclaimer here, I don't know anything about these areas of law, like at all. And they said, oh, that's no problem. You can learn it. And I'm like, like, okay. So, uh, and I, I think that's, you know, something like that's in my nature anyway, being a luge athlete. Like I'm really not afraid of anything. So I'm like, yeah, sure, why not? I can do that. So, uh, so I did, the first semester was a little bit of a learning curve. Um, international sports governance was great. I had terrible reviews and my sports law class, like I cried.

Speaker 2:          35:32          I'm like, Oh God, it's awful. And I said, listen, like I, um, I said to the director said, I, if you want to get someone else to teach the class, totally fine with me. Like, I don't need this kind of thing. And, and he said, go, like, go, you know, take the Christmas break and come back. But like, I think you should teach it one more time. I said, Oh God, all right. Uh, so I came back and I thought, okay, and, and again, I think both of us as athletes, like you were very determined and you don't get to three or four Olympic Games without having, um, some sense of feeling like you can accomplish what you set out to do. So. So I said, okay, like I'll give it another try. And it was then it was great. And so at, that was seven years ago. I'm on the full time faculty in the, in the sports business program and uh, I love it. Awesome. So let's briefly talk with the Olympics are coming up. Yes. Um, what advice would you give to a first time athlete going to the First Olympics? Oh, okay. I'll go ahead. Um,

Speaker 3:          36:29          Gosh, um, I think I, you know, you're so obviously focused on just your, your sport and obviously that's what you should be focused on and, and competing. And all of that. But I think for me it was always about also a balance. I could not, um, at least as for the way I worked as an athlete, I could not 24 hours a day think about my sport. I really did me a disservice. And so I always like to try to remind people to take a little bit of, you know, do something else that will take your mind off of it. And, and you know, and that, that doesn't mean go go party and the, you know, outside, you know, before your event or anything like that. No, no, no, nobody did that. But um, anyway, um, but or spend too much time in the cafeteria, that was the big thing.

Speaker 3:          37:21          Everyone to do not spend so much time the cafeteria at the inside of the Olympic Village because that was just the biggest social social place ever. But um, anyway, but it, but it is there. They're really, you really should just be able to take a little bit of time away from your sport and so balance your Olympic experience and it's okay to, like I said, you know, you go out and enjoy yourself mostly after your event, but even leading up to it, um, to have a good balance of, I think just mental it, you know, the physical side of it at that point, you know, you're not rushing. I mean, yes, you're maintaining whatever you need to do, but you're not looking to like get a major workout into, to hope that your quads are stronger for landing at that point. But it's really a mental, it's such a mental, um, I, you know, pointed that I always say after the Olympics, people say like, Gosh, you know, you know, how do you, how do you feel after your events over after the Olympics are over? And I literally felt like I had held my breath for about four years. And then so when you finally were done, the exhaustion, you know, is, it's really hard to describe, but it's like you finally get to breathe again before you start ramping it up again. But still you, you do. It's exhausting. So, um, my advice I'll, you know, it was just to make sure that you

Speaker 2:          38:43          give yourself a little bit of a break. So I would say, um, to try not to be distracted by everything that's going on at the Games because, uh, Tracy, I'm sure would agree it is such a different experience than any other race that you, that you go to. So if you're on the, if you're on the World Cup tour, you're there with only lose athletes and everybody goes from track to track and you see the same people, you know, a training and a, and in the race. And in that context with the team, you stay in a hotel, you eat all of your meals together. Like at the same time, there's a room where you keep, uh, your sleds, you know, where you can work on your sleds, you get your sled. Do you go put it in the van? You drive to the track. It's pretty, you know, it's, it's pretty simple.

Speaker 2:          39:30          Uh, at the Olympics it's an entirely different things. So at, uh, you know, you're staying at the village with people from, I think what I last read for Pyong Chang, uh, there are 93 countries right now sending athletes to the games. So you're in a village with, you know, athletes from dozens and dozens of a, of countries. Uh, you are, you're not eating necessarily, you know, where the dining hall is, is maybe not great where you stay and where your equipment is stored is someplace else. So like, logistically it's much more complicated and I mean there's a, there's a lot, there's so much going on. Um, you know, being mobile, definitely media requests, um, you know, press conferences and so there's a lot that can sort of draw you, I think outside of your, sort of your zone of a, of focus during the games lose. I felt like we were always really lucky because, uh, the races at the beginning of the Olympics every time. So it's the opening ceremonies are on Friday, men's singles race on Saturday and Sunday the women are on Monday and Tuesday doubles on Wednesday and then you're done. So it's like six days into the games. There are 11 more days to go and you can go and you can go, you go see your teammates compete and then you figure out which a sponsors are having the best parties.

Speaker 3:          40:55          Yeah, yeah, yeah. See for areas as their competent moguls was always first and Ariel's was always second week. So we actually, for Nagano did not even show up for opening ceremonies. We were at a training camp before we, even before we came. So we came well into the first week of the Games. Um, so, uh, yeah. Yeah. And there are, there's definitely a lot of distractions for sure. I always found it so nice. Like you said, you know, when, when we actually got to our site, it felt like home. Um, because you know, you're obviously that's, that's the familiar I already have of, of your sport being there and you're right. Nothing can prepare you for the, when you look down and, well it's different probably at the top of the track, but for us at the top of a of a hill, you look out and see the entire, you know, spect, all the spectators and it's massive.

Speaker 3:          41:48          Can there is like, we obviously have had, yeah, the spectators at World Cups and world championships. Nothing was like the first time I was like, I was like, oh, oh wow this, okay, let's not, let's not focus on that, you know, let's just turn around and just think about what we're doing. Not everyone down there. In fact, this is very funny story and I'm in a 2002 as in deer valley where our site was. I was at the top of the hill just training and can I just healing somebody down at the bottom really like just annoying yelling something. I was that, yeah, Lansky do it, practice jump, come down, back up. Same thing. Come down again and I'm really like, wow, I don't know why this is really irritated me. It was my family. That's why it was my family. And I was like, oh my gosh, I went over, found my phone, called my brothers, and you need to go over there and tell them to be quiet. I was like, oh my gosh, that is really annoying. So it's amazing that that, you know, kind of, uh, you heard that, but yes. Yes, exactly. So anyway, so I do want to open up to audience questions. There's microphones on both sides and maybe

Speaker 2:          42:55          just mentioned that we're both going to the Olympics and pf Chang's. So, uh, I am a, I'm an arbitrator on the Court of Arbitration for Sport and uh, I'm one of six arbitrators who will decide any doping case that comes up at the Olympics. So I'll be over there for the whole time doing that. Yeah. Yeah. I think all of the Russian cases will be taken care of

Speaker 3:          43:18          and Tracy is going to be there as well. Yeah. Getting an award. Well, yeah. So I have a fun question when all people, if people want to start lining up my phone question is, what is the craziest, wildest family friendly Corey of things you saw during the Olympic Village in the Olympic Village? Goodness. Family friendly. Hmm. Wow. Goodness. Uh hmm. Well, I don't know that I have any. Yeah, yeah. Ah, I'm a lawyer. I have no stories and you have no stories. Yeah, exactly. No, you know, I think just with the, the Olympic Village really it has everything in anything. If you wanted to go get your hair done, go get your nails done. Um, you know, they had, uh, they had, uh, um, you know, disco, Yellow Bar. No, no, there was no alcohol inside. I do have a story. Okay. Speaking of bars. Yeah. There's no, there was no alcohol on. Oh, well, campus wasn't finish your story. Yeah. Anyway. Um, and yeah. You know, and I dunno, there's, yeah, it was just very much in all inclusive. Uh, but it was just a very unique, all inclusive.

Speaker 2:          44:34          Yes, yes. Yeah. So, uh, in a, in 1992, a, the Olympics were in France in Albertville. And, uh, the, the main village was in la, in the city of Albertville at, but none of the venues were very close to town. So you had to drive basically two hours to, to any venue and you'd have to drive down a valley and then up at mountain. And then to get to any other venue, you'd have to go back down the mountain backs, you know, down the valley to Albertville and then out in some other directions. So at that games, we lose the illusion. Athletes and bobsled athletes were together in a sort of separate village. Uh, and it was a club med, uh, in La Pylon and there, and there was beer and wine on tap. Well, it was that they were treated, it was like the sort of club med practices were still going on, like, you know, drive around with a cheese called and, and I think after, maybe like the first five days of the Games, I, maybe we drank like all of the wine and beer and ate all of the cheese or something. But they're like, okay, maybe we need to cut a cuddle a little bit off. Yeah. Yep. Exactly. Like audience question.

Speaker 4:          45:41          Thanks so much for coming. I'm curious just given how intense the training is, uh, between games, how athletes support themselves sort of year to year to year as, as their careers sort of stretch?

Speaker 2:          45:54          Yeah, great question. Uh, so, uh, so I was a, I was on the national team for 14 years and uh, and lose, uh, had and still has some, uh, there's like a race incentive programs so you can, depending on where you finish in World Cup races, uh, win money, that's a, that comes from the u s Luge Association. So I did well enough that I, uh, I got enough money that, uh, that I supported myself through that. And there were also grants available like through the, uh, through the US Olympic committees. So, so I, I feel like I was fairly fortunate in that respect that I didn't have to, you know, work like that much. I did, you know, some at school, but, uh, but otherwise I didn't really have that really big challenge, I think of sort of balancing work and, uh, and training at the same time. But, uh, so, so I think some athletes sort of survive that way. Some have, you know, sponsorships that help support them and then others I think, I think I can can be a really big challenge.

Speaker 3:          46:49          Yeah, absolutely. You know, support yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Same here. I mean we would have ski sponsors, boots, sponsors. I had gear sponsors, so you would set up a retainer with your sponsor and then a victory schedule depending on how well you did throughout the year or if you made the world championship team. He um, you get a bonus for that are obviously Olympic team and all of that. And also for us the way you were on a team B team c team, so you would get some funding from your federation as well cover, you know, uh, you know, flight and travel and training expenses basically. But, um, you know, having said that, exactly, what's really difficult, I think in general with is when you're trying to come up through the ranks, it's such a double edged sword because you can't get sponsors without results. Well, you can't get results until you actually start competing.

Speaker 3:          47:38          And so it is so difficult I think for, for upcoming upcoming athletes too, to be able to, unless you have parents that can finance it, you do, you have to get a second job. Eric Burgiss gold medalist in 1998 lived out of his car, ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for, I don't know how many summers in years. I mean that you just wanted to do it. One good thing is the Olympic training centers now lake placid and Colorado Springs, depending on your sport, you can go there and live, live and have that. But again, you have to also have worked your way up to a certain point. So it's difficult. Yeah, it's not a, it's not always an easy, unfortunately you, you probably lose some really incredible talent just due to lack of support.

Speaker 2:          48:23          And I, and I think in Olympic sport, most athletes don't have, you know, really big sponsors or a ton of financial support. So like the Michael Phelps of the world are, you know, very few and far between in Olympic sports. So most of us do it because you love it.

Speaker 3:          48:38          11 yeah. The shelf life of even a gold medalist these days is so short, especially now with the Olympics being every two years. So as soon as you know the winter games are over, boom, you're, you've got maybe a month to kind of really, um, you know, if you want to meddle in and do everything with media that you can try to, you know, reap those benefits. But then sponsors are looking at the next Olympics already right after that. So again, there's, there's clearly exceptions to that, the to those rules for sure. But majority of Olympians, you gotta love what you do. You got to love the sport, you got to love it. Um, you're not going to, even if you are a gold metal does not mean you are set for life. So

Speaker 2:          49:19          audience question. Hi. I have two questions. The first is actually related to what you're just talking about with this shift from being every two years this winter and summer versus when they were concurrent, like how you saw things change. And the other is, uh, can you talk about your day to day or like a week, what would a week look like with training and how did your training groups changed as he went from one Olympics to the next? So, uh, the, I, I kind of went through that a, the transition from when, uh, the summer and winter games were in the same year or two, you know, being staggered every, every two. Uh, so, uh, 1992 was the last year that summer in winter we're in the same year and then winter was again in [inaudible] 94. So normally, which, Eh, you know, it sounds great, like I had four Olympics in 10 years, but actually that was a, it was a really quick turnaround because normally like after our games you, you've kind of got a like a year where you might experiment with your equipment and try a new sled or some different things that, because you've got cover in time leading up to the next games.

Speaker 2:          50:23          But after 92, it was like, okay, we're actually that next season you were qualifying for the Olympics again, a already. So I think though that it's for winter sports particularly, I think it's, it's good that it's a, that the games are every two years because the media can, uh, can focus on, um, you know, give as much attention almost. Uh, it's a winter as a, as, as the summer. So I think that, I know for and in general it's a, it's positive. Um, and uh, on the, on the training, uh, um, front in the, it's so it's different sort of in the winter and the summer sort of in season and out of season. But uh, in season usually a, if you're, we would be at like a track for no longer than a week. So if you're in the, if you're in the World Cup season, the race ends on Sunday, you pack up all of your stuff and we lose like the equipment is heavy.

Speaker 2:          51:15          And uh, one time we were in the, we were in the airport and there was a, a scale in the floor and we actually put all of the stuff on to it. You had to weigh it. And we're always, we're paying like extra baggage fees. But when we literally had a ton of equipment, so you had to pack that up every Sunday into the cargo van and then you drive to the next place. So usually then Monday, like afternoon, you'd be on the track, you train twice a day on the track, get a physical workout in, work on your sled, take a nap, eat. So it's a, you're, you're pretty much in a, in a routine that summertime it's, you know, you might be, I was at Dartmouth a lot of, a lot of the time or in lake placid and that's more like in the gym I'm doing start practice and more, more physical training.

Speaker 3:          52:01          Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, so I, my first Olympics was 94 and I, I, my first year on the team was 91. So, um, you know that your, your having been in the Olympics and then have to turn around. I did not experience that, but um, but I was actually very happy when it got on the team that the Olympics were coming again in two years. So for me, um, yeah, uh, you know, that's, I agree. I think it's good for Winter Olympic, uh, Olympics to be its own, um, you know, its own year, so to speak, because I do think that when they were concurrent that Eh, you know, summer always kind of overshadow winter. So, um, anyway, I think that that's, I think it's a good thing. Um, so training, yes. Gosh, for training, for Ariel's. Um, our summer time training is definitely far more intense than, um, than it is when we're on the road.

Speaker 3:          52:52          Once you're on the road and competing week to week, it's more of a maintenance, um, type of, um, you know, uh, mentality so to speak. But our summer training definitely was pretty intense. We would get up and have a couple hours on the trampoline. We do a couple of hours, uh, water ramping. Um, we'd have lunch, we'd go to the gym for another couple hours and sometimes even a trampoline session at nighttime. So it just, it kind of, uh, we inside the gym, so to speak. But, um, so yeah. And you were just really trying to, you know, you would definitely, I think it, it, you know, it depends on where you are in your career. Obviously if you're, you're just starting off and you're a rookie, you're really trying to do a lot more jumps in qualifying, a lot of jumps as your, you know, becoming more of a veteran on the team.

Speaker 3:          53:37          You're trying to have a different type of training. It's quality over quantity basically. Um, so that's, that's kind of how, how it worked. Um, you know, in the summertime everyone kind of had more of an individualized plan depending on what you were, what you were doing, uh, with your, with your jumps. But, and then, yeah, the winner pretty much with Cameron said, I mean, it's week to week train traveling. Um, you'd get into a site on Monday, you would work on the jumps. You would hopefully at least have one day of training on the jumps sometimes with whether you didn't even get to train on the jump till the day you competed, which was never fun. But usually you have at least one or two days of training. You'd compete back up, move on to the next, next place. So it'd probably one thing I would add to this for both of us would be, um, maybe later in your career you might spend some time in sports medicine and doing some rehab on your various joints. A, I've had four knee surgeries and one on each shoulders. So, uh, it's, it takes a tick, definitely takes a toll on the body for a skier. I actually have both my acs, which is very rare. So I've been, I feel like I got out of the sport pretty unscathed. I, yeah, I definitely have some things, but Tracy, Cameron, thank you for being here. Thank you so much for coming and, uh, that's it. Awesome. Thanks everybody. Thanks.
