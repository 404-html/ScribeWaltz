Speaker 1:          00:08          We're so excited to have

Speaker 2:          00:10          20 here hear from Austin. Um, I think most of you know her. Um, for her, she has fought tirelessly, uh, first as a Texas state senator and then, um, and her run for governor, uh, Fort Women's reproductive rights, uh, gender equal pay, Lgbtq rights, justice for sexual assault survivors just has an incredible track record. Um, and I think you probably also know her for a somewhat historic 13 hour filibuster in some cases, sneakers.

Speaker 1:          00:41          MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:42          And most recently she has started an advocacy group called deeds, not words, which we're going to talk about today. That is all about channeling the energy and passion for gender equality into actionable change. So hello everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00          So why don't we start with deeds, not words and tell us a little bit about it and why you founded it. I

Speaker 3:          01:05          started deeds, not words. It's a nonprofit organization about a year ago. It really starting from the perspective of wanting to make sure that we were giving the best opportunity for that next generation of young women who are going to be the filibuster errors of the future to find their way to that path. Um, I travel and speak a lot and I was frequently asked a question that I'm still asked a lot, which is what do we do right? And, and you see this incredible knowledge and passion, but sometimes a struggle about where to connect that to action. And so deeds, not words was born really with two big ideas in mind. One is to make sure that we're putting together in one place an area that you can go to a hub, our digital hub, and you can find a variety of different organizations and the work that they're doing in the gender equality world.

Speaker 3:          02:07          And it's separated by health. So things that are happening in the reproductive rights world. For example, safety, which of course includes campus sexual assault, human trafficking and sexual assault, criminal justice reform work. Um, economic opportunity, which includes a lot of organizations that are working on equality of pay on affordable quality, child care, on increasing the minimum wage on family leave policies. All of those things that make such an important difference in our ability to equalize our economic opportunity in this country. And then leadership, there are so many different organizations who have one based right here in California emerge that are really there for women to make sure that where we have women who are thinking about stepping forward and running for office, they have the support around and the system that helps them to raise money and to have the resources and the knowledge that they need to do that and to do it well.

Speaker 3:          03:07          So that's what we do in the digital space. We have a weekly digital newsletter called the deeds digest. And in that newsletter we inform, we try to inspire, I hope we do sometimes and we end each deeds digest with the dues of the week. And those dues always tie in to the things that we talked about in that particular newsletter. And then we do a daily deed. We started doing that just a few weeks ago, um, post women's march, trying to make sure that where people were looking for a way to plug in and some direction and guidance in that regard. We do that. That's all the digital part of what we do. The other piece of it, and certainly this is how I found my way into the political world, is helping us to find our power as advocates. It can be kind of hard to navigate your way into that and to know exactly how to do it.

Speaker 3:          04:03          I think that indivisible has been such an important resource and helping people to see how we can use our voices in a very, very powerful way. And I love the structure and the guidance that they've put together for that. We are doing tactical trainings of advocacy work. So we started in Texas. We have our eye on several other states that we want to expand into, but we're working with both high school and college age, young women. And we're helping to foster their voices into the legislative process. So they're working on two key issues right now with a number of legislators, kind of from idea to how you write a piece of legislation to coming to committee hearings and testifying for it and how you present yourself and how to make a most effective argument. And the areas that we're really focusing on in that work are sex trafficking of minors and also sexual assault reforms in both the criminal justice world rape kit backlog, for example, statute of limitations issues, but also campus sexual assault and kind of changing the landscape of what our understanding is about consent.

Speaker 3:          05:19          Um, how we define that, how we define um, yes, rather than no means no. What, what does it mean to say yes. Um, so we're focused on, on those things and we find that our young audience is very interested and passionate about those particular issues. And so it's been a really good way to foster their advocacy skills. What's been the most surprising thing that you've discovered since starting? I guess just the, the challenge of taking an idea. I can do the political thing pretty well. I know how to navigate my way in that. And that's a learning curve too, just like anything. But it's a learning curve for me right now. How to take these ideas and most effectively implement them and just how hard it is to be a startup. A startup nonprofit is no different really than a startup profit other than you obviously don't need to make money. You need people to donate money to the vcs are maybe a little less excited about the nonprofit. Sorry. I guess that's so true. Yeah. Um, but I think most surprising is just how eager people are to, to be connected in ways that make them feel like their voices really make a difference and they do make a difference. They truly do.

Speaker 2:          06:40          And what, and so it sounds like from everything you're talking about that to you, the biggest way to affect political change, kind of the current political landscape. Would it be to get more women out there? Nope. Awesome. Um, what, what else? Like what else? Obviously you need to have your focus on, on, on, on say, advocacy. What other areas do you think could be making a difference right now? I'm sure there are a lot of people in this room and on the livestream that want to know how they could get more involved. What do you think is the most effective?

Speaker 3:          07:08          You and I had a great conversation a moment ago before we came up here and I thought you actually characterize and crystallize this perfectly. What you were saying was that we have to pick those two or three things that we are really going to care about and dive into and try to avoid the temptation because there's so much going on right now, um, to weigh in an every little space. So whatever that area of passion is for you, whether it's the environment or Lgbtq equality or transgender rights and specific or women's equality and all of the different realms of that, find the place that really connects to you or that you connect to. Because what you'll find, I've certainly always found this in my life. If you follow the thing that you really care about and you use your energy on that thing, it's going to take you to a place that you wouldn't have expected and it's going to be unbelievably fulfilling but personally, but also with your ability to actually have an impact on it because it's coming from a place that's really true too.

Speaker 3:          08:25          So whatever that is, look for organizations that are working in that world. You know, if it's voting rights, you know, a Clu, um, if it's a women's reproductive freedoms, obviously you know, the incredible organizational work of groups like planned parenthood and Nay Raul, but maybe you don't know so much about the center for reproductive rights, which is doing all the legal work on this and actually were the, the major impetus behind successful supreme court case that we won last year. Um, maybe you care particularly about making sure that women have access to safe and legal abortion. And you want to really get into the ground level of that and support organizations like the Lilith Fund, which makes sure that women can afford to have an abortion if they otherwise don't have the financial means to do that. So there's so many different ways to plug in and what we hope to do with our website and we're actually in a revamp of it right now to make it much more meaningful.

Speaker 3:          09:30          If you're looking for that place to plug in. Um, we want to be a place where you can go and depending on that area of interest, you plug into one of those organizations and you will find immediately two or three key ways that they're asking for you to get involved on a realtime basis, some more intense and some less intense, but ways where you can meaningfully be contributing your time and your energy. And what about companies? What role do you think companies should or shouldn't have? Have you seen their advocacy be effective? I think there are, advocacy is tremendously effective. Um, I'm sensitive obviously to the fact that companies walk, uh, uh, quite a fine line in terms of not wanting to get involved so much in the partisan world. And that makes sense because they have consumers who sit on both sides of that line.

Speaker 3:          10:27          They have, I'm sure employees that sit on both sides of that line. But I think we find our way into the things that make sense when we are being very issue focused. And so for example, last year in my home state of Texas, uh, American Airlines became the title sponsor of the planned parenthood luncheon in Dallas for the very first time. I almost cried. I literally, I was so blown away by it because it means such a powerful statement for a company like that to say we support women's reproductive healthcare and this organization and in the face of all the political flack that planned parenthood is in the midst of, we're going to step forward and we're going to do this. So I think, you know, for companies to find their way into issue areas that really mattered to them and to use their influence. And there are many ways for them to do that.

Speaker 3:          11:27          Of course, we certainly saw the incredible impact in North Carolina last year with the transgender bathroom bill, Texas, by the way. It's trying to replicate that right now. And I'm pleased to see we've got some corporate push back already beginning to percolate. But that corporate push back in North Carolina not only contributed to really, um, uh, an economic impact to the state, but it made such a powerful statement economically that it impacted the way voters thought about that issue. So that in the last gubernatorial race that they had during the presidential election cycle, they elected a statewide democrat. Um, that was considered a really long shot thing to do there actually. And they did it because people, now we're coming at this issue from a variety of perspectives, whether it was something that they cared about from their social conscience or whether they cared about it because they understand, understood it was having an impact economically to their state and maybe to their own book.

Speaker 3:          12:35          Uh, that's what companies have the power to do and to, to broaden the conversation in a way that really does lift it up out of the social and makes it something that's much more meaningful in the day to day lives of people who have respect for or who are impacted by the decisions and the actions that that company takes. So where do you think companies are still being silent? Like why don't, what issue do you wish companies are speaking out more of that? When I looked at what happened in North Carolina, um, with appreciation and awe for the companies that stepped forward so powerfully on that and objected to it, I found myself longing for that same response in other areas. Um, I of course am very focused on gender equality and I wish we saw more of that when it came to issues that particularly impact women in Texas.

Speaker 3:          13:32          When we pass that antiabortion bill in 2013 that was in and of itself terrible. But what happened actually two years prior to that that a lot of people didn't know about, there was no big filibuster. It didn't capture the attention of people around the world in 2011 in an assault on planned parenthood, there was a dramatic defunding of women's health care there and they couldn't really de-select just planned parenthood. Um, and so what happened was that there was this wholesale withdrawal of funds. Number one, the state decided to no longer participate in the women's health program, which was giving us about $30 million a year for women's reproductive health care. It's aimed particularly at lowering the Medicaid birth rate and saving taxpayer money by virtue of doing it. And it really was saving a tremendous amount of taxpayer money. Um, we deep participated in that and that affected not just planned parenthood, but everyone that was getting money for birth control, reproductive healthcare services in our state.

Speaker 3:          14:44          And then there was also a $78 million state defunding of these women's reproductive healthcare centers. None of these were providing abortion care, not a single one. And overnight we had over 80 clinics close all over our state. Those that still remained open. We're hobbled really badly and could only see a small percentage of the patients that they'd been seeing. And there's a wide range of estimates about the number of women who were impacted, but it's anywhere from 100 to 180,000 women in one fell swoop. And we see the circumstances of that in our state. We have the highest maternal death rate of any developed country in the world. In the state of Texas. Our maternal death rate doubled in about a six year period of time. So these are dramatic, horrific human consequences that women are getting sucked into by virtue of partisan politics. And I want to see companies step forward and say, when these sorts of things are happening, you know, we were going to relocate our corporate headquarters to Dallas, Texas, and now we've decided not to, or were the NCA and we were going to host the final four there and now we've decided not to or were the Superbowl and we were coming, but now we're not going to, I want to see that kind of response when women are under assault because it's not just that we are failing to realize our full equal opportunity.

Speaker 3:          16:21          It's that we literally are the shrapnel in these political wars where human lives are being impacted and devastating ways. And it's something that we all ought to care about because at the end of the day, it impacts everyone. And at the end of the day, it impacts our economy as well. So how do you do it? How do you get women into this obviously disproportionately dramatically affects the poor, right? And then you have a wealthier women who are at companies who are at these companies. How do you get them to stand up in the same way that people have stood up for other rights, like rights for other groups that they don't necessarily belong to? I think part of it starts within the culture of the organization, the company itself. Right. And what does the, what is the makeup of that company look like in terms of the number of women on it's board, the number of women that are in the executive suites of that company.

Speaker 3:          17:18          That has a lot of influence in these conversations. Um, and so continuing for gender equality in the positions that women occupy is a very important part of that. Josh says is the case for making sure that we have women fully reflected at every level of representative government in this country unless, and until we have that, we're not going to move this conversation really where it needs to go, but we have an opportunity as employees and as to to exert our own influences. Uh, we've been talking about that a bit at deeds, not words. When I first was hatching this idea, one of the things I wanted us ultimately to be able to do is to weigh in as consumers and to help direct consumer decision making based on a company's score with how well it's doing to support gender equality. Is this a company where there are, um, a representative number of women in the executive suites and on the board is, it's a company that's like salesforce done a self examination of pay equity and worked hard to make sure they were equalizing.

Speaker 3:          18:32          It is that a company that has a good a family leave policy both for dads and moms so that we do have true gender equality in the way that that's happening and helping to drive people's positive buying decisions based on companies that score well in that regard. Right now. I'm sure you've all seen grab your wallet and Grab Your Wallet is doing, uh, I think an interesting job of making sure that they're making people aware of how to take their dollars away as consumers from companies who aren't behaving well. I have found myself responding to that. Um, and, and thinking about which rideshare company I'm going to use for example, or, um, which retail establishment, not Macy's that I'm going to shop at. Um, I have my unexperienced with Macy's because they actually advocated against an equal pay law in Texas and were successful in getting the governor to veto an equal pay law that I worked very, very hard on.

Speaker 3:          19:36          So if any of your shopping at Macy's, it's going to add my 2 cents to what's already on the grab your wallet site when it comes to that particular company. But we have influences in that regard and I think we're starting to see some of the response that private companies are making to watching the way consumers are responding. This young woman that we were talking about earlier who just recently left Uber and who shared her story essentially for the outside world and the immediate impact that that's had a while, she worked within that culture for a very long time trying to change it, bringing outside attention on it and having the, the executive offices have to deal with the public opinion of their company based on that. That experience, I think it has shown we have a lot of power. If we can really kind of focus that you had to think an acronym to see easier. Right? Right now it's very almost, it's an entirely almost offline or an individual experience where yes, Kay, you can post

Speaker 2:          20:48          on social that you've done boycotted something or support something. But it'll be interesting to see how that evolves is that I think the tech solutions get easier with a company, like you said, the companies that are doing the things that align with your values and how that gets surfaced. So how did you get into politics and what was the moment where you were just like, Oh wow, I'm a big deal.

Speaker 3:          21:07          I haven't had, I promise you I haven't had that moment. I'm like, what? That when you went to cabinet or during a filibuster. Yeah. I, I know we all do this, but I think women particularly do this. We take in all the things that we're not achieving as opposed to celebrating the things that we're doing well, right? We tend to be very self critical. Um, but my entree into politics and the reason that I was really committed to the advocacy training work of deeds, not words happened when I went to a city council meeting, I was in my thirties. I was arguing for something in my neighborhood along with, you know, a lot of other people in the neighborhood community. And I walked into that council chamber, express my opinion and then just got the idea, well, I could be one of those people sitting up there, you know, and this is interesting actually, and I think I would really thrive in this environment.

Speaker 3:          22:03          And so it just opened up the idea for me. I had not been paying attention to politics. I was one of those people that I really work on right now. Um, I was a young single mom. I was working two jobs and going to school and my struggles did not include the thought about how my voice could make a difference in the political world. And I, I really didn't set up and pay attention to it until I saw Hillary Clinton fighting for universal health care as first lady. That was kind of my first, you know, tug into it where it, it seemed relevant and meaningful to me based on my own experiences and struggles with healthcare as an uninsured person. So we find our ways. Again, I think, um, when we are, we're help to demystify that process where we see that those fancy capitol buildings, whether we're talking about the one in DC or the ones around our states, those buildings belong to us.

Speaker 3:          23:08          There's nothing really mysterious or, or intimidating about them. And I think we have to demystify them. And, and I'm pleased to be doing that for some young people in my own state and helping them to see that, you know, the people that are elected there, while they may refer to it as my district or my office, the district is actually one that belongs to the people. Our office belongs to us. They have to at least at some level listened to us, even if they do avoid us in town halls, which some of them around the country have been doing, but we the power to speak out by calling their offices right in their offices, coming to committee hearings and letting them know how we feel about things. And um, I hope that the more people we can encourage and to that venue, the more young women will see that they have every right to be sitting up at those decision making tables and that they'll begin to view that as something that they want to do for themselves.

Speaker 2:          24:12          And you know, I imagine one of the most discouraging things when you're thinking about running for any kind of office or speaking up is that you always know that this is all going to be seen through the lens of your gender. And I remember, I mean, I remember when you were running for governor and there was like how many hours a week did you spend with your kids? Right? Or it was like how many days in a month when you were, did you go back to see your kids, which you never ever, ever, right, right. What happen? Um, and it's got to be something that's quite discouraging. Not only just the public aspect of the soul, but knowing that you're going to be, you have to fight twice as hard to be taken seriously. How, you know, how did you navigate that? I mean, was it, do you know, to a certain degree you'd have to play that game that you can't transcend it entirely the same time you want to have control over your narrative. How did you to

Speaker 3:          24:57          approach that or how do you purchase it today too? For me, it's, it's still one of the most frustrating experiences that I've had in the political world and women faced this and you know, every level of profession. One of the things that was successfully done to me during my gubernatorial race, and it was really kind of, I mean, if I stand aside and just look at it as a spectator, I'm rather fascinated by it being in the middle of it. It was horrific and painful. Um, but one of the clever things that happens in the political world is trying to figure out how to take a candidates best asset and make it their weakness. And that's what happened with me. My asset was my story, the American dream story of coming from poverty, struggling, fighting, making my way all the way through Harvard law school, first person in my family to ever even go to college, nevermind graduate.

Speaker 3:          26:04          And then to, you know, have a career where I gave back to my own life experiences and the things that I fought for that, that was my feather, right? That was the thing that I could distinguish myself about. Well, my story got ripped out from under me. I was a bad mother. I commuted back and forth from Boston to Fort Worth and my second and third year of law school because that first year, taking my girls there with me, what's not just really hard on me. It was so hard on them. Um, and where a man would never have been questioned about that. My Bona Fides as a mother was called in to question. My two daughters actually had to come forward. And, uh, they wrote a very heartfelt letter that they read publicly about my bonafide, he's has a mother. Um, you just wouldn't see this happening for men, but I understood why they were doing it.

Speaker 3:          27:11          And I also understood with some of the labels that they used with me why they were doing them. Abortion Barbie was a label that was used quite often for me. And in fact, when I came to do some fundraising in southern California during that race, there were these big posters that have been put up all over la with, there were three d posters with a Barbie plastic transparent, uh, belly with a plastic baby doll in the belly and me with scissors in my hand. Um, so why would they do that? Well, a couple of things. Number one, they wanted to make me a candidate that was all about abortion and to take away the entire body of work that I had done as a public servant and what I had to offer as a candidate. But they also wanted the Barbie image was very purposeful.

Speaker 3:          28:07          If we can invite voters to think about women candidates in terms of how we look, then we dismiss our capacities as leaders. We're inviting people to think about them as mothers and bad mothers at that. Um, as women who are no more than the makeup of what we look like and to therefore take away our perspectives about our true value as leaders. It happens to women in the political world all the time. I am not unique. Uh, it was particularly bad in my race and it's particularly bad in Hillary's race, but it happens to women all the time. And I think, you know, the, the best way to ride through that and to rise above it is to continue to fight back every single time and to pop right back up. That, that was one of the things that I always admired about Hillary. I've never seen anyone that could pop right back up and get back out there and fight another day.

Speaker 3:          29:12          And it's unfortunate that we have to do it, but it's the reality. And I think unless and until we have more women in those gubernatorial mansions and, and until we have a woman in the White House and we can show the incredible capacity that women have to lead in those executive positions, we're going to continue to struggle with these stereotypes. So I really committed to just doing everything we can to chip away at it and school boards and city councils and every state legislative, um, body in this country and obviously at the congressional and of course the presidential level too.

Speaker 2:          29:56          And so you, you've lost the race and you know, in the valley we love to talk about failure and it makes us all stronger. And like there's usually a story, oh, I failed at this and then I, you know, it was bankrupt and I looked up at the stars and realize that it disrupts the auto industry or something. Right. And then you become this like a millionaire. Did you have an equivalent moment? I mean, did you take anything from that failure?

Speaker 3:          30:17          Most definitely. I, I wrote an essay for Lena Dunham's Lenny letter, um, just within a few months of that race. And if it's okay for me to say a curse word, the title of my essay was I fucking hate to lose. Um, and, and I talked about just what a competitive person I am by nature. I'm sure a lot of you are as well. Um, but that, you know, going back to that beautiful Teddy Roosevelt, um, quote about what it means to be in the ring, to be that person who sweats and tries their hardest and comes up short, but how much more glorious it is to be that person than to be the person who's standing on the sideline as the critic. Right? It's only when we put ourselves out there and we risk losing that we will ever move the ball. Um, there's value no matter what in that moving of the ball.

Speaker 3:          31:27          I know in the political world that in places like Texas, a lot of times these conversations, these hard conversations that need to be had about policy, they're not being had except for when we have these big statewide contest where we can raise the conversation and the level of consciousness around them. And for me that was really important part of running for office. Um, but the same can be said of anything that we are working to do, anything we're striving for that's hard and that we may fail at every attempt we make at it advances that a little bit and we ultimately will succeed in those goals, whether it's me individually or not. I will have played a part in moving that ball forward. And, and so in my essay Wa what I said was if you're going to fail, like fail big, fail gloriously trying to do something that really matters to you and when you fail and you deal with that, um, consequence in terms of how that feels, really try to center around how extraordinary you are that you tried it and that you, you moved to the ball and then if you've got it in you and I hope you do get back up and try to do it again.

Speaker 3:          32:53          And let me just, I've got more questions, but I bet there's probably some stories. So do we are we didn't live as well.

Speaker 4:          32:58          Yeah. How do you combat and deal with people who have violently opposed views to you even on like base principles and then get to talking policy with them afterwards if they're base beliefs are different.

Speaker 3:          33:10          There's some people that you can't talk to. Um, I know that's not a very, um, in my leather side of experience, for example, I really prided myself on working across the aisle and got quiet. A lot of legislation passed doing that. You have to do that in Texas have it's, uh, quite, um, predominantly republican place. But there are some areas where it's worth drawing that line. You know, where you, you can't find a way to compromise. And I think the most effective way to communicate when you're in that place or any of these places actually, even where you do find that middle is to do it through personal experiences and, and human stories. A lot of times we have these conversations up in the ethereal world and we're kind of stuck in our own ideological way of thinking about them. But when we can make them more real, it really makes a difference.

Speaker 3:          34:15          So a great example of how that can move the ball and the conversation around Lgbtq equality that really began to move when a great deal of work was done. Determining how to talk about it and to talk about it in a way that was more resonant than had been the case. It had been talked about specifically as equality and that we all ought to care about it just to be, you know, living in a full and equal world that we all ought to be treated that way. But the conversation shifted purposefully. So to be much more personal and a lot of work actually was done in your state around that door to door conversations with people were, had, were um, couples who are impacted by the inequality of marriage equality, for example, would go to a older Republican household and say, we want to talk to you about why this matters to us. It really shifted people's thinking about it and it's because it, it became personal and because they saw it as something personal. Storytelling is powerful. And I love seeing the fact that it's becoming more and more prominent and that technology as has such a great platform for people to share stories and to influence based on that. A lot of abortion story sharing going on online, um, post 2013 and the filibuster and kind of people's consciousness raising about that. And I think that's our most effective way to try to get through hard conversations. But that doesn't mean everyone's always right.

Speaker 5:          36:01          Hi, I'm Monica and I'm so excited that you're here. I grew up in south Texas. Um, and when I was growing up and Richards was the governor, so I'm going to ask a question just on the topic of failure again. Um, she was the first governor I got to vote for. I went on to work in, um, President Clinton's first White House, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein. All these women were, were running and I felt so invigorated as a young woman coming out of college. Um, it's a very different story now and I look at that from when I was young and where we are now. Everything that Hillary Clinton's had to go through. Everything that Elizabeth Warren is going through, et Cetera, everything you've gone through. And thank you by the way, for going through that. Um, where have we failed and what do I tell my daughter?

Speaker 3:          36:55          It's such a hard question. The, what do I tell my daughter? That was such a hard question. Um, the night of the election, I have a 34 year old and a 28 year old daughter and I was at the event in Manhattan. I had phone conversations with both of my daughters that evening. Both of them crying their eyes out and both of them asking questions from a place of what was real fear, what's going to happen, what's going to happen. Um, I'm feel really optimistic right now about the, what's going to happen because I am so encouraged by the personal reaction that people have had to saying, we're going to step forward and we're going to use our voices. What you tell your daughter, I hope is to participate in that with you. To the extent that you participate in it. Show her through role modeling the power that you have and how you're going to express it and show her that you're going to sustain it.

Speaker 3:          38:05          I think that's one of the big questions right now. Are we going to sustain this enthusiasm that we have right now for our values and our desire to make sure that they're going to be heard? Um, but at that top level, once again, I think it is our very important responsibility to make sure that we're doing everything we can to create legislative bodies, reflect who we are as a community. Um, and that doesn't just mean making sure we have women, it means making sure we have women of color who are dramatically underrepresented and legislative bodies around this country that we have transgender, uh, representatives that we have people from different cultures and religions and backgrounds, both socioeconomically and otherwise. Unless we're really reflected in the decision makers, we're not going to move things forward as productively and as effectively and as quickly as we'd like to see.

Speaker 3:          39:14          So if you're going to spend your energy somewhere, I would say run for office, um, or, or you know, find a candidate that you can get behind and that you can help, not just by writing them a $5 check every week, but making sure that, you know, you're gonna knock on some doors for them and you have some conversations about why their election makes a difference. Republicans for a long time, I've been very astute at building from the base up and making sure that they are putting people in places where they have the potential to climb in the political world. So those school board races and city council races, which is where I started to, um, it, it's a really important way for us to make an impact.

Speaker 6:          40:02          Hi, my name is Meena and um, first I just want to say thanks for coming and also thank you cause I, you really personally affected me. Um, I actually did knock on doors for you in Texas as part of, um, um, and I, I really, I want to say that I feel like you revitalize politics in Texas. Um, everyone that I spoke to, we spoke to a number of people who actually said, you know, we're switching parties. Like they were frustrated and, and I felt like you had a big part in that thing. Um, and you know, as you mentioned, we are seeing a revitalization in interest in politics and people getting involved. Um, one of my questions are, one of my question is you also see women voting against their own interests a lot of the time. And you know, I feel like it is because they just focus on one issue. How can we make it a larger conversation so that they actually perhaps want to start supporting each other rather than tearing each other down.

Speaker 3:          41:13          Um, I like the way you ended that last question because it made me think of something that Chelsea Handler's had recently about women that we've been taught to tackle, not to climb. And I do think sometimes we can be each other's own worst enemy because there's a lot of judgment that goes on, right? Depending on the choices that we've made, our own lives and careers or whether that career is outside the home or inside the home. Um, this is the $20 million question though. How do we make sure that people aren't voting against their own interests? And there's a lot of education that needs to take place because people aren't going to vote against their own interest because they think they're voting against their interests. They really believe they're voting in their interests. Right? Um, and I, I think Democrats have failed, myself included and doing a good job of communicating why it is that our values are ones that really are, are more in alignment with most peoples in this country.

Speaker 3:          42:20          Um, and there's a lot of work being done right now on how do we reframe the narrative and how do we do a better job of talking about that. But back to that personal storytelling again, um, where we have experiences that we can share with people who may disagree with us and paint a picture of a real person and an impact that would feel more compelling to them, where you have opportunities to do that. I think that's the most powerful way to cut through that. And particularly if there's a way to paint within their own perspective what's happening to them. Visa vi a person that they may have thought was actually aligned with their interests.

Speaker 6:          43:05          So first of all, I agree with the optimism. Um, and I think that's just because everyone's having such a big wake up call. So when I came to this country four years ago from London, I was maybe a latent feminist. I mean, I've always believed in equality, et Cetera, but it wasn't an issue for me. And then I came to the balcony where everyone was male and everyone was working in tech and everyone was white. Eh, these issues, kind of what became more important for me personally, but now it's like, it's because it's so bad this Trump, it feels like the entire kind of middle ground of people who just didn't care anymore and didn't seem to be caring about politics. I've been awake and so I actually think this might turn out to be a good thing. I don't think she hang up. But I wanted to ask you about this, um, question about personal storytelling, which I totally understand.

Speaker 6:          43:52          Um, in terms of building tolerance, right? Like if you relating to this person, um, it's different. And it reminds me when I was 16, I was in upstate New York as an exchange student and a family that was, you know, Aniko blatantly racist, all these things. And so my dad would like shout it back, people out the odd out of this pickup truck, my host dad and, but then like Bob, who is the black guy who worked with him, like somehow didn't, it wasn't black, right? Cause he was bald because he knew him. So I think that's, that's sort of what you're guessing at is right. It's like once you, once you know the person, you can no longer put them into this category of otherness. Right? Um, but on the flip side of the politicians, it seems like we're moving further and further away from issues and more and more about the personality. And that jump got elected because of his personality that appeals to TV viewers. That, and it was nothing about the issues, right? Everyone ignored all the issues. So how can we square those things? Like how can we get, should we get politics away from personalities and more towards issues again? Or is that just impossible?

Speaker 3:          44:57          I don't, I don't know if that's possible, but I think a lot of people to would tell you that they supported Donald Trump because they did believe that he was supportive of policies that we're going to have a positive impact on their lives. So whether we were talking about people who had been impacted by automation, but he gave an easy target to blame, which was an immigrant workforce that had taken your job. Uh, whether we're talking about people who worked in industries where environmental evolution and the protections of environmental laws had, um, decreased the employment capacity in that particular sector and they'd been impacted by that. They heard him speaking to them about that. Um, never underestimate the massage mini that is out there and the, even if it's not something that people bring forward consciously their own subconscious feelings about the threat that equality in the workforce means to their own livelihoods and success.

Speaker 3:          46:07          He spoke powerfully to a lot of those things and people were responding to them. Um, but I love your, your example about Bob Bright because that's the only way that we can really counter that. There was a great story in the New York Times yesterday about a Mexican gentleman who was, um, detained recently and he's probably going to be deported. And in the small Iowa town, he was so well loved and everyone was saying, well, yeah, we support, you know, rounding up and deporting, but not him. I, we, I think his name was Carlos. We'd love Carlos, you know, and Carlos had done all these incredible things in the community. Like supporting firefighters and always being the person there with the food drives and different things like that and you know, everyone loves them. So making it the reality come to life for people is really a way to take a step back and to, to, to look at things differently.

Speaker 3:          47:14          The real challenge that we have is not that their personalities and politics that can be persuasive. Um, but that we have a media culture where people self select the prism through which they viewed news and they're going to hear things and be told things very differently depending on that self selection. Right. That to me is the greatest challenge that we have is cutting through the version of things that you find on different news sources and the um, the decisions or the opinions that you formed based on, on what you hear coming from, from those filters. And we all owe a responsibility again to take the power away from their version and, and put the power into a reality version that's based on real human impact is hard. But we each have an we're each and influencer and we each have an opportunity to do it to our spheres of influence.

Speaker 5:          48:19          Hi. Um, I'm an immigrant, a woman and a Latina, so I 100% relate to your daughter's fear about what's going on. Um, and on top of that, I like many others that have sort of like the opposite concern from hers. I'm raising a white meal in a Silicon Valley, um, and I'm deeply concerned about what he's going to grow up listening to, um, at school and on, on the TV and so on. Um, it was very frustrating not being able to vote last election. Um, so I guess my, my question to you would be how do you think, um, we did not get to vote in this country can have the biggest impact beyond the ballots and

Speaker 3:          49:09          um, and, and you know, and myriad of ways and again, find that thing that feels most authentic and a value to you personally. Um, if it's in the political space, obviously supporting candidates and working for them, even if you can't vote for them. For example, in Texas, I had a large number of dreamers who worked really, really hard on our campaign. None of whom could actually vote for me, but all of whom had a vested stake and what the outcome of that election looked like and who cared very deeply about the direction that we were going. As a state. You have a wonderful opportunity with your son, you know, to be an influencer and the way he's going to view these issues. And uh, I, I'm sure he's going to grow up beautifully, uh, based on who you are and what your values are and making sure that you pass those on to him. Um, if you know, you find yourself really deeply passionate about, um, LGBT equality or the environment or gender equality, find an organization that matters to you and support the work that they do and ask them how you can be valuable to the work that they do. There's so much that's needed in terms of our time and our passion that as long as you find a place that feels meaningful to you, you will be making a difference. He really well, whether you can ultimately vote or not.

Speaker 7:          50:44          And when do, you were going to take one more question from a man who's been watching over the live stream, who asked, how do you see the role of men as allies? What can we do to help this? Cause

Speaker 3:          50:53          that's a really good question. Um, first of all, I'll tell you a story about myself and the word feminism. Back to what was said earlier, when I was in my thirties when I was running for city council for the first time, I was asked by a reporter whether I was a feminist and I answered the question. No. And I'm ashamed to tell you that honestly, but I want to tell you because I want us to do some self exploration about our own attitudes and perspectives. Why did I do that? Well, I felt like it was categorizing me in this limited way and defining me in a way that other people would look at and disqualify me based on that categorization. But by doing that, I was playing a role in marginalizing women. Right? Um, what I would love to see more of, and I'm so pleased to see so much of it right now, our man stepping forward and saying, I'm a feminist too, because to be a feminist really just means that you support the idea that we should all be equal in society and the economy.

Speaker 3:          52:04          Right. Um, what's that bumper sticker feminism is the radical notion that women are human beings or something like that. Um, I'm really encouraged about that too though. And where we are, the marches, the women's marches that took place around the country, around the world, there were so many men, there were so many beautiful, wonderful man stepping forward and saying, this matters to all of us. I'm with her. I'm with her. Exactly. Um, and you know, I think more manner or looking at this from the prism of their mothers and their sisters and especially their daughters and wanting to create a world where they have, um, the opportunity to fulfill their dreams and their, um, best opportunities for themselves. And so more and more, uh, we're joining this conversation as one. And I think one of the powerful ways that we can talk about it is the fact that when we are all working toward gender equality were actually all working to a place where our economy has the strongest opportunity to thrive.

Speaker 3:          53:16          And it really goes back to looking at what happened when women were able to really enter the workforce and stay in the full time workforce for the first time. It was in the 1970s and I know a lot of the really young people in this room cannot even fathom, but and as of 1971 birth control was illegal. If you were not married, you could not have birth control in 1972 with a supreme court decision that's much less known. The Roe v Wade, Eisenstadt v Baird birth control became legal for unmarried persons, not just married persons. There'd been a supreme court decision a few years prior to that, that equal, that allowed married people to access birth control. So birth control and then of course Roe v Wade with our right to make determinations about our own bodies. We could suddenly decide that we were going to enter the workforce and we were going to stay there if we wanted to.

Speaker 3:          54:10          And the women's participation rate in the workforce took this huge climb. It went from about the low 20 percentile to the mid 40 percentile over the course of the next three decades and and hung there. And because it hung there, we contributed significantly to the economic output, the economic growth of the country, about an estimated one point $7 trillion in 2012 which pays for, by the way, Medicaid, medicare and social security combined. Just our participation, our increased participation from the 1970s to that point is responsible for being able to pay for all of those programs. So we all have a vested stake and women's equality and women being able to realize our full economic participation in this country. And I want to hear more women and men sharing that with, with their friends and their coworkers that this isn't just a social issue. It's not just about saying we ought to treat everyone fairly and equally, we all have an economic stake in it. And it goes back to that saying that a lot of people think, is this a try it little campaign saying, when women do better, we all do better. It's really true. Um, and so we, we all have not only a stake in it, but we ought to be exercising our voices and making sure that we're spreading greater understanding about that. Okay. Well, thank you so much for having me.
