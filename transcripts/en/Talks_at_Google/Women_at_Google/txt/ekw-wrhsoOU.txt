Speaker 1:          00:06          So please welcome to Google Detroit. Mrs Kristi hedges. Well, thank you again for joining us. We appreciate it. Um, I mentioned in the Bio Intro, um, so you wrote a book previously called, um, the power of presence, right? And this book is called the inspiration code. Um, are you able to kind of kick things off by just telling us a little bit about how those two things are? Those two books are similar and perhaps how they're different, right. Presence versus inspiration, they tied together, but there's obviously differences between them. Maybe kick things off with that and we'll go from there.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Yeah, sure. So what, well, let me start by saying how I ended up writing this book. That's a little bit, that's how they're, they're kind of tied together. Sure. Uh, so I wrote the power of presence and came out in 2011. Uh, and that's really a book about influence. How do we use our presence to influence situations around us? Uh, and as I was out talking to groups about that, I would start by asking them the simple question to come warm up the audience a little bit. It get people talking. Uh, and that was, uh, who inspires you and what did they do? And I was trying to map those answers and those characteristics back to people who had presence and make this real life connection for people. What would I notice when I asked that question? A pretty immediately was no matter how tired people were, maybe it's the day after a holiday weekend or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Uh, when they would start talking about these people who inspired them, their faces would light up and there be all this animation and energy in the room and people would be literally transformed energetically in front of me. Uh, and that happened again and again and again and again. And people would talk as part of the exercise about what these people did. Uh, and I noticed that they communicated in certain ways, uh, that inspired people. I mean, to even remember things and you guys have them now. Somebody said something to you that just hits you, just write and those words, you carry them around and you, you use them when you need them and they and fortify you when you, you sort of need guidance and all those kinds of good things. Uh, and I just started writing down what did these people do? And I found that these patterns just emerged again and again.

Speaker 2:          02:05          Uh, and that led me to put them together in a, in the inspiration code. Uh, but as I looked at those, because I was usually there speaking to groups to talk about presence. So talk about influence, which is really important. Uh, but what we, um, in leadership development programs, we often rely so much on influence that we leave out this other piece about engagement, which is inspiration. Uh, and if you think about that, we need both of them as leaders, but they go hand in hand. I mean, none of us go home after a day of work and say, I still did a great day to day. I was influenced all day long. Right? I mean, that, it feels different. Influence has done to us, but we would go home and say, I was so inspired today. I had a great day. Uh, inspiration comes from within. So I really wanted to figure out how to create those feelings in people in the workplace because we need more of it.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Yeah, absolutely. You so one of the really interesting things that I read about in the book is this kind of the influence of listening, right? So we talk about inspiration and when you think about an inspirational person person, you think of a great speaker or somebody with presence, right? Uh, one of the things that you mentioned that was one of the most cited behaviors of somebody who is inspiring is the ability to listen. Can you talk a little bit more about that? It seems like a simple thing, right? And listening, everyone should be able to do it, but it's not really that easy of a concept to handle. A lot of people aren't good at listening. And you talk about how listening kind of plays into inspiration and also how we can work on becoming better listeners in order to be more aspirational with the folks that we lead.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Yeah, that was a surprise to me. So as part of the research that I did, I also did a quantitative research that I commissioned on my own and I looked at what are the behaviors that were most impactful to people in terms of inspiration. And the number one behavior was listening. Uh, and I also heard in these discussions, people would say that person was there for me. Uh, they made time for me. They were focused on me. Uh, that came up again and again and again. So it was clear that there was just something magical about when somebody creates a space for us, uh, through strong listening skills. So whether you're in sales or whether you're leading teams, uh, when we listen to people, it's a sign of respect for their opinion. It's a sign that we care. Uh, there is a, a great quote that, uh, the currency of love is time and I would say the currency of respect his attention. Uh, so when we give people our attention, it feels different, but we're not very good listeners as a group, right? We learned to listen quick and listen halfway so we can get done what we need to get done. And that's why would somebody really listens to us. It's sort of like the record skips and it just feels quite different.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Yeah. And I think another concept you talked about too is authenticity, right? We've all encountered leaders who most likely read a leadership book, uh, and that's pretty much it, but there's no authenticity to it, right? Because they're just kind of spitting back something that they read about, uh, you know, being a powerful speaker or giving someone a strong handshake, right? That doesn't necessarily equate to authentic leadership. It's just something they read about and look at in a book. And I think listening is one of those aspects, uh, that actually conveys authenticity. Right. Um, can you talk about this kind of concept of authenticity as well? Not just reading a book about leadership and kind of spitting it back to your employees, but how you actually could become an authentic leader. In addition to kind of the, the listening that we talked about, some other concepts around that.

Speaker 2:          05:22          Yeah, well me listening, I mean authenticity really is a, it's about trust when it comes down to us, you know, we trust people who are real. So if we don't feel like we actually know someone, then it's, it's very difficult for us to really invest in them. Um, but authenticity is tricky at work, right? People can be too authentic as well. So just trying to figure out what that fine line is of uh, your authentic enough so that we know you. Uh, and yet you're also, you know, aware of your surroundings and what, and what the situation will support. Uh, and so, uh, with authenticity, what I will often will tell people is that, you know, we have to, it really has to start within you. Like what is your intention for what you want to get across? And I'm being very clear about what I call your personal presence brand, which is really your values were on the outside.

Speaker 2:          06:05          How do I want to show up? How do I want people to perceive me? How do I want to show what's most important to me? If you're very clear about that going in, then you're much more likely for that to come out in an authentic way because it, it really is about the core of who you want to be in that situation. Uh, but situational awareness matters too. So also knowing what those, the room will support because sometimes we get into to ed needed too much information. The TMI situation where, wow, your authenticity is screaming at me and everyone kind of back it back up.

Speaker 1:          06:35          When we talk about, um, TMI, uh, sometimes emotion comes into the discussion as well. And in terms of leadership and authenticity, um, Google is, is known for kind of coming up with this concept of search inside yourself, which is this concept based on of mindfulness and emotion, uh, within the workplace. And, um, not a lot of companies were really thinking about this. Like, how does this play into kind of the ecosystem of the workplace? But I think it's kind of a core emotion as it is a core aspect of leadership that a lot of folks don't necessarily grasp. How do you, how do you tie emotion into leadership without being unauthentic? How do you do it in a way that, um, kind of displays a sincerity? Like you talk a little bit about kind of the importance of mindfulness or emotion within kind of the, the aspects of leadership.

Speaker 2:          07:27          Yeah. Well, the, uh, you know, I just wrote a piece for Harvard Business Review, which is a believable, I online this week hard, go ahead, get emotional at work. Uh, and, uh, and the idea was the fact that in my world with, with coaching and leaders that I coach, it's not the people who bring it too much emotion and they're not bringing enough emotion. And, uh, and you know, emotion is really a signal for us as a trigger to understand really what you care about. So if a leader comes in and they're overly stoic, you know, it's, it was like a, what's there, knock, knock, knock, you know, you're looking for what the, what the real story is. Uh, and so emotion is actually something we want to be very strategic about as leaders because if we want people to feel something, we have to bring in. So if I want people to get excited, I have to bring excitement into a room.

Speaker 2:          08:11          If I want people to feel serious, I have to bring series as into a room. So knowing what emotion you're trying to impart and instead of trying to either have it be an afterthought to make it really important part of your communication is really what that's about. So it's a knowing what that emotion is and then being willing to put it out there. And, uh, instead of, you know, a lot of us can have come up through the ranks, uh, learning that we want to be unemotional at work. We don't want to show, we want to be always stoic, you know, have the same demeanor no matter what people throw at us. And as an individual contributor, we get rewarded for that. Uh, and we're told, oh gosh, you can give Jason anything. He's going to, you know, he's always has a smile on his face no matter what you dump on his lap. Right? Uh, and then you get to be a leader and that doesn't work so well anymore because you have to use emotion to get people excited to make them feel something. And, and being able to actually think about, oh gosh, how should I be emotional at work versus not having emotion to be something that we really think about.

Speaker 1:          09:07          Yeah. I feel like we sometimes it Google and counter the opposite of that as well though, where when you're an individual contributor, then individual contributor or you're newer to the company company, you bring more emotion, right? You're like, okay,

Speaker 2:          09:18          I'm me Google. This is exciting.

Speaker 1:          09:20          People are more emotional. They're more emotional in their interactions with their managers. But then as you progress and you become part of the leadership team, maybe you're a manager or you manage a team or you're a director, you feel like you have to be more serious and more stoic and you actually remove the emotion because you want to be respected and authoritative versus, you know, an individual contributor that's a little bit more free and open. You see that as well as being kind of a concept that comes up across in inspiration where when folks get into a position of leadership, they actually lose some of those traits of a good leader because they feel they have to based on maybe an antiquated vision of what a leader is.

Speaker 2:          09:55          Yeah. Well exactly right. And that's what, I love that example where people come in and they're like all gung Ho. Sure. As a leader like that. Exactly. Yeah. I guess we don't want our leaders have excited. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Uh, and, and you know, it's kind of funny as we talk about it, but you, you see that play out. There's, you know, as you say that it just, it makes me think about how we think about, we quit joy, a joyfulness at work with naivete. Sure. Uh, and, and that doesn't serve us very well because wouldn't it be great to have leaders who were actually joyful about the work that they did versus coming in and feeling like it's a grind every day, uh, that, that doesn't inspire anybody. So, uh, it's, it's really thinking, again, we don't think about things on an emotional plane very much, but if you just think about it as a leader, you know, and play around with the idea of motion as being a critical part of how you communicate. That opens up a lot that maybe we don't even think we have.

Speaker 1:          10:46          Sure. Can you talk kind of tying that topic together too? So your book talks a lot about inspiring others. Um, can you maybe kind of turn that inward a bit and talk about how leaders, so folks here in the room, folks that are watching, who are in positions of influence or leadership, how they can inspire themselves from a leadership perspective, how can they, if maybe they're one of these more stoic leaders and then something just, you know, the, the last comment you made something snapped in the, is it they wait, I'm one of these stoic leaders, how can I inspire myself to be a little bit more joyful, more mindful, more emotional work? What are some practices or ways that folks who are in a position of leadership can, can inspire themselves?

Speaker 2:          11:28          Well, everything that a I wrote in the book, uh, that as far as other people also inspires you. And I'll be honest, that didn't even hit me until the end of the book. So I was writing it and then wait a minute. But we could use these things on ourselves. Uh, and, and that's great because that's the idea. It's a virtuous cycle. So when we inspire other people, we also get inspired and it, and it all plays into the same thing. Uh, but for example, one of the top ways that what we were saying that earlier that people get inspired is through conversation, through communication with other people. Uh, you can get inspired reading your email, but you probably won't. Uh, it's probably, you know, it's sitting like this listening to other people talk. I'm thinking about things. I know you guys do a lot of that.

Speaker 2:          12:08          A Google bringing ideas in from the outside just to expand your mind a little bit and get you to think differently. Uh, and, and so, you know, with leaders that I've worked with, often they'll get to a place where, you know, they've achieved a great level of success, but they just don't feel all that inspired anymore about it. Uh, and then I'll ask, well, who do you talk to during the day? And they talked to the same people. They talked to their management team. They might go out and talk to some customers occasionally. Uh, they talked to the board. Um, whatever the case is, but they don't actually have any new inputs coming in. And, and so to really go out and seek inspiration to find people to have conversations with two, if you don't have any role models to find some, cause they might not be sitting around the office, uh, you might have to look outward for that. And to put yourself in places that just really help you open your mind can be a great pathway to inspiration. Sure.

Speaker 1:          12:58          You speak, obviously you're here at Google today, you speak to a lot of other companies, you speak at schools, you speak at businesses. Are there any kind of really interesting techniques that you've absorbed from speaking at these different places? Uh, folks that are doing, I guess either a, a really great job of inspiring their employees or their students or, or whatever it may be, or on the flip side, be doing a really poor job at doing it, but maybe in a forceful way or an inauthentic way as we discussed earlier?

Speaker 2:          13:27          Well, I'll tell you something that, uh, that I see a lot, so I don't want, you know, and I'm not calling out anybody. Yeah. Then then there you go. Is that company spent a lot of money and time on corporate mission statements and corporate visions. Uh, and it's not that they don't matter because they do matter. They just don't matter enough. Uh, and they don't look at what are the conversations that are happening every day and organizations between managers and their people and teams and you know, what is the, you know, I always say like cultures are really just stories built upon stories in the organization. There, there aren't enough sort of fresh stories getting into the mix about things that are working and things that, um, solutions that are being overcome and until they're really hanging their hat on this beautiful mission statement, uh, and yet everybody in the organization doesn't buy it because the culture doesn't support it. So I see a lot of that where we, we look at the very high level though. So the grand ideas of inspiration and we've heard that you have to have a great vision. So we checked that box and we spent a lot of money checking that box and then we just wait for everybody's behavior to change. Uh, and it doesn't really get embedded down to the individual level. I mean, what inspires us as our day to day interactions with people around us. Sure.

Speaker 1:          14:37          Uh, what are some common mistakes people make? Uh, we've talked a lot about the positive things that people can do. We talked about in that authenticity is maybe I guess a mistake, but are there other things that you see people making on a daily, monthly, weekly basis? Uh, mistakes that the good leadership, uh, folks that should know better or actually making a mistake so we can kind of understand and avoid learning from past mistakes, I suppose.

Speaker 2:          15:03          Yeah. Yeah, sure. Well, you know, it's one we just talked about at lunch and I'll just bring it up because it's very current. Uh, is that, uh, one of the most inspiring conversations a leader can have is to be in talks with their people about their teams, about their purpose. So helping them really identify how is your purpose for yourself. I'm being played out and being supported in the, in the position that you're in. But that seems like a really great conversation, but it doesn't have to be. So just talking about contextualized purpose, so how does what you're doing today, but just help you take a couple steps further along in your development. It can be that simple, but often managers don't want to be in that conversation because they'll worry. That's gonna it has some, they're, they're, they're, uh, you know, team members going to have an epiphany and then go out the door, uh, with that.

Speaker 2:          15:48          And so they don't want that to happen. So like, well, I'm not going to have the purpose conversation cause I might lose them. Uh, and, and that's a real missed opportunity, uh, because first of all, we love when people engage us in that larger question, um, because we're thinking about it or we want to be thinking about it. Sure. Uh, and somebody creates a space for us. It's very meaningful. Uh, and then also often there are things that you don't see that, uh, that somebody around you might see the can pull some threads together. And help you understand that. Let's say you're working in a, in a company that's very chaotic, um, well that chaos might be really teaching you how to manage a lot of complexity, what you're going to need for the next level of your career. So somebody can help you see that all of a sudden that chaotic environment isn't a grind just to manage through every day. It's a, it's a huge learning opportunity and you may not see that yourself. So being, be willing to be in those conversations is quite powerful and we don't have them enough.

Speaker 1:          16:37          Yeah. Oftentimes people want to build on the base of what they have without analyzing that base, right? So there's, how can I be more inspiring? I'll do a, B and c without fixing what was wrong in the first place. So we often look at how you can improve upon what you're currently doing. And then once you feel like you've kind of fixed that base, then you proceed with some of the tips from, from the book in terms of how you can inspire the competitor yourself. Um, a lot of the book talks, yeah. It kind of in context of, uh, you know, inspiring in a, in a corporate setting. Um, are there ways that you can take a lot of these kind of, um, topics and themes that apply to them outside of the corporate world as well?

Speaker 2:          17:15          Yes. I mean, everything in the book, uh, works in any environment you're in. So, uh, I have found myself starting to use these at home with my kids a lot more.

Speaker 1:          17:24          That's what I'm asking. Yeah. I'm

Speaker 2:          17:25          sorry. Uh, let me think about that. Uh, and it's great. They do a, and so it doesn't matter if you're, you're trying to, I mean, there's a lot of inspiration going on in communities, right. And I was on inspiration going on in Detroit right now. Uh, and, and so, you know, using these kinds of ideas about what really gets people inspired, what lights up, lights people up. Uh, it's any group you're, you can imagine it's, it's your teams at work. It's your communities at home. It's the schools that you're working in a, it doesn't matter. It's, it's the same stuff, which is the beauty of it. Right? I love when things will apply at work and apply at home. Uh, and that's really what I, I tried to do last time. Um, with the power of presence to, it doesn't really matter where you have presence, it's all the same result.

Speaker 1:          18:03          We talked a little bit right before we hopped on stage here about, uh, how inspiration can be contagious. And we talked about the city of Detroit, which were all located in right now, uh, and how Detroit has seen better days. But what happened was there was a few inspired individuals who started to live, apply inspiration to certain their house, to a neighborhood, a street, uh, whatever it may be. And it spread very quickly, right? We saw this inspiration spread very quickly. Um, but I feel like that same concept, uh, this, this took place in a major us city, that same concept can also be applied to the workplace, right? So if you're in an uninspired workplace, having a few individuals that bring inspiration, that, that learn how to be inspiring individuals, it can catch on it. It could be contagious as well. Right?

Speaker 2:          18:49          Absolutely. And I sit here with my Shinola watch on, right. So supporting. Beautiful. Yeah. We were saying, I've been lurking watching Detroit for years and just rooting for Detroit and just so inspired by what's happening here. Uh, so, so there is actually a, um, a scientifically researched, well researched, a theory called emotional contagion. And so we always sort of think about it just in layman's terms as you know, Kinda you catch somebody bad who don't bring people down, right? Debbie Downer. We catch people's bad moods or, or whatever the case is, but it's actually verifiable as humans, we do pick up the moods of other people. Uh, and we develop as groups what, what sociologists call group aspect, which is we kind of, we kind of go towards the center of whatever the mood is in a particular organization. Now, leaders actually have more power to shift that mood than anybody else because people may pay more attention to leaders.

Speaker 2:          19:41          We pay attention up the hierarchy. So if the leader is cynical, the group's gonna feel cynical. If the leader's optimistic, we're going to feel optimistic. Uh, and so absolutely it is contagious. So, but you need those people to come in and be the brave ones to be the beach head for whatever emotion is that you're trying to, to get people to impart a, and of course there's safety in numbers, so if you get a few people really excited than that, that tends to, to change the dynamic of a much larger organization. But it has to start with somebody.

Speaker 1:          20:09          Sure. And we talked about in the city of Detroit, Dan Gilbert, not by, by Fart, excuse me, not the only person, but obviously one of the figureheads of, of some positivity around Detroit. And he instilled a lot of inspiration to people by investing a lot of his money into the city. And again, a lot of people, when they saw that happen, a lot of folks who were outside the city, we're in the city who hadn't necessarily invested now or investing time and money to help kind of inspire the city as well. So Dan Gilbert's one that comes to mind in Detroit. Did you have any other leaders that, that kind of are inspiring to you folks that, uh, it either in your hometown or folks in your industry, uh, authors that have kind of really embraced this idea of inspiration and presence and authenticity, folks that have really inspired you?

Speaker 2:          20:54          Well, I'm in Washington DC, so lots of inspiration there. Yeah, of course. It's a lot inspiration. All guys of the boys. Uh, it's, yeah. So, yes, I mean I get inspired by people all the time and a, and I'll just tell you personally from me right now, I'm, I'm quite inspired by people who are maybe 20 years further along in their career than I am because I'm starting to look and think, okay, this next phase of my life. Like how can I be most inspiring in that and using my talents and do the things that, um, that I think are going to be important beyond myself. Uh, and I'm very inspired by people who've been there before. And, and role modeling is just, it's such a huge, we talked about earlier too, it, it role models are inspiring to us because they create a vicarious experience for when we see somebody like Dan Gilbert come in and do that, um, were inspired because we see him do something and we think, well, I could maybe do that too.

Speaker 2:          21:44          So I maybe I can, you know, buy a whole building. Um, but maybe I can put a couple of my people in that building. Yup. Right. So we, we make another step and then that's what role models do for us. So I'm really looking at, uh, uh, people who are, you know, have a real need and energy around being in service and then how they're doing that in their lives. And so I have, I'm lucky enough to have a couple of people that I've sought out because they didn't land in my lap and I, and I tried to spend time with them and I see what they do. Uh, and I always leave those conversations just no, 10 feet tall and, and, and we need that. We need those people.

Speaker 1:          22:21          Absolutely. Um, we got shifting topics a little bit, but still kind of tying into what we were just talking about is kind of the idea of diversity, right? So diversity not in the sense of what people look like or where they're from, but the diversity of cultures, diversity of backgrounds, diversity of professional experiences, uh, incredibly important and a huge topic and incredibly important for Google, a huge topic in the media these days. How do you kind of tie this idea of diversity into authentic leadership and inspiration and presence is, is there a way to kind of tie in what you were just mentioning bringing in diversity from other folks and really kind of bringing that altogether and in a way that makes sense for a company or a family or whatever it may be.

Speaker 2:          23:03          I don't know, but I'll, I'll try. Yeah. Like we're all trying of course. Uh, as well. Uh, the research supports that, you know, diverse organizations perform better. Sure. Right. We know that at the board level, you know, throughout organizations. Uh, I believe that the reason that that's the case is because of the input idea that I just talked about with the inspiration. When we see things from people's experience, it just expands our own perspective. It's so Weber cultural blinders we have and you can define cultural however you want. Um, they get widened when we see things that we previously didn't see because somebody else's helped us see that. Like we've weathered through role modeling or being with them or discussion or whatever the case is. Uh, so, so we learn a lot more people become three when they're in front of us and, and you know, we know them and we can, we can understand that more. Um, we're a, you know, a global world, you know, it's, you know, and a trite phrase, but it's true. Like we work with people. I work with people all over the world. You guys probably do the same. Uh, and so diversity of everything is important because it just allows us to be in the world and, and, uh, with a, a broader perspective,

Speaker 1:          24:08          the two perspectives are huge. Getting perspectives from different people and countries and everything. Culture is a huge, huge difference maker. What's one piece of advice you would give us as Google speaking to us as Google today in terms of inspiration? Is there, is there anything you've heard or read that we do good or bad that could potentially be turned into advice that we can walk away, walk away with today?

Speaker 2:          24:32          Well, I mean Google is known for a lot of the things that we just talked about. So, uh, you guys are lucky cause you're sitting in organizations like that and not all of the organizations I work with, I can say the same, uh, what I admire from Google from afar. So I don't work in the company. But what I, what I see is, is just the, uh, you, you mentioned the word curiosity before, but that's what I see. I see just a hunger and a curiosity to learn and expand and try new things. Uh, and you know, when you have that sort of permeating the culture, even, even today, so we're having a Google talk we talked about earlier of, I said your diploma seat, right? Because you helped put these together, that means that you get to learn, you know, a lot about things that you might be, you care about.

Speaker 2:          25:17          Uh, but all Google has that opportunity. So I think, uh, having that kind of mindset, uh, and to be, uh, to be an outspoken leader and things that, uh, from a business standpoint and the corporate community, uh, which Google does a frequently, uh, is inspiring to a lot of other organizations. And you, and you see that, you see, um, there are a select number of companies and Google's one of them can, that can put out a pretty bold statement and you see other companies lining up behind them and there's a responsibility with that. Uh, the Google seems to take it pretty well. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          25:52          well, we do our best. We do our best to be inspirational is as a company and as individual contributors here and the city of Detroit. But it's hard, right? It's, it's a, it's a simple concept, but putting it into practice, uh, is, is it takes, it does take practice itself. It takes practice and understanding and cognizance more than anything. Um, I wanted to open up now I'm sure we've got some questions from the audience. We have a lot of leadership here in the room. Um, wanting to open up for questions. If anyone has any questions, if that we can ask Christy. Um, I do have Mike's here if you want to court, if you don't mind running those for us. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          26:29          Nice for you, Jason. Hi, Dave Hoffman. Um, and this is one of my main types this close to my heart and went back to get my MBA space specifically based on corporate cultures, things like that. Um, I, I'm an ex athlete and it's always funny how the best team doesn't always win, stolen the team that has the most hard, most best leadership and inspiration, all those kinds of things. Um, one of the things that I found kind of time and time again is that natural light that God given brilliant seems to really hinder your ability to be an inspirational leader. You know, you get so caught up in, in how things work or he or your mind and whatever that you tend to not be as personable, as outgoing. Um, and that seems to be the case sometimes here at Google where we, we lack a little bit of inspirational leadership because they just, that Eeq kind of isn't there. So first, like what are some of the traits where you can actually help coach someone up into that from a leadership perspective or the other end of the spectrum where somebody might be a little bit more fast and loose. So a lot of energy, but at the same time needs to find a way to authentically dial it back down so that they can kind of fit into that mold of a leader without losing their, their uniqueness or their genuineness.

Speaker 2:          27:37          Sure. There's a couple of questions. Yeah. Uh, but I like where you're going and let me just say that, uh, athletes, often people who were former athletes, our athletes are often really get this because a lot of it is a, starts in the inside that mental game. So really being clear about that. And, and if you have been an athlete, a lot of times I wasn't an athlete, I've heard this, um, that that's been part of the training and it's a positive visualization, um, plays a big role in it. So I'm not surprised to hear the connection that you just made between athleticism and then, and culture. Uh, so the being in your head problems and interesting one a time, a blessing and a curse because often if we're someone who spends a lot of time conceptualizing, and maybe that's our personality or maybe we're an introvert and that's how we process or, or whatever the case, um, it means that our first instinct might not be to communicate right at first instinct is to cut this a step back and think about it.

Speaker 2:          28:31          Uh, and when I work with leaders like that, which I do all the time because a lot of people are introverts and, and that's, that's where they naturally go. Uh, it's to get them out of that predisposition that things have to be perfect before I communicate it. Right. And so, yeah, I'm thinking of someone that I worked with several years ago. And so my, one of my pieces of advice to him was, uh, you know, you need to, you need to go for, um, intentional transparency is what I called it a, because you think that people are reading your mind but no one knows what's going on up in here. Uh, and so you need to be very intentional about it. So your first instinct when you get new piece of information or when you have a plan that's maybe 50% bacon on 100% big is to tell people like you need to get that knee jerk reaction. Because if it's just you thinking about it, then it doesn't really shape anything. So, so that's one thing that comes up quite a bit, if that, if that makes sense. Sure.

Speaker 4:          29:22          Thanks. Cool. Questions, Ashley?

Speaker 3:          29:30          Um, hotline. Here we go. How's this? Better? Okay, great. Um, so in addition to, to be an author, you consult and work with large companies. And so I'm, you

Speaker 5:          29:41          know, I'm considering here kind of thinking about all these principles and how we might push them down through a company like Google or through one of the companies that we support in this room, which are large automakers, the GM or Ford or Chrysler. Um, so when you think about tackling a huge corporate client like that, let's say budget was no option, no issue in the CEO said, I need your help transforming my leadership. What are, you know, what are some of the levers or the tools that you would use with the company and what do you think would be required to really push this type of inspirational development through a large organization? Is that everything from personal coaching for their leaders in addition to retreats? And what are sort of the levers that you use to help actually push this through in a meaningful way across a big organization?

Speaker 2:          30:32          Okay. Well first of all, no one ever says you have all the money you want, but that my brain web chimps, uh, well, so a couple of things. Obviously I'm a big believer in coaching. So I, there, there is something really powerful and I became a coach because I had a coach and it just changed. He changed my life. And so I want it to be able to offer that to other people and hopefully, I don't know if I changed their lives, but I, I try really hard to, uh, to be in service to them. Uh, is that personal coaching changes things because it's just such a unique development opportunity. It's so personalized and uh, and it really allows you to ask the questions that you want to ask in a very safe setting, uh, with someone who isn't invested in your outcome. They just want you to be successful.

Speaker 2:          31:15          So nobody's trying to gain the system. So That's why I think coaching is very effective. Um, but beyond that, if I could work in an organization, however I wanted to, what I think is most effective is when you introduce concepts to a, a swath of people. So maybe it's a all leaders in, in an office or whatever the case is. Um, so everybody gets a sort of the same song book, if you will, certainly starts to think about things a little differently. Uh, and then you have some sort of breakout cohort groups underneath of that. Because I think back to the role modeling and the conversation, I think that's what really starts to get people to think, okay, how can I really embed this in my day to day? Uh, and you get economies of scale that way because the conversation gets richer and everybody gets curious and they start looking at other things.

Speaker 2:          31:59          So I think it's a combination of those that can really help shift the culture. Uh, but let me just say that anything that I wrote about in this book, the last book, I always tell people this, it's, it's not hard stuff. Uh, it's, it's not like you read and you're like, wow, listening, I never thought about listening before. Uh, you know, it, we just don't do it. Uh, and so part of my work, what I try to do is really to close that knowing, doing gap. So you know it, but then how do you make it easier to actually just do it? Uh, and so I try to make it very accessible for people. And so when I come in and work with teams, that's really what it's about. You know, I'm not there to tell you something you've never heard before. I'm there to get you to do things you probably know you already should be doing. Um, but you don't do. Yeah. And that's really what it is.

Speaker 1:          32:42          Sometimes it's good to have a reminder, you know, for folks in this room and folks across Google. Yeah. You talk about it. These, these concepts are not difficult, right? This simple concept. It's not rocket science, but a lot of times to some folks in a company like this, uh, coding, uh, search algorithms is very simple. Listening actually is not that simple for them. It's something that they do have to practice. And something that, that that seems like a very simple concept, but outside of kind of what they're used to is it takes a little bit of extra kind of focus and, uh, elbow grease to kind of make sure that it happens. Right. Kind of the last question I had because you mentioned this here and the answer to Ashley's question was around coaching and you mentioned that you had a coach yourself and kind of drove you in the right direction. Can you kind of talk about that process a little bit? Because we all know, we talk about inspiration, we're talking about presence. Um, I think one thing that we all look for a here is finding coaches that can help us along our paths as well to become better, uh, inspirational leaders to become better employees and things like that. Can you talk about that coaching and coaching kind of atmosphere that you just mentioned and, and talk a little bit about your coach and how that person was inspiring to you.

Speaker 2:          33:50          Sure. Well, I, I, uh, you know, I've been an entrepreneur since I was 27, so I didn't have a, an organization full of people to role model and mentor me. And in very early on, I got introduced to someone who was a coach, a leadership coach for a small business owners. And it was, it was just immensely helpful. I mean, in so many ways, but, but probably the most is that it was somebody I could be very frank with and, and he had, you know, had had a business for, you know, 20 or 30 years. And so there wasn't anything I came up with had already been through five times, you know, so it was really nice just to have a little bit of normalizing of things that were happening. Uh, but also somebody that could really just push my thinking and, and have just sort of no bs, uh, allowed and the discussion, you know, it just sort of call you on stuff and, and really make you accountable, but in a very supportive way.

Speaker 2:          34:42          And that's just a very unusual dynamic to have somebody who will push you, support you at the same time has experienced, they can bring that, help you understanding contextually what's going on. Um, and that doesn't have any sort of game and your outcomes. So they're not going to fire you if you don't do it, what you just talked about. Right. It, it's really you, it's your development opportunity. You do what you want to with it. Uh, and I find with my clients now as a coach, uh, you know, my job is to be supportive and my job is to be incredibly honest. So, uh, I don't hold back with my clients. I think they need to hear what my observations are. That's what I'm, that's what I'm there for. Uh, and, and I try to really adjust to their learning styles so they can hear it in the best way. Um, you know, but my investment is in their success and that's it. And, and I think the best coaches look at it that way.

Speaker 1:          35:30          Great. Awesome. Well, Kristy, thank you so much for coming in today. We appreciate it. This was very inspiring for us appropriately. Um, again, in the book, the Inspiration Code, if you guys haven't grabbed a copy on the way out, I think it's, it's not right. It comes out on Thursday. So we have advanced copies. How great is that? So, um, if you have it grab a book, you can read it before the general public even gets to put their hands on it. So once again, thank you Christie for coming and we appreciate it. Thanks for joining.

Speaker 4:          35:55          So that's happening.
