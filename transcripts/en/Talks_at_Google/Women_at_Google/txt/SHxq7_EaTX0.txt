Speaker 1:          00:03          Welcome everybody to toxic Google. It's my great pleasure to introduce Leslie Stall, one of our country's most preeminent journalists. She has been a correspondent at 60 minutes for 25 years. And his covered pretty much everything that's happened in the world in the last quarter century for one ton amount to all the wars, to various presidential campaigns, to technology stories, which is a particular area of interest of hers to sports. Um, she is the winter of 11. Any awards and prior to joining, 60 minutes was a White House correspondent during the Carter and Reagan administrations and it was a moderator of face the nation. She is the author of two books, including the one that is on sale in the back, um, called, um, becoming grammar. So highly encourage everybody to pick up a signed copy of the book on your way out. Great Mother's Day gift. So get your shopping done early. There's also cards back there, so feel free to get it done in one stop. And she is, is

Speaker 2:          01:00          the proud grandmother of two girls. Welcome Leslie. Thank you. So me, she neglected to say so many neglected to say that we're colleagues because Sumi worked at 60 minutes till less than a year ago. Yes. I was a producer and we worked together and had the pleasure of working with Leslie on a couple of stories. That's great. So, um, tell me about the book. Did becoming a grandmother surprising? Well, I knew I was going to be a grandmother. What surprised me was the enormity of that initial emotion, this kind of wallop of love that's unlike any other kind of loving that any that you have for any other creature on the planet. It's nothing like mother love. It's its own, it's its own little animal. And when you become a grandmother, you change so dramatically that your children don't recognize you. They run around saying, who is she? Because you are so mush.

Speaker 2:          01:59          Bali, you are just a puddle of, of whatever the kid wants. I believe that we are actually, uh, that the word no is incapacitated. We cannot deny them anything. Um, but, but really it was that initial jolt of elation and emotion that I wanted to explore. What is that? Do all grandmothers have that? The answer is most of them do. The grandfathers have it, they do, but it's different. And uh, and look into the history, the biochemistry, the anthropology, the different kinds of grandmothers step, grandmother's surrogate, grandmother's, uh, and even when there's tension in the family with the daughter-in-law and there's a lot of tension with the daughter. I wrote it as much for your generation as for my generation, for young parents because we're in this together, young parents and their parents were the family. And so I, it's as geared for my daughter who is a young woman with two kids as it is for my friends.

Speaker 1:          03:17          So as I was reading the book, the thing that was most enlightening to me, so I'm the mother of a young daughter who's six years old, but it really gave me a look into what my mom must be experiencing and how she comes to it and things that I feel like can be a little metal somewhere. I'm like, mom, I'm not going to do that when you're talking about. And so it was really a, an interesting kind of insight. And does sheet metal, sorry, does your mother metal, she very carefully it metals. She's very cautious about it. Well what, so what do you, I mean, I don't think of modern parenting.

Speaker 2:          03:50          I'll tell you what I think of modern parenting. But first let me say that most grandmothers I met and interviewed including me, we walk on eggshells. We are so careful. We don't want our kids to be angry at us because then we fear they might deny us access to the only thing that really matters anymore. And it's those babies. So I had any number of grandmothers I interviewed and I interviewed a lot, tell me, you know, my tongue hurts from biting or uh, I, he, I won't even lift an eyebrow in criticism of how they're doing it. And then the minute you leave the house, you turned to your husband or he turns to you and you say, we didn't do it that way. And she turned out okay. You know, we were good at it. Well, the truth is we weren't as good at it as your generation is. That's the truth. Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:43          But I think that puts more pressure on parents as well. Right now you're so concerned about they can't eat this. They have to go to bed at a certain time. You have to follow the routine. It's a lot more, I mean, how did you manage that? You had such a demanding career. How did you manage it when your daughter was younger? Well, I think

Speaker 2:          05:00          my generation of women was much more focused on just getting into the workplace and it took a lot of energy and a lot of attention. We missed a lot with our children that we regret. Um, I think we are, our attention was, was truly divided and I think our children, you, my daughter, um, a lot of the people who work at Google by the age I'm looking out at here, um, you learn from us or maybe resent what we did, but you're doing it differently. And the truth is, I admire the way you're doing. I admire the way my daughter is putting a lot of emphasis on her family. Although she has a big job, but she's still, she's still is more, she's building a better nest than I did. I admit that.

Speaker 1:          05:54          And what are the things that you noticed that you have to bite your tongue for?

Speaker 2:          05:58          Not necessarily that your daughter, but I'm telling you one, I'll tell you when sleep training, I don't know how many people here have children. Have you? Well, tell us what's, no, I know, but at Google in general, but, but I did, I didn't sleep train so I'd never heard of it. Apparently it's been around for ages. So the idea is after a couple of months you just let the baby scream and yell. And I just happened to be there when it happened with my husband and I couldn't stand it. They didn't pick her up, they just let her scream or little header. I skin was crawling, but I didn't say a single word. I just sat on it. I was hyperventilating. I was thought I was having a heart attack, but I didn't say a word. We get in the car because we were staying at a hotel.

Speaker 2:          06:40          I husband turns to me and says, what was that all about? And I said, what? I said, I didn't say a word. I was the Sphinx. He said, you didn't say a word. You didn't shut up the whole time. So out of my mouth was, why are you punishing her? Why are you making herself? I swear I didn't think I said a word and it was just tumbling out. I didn't hear myself weird. I know. But for the most part, my generation of parents is sitting on it or trying to sit on it because we want you to think that we think you're wonderful so that you'll let us have the babies. And so tell me a little bit about some of the signs that you found out about as you were researching this book. What is the science behind grandparenting? What is this thing that's happening?

Speaker 2:          07:28          Well, there's, there's two interesting things above all the others. One is the biochemistry. Um, that enormous wallop that I felt and it, I felt it all over my body is actually a biochemical response. When a mother has a baby, her brain is completely rewired and all kinds of different new hormones come into play. Uh, grandmother has something somewhat similar. She is on her brain, is also rewired, not as extensive knitly and not as dramatically, but she also see creates a bonding hormone. And so she is physically binding herself to that little baby. Just the way parents do. Well, it's not the way parents do because it's not as intense. But we also go through a connection that holds us to that baby so that when we don't see the baby, we crave the baby. And it can happen to a step grandmother. It can happen to a surrogate grandmother.

Speaker 2:          08:32          It can happen to an aunt, a great aunt. But when that baby is a little kid and somebody who thinks of it as somewhat, there's a holds it, there's all kinds of physical changes that go on within you. So that's one thing. I thought it was pretty interesting. Oh, here's another thing. The circuitry of baby loving in the brain and in the body, the ser, the wires are exactly the same wires as romantic love. They're the same pathway. So what was happening to me and all other grandmothers is we're falling in love. We are literally actually falling in love and it feels like that. And it's the, we use language like that. People say, I fell off a cliff when I held my grandchild, or you feel just wonderful all over. Or I crave them when they're not there. So it is exactly the same animal, the feelings.

Speaker 2:          09:28          And the other thing I found out was that most animals on the planet die when they can no longer reproduce. So when a female stops being able to have babies, she, if she can walk or fly, whatever, she goes over there and dies except for elephants, whales, and humans. So why, why do we have extended lives beyond menopause? Why do we even have menopause? Well, the answer is to take care of the babies. Grandmothers raise the babies. Both parents hunted. They went out into the fields and raise crops and they left the babies home with grandma. And so I think there is in us kind of atavistic granular need to re to help raise the babies when we don't. We, we heard. And so you talk about it. I mean it's almost like we're coming full circle. You talked about granny nannies. What her granny nannies tell us granny nannies are grandmothers who take care of the babies two days a week, three or four days a week to help their kids.

Speaker 2:          10:38          And today in this country now with post recession, both parents are working and they're not making as much as my gender. One person made my generation. So you need the help because childcare, good childcare is exorbitantly expensive. I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know it can cost as much as college. So the babysitting function is needed and my generation is spending. Here's the s statistic I came upon. My generation is, is spending seven times more on grandchildren then grandparents did 10 years ago. Wow. And we're not, I'm not talking about toys, I'm talking about the crib. I'm talking about the, the car seat. I mean major items. We're sending the kids to school, we're paying medical, we're straightening their teeth. Um, grandparents are really contributing in many ways. Where does grandpa fit into all of this? Oh, Grandpa, if you, if, if grandma's think that we go through a sea change, which we do, our personalities change when we're with those children.

Speaker 2:          11:48          I mean our kids with our kids, we were policemen and with our grandchildren were playmates, whatever they want. Grandfather's also go through this huge metamorphosis for a grandfather who worked very hard when the little ones, his own little ones who are growing up, they all think about it as a second chance to watch a child grow up to be in their lives. And a lot of grandmothers told me, GRANDPA's a better babysitter than I am. He's more patient, he's more playful grandparents. Grandfathers. I saw this over and over. Grandfathers are the nanny's, not grandmothers and many marriages. The husband is older, he retires, grandma's still working. So he's the one who's taking care of the babies and um, he's doing a great job and he loves it. And if he has health problems, the children are alleviating them there. They're getting rid of depression, they're staving off dementia. I mean these are, these are actually studies that show that, that, that, that, that baby's just have this effect on us, makes us healthier, makes us happier. It makes us younger. Hmm. I know,

Speaker 1:          13:09          um, to segue a little bit, it is election season after all, and all the presidential candidates are grandparents. So I have to ask you, what do you make of the, uh, the race so far?

Speaker 2:          13:19          Well, one, I actually thought age was going to be an issue. Um, when Hillary Clinton announced, I thought that the Republicans were going to come in with a whole coterie of younger candidates and they were just going to harp and bang away at her being in her late sixties. Ah, I mean, Bernie 74, she's only 68, and I think that, uh, how do we know how all Trump has to see 69, something like that. Um, I was very interested in Hillary being a grandmother because when I started working on the book, she announced that she was pregnant and we, I mean, her daughter was, yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:58          pregnant. Whoa. It's not the national inquirer. That's a lead. And so I was curious. Yes.

Speaker 2:          14:05          Uh, as to whether her being a grandmother, well, whether she'd use it, um, and whether it would help her are not to win the presidency. So I went with Frank Luntz, who's a Republican pollster to New Hampshire to sit down, sit in on a focus group, and uh, he tacked on a couple of questions for me and then let me ask some questions. So they were all Republicans and he got up there and he said, what one word would you use to describe Hilary Clinton? Oh, God, this was if Hillary Clinton had been in the room, she would crawl up in a ball and go sit in the closet. Dishonest, liar, cold. Uh, not she did, they didn't say corrupt, but that's what they're, that's what Trump is picking up on. But words like that, all negative, all having to do with dishonesty. It was brutal. Then he let me get up and I asked what one word comes to mind when I say grandmother.

Speaker 2:          15:06          Oh my gosh. The words were just, all of them. Nobody had one even remotely negative thing to say. It was loving, cozy cookies, unconditional love lap, warm. So I asked them. Now they're all republicans. If they thought, if Hillary played up that she's a grandmother, some of those words would rum up rub off on her. And I was surprised because they were all self described as conservative Republicans. Several of them, many of them said they thought it would help her as long as she didn't. They said exploit the child. Meaning, you know, walk around with the kid on her hip. Um, I'm sure Hillary's people have done their own focus groups. I'm a little surprised she hasn't made more of it. It could be that all the other candidates are also grandparents. I don't know. But I, that focus group led me to believe that it would soften her image and she's still having those words come up in all focus groups, including with Democrats.

Speaker 2:          16:09          So she could use a little, yeah. Yeah. People never make much out of grandfathers. Grandmothers. It's going to be the word in front of every woman who's ever had a position of authority. She's a grandmother, but grandfather's don't get that right. That's kind of vague. I know. What do you make of Trump? The Trump phenomena. Oh my goodness. I mean, I'm like everybody else. I don't know what to make of it. I, it's not that I don't know what to make of him. I don't know what to make of the public reaction to him. I could go through a litany of things he has said where I was sure I would have put money down that it was over. I mean, when he went after John McCain saying he wasn't a hero. Now that was really early on. I knew for sure that was the end.

Speaker 2:          16:58          I knew it well have been 13, 14, 15 of those. And he always rises from the ashes. So, uh, I wouldn't dare predict, and it's even hard to analyze, but I'm sh I'm, I know I'm pretty darn sure, pretty darn sure it's going to be Hillary versus Trump and, uh, they're really going to do jobs on each other. It's really going to be a slug fest of gigantic proportion who, who can slime. The other one more is probably going to win. Isn't that awful to say about our country? The other thing that strikes me about this campaign, and I think I've been struck by it in the past, but never so intensely is how few people give the candidates to us. If you go out and count all the people who either went to a caucus or voted in a primary, it's a minute fraction of the American adult population.

Speaker 2:          17:57          And so the process just doesn't, it's not working. It's just not, we have to fix it, just have to fix it. And I mean, the thing that strikes me as a former journalist is how do you report on somebody like Trump when there's no fact checking? And I know it's 60 minutes, very particular, every script is footnoted, everything is back check. How do you cover a candidate in a responsible way who really can't be fact checked or doesn't carry, is fact checked, but the public doesn't care. There are any number of newspaper columns written about what he got wrong, television stories written, uh, Don about what he got wrong. And people don't care. That's why I say it's the reaction to him. That's the unfathomable part of it. Uh, it's very difficult to report on him. He, he, I've, I've studied his interviews cause you know, I used to do face the nation and I used to love to try and pin someone down.

Speaker 2:          18:52          If they didn't want to answer, ask answer the first question you went to the second question. And then, you know, if you go to the third year nagging, but I would knack, he's unnavigable you, you can't, you just can't get him to answer the question. He, he gets away from it. So it's hard. I mean, and where is the line between entertainment and journalism? As you said, if this is going to turn into a slug fest, it almost feels like a little bit of a, of, of a horse race, the boxing match, whatever you want to call it. I mean, how's about standup comedy? I know, seriously, have anybody have, have any of you just sat and watched a Trump rally? None of you. He is hilarious. He is. Seriously hilarious. It is. It is a standup routine. And, uh, I always thought that humor was really, really important in politics because I covered Reagan and he was very funny, but sweetly funny but funny.

Speaker 2:          19:50          Um, I also thought likeability was crucial at certainly crucial to leadership to governing. Um, but we are being presented by this tiny sliver of the country with candidates who are more unlikeable and candidates I think have ever been as well in, in time that we know of. Certainly in modern time the negatives, oop, trumps are sick. He's, he has an unfavorable rating of 67% and Hillary and anybody want to guess 56% negative. And so as you said, you covered Reagan for a long time. What do you make of the almost deification of Reagan? Yeah. Um, well he wasn't deified in the beginning at all. In fact, there's a little bit of similarity. There was a huge chunk of the country because Reagan was very, very, very conservative for that period of time in our history who thought Never Reagan. So there was that huge chunk of the population out there though the election was very close.

Speaker 2:          21:01          Then he was shot early on and he handled that with such grace and really heroism that he won everybody's heart and people stopped and stop looking at him in a two dimensional way. As a guy who stood for these issues and started to see the human being and he had a quality and it's a quality. We're not seeing this time in anybody. He had sweetness. He had a special quality of sweetness. And when you saw him, you could disagree with him 100% and like him. And it goes a huge long way to govern when you need to persuade people. Is the era of sweetness over you think is there no room left in our, oh, well I would never say that we're going to, you know, when Jimmy Carter was president, every, there was so much gloom and doom. Reagan used to run around the country saying what's with the gloom and doom?

Speaker 2:          21:58          But there was, we were very pessimistic. Uh, nothing was working. There were gas lines, there were food lines for people. People were suffering so much. They were standing in line to get food. We had high inflation, high unemployment, you never thought it was going to turn around and Reagan came in and pretty soon, you know, we, we were feeling good again. The economy cranked back up. So I mean these things are cyclical. I think we might have sweetness again when you get home. I want to bring you back to something you were saying earlier about Hillary Clinton being a grandmother. And one of the interesting things to bring it back to your book as well was, uh, when you wrote about how being a grandmother actually helps women break the glass ceiling. Well, it's a little bit about that. Okay. Uh, first of all, you, you will observe that women in high places today, a grandmother's, uh, Nancy Pelosi, when she was a sworn in as speaker of the house.

Speaker 2:          22:59          She's your, was she your, is she? Yeah. Do you remember then you, you all remember she, she had all her grandchildren on the stage with her and I actually did a story on her. She ruled in a maternal way. She ruled the house with an iron fist, but a maternal iron fist. Like the mother, the police woman, um, she had an instinct that said the, that grandmother image can be a formula for authority. And so I, I came to see that while it's still difficult for the country as a whole and for men specifically to accept a young woman in a position of authority, it's not hard to except the grandmother because very often in our families they were the, they were the tough one in the family. And um, so I had a girlfriend tell me, she ran a girls school in New York and for her she was there forever.

Speaker 2:          24:03          She stayed at that school and ran that school for years and years and years. She always had trouble with the fathers. They will always interface telling her what to do and poking at her. And one day it just stopped. It just stopped. And she was able to control the meeting with the father and everything was wonderful. And then she realized that he was seeing her not as a young, sexy woman, but as a grandmother. And so the Cha, you know, his need to fight with her or to challenge her stand up to her was over. So grandmothers can be authoritative in the public's eye. Um, and again, I'm surprised Hillary's and playing it up more. And you know, grandmothers aren't old anymore. They're baby boomers and baby boomers are young. They think of themselves are young as themselves, as young. They act young, they dress young, they look young.

Speaker 2:          24:56          We, I believe me, we're tired and told me that when I chase after my grandchildren, I'm very tired, but we put on a good face, another grandmother in the audience laughing. And uh, so I don't think we have the same image that grandmothers had when I was certainly when I was growing up or maybe even when you were growing up. And so here in, in the valley and we talk a lot about diversity in tech and um, sort of, uh, making sure that there's representation of women on teams and especially in the more technical fields with a little bit of distance and perspective. What do you make of that, especially given your research? Well, I'll tell you, this happened at 60 minutes too. While you were there. I, I, I fear so often that women take two steps forward and a step and a half back.

Speaker 2:          25:51          We take three steps forward and two steps back and it's been that way ever since the women's movement in the early seventies. We think we're making progress in the workplace and then we find out that we're still only making 79 cents to the man's dollar. Um, we still don't crash through the glass ceiling. We still don't have many CEOs and it's, it's a bafflement. It's a bafflement that we don't have more women in position, a position positions, um, uh, of executive positions where they're making the big decisions when it's shown that women make better decisions in many situations and where women are better educated generally speaking, as many PhDs and so forth. So it's a bafflement and uh, it's a like a little lake. Cause I was there at the beginning of the women's rights movement where I was so sure, so sure that women were just going to sweep into, into the presidency, into the boardrooms, into the executive suites in huge numbers within 30 years. And it's more than 40 years ago that this started. So I don't know, I keep saying the time will come, but when's that going to cop? If there are any questions in the audience, please feel free. And in the meantime,

Speaker 3:          27:15          I guess two things. First of all, it regarding women, I think that, uh, there was a change, not enough, but there is a change and maybe I'm an optimist, but, uh, it seems like it's shifted from end of the wall. Doesn't let women do anything, uh, to that, that as well. But also I think that education back at home, I think parents should change as well. Not just, uh, not just the world, not just a corporation. Corporations. I think that steel, many homes not even intentionally are not raising eh, the, the girls, you know, way that they even understand that, uh, there are options other than being a girl or whatever it means that we experience. I think we as parents are at least some of us not doing the best job, not necessarily because we don't want to, but because we're not aware of it because we grew up even my generation in a way, the two women has, uh, you know, you grow up in Israel and then in the United States later, but in, but in Israel than they think that it's still, I saw a lot of conservative type of homes. And again, not because they wanted to underwrite, eh, in Israel, but also I think that they see it here that it's conservative in, in a way that nobody said that you cannot be an engineer, but it's not the point. And I mean, we don't, we don't, we're not talking about a girl as an engineer. And

Speaker 2:          28:42          my talking about it being told, having a girl being told you can be whatever you want,

Speaker 3:          28:48          that should be the message. I can cheat. It's very common even today. And not because the parents are objecting to it, but they still, it's very conservative that girls or girls and boys or boys, and at least what I'm trying to do, because nobody has a golden, uh, uh, is girls can be girls, boys can be girls, but I'm trying to mix and match. So at this she knows she can do, she can do whatever she wants. And

Speaker 2:          29:15          that's hard. I come from obviously different generation. I was told I could be anything I want. Right. And so I'm a little surprised to hear you say all these generations later, you don't think that that message is still being sent to our kids because that would be a message that comes down from my generation.

Speaker 3:          29:37          Look at Google, uh, the numbers that were released, the public shows that even Google where we're doing whatever we can to, to, to, to get as many women as we can, especially engineers. There's not enough women graduating universities in computer science. That's the parents really. I thought that was odd. The parents, girls thinking boys won't like them if they go into science kind of thing. I think that it's indirect. And again, I don't think that, that a lot of the parents are doing this in purpose. I think that in many cases they don't even think about it. And at least in my case, I think about that. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, but I think about that and if anyone was, will convey any other message to my daughter, that's one of the things that can really freak me out. So that's, that's a for everybody who's listening.

Speaker 3:          30:28          Yeah. Um, thank you. And if we can go back to television, but television was always my dream, especially in youth. So I wanted to be a newscaster. Always there are in Israel here. This is the, uh, the mic. Uh, and I even sometimes I report to Israeli television, but just as a, as a, as a side hobby and, but, but what I did learn from reporting to radio and television needs, road foot, let's say 30 times in my life, that it's just unbelievable what happens when something, something is broadcasted. No one is watching broadcast television. Double quote. Nobody old boy, a video on demand. It's all Hulu or Netflix. Nobody's watching anything on TV. TV is dead and everything. Once my piece was broadcasted on television, I mean the, my, my cell phone was drained out of battery from so many Facebook came. It's just, so my question to you is, how do when you go into a studio, not even reporting for, from the field today, after so many years, what do you feel when you record in studio, when, when you see a piece that you did, what does it make you feel and what do you think the impact today versus a few years ago?

Speaker 2:          31:53          I guess the thing that I feel is that I'm not, I, I'm not sure I'm having an impact and it bothers me. Uh, I, I don't know how many stories you did for 60 minutes, but I've done a lot, hundreds and hundreds and many of them important, important information that the public should know, change should have been made. And it just sort of evaporates. I feel it evaporates. So I guess people have said to me, Oh, you have so much influence. I fear that we don't, and I fear because we're doing serious work. That's what 60 minutes is really about. So if we uncovers an injustice or if we show some corruption and then nothing happens, it's very discouraging. Sometimes you have to do, uh, you have to have the public exposed to a story over and over. It has to linger before it really has an impact. So 60 minutes does it, and then someone else picks it up and then maybe a congress woman makes a speech about it and maybe someone tries to pass a law. It has to go on and on. So, you know, I sit in the studio and I say to myself, okay, is this, it's anybody going to do anything about this? That's what I think.

Speaker 1:          33:15          But that's it. I mean 60 minutes still is, is, you know, the news magazine a record, but it's still average of 15 million viewers every weekend. And that's, but, but what happens? Did you ever do a story the produce change? I did. You did. I did one and I was very, very proud of which one was up the sugar one and it really produce change and produce some change. It got the FDA to start really looking at some of the classifications that they had done. Um, but no, I know exactly what you mean. Where you do the story and your jazz for months going, you know, this is, this is going to be, it's going to blow the lid off world and the little crack. Maybe. So, I mean, that said, do you think television news is, is should we be planning the funeral?

Speaker 2:          34:01          Well, first of all, television news has changed dramatically. It's interesting that 60 minutes hasn't, we'd still doing it the old way. We still use the old stopwatch. Um, the way I did it. Well, but it's still a stop watch and think Dick. And, uh, it's, uh, we do, the stories are done the same way, same ethics, same standards, all of it. But most news has changed because of the, the shrinking of the time it takes between the reporter learning something and the reporter getting it out there. When I started there were, there was a whole day to think because we worked in film and film had to be processed and so you could really make a hundred phone calls and you could really suck your thumb for an hour or two and think it over. And then when we got videotape that time was shorter and then we got cable and those reporters had to be on the air pretty quickly and now there's no time.

Speaker 2:          35:02          And that has changed the nature of news dramatically. So whether it's on television or on the web, uh, the, the nature of news, uh, by definition is completely, totally altered. I wouldn't, if I were on doing daily reporting, say, covering the White House, I wouldn't begin to know how to do it today. And I really needed to make a lot of phone calls and, uh, I needed to understand it. And I don't, I don't understand how you can just run out there. I, I wouldn't, I don't do that at 60 minutes still. So I'm kind of one of the lucky ones. But I think that news is morphing, I'm not saying it's better or worse, actually I shouldn't be judging, but it's definitely different and, but I think the appetite for news is enormous. I think people want to know that they want to devour and a lot of people want in depth reporting. Oh, I mean our, our audiences are enormous. And websites that are doing in depth investigative report it or surviving and are healthy. So I think people want this kind of work, but not a lot of Pinot. Not, not enough.

Speaker 4:          36:19          Keeping on the news thing. Um, w how do you feel about, you know, the trend to so called comedy news? Like Stuart and Oliver?

Speaker 2:          36:27          Yeah. Um, what, what do I honestly think between you and me and 30 800 million people, I think they're brilliant. I think they're brilliant. It's satire and it's a, it's a form of commentary that people listen to. People want to love. We started out saying that, uh, Trump, one of the reasons I think he's successful is that he's really funny. Uh, people want to laugh and if you feed them the serial was sugar on top. Um, they digest it. Uh, I did the bill Maher show the other night. He's brilliant. He's hilarious. Um, I watch, well, I used to watch the daily show. I am, I enjoy it. It's, it's, it's part of our life now. You know, it's part of our society in our life. It was a little discouraging to find out that that was the only news some of our children will listening to that was a little hard to take. But you know, my, as, as the kids get a little older, they start wanting something a little more serious. At least that's what I'm seeing in my family. So I'm all for it. Are you against it? Oh No, you love it too. Oliver is this, oh, it's the minutes. Absolutely. Oliver's brilliant. But Bill Maher really impressed me the other night. They all are. I think they're great. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          37:55          So talking about the immediacy of news versus the, the writing of the book, how, how did the, um, how did the process differ for you? Were you in playing a lot of the same skills and techniques, or was it a, a new patent experience?

Speaker 2:          38:07          It was new, uh, well, the reporting wasn't new, but the writing was really hard because the first draft that I showed my husband who's a writer, he said this, this is a series of 60 minutes pieces. So I could, I could write about 15 minutes and that, but I to write long form, like that really took a lot of work for me. I had to figure out how to thread everything together. I could do it for 15 minutes, and that was it. Uh, but I really loved working on this book. Um, I met so many different kinds of grandmothers and grandfathers across the country. And to find out that we're all in this together, we grandparents were a society and our children and how they relate to us, meaning your generation, how you relate to us is a society where we're so connected. We're all, we're all in this campaign. So aware of how different we are, but we are all the same grandparents. Believe me, we're all the same. We all love these kids intensely. We all change in the way we grandparent. Uh, we, none of us can wait to see those grandchildren. We annoy our children because even if we're not saying anything critical, we are doing a little body language thing that really irritates them. And we're trying not to. So we are one big community. And I found that out and it was very heartening. But writing was

Speaker 5:          39:41          a challenge. So you mentioned that, um, you're disappointed that women haven't reached higher levels in professions en masse on mass. Um, and one thing that occurs to me is that when grandparents are living close by to their children and they're willing to help out with the childcare, that that may allow their daughter to, um, you know, be it in her profession longer and reach higher levels. Um, but it seems like in this world it's a very international world and we have people, you know, moving across continents to take jobs and their parents don't always come with them,

Speaker 2:          40:23          but a lot of them do, a lot of them do.

Speaker 5:          40:27          Um, and so I guess my question is what is the responsibility of women who have achieved high levels in their profession to make sure that they mentor other women or create policies in the workplace to allow other women to rise when they don't have as many advantages? You know, support perhaps.

Speaker 2:          40:53          Well women should mentor women, period. It's, it's almost a given that we need to help each other. So that is a, is a necessity. We haven't solved the problem of child care. We just haven't. It's, it's, it's what it's, it may be one of the main reasons that women don't achieve cause they break their careers and half because they feel they have to be home because they don't trust the childcare situation, the daycare situation. Um, it's a conundrum. I'm not a policy person. I wish there were more policy people working on it and more openness from our elected officials to try and create a structure, a grid, some, some way for uh, families to be able to go to work with peace of mind. Um, it's, it's, it's a terrible unsolved crisis in the country. Childcare and uh, I do come around at the end of my book to say that this is the perfect way for grandparents to, and their extended retirement and maybe not all grandparents move, but there is a huge trend going on right now of grandparents moving to be near their grandchildren.

Speaker 2:          42:17          They do it selfishly. They want to be in the babies' lives. The smart parents, the smart parents will overlook the little critical elbowing and say, we need you because you are a woman. Going to work will never trust anybody as much as she'll trust her mother with her children. So, uh, for most, for a lot of women that is the answer for women whose parents cannot come and be near them. Uh, we need, we need more government to help us. We do our societies or rotary clubs. I mean something. Uh, so it's something I thought a lot about when I wrote the book. I also wrote about sour get grand mothering, um, parents who for any number of reasons. I mean parents my age cannot be with their own grandchildren. Maybe they don't have any or maybe their daughters just aren't or sons aren't going to have them or maybe the daughter in law is not going to have it but they can sarragut grandparents, another child somewhere else. So it's a good, it's a good way to end the take the last 30 years of your life cause we're going to live a long time and we'll be healthy. Most of us and would that great thought. I want to thank Leslie for coming to Google it.

Speaker 6:          43:43          Thank you. I know you have to do the dash

Speaker 2:          43:49          cause you have to get up to San Francisco and Battle Bay area traffic. But we have books in the back. So please, uh, stop by and grabs him. And this is the best mother's Day present you can give your mother. I'm not kidding. Grandmothers are adoring this book because I'm talking about them. Thank you, Leslie. Thank you so much.
