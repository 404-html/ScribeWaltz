Speaker 1:          00:06          Hi Guys. Hi. Nice to be here on the stage. Happy to share whatever you want to ask me. And I actually spent a bit of time up in the creative labs one day and uh, just saw some amazing things. So if there's anyone in here that I might've met hello again, because I saw lots of kinds of music called music apps. They're making it.

Speaker 2:          00:25          So folks here in the audience might know you from, uh, songs that were licensed to voc or Zach Braff garden state or a, your collaborations with Taylor swift or Ariana Grande Day. Or they might know about your performative technology, uh, endeavor in the Mimeo gloves. They might've heard about creative passport. They might also have heard about you doing the Harry Potter, um, curse in child soundtrack. Uh, all of these things are out there in the world, but seems breathtaking in their, their scope. How do you think about yourself when you introduce yourself at the allegorical party? W how do you consider yourself? What's your identity?

Speaker 1:          01:06          I don't know. I just say I'm, I'm, I like enjoy anything that kind of is around the intersection of music and tech. That's what I said. I don't go to like a musician. I'm a producer. I'm a performer. I'm an engineer and I want some Grimey's I just go, I mean I'm into music and tech.

Speaker 2:          01:25          I'm into music and tech. Okay. That's what I said. There's the, the big umbrellas you consider one of the things I've heard you reference a couple of times and it seems almost contradictory to my, my image of you, um, is only do what you can see in the headlights. Can you talk about what that means to you?

Speaker 1:          01:46          I would love to, um, before the days of Google search engine, um, uh, we had a thing called Yahoo and, uh, one day I was in the studio and I think it's a nice story. Um, and so I was there, um, kind of going round and round in circles trying to finish this song. Um, I, I'm, so I am in my studio, this is the first time I recorded a studio and recorded an album on my own. So I was in the studio constantly, all by myself for like a year. And so it does send you a bit mad. And because I didn't have an a and r man or anyone that would come in and go, oh, that's really good. Oh, you should turn some more up, or whatever they say. Um, I, uh, I was going, man, a man and so I couldn't finish this song.

Speaker 1:          02:29          So I went onto the search engine and I just said, how do you write songs? Um, and I found this article about this writer novelist who had written this little blog and it said in it and do what you can see and the headlights. And what she meant was if in the song you can see that there's a high hat that needs fixing or that you could, or you're trying to finish the lyric and you know, you can see the color of his eyes, then just do that. Just write that bit and just keep chipping away. And eventually you will see the full path ahead of you and you'll see the, you know, all this, all the landscape. But it's that kind of, Oh, I've got so much to do, but so much to do. Um, and it's overwhelming and it's, you can't breathe. Um, and then you just remember, we'll do it.

Speaker 1:          03:17          You can see now just do that. Don't see, don't do all this complicated stuff that's far away. You know, you have to get to it eventually, but you can't see it just yet. So just do that. So that's what I mean. Yeah. And I use that a lot, um, in everything from like, how do I look after my child this morning when I've got to get to this interview and I've got, you know, I just said do he just seen the headlights, which is make sure she has breakfast in it. Um, and that's just, yeah, it seems to me

Speaker 2:          03:41          how are supposed to feed them. I hear I do six months. I didn't see it every meal. You know how to skip even one.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Yeah, that's true.

Speaker 2:          03:50          It's very strict rules. Um, so one of the many things that you've juggled a is the Harry Potter curse child a soundtrack. We're going to see a quick video, um, introducing that album, which has just been released.

Speaker 3:          04:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:43          that is a bit of the play, which is on Broadway here, which is wonderful. Um, and yeah, for about four years ago, I got a call from a friend called Steven Huggett who isn't movement director. Tony has, he used to have this group called the frantic assembly. And when I released a, well just after I released a song, an album called speak for yourself, which is the same album, but I couldn't finish that song. And I really sat by myself with my own label and eventually licensed it to Sony because I couldn't deal with all the main orders. Um, and so, but before that, um, I got this call from this Guy Steven Holl get back then like 20 years or 15 years ago. And he's like, are these annoying me by the way? Should I take them off? Are they present because they're really annoying? Um, anyway, so yeah, he was like, I love this album.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Speak for yourself. Could I, I want to put it in this play that I'm working on. And there's going to be like people dancing around it. And I was like, okay, that sounds really good. And I didn't ask him for payment and I was just like, that sounds good. Yeah, okay, here you go. And I, I like tweaks and things that made it a bit longer and, and that kind of stuff. And then it went into this play and it was really great. And I loved, it was the first time I'd seen dance to my music and I really enjoyed it. Um, but they didn't ask for payment, but if I had been signed to a major label at the time, they would have been like, Oh yes, I can just spend the whole year discussing how much she should get for this and then you won't be able to use it anyway.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Um, so, um, so, so I basically, yeah, it was really, it was really great. And then we, we made friends and we kept in touch. And then, you know, he did all these amazing things and then the net in, and not the next call, but I call, uh, four years ago was him saying hi images or any as he calls me, I'm working on this play and can't really tell you what it's about, but they love your music and like all this stuff. Cause I did all this weird orchestral stuff and I'm like, uh, Acapella, a strange stuff for an, a compliment for an old silent movie. And, and nobody ever gets to hear that stuff, but he loves me and he loves all of my new music and he knows it all really well. And so he was putting all these random bits in there, which hardly anyone's heard, and it felt really good.

Speaker 1:          06:56          And he's like, I think they really just want you to meet the music. Um, and I was like, who, who, who is it? Um, and he said, I can't tell you, but it's about a boy with a scar. And I was like, okay, it's a bit of a giveaway. Um, and so I looked up online, I saw his name connected to this creative team who'd already announced they're doing the play, and then I was like, that's exciting. Um, so then, yeah, I met up with Sonya who he's, she's the producer and they offered me the job and uh, yeah, life took a very different turn. Um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:29          What was your relationship to the Harry Potter Universe before that? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:33          um, thin, um, quite distant. Um, I really don't like reading very much. Um, I mean, that's not true. I like the information that's in the book. I just don't like the process of actually reading it. Um, so, and I've never enjoyed, I've never enjoyed that my dad thinks that if he, if it wasn't down to him kind of showing me going through, he thinks like dyslexic and maybe because I really struggle, like, you know, getting the words in my head. Um, maybe that's why I like making my own. Um, so anyway, um, so yeah, so that's, that's how I ended up in there and

Speaker 2:          08:14          fascinating. And if I can ask for those of us who were much, much deeper into the universe, um, can we fan boy and fan girl out for a second and ask, did you hang out with JK Rowling? Did she invite you to her house, which I assume is a magical castle that you can only access by a unicorn or magical boat or something? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:34          yeah. Um, I have, I did meet the lady herself few times. Yeah, she was on, she was on set, quiet. Um, and yeah, she's very nice to me. She says she actually, I think when I first met her she did this division and I was like, um, no, she's, she's very happy because she, I mean I discovered that they really wanted, um, they really wanted somebody, British, a composer that's British and it was a woman. Um, so, so I was in there really at all. Um, I would, I think also with the health of Steven and the fact that the director and him are like best buddies, it all, it all helps. So can you tell us about the creative process that cause as, as I've heard you describe it, sort of it's a creative process within a creative process because they're, they're working on, they're their own thing.

Speaker 1:          09:29          It's really awful, isn't it? It's that thing, Ben. No names. Dot. Raja. You can, you can absolutely call me garages. It's completely fine. Well now, even now we even, you have your on and I quote you, I'm like, um, so then, then often, um, your question was what would your, your presence, sorry. Yes. So the creative process was, um, they really liked a lot of existing material, um, but they needed it adapted. Um, but they had it, it's a five hour play and they wanted a lot of it to be music underscored. Um, but they also, like, there's kind of three different types of music. There's music that they interact with, which is when they're on the stage and they're like meeting [inaudible] music, there's the underscore and then they've seen changes. Like, you know, a wall goes across and it's like, hmm, oh, I think it's like that.

Speaker 1:          10:23          Yeah. Um, and so the underscore bit is like quite a lot of existing material that just kind of fumbling away in the background that's been adapted and stretched and added different things and lots of high frequencies taken out because it kind of gets in the way of the talking. Um, so I learned a lot about how to kind of sculpt around the vocal, like, you know, human voice area. Um, and then a lot of, um, yeah, lots of drones. Um, lots of vocal loads of vocalizations. There's no lyrics actually is any one bit it hasn't there Rick. Um, and did, that's from Hiden seat. Of course. I didn't have to put my famous song in there. Um, so that's the one, the one song I really wanted with the lyric and I didn't want, it didn't feel right to have me sing in it and they didn't want to have me sing in it anyway.

Speaker 1:          11:08          So I got my friend's choir to sing it and then I kind of added the vocal layers underneath and made no strains and, and uh, but most of the time it was just, it was all about the transitions. And that was really, really fun and really tested my theory skills and to like, how do I get from that kid, how do I modulate in there to them and how do I, you know, do this. Um, so there's a lot of existing material and I mean, luckily, um, over the years I've been quite vigilant into kind of making, making sure that all of the songs have their stems and they're all documented and kind of filed quite nicely. So all of the songs from pick for yourself up, um, or have like John Strings, vocals, backing vocals, effects, blah, blah, blah, um, weird sounds arpeggiated things, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          11:55          Um, and then so I was lucky enough to be able to pull that in and those ones that I hadn't done, I've got this awesome, um, assistant called Alexi and he was in my studio back in, uh, back in the village where we live. And, um, and he would be kind of getting those together and then dropping them into Dropbox. I'm into Ableton sessions where then I was sitting in the theater for about three months and just with my little, you know, computer and my little hard drive and whatever and had my, uh, my microphone and sing little toys and then I was just there the whole time. And my only regret is that I didn't really get to talk it to anyone other than did you like that or could you make that a bit more like this or could you make it a bit less? Um, and uh, yeah, so I didn't really get to talk to the gang very much. Um, and I was literally there from 10 in the morning until 11 at night and it was always, well not always, but I was quite a lot of time. The last one, the last, the last one in there saying hi to the security guard. Um,

Speaker 2:          12:55          and you took all of this music, it's something like a hundred cues and uh, created an album. Yeah. That sort of a cohesive album. What was that process like for you?

Speaker 1:          13:06          Yeah. So the, the, in a theater, it was really great cause there's like tons of inputs to kind of, you know, react against and be like, oh that sound works beautifully with the light. Oh, that sound as peacefully with the sound effects or ah, the piece of that person. So all of these are kind of affirmations that that's working, that's working, keep going, which you don't get in the studio when you're all by yourself. Um, and so, but at the same time, because it's a big theater system and you don't hear a lot of the detail in the mix, so it's kind of getting away with murder in terms of what I could mix in the time that I had, which is two and a half hours of music that like quite a lot of it done also from scratch. Um, and so when I finally took that back into my studio, you know, it was like, oh my goodness, I've got so much work to do.

Speaker 1:          13:50          It's like a gazillion pops and clicks and all kinds of things I had to draw out. Um, and then, uh, and then just making it sound lush and beautiful and layered and giving it the attention that I do to my own records, but to like when it's a 78 minute album, it's like as much as I could fit on a CD, physically possible. Um, and it's 42 tracks and it's so it goes into four acts and then like one long piece of music for 20 minutes, another long piece of music for 20 minutes, but it's the going through 14 or 15 keys. So that's where the kind of, how do you get from this key to that key in three, four from seven, eight to today? Um, there's really fun. There's a lot of hard work and I did most of it standing up, um, because I also had a life at that time in a flat in London. And so there's a little bit just standing up, but it was quite good from a pollster. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:43          Excellent. Uh, a personal recommendation, I've been listening to the album for a while now. A walking through the city and listening to that on headphones gives you a very weird,

Speaker 1:          14:52          a magical layer of New York that very surprising because he did a wonderful job sort of making that, that feel magical. Yeah. Which sounds like it was kind of withdrawal and t um, kind of the other, um, kind of secret weapon I had was, uh, I developed with a company called sonic chill, my own set of virtual instruments of all my favorite sounds in my studio, so that I could basically take them on the road with me. So I could have my Embera, I could have my cello, like harmonic stuff. I could have my cocktail kit, I could have my Worley's your, your marks, a phone I read, which is a ball sort of socialists trumpet. I think it's a bit like an auto Hartford, but it has 20 things on it. Um, and then I what you were thinking of. Um, so yeah, it looks fine.

Speaker 1:          15:44          I see Mike and it's slow a bit slow today. Anyway, so, um, caught that, that out. Um, yeah, so I have this, we call it the box of tricks. Um, which is quite funny because it ends up being a box of checks in a magical theater piece. And I used all of those sounds, um, you know, to basically make things sound like me. Yeah. So I would always use the Mark's phone and I'd use the choir of me. I could play quite as on my, I had sampled my voice. So if anyone wants to make sounds that song, it sounds a bit like me. Just find the box checks and just go like Mark's phone, bit string of focal vocal harmony things and some men. Speaking of instruments, um, I wanted to turn to the mimeo gloves. Um, we've got a quick little video to introduce you all to this if you haven't seen him for. And here she goes,

Speaker 4:          16:36          Huh, oh, what do you get me out of bed?

Speaker 1:          17:21          Okay. So it's really not a very good example because what happened before? It's not your fault, it's not your fault. I think it was my team reason gave you that. But basically, yeah, well I'd done, previous to that is I had a lift my voice by going, catching my voice and then it would create a leap and then I would catch another leap. Well, I'd actually put that aside and then I would catch another loop and then we'll put that aside and then I catch that, et Cetera, cetera. And what I'm doing is I'm going, uh, posture fessed up, um, his record. And, um, when I'm out of that zone, it goes to play. Um, or when it goes to this so that it plays, and then it continues to play. And then I can't remember exactly, cause that was ages ago, but, um, it's something like when they want to pull up the volume of the first leap, then I would use my finger like this and they would just be like up and down, up or discuss, beat up.

Speaker 1:          18:13          And it'd be 120 127 in Mitie. Nope. But like 100% a loudness. Um, and then if I wanted to add reverb, I just use my secret finger, a posture which, um, basically activates, uh, the reverb, um, feeder or like the Po in my software. And it just says from naught to 100%. So if I was like, just sound like now, but if I was like over there, it would be like, dude, it doesn't a massive cave. Um, and then, yeah, so I play like baselines or he might play tinkling sounds or it's just things that I do anyway in a, when I perform previously, um, you know, you kind of have to be kind of a little bit barricaded by give you want to sample staff or you know, you're locked in to the physical nature of whatever books you're using and the gloves are, you know, basically controllers at your fingertips and you can just, uh, yeah, just be very expressive to something which is quite boring actually in real life.

Speaker 1:          19:16          It's just like turn off a thing to 100%. It was like eat. Um, but you could do that really expressive, like, yeah, because I feel like that, but this is much more like, oh, she's making her voice bigger, you know, or she's catching her voice and now she's meeting it left or right. You know, or maybe even in surround, which I'm doing on the tour, kind of moving it around a three d space. Um, and uh, and then, yeah, just kind of sampling my voice, bringing in vocoders harmonizers I can harmonize with my voice. Um, sometimes I integrated with like an IRA, a camera, well, they don't make them anymore, but a connect, um, and they would map the stage into different zones. So I could be like, when I'm over there, then, um, you know, make the drums more, uh, kind of sparse and when I'm back here and make them more phonetic or when I'm over there, switch Mohammed Hazard to minor or when I'm over here, or when I'm in the middle, take out my harmonizer.

Speaker 1:          20:10          So using the spatial, uh, this, the stage spatially to effect the kind of bigger, um, parameters in change in a system like Ableton pro tools or whatever. Um, so it's basically like a mapping device, but how it feels is you take on, um, the physicality of something which doesn't have a physical representation. It's like a filter or a bunch of effects. Uh, it doesn't have a thing that, it's not like a basic tasks like that. That's the Bass Guitar. Um, it's like a rebirth a, so you become the reverb and you become, you know, the mixing desk and you become the multiple voices or um, yeah, the, the thing that only downside though I discovered from it, um, other than like lots of programming and to kind of get it so it feels real to human. So the you'll never, you'll never even thinking about, actually I'm going to bring in my reverb now I'm going to something in my voice.

Speaker 1:          21:09          So just, it's just, it becomes second nature. I'm going to call my voice, going to make it bigger. Now I'm going to add some heart and some delays. You kind of create a gestural language. The more and more you use the system because it obviously has a bit of software in between it called Glover. Um, what'd, you could also add other inputs so you don't have to use the gloves with Glover. Uh, you can use, you can use connect, you can use a myo, you can use an iPhone, you can use your leap motion, you can use whether you know, the types of inputs and then use them to, you know, move around things in Ableton or whatever. So the gloves are essentially just trying to get away from this limited limited space. I, I felt of trying to add lots more gear to create a fluidity or a kind of spontaneity on the stage.

Speaker 2:          21:56          Sure. And, and for you, now that you've actually developed these, uh, do you find when you perform that you're in them most of the time? All the time? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:06          I wear them all the time. All the time, the stage because why take them off? They're quite pretty and they don't eat anything. Um, the, they basically have like eight Ben sensors. They've got one to two, two and one. They have lights for feedback and you can program the lights to do whatever you want. It might be like turn it red when I'm in record, which, you know, it's been a quarter, but it's nice for the audience to see it. Oh, it's in record, it's gone red. Um, and then it's a battery has got an imu so you can get your kind of positional data and just got exit accelerometer so you can be like John Peaks. Um, and I do ag guitars and it was really fun. Um, and uh, yeah, so that kind of combination. Then you've got your axes, so you've got your pitch, you've got your, and you've got rolled and then you've got different zones backwards, forwards, up, down.

Speaker 1:          22:53          And the combination of that leads to so many possibilities because if you have a keyboard and you're like, I'm going to play a squeegee bass sound. So he might be like doing and you want it to go away now or something. Um, you could do that for pressure with pressure. It can make it slightly harder if you want it here now. But if you want it to like do that and change the tone or something around it, um, you would have to use your other hand, which is an entirely consumed by going well. Um, and you were like suddenly just playing a three note baseline with a wow thing, but you could just be going, we all like that the same, but just your whole hand, then you can move around the stage and do, um, yeah. So it's all good for everything and it's not good if you want to pay like some black men in off with your fingers.

Speaker 1:          23:36          Um, but you, you do that on the piano because that's what the panel is for. Um, it's really for all of the, the unseen bits, the bits that don't have a voice or a physical nice. But you do get lost in it. That's anything cause interesting. You just close my eyes all the time and I'm like in the zone I'm paying, I hadn't see kind of layering my voice. I'm drinking in a harmonizer and I'm like, God, I finished a song. Did I actually look at anyone? Um, because it's like you're, you're playing and it's like Phil's. Yeah. Cause I have in as well. I like just hear that sound and I'm just like, you just get lost because you don't touch anything, you know, uh, like a machine or whatever. It just kind of, if becomes really like a second skin of visceral experience. Yeah. Fascinating. Yeah, it's really cold.

Speaker 2:          24:23          And where in the development process are you right now? Is it, are you, are you licensing it to someone or you are you looking for a funding partner or you, why? Well, I was gonna wait til later, but okay. Uh,

Speaker 1:          24:40          no, it's you, what we've been doing because it has been quite hard, you know, I'm not, um, kind of corporate structures and all that stuff's not my forte. Um, so we, we have a team and they've grown over the eight years since we started developing it for my own personal fun time use. Um, which then became, we did some conferences and things like this and one before and over time we've had loads of interest, tons and tons of emails that we set. We set up a company eventually cause it's like, well, maybe we should make them, um, instead of, you know, just for my own personal enjoyment or for my, my, my shows. And so we did start to development, but that's a huge curve, you know, to have to make it something that everyone can use. Software that's intuitive hardware that's robust and you know, cheap enough to, you know, make enough of them.

Speaker 1:          25:30          Um, so we have, we've made like 50 handmade pairs for people over the years and now we are getting much closer to releasing something this year. Um, which just a hundred pairs, but they will be manufactured and it will be a lot kind of down and not that much down in cost, but maybe in five years time. So if enough people buy Teslas, there'll be like two print next year. Um, so, you know, it's, uh, it is that they're, the early adopters do pay the higher price, but they get the benefit of medicine, service and whatever. Again. So yeah. This year we're going to release them. Um, we have released the mini mew. If you have a small child in your life, um, you can make a your own glove. Um, it's quite basic, but it's still fun. Um, and you can build it and code it yourself. Um, and it's called the mini me.

Speaker 2:          26:15          Yeah. I can't wait to see it that way. You'll go, well, I do, I do have a younger sister who might be interested in such, but I can't wait to see a ballet where the, where the dancers become musicians. Yeah. Uh, so whoever out there is doing that shouldn't do that because it seems built for a hybrid art.

Speaker 1:          26:32          Yeah. It's, it's you kind of, because you use your whole body, maybe your hand, right. You, you know, you don't just be like, Hey, even though you might be just getting like that, it kind of wanted to get like, you know, it's like I'm catching was then, um, so for, for the dancers, the, you know, they use a whole bodies and you could, um, I mean for fine detailed sounds, it's great, but you could equally use an infrared camera, you know, um, or kind of an array, uh, to, to have a play space but some dancers, but combined with the gloves you could get more detailed and you know, really amazing timing. Like you don't notice any latency at all. Um, yeah, it's really fun.

Speaker 2:          27:13          Well, speaking of, uh, broad, uh, shifts in technology, we wanted to talk about creative passport and we have a, a brief snippet of a video. You can see the longer, um, full video on the youtube. Um, but for the moment, uh,

Speaker 1:          27:29          we'll show you this,

Speaker 5:          27:33          the creative passport, an identity in a searchable database for music makers to upload and share that information. Everything you'd like to share about you as a music maker verified and in one place mat and empower the global music maker community as you list and link to your music and sound contributions. Add unique descriptive data to your profile and individual works to increase discoverability for brand partnerships, playlisting sinks, collaborations, live or session bookings at the same time, enabling music services to innovate, benefiting both us and our audiences. This is an identity that belongs to and works for you while also connecting all of your external existing ideas in one place. Imagine uploading your biography only once, but updating simultaneously across all services. Sounds good. Who's going to build it? You and I, we all are. Step by step with music makers and services informs me, host all over the world on our ongoing music and tech tall, interested. Show your support. Sign up. Keep up to date with the latest developments and get involved at my CLF in music to or let's bring this necessary missing layer, a music maker database to life for the health of our global music ecosystem because let's face it, nobody else can do it for us. The creative passport by music makers for everyone. There we go.

Speaker 1:          29:00          That's so join up there. We don't really have anything at the moment. This is more like a kind of call to action for musicians to think about their identity. You think about what that means. Think about, uh, ownership of data, um, about getting organized, really about having a place in the world where you can say that is the digital me. That's where I as a creative self exist because, um, you know, it's great to have all these different services and they have their own identities for you. Oh, you make be, you know, you have a profile on Twitter and the alarm and all these other things, but where are you? I feel very torn apart, feel very like a big massive tentacle in the oceans. Just, I don't have a center, like you're speaking to my center as a physical thing, but I don't have that.

Speaker 1:          29:49          And more and more as we kind of progressed into, you know, developments in AI and discoverability, incubation and, and the, I really believe that the future of work is going to be around our unique selling points, about how we, how we express who we are in the digital space so that our cells are working 24, seven on our behalf, in our words, perhaps in our, uh, in, in our, with our ethos, um, interfacing with the world. And so when it comes down to music, um, how do we present ourselves? Uh, the, the, we have a major problem in the music industry whereby, uh, you know, the commercial music industry didn't adopt, uh, the technology of MP three. I didn't see enough to serve as this incredible, amazing opportunity to like go, wow, this is life changing for musicians and the industry. Let's get on this and make it something really great.

Speaker 1:          30:42          And instead they're kind of in its, sweep it under the carpet and put people in jail. Um, and really just people wanted to share music that they loved. And so what happened was the, you had a huge disassociation from the music and the people that made it then it just never managed to catch up. And the music industry has been trying to catch up and of basically firefighting every day as people tried to innovate on this very crooked, um, kind of heavy, clunky industry. Um, so there's like thousands of services and I've spoken to hundreds of them who want to build new services on, you know, using existing music, but to get to reach that point where they have the permission to do that, to license the music, it's just not viable. They have to raise so much money with VC that then only leaves little tiny scraps for the musicians in the end, if any.

Speaker 1:          31:29          Um, and it's a very lengthy process and I just feel more than ever we have an opportunity with new technologies, um, where we could create an open database of works that the whole world could come around and create this kind of Alexandria, this library of, of content whereby all of the music services, the labels or publishers, the collection societies who all have their own databases at the moment, costing the huge amounts of money, um, that they have to keep updated and very fine, all that stuff. Um, and they're all incomplete and they all compete with one another. Um, but if that was just, just get rid of that, we don't need to have multiple versions of the same thing and all slightly different than all, slightly bad. Let's just have, let's share into a space and contribute to that, um, that, you know, alive kind of world of music and, and data and an augment what's already there into something that can be tuned into by all the services so they don't have to have that weight on their back basically road. So speaking of that, you say, um, um, Mycelia you, you see this as a potential,

Speaker 2:          32:40          a portal for income. Can you talk about how blockchain a relates to, uh, creative passport or doesn't? Yeah, sure.

Speaker 1:          32:49          Um, so for me, you know, I've been in the music industry 23 years, it's very, very hard to know where your money is at any one time. We spent about a year trying to research just the income for one song, just one song, and it's taken like a team of seven students on and off for a year just to try to get to the bottom of what, where, where does it come from? What does that radio station, what does that thing over there, why is that a match up with that? Um, and that's for me with a team of people going into the offices of the Pos and the collection societies get, could you explain this? I don't really understand that. And we're still like only 5% there. Um, so it's, it, it's an insane amount of complication for, uh, which, which comes from, you know, the physical, you know, the old day a hundred years ago, you know, how do we pay a publisher when something gets paid on the radio?

Speaker 1:          33:39          And it was much simpler. Um, so the creative passport is really just about us putting our flag in the sand musicians at the moment, verifying each other through peer to peer verification. Like we haven't a QR code. You just shine your camera on someone else's Qr Code and you go, okay, I verify who you are. And that is a thing that then creates a trust network around all the music makers across the planet in time. Um, but we're not ready for that yet. Um, we're just doing a very kind of, we may need just going around the world doing this tour where I did concerts, I do workshops, I show off my gloves, I give comp, I do conferences, I do accumulate, I do whatever I can. Um, and we meet with music makers in services and we talk about this future ecosystem because essentially if we had like it's incredibly rich data source, um, linked to the actual content, um, linking out to all of the musicians who contributed to those works, then you can imagine all these amazing possibilities of discoveries and connections and offerings of jobs and new, you know, somebody wants to book somebody, a private concert because they saw the heard something in Spotify or Google or whatever, youtube and they went, oh, well, um, I really, really liked that person's work.

Speaker 1:          34:50          I'm going to, I'm going to try and book her. Um, and maybe you do it right from the song. Um, and you, you leave or you say, I love that trumpet player. I want to, I want to put that chunk of plywood for the trumpeter, make film. Um, and then they like put the trumpet player. Um, but if we don't have a way to kind of go, here I am and here are my songs. We don't have anything to build from. We don't have a home.

Speaker 2:          35:13          Imagine you were at a, like a, a large influential tech company, um, talking, uh, to some very handsome and smart employees, how would you convince them to support you and how could they support a creative passport? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          35:31          it's a good question. I think we're not, we're not ready for like big integration. Yeah. Um, we need to, we need to go kind of and create a ground swell among musicians. So they, they get, they kind of own this space because this is a autonomous thing we need to do. Um, we need to convince music makers to take charge of their data and to really like take their digital self seriously. So at the moment we are talking with tons of services. Um, we're, you know, might have four or five, a little handful by April or May when we come in the tour around here and we do more so to being on more music makers. But, you know, we're not ready for that. Like, it's not like my space or linkedin. It's not like it's not ready. It's just imagine if you owned this, imagine if you owned your identity. Um, and what could, what could grow from that because then if we reach like a thousand or 10,000, what's going to be the tipping point for someone, you know, a company, an organization like Google to go, we're going to integrate, you know, oh, youtube service with the creative passport and that would be mega, but we're not ready for that yet because it's not, you don't have an incentive enough just yet because we need to have, you know, we would need to have hundreds of thousands before it's of interest.

Speaker 2:          36:43          Right. So, so you need musicians, maybe some in the audience and, and other, other people out there in the youtube audience to come and sort of be a part of the community and how help shape that so that you become a large enough organization that so that you can, uh, more, yeah. Awesome. Wait. Yeah. Okay. Fascinating.

Speaker 1:          37:02          Because, um, yeah, we, we know we have representatives on our behalf, like labels and publishers and collection societies, but a lot of us don't like so many musicians. I don't have any way to get in, even into any industry because they might be in Sudan or they might be in, who knows where they might be. They have no way to get onto the ladder. And if we can try and, you know, reach our handshake across the Mexican wave across the world or whatever, um, to these musicians, then we're bringing them in to this truly global community and music community that then hopefully all the services will start to think, oh well that's actually really interesting cause now made me change to this mark and this mark and this, you know, and that's their incentive. Um, but for us it's, you know, it's how can we create, uh, uh, a beautiful healthy living kind of ecosystem from which these services can grow on kind of on our, uh, that makes sense for us. And then with truly sustainable. And then we can have, you know, centuries of wonderful, beautiful music cause the musicians are supported. Um, I think we have a question for you.

Speaker 6:          38:04          I think my selenium is very interesting. Um, I'm kind of curious. Uh, so it, you obviously need the three majors to be involved. You don't think so. And I think we need them know. How does Merlin feel about it?

Speaker 1:          38:21          Um, the thing is it's like, it's outside of licensing. This is about your like personal identity. It's my skillsets. It's my projects. It's my interests. It's my philosophy. It's my biography. It's that aren't actually at this moment to do with my songs. They would link into a songs database, which my Celia isn't. My scene is like the vision, the blue sky imagination of the future. But the creative passport is a thing. It's like an APP, um, trust anchor for other services to be able to go, oh yeah, that is imaging. He cause she's got a credit passport and she has been verified by her peers, blah blah blah. Um, so if you wanted to like go and look at Gig, some promoter could pretty much trust you because that is, you'd be verified by your peers and you have a good track record and that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          39:09          So at the moment, um, where the record ended, the right, the kind of the majors are going to get interested is when this database does start to emerge, which is starting to emerge in places like Sweden. There's one in Malta, there's one, and actually here there's going to be a new one, um, around the music modernization act around them, mechanicals, how they're going to be paid to the writers. And that's something that just passed a few months ago in Congress. So they have to build that in the next two years. And I'm going, hello, IBM and that Cli. Um, how are you going to do that without, uh, the music makers? How you're going to build that without us being able to add and add to the content that you have around your publishers because that's how they're going to build it. They're going to combine the big publishers together and create the another database, um, but it's only going to be as good as their combined databases.

Speaker 1:          39:56          Um, and it won't. The problem with that is that, you know, whether they're guilty of it or not, um, is that the money that comes in from the services will then go to this body. Um, and then the money that they can't be distributed because they don't know the writers because they're too small fry and it's too much effort for them to do it. Um, we'll just go back to the writers that they do have. They do, they do look after after four years or whatever the deal is that it will be. It's probably something like that. Um, it will get redistributed back to the original writers that they, they look after so that the other writers are all around the world and all the smaller writers won't get that money. And that's tiny amounts to two these other artists. But to them it could be like 50 quid or 100 or thousand kids.

Speaker 1:          40:39          Um, so, so when they create that we want the credit passport to be able to enable individual musicians to be able to automate into and clean, uh, you know, uh, a weight kind of point to this is how to pay me or this is, this is my collection snotty. Well this is actually me. There's missing that here so that we can tidy up and do the job for them that they can't afford to do because it's tiny amounts. Um, so the majors like the records side of things because they don't have, you know, your Isr c and SWC WC two codes that you have your recording, any publishing. Um, there is no shared database at that, which is crazy. Um, and so if this does start to emerge, that may be where the majors start to pile in there recorded data and that might start to flourish and become this big Alexandria. Who knows if we can kind of make, if we can find a way in for the musicians and it can, it can further, otherwise it will just became, become another kind of claiming house, um, kind of closed space, which will have all this money put into it by the, you know, public money. Um, but it won't be further reaching. It will just be another close database and that there'll be a shame.

Speaker 6:          41:49          So we're, we're running a little low on time. I'm sorry to interrupt. Um, I did kind of sort of, I mean it's such a complicated, which is why we need to simplify

Speaker 1:          41:58          and that's when they're going to come on board is when you like when you say look, all that kind of accounting stuff that you do and all that really annoying paperwork and that he just like, Oh God, I wish I didn't have to do this. When that disappears because we have smart contracts and payments. And you know,

Speaker 6:          42:12          what I'd say to you though is that that assymetry of information is basically a competitive advantage for labels to be able to bargain with people like Spotify. And when you have 70 or 80% of Spotify as catalog coming from majors, it puts them in this position where they have to ingest majors data. Uh, and this is where I'm sort of like, you don't, you need the majors on board.

Speaker 1:          42:34          Yeah. So that's a good example. And the thing is, is that you have, if you look at the longterm, um, the majors, you know, they might hold licenses for, I think there's a maximum of 35 years. Okay.

Speaker 6:          42:45          70th. I mean at the Beatles stuff is about to come out of licensing. It was from the 50s. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:50          Yeah. So, but it's like, if you think of all the new material and most that the trend is, you know, big labels hold large amounts of existing work and younger up and coming artists or people like myself, I own our own works and we have small holdings around them and works. So how can we make that really easy so that people like Spotify, I can deal with that. Definitely.

Speaker 6:          43:14          So it's a chicken and egg problem.

Speaker 1:          43:16          It is. Yeah. And we all need to be the chicken or the egg, whichever way, but we need to get on with it. We need to make the first move basically.

Speaker 6:          43:22          Yeah, that's fine. We have another question over here. Yeah, I have a completely ever question. I assume like writing and forming, wearing the gloves kind of causes you to make different creative decisions than you would if you were just using a regular midi controller with like standard coders. Are there other technologies that you think should be utilized more or really are like, aren't kind of getting the attention that they could that could have that same potential to change the way that people either uh, right informed music or experience it?

Speaker 1:          43:50          Hmm. Interesting question. Um, I mean how, why and perform music the way I really enjoy the kind of the unknown. Like, oh, there's something over there I haven't tried yet. Or there's an input there that I've never had to deal with like audience, heartbeat info or something or like, um, I didn't galvanic skin response or something. Um, like what would id musically if I knew the audience that actually I'm trying to develop a thing. Like it may never happen because lots of things don't happen, but um, it's just a simple, it's, it's actually got a terrible name. It's called the love glove.

Speaker 1:          44:31          I know it's going to be mad at US shiny material. Is this a way that I thought it'd be nice to, for the audience member to have like they could show their love, like I love this bit. Um, instead of like taking camera pictures or like, or like clapping at the end so that I could see, oh, somebody really likes that bit, you know, or I'll do, we need, they've got a thing. And just like that little eye contact. And I think when you get those kind of bits, you know, from the audience, um, isn't, isn't it? Does it a lighter? Oh, just, yeah, I suppose so. I suppose that's true. It's really only for the slow songs. I didn't know why. Yeah, it might be something. I Dunno, I was thinking about like, could then I could give back the nerve and I could like kind of pump up the law and then they could get more love in their hand and then it would kind of die down if they use too much of it all the time, so it doesn't get too annoying. Anyway, I just, I just, yeah, it's true. They could just use a lighter. You just saved me like 10,000 pounds. I should bring it into my team.

Speaker 2:          45:25          Take a, a check or a cash. Uh, thank you so much for spending time with us. Thank you all for, uh, hanging out with us here, uh, at the talks at Google and thanks for the team, for getting all this done. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, you mentioned needs.

Speaker 3:          45:44          Okay.
