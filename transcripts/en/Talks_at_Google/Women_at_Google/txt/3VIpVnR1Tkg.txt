Speaker 1:          00:07          Hi everyone. I'm Kathy Chen and I am a product manager here in Cambridge. Um, I just wanted to kind of express how excited I am to bring Debbie here to Cambridge to talk to all of us. I'm actually a Grad Student at Columbia University full time in a master's degree program in something called organizational psychology. And one of the things that we cover there is a leadership and a lot of things around gender, also negotiations. So I've had the privilege of having a Debbie as a lecturer for my, uh, for my course. And so my class actually ranges from people who are politicians, uh, like there's a mayor of a small town in Connecticut all the way through like a chief of staff to a senator. And then there's other people who are like chief of it for a hospital, that kind of thing. And even then in that class, like a very experienced people, everybody learns something about negotiations when Debbie was there.

Speaker 1:          01:05          So, uh, another day during class, Debbie Ashley talked a little bit more about diversity and leadership training. And so I'm really pleased to have her here. To talk a little bit about both. Um, Debbie is a Deloitte Ellen Gabriel professor for women in leadership and Marita. She doesn't look retired, but she is and a distinguished research fellow at the center for Gender in organizations at Simmons schools management. And for those of you who don't know much about Simmons, but the, the center is actually funded by the Ford Foundation from 1991 and 94. Debbie was executive director of the program on negotiation at Harvard law school and she currently is a senior fellow of the PR of that program where she co-directs the negotiations at the workplace project. She's also an adjunct professor at NC, at business school in Fontainebleau, France. Debbie runs women's executive leadership programs for places like Time Warner and Deloitte and Deutscha bank and using what she's observed about executives there and these leadership programs.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Debbie is integrated those stories into this book. So the book is based on women's real life examples. She's also written many books and articles about conflict and mediation and is an authority on negotiation. So today she's here to talk about her fourth book on negotiations and gender. And if you want more information about those other books that she's written, you can find her bio and the website link on, go negotiating at work. There's also a dory there if you have questions and she's gonna talk for about half an hour and then take questions at the end. So with no further ado, here's Debbie. Cool.

Speaker 2:          02:48          Thank you. Kathy. Can you hear me? God, this is hard. The lightest right in my eyes. Um, so let me, I'm, I'm delighted actually to be here in preparation. Read the book about Google, um, by your former CEO and Jonathan Rosenberg. And I can tell you in negotiation is an important part of work there. It seemed, it seemed to me. So let me just place this book in context before I sort of talk about some of the principles of negotiation that are in the book. So I've written a lot of books about negotiation on the one that was most, uh, well known was something called the shadow in negotiation. And in that book, what I did was I looked at, you know, we know about getting to, yes, I'm about the principles of mutual gains, negotiation in the shadow negotiation. And I talked about the relationship building relationships and how you advocate for yourself and connect with others.

Speaker 2:          03:43          And so that book has done quite well. They came out in paperback in it with a different title. Um, but through my leadership development activities, both leadership programs for women but also more generally. So Kathy's program is obviously a mixed a mixed group. I really started to see how experienced leaders manage some of the challenges of internal and negotiation. And the actual motivation for this book came from, I teach a PR, I run a program in Chicago, um, that brings people from different companies for our several module program. I'm the academic advisor and I teach in it. And at the end of one of these programs, when you know, you're saying goodbye to everybody and everybody's hugging and kissing, this woman came up to me and she said, the negotiation module changed my life thinking, wow, that's really pretty terrific. There must be a story here.

Speaker 2:          04:36          And so she told me her story. And from that understood from that sort of her sending me in setting this idea in motion about stories, I started to collect stories from experienced practitioners. So this is a book about stories, Mex experienced practitioners. I've done a lot of work on this topic before I've interviewed, but this is a different book because it's got these, it's got these stories in it from practitioners. So let me ask you a question. Um, how many of you would describe yourself? So this is a question I always ask at the beginning of a leadership program that I teach in negotiation. I asked the question, how many of you would describe yourself as successful in dealing with clients, customers, suppliers, places where you are acting as an agent, either for your group or for Google. How many of you would describe yourself as successful in that? Okay. And then I can ask, I have no way of verifying this. What makes you successful? So what makes you successful? Yeah. Yeah. So being positioned to his competition recently or your goals and what makes you get into a position to accomplish that. Okay, so you build relationships with people externally. What else makes you successful? What? What makes you when you act as an agent?

Speaker 3:          06:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          06:02          you're nice. What does that mean? Nice. You're collaborative, you're willing to make concessions. What does nice mean

Speaker 3:          06:15          to,

Speaker 2:          06:17          okay, so you're a good listener, right? You're trying to find some kind of agreement that both of you are happy with. So that means nice. What else makes you successful? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:32          Right?

Speaker 2:          06:32          So knowing the right people being very well, people always say, I'm very well prepared. I know the right people. I know what they're likely to do. I'm very well prepared under those circumstances. I listened. I look for mutual gains agreements, I think, I assume that's what's behind. Nice. Um, and so then I asked the question that's negotiating as an agent, what I call this capital letter and negotiation. And then I asked the question, what's different when you're negotiating for yourself? You're not an agent. You're what we call a principal. So what's different when you negotiate for yourself? What's different? Nothing. It's the same,

Speaker 3:          07:20          sorry,

Speaker 2:          07:23          not so clear. How you can discover what's mutually beneficial. It might depend on the situation. What else is different? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:32          People reacted differently when they see someone asking for something on behalf of mothers versus for themselves. Right?

Speaker 2:          07:38          Of course. What did they see? So w so what do they see and then what do you feel?

Speaker 3:          07:43          Even if you don't feel it, it's easy to feel like, oh, I shouldn't be asking people just to see it.

Speaker 2:          07:51          They serve, they see and so they see it differently and you sort of incorporate that a little bit. You can feel a little bit greedy asking. Right. And so could make, it might make negotiation a little bit more emotional. What else? Bothering people. It's just sort of much harder in negotiating with this, what I call this sort of lower case in negotiations. You know, it's hard to get negotiations started. We don't have a structure for doing it. It's often hard to figure out what you want in this context. You know, if you're in, when you're a capital letter and negotiation, it's pretty clear about what you're going after. You might change your ideas, but when you're negotiating for yourself, sometimes it's hard to do that. It might be hard to stay in the negotiation. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:39          When you say lower case n negotiation, the parties being individuals, are you referring to where one of them is an individual or the other one is actually an organization?

Speaker 2:          08:51          I'm actually thinking about your, you could be negotiating a, what's an of you is an little end negotiation negotiating with an organization.

Speaker 3:          08:59          Well for example, negotiating a salary with your superior as an individual. You're negotiating with them as representative of the Lord.

Speaker 2:          09:11          But that's, but the is it? But it manifests itself as an individual negotiation. Right. The position I take is they are representing the total organization and when they respond to what you asked for, that's what they're representing. But it actually is two individuals actually sitting down and negotiating. Is that right?

Speaker 3:          09:28          How would that be? Any different from an upper gives a negotiation breaks dope too.

Speaker 2:          09:32          Well, cause I I that's what I'm asking you. It's a difference. I would think so because, because in New York in the first situation it capital end negotiation, you are a representative, right? Negotiating with a representative, right? And lowercase n negotiation, you're negotiating on behalf of yourself as an individual and you might negotiate with somebody who is representing something else, but you're the agent. And so is it different? Right. And also, I guess what I'm trying to ask is that are you distinguishing the two cases where you as an individual and negotiating with an organization versus you as an individual? I haven't. I'm, I'm distinguishing when you are negotiating on behalf of yourself, that's the key. I don't care who you're negotiating with, God, it could actually be, you know, buying a car. It could be a little end negotiation. You negotiate it with a car dealership, but you want the best price and it's you, right? Unless you're negotiating on behalf of your parents, your children, your spouse or somebody, you're negotiating as a principal. So the thing that's important to me is who you are in those negotiations. We'll also talk about who the other person or the person is as well. So let me ask you some questions about what kinds of little end negotiations do you have at Google.

Speaker 2:          10:48          What do you negotiate about when you're negotiating for yourself at Google? What kinds do you have? Who gets assigned to bug? Who gets assigned to a bug? Okay, so work, right? What else? And you have a preference about that or not, right? What'd you say? You don't want to get it right. Okay. What else do you negotiate about little end negotiations at Google?

Speaker 2:          11:17          Yeah, involvement or growth opportunities. Career Development, growth opportunities. Those are negotiations. You're trying to get sort of things that you can do. That's a little end negotiation. It's you're negotiating on behalf of yourself. What else do you negotiate for a desk? A desk to sit. Okay. I didn't really think about that, but I guess that that would be true and that's where to sit. What else? Also a flexible work arrangement. Sex that will work. Arrangements can be and can be that as well. So I think as we go through this, it would be useful for you. Have in your mind a little end negotiation that you might be struggling with so that as we talk about it, you might be able to think about it.

Speaker 2:          11:57          So what I want to do is add gender to our story of little end negotiations. And I want to say a few things, you know, so we have a class here, you know, gender is not just about women. Uh, it's an I and I'm not, when I talk about gender, I'm not talking about the differences between men and women. I'm talking about what we call second generation gender issues that his policies and practices and culture that on its face looks natural and neutral but can have differential impacts on men and women and different groups of men and women. And I always like to say when we talk about women in these issues, I always like to say it's like the Canary in the mine that we sort of understand some of the issues that might be effecting a minority group, which is true in a Google might have implications for the majority group as well.

Speaker 2:          12:46          So one of the ways we like to talk about what it means to have to talk about second generation gender issues is to use the example of the US Capitol. So the US capital was built in the 18 hundreds and of course when they built it, they had no ladies rooms because they had no ladies. Right. And in 1917 the first woman was elected to the US House of Representatives. And in 1932 the first two, the Senate prior to 1962 con Congress women shared a single bathroom far from the chamber even though there were many in the house in 1992 the women senators were given restrooms on the same floor as the Senate Chamber Chamber in 2011 forestall bathrooms were put in the house. And in 2013 they actually put women's restrooms in the Senate and near the Chamber when there were 20 women senators. And so the idea is that nobody was doing this explicitly to discriminate.

Speaker 2:          13:45          It just was, there were no women. And so they weren't room for, there wasn't need for women's restrooms. And that sort of the idea about second generation gender issues, that is they are, um, they come into existence because they fit the lives and the work style a certain majority group. And we don't sort of think about how it works, um, uh, for people that aren't in that majority. So I want to give you some examples about we're negotiation comes in there. The first is people are offered jobs that they don't want to take, like fix the bug, right? And you're expected to say yes. And so what are some of those? Well, in financial service organization is often the case that women get assigned managerial operational jobs that is run the office, run the country. And there's not a lot of value to that. It's obviously the value isn't sales in financial services or in a, in a, in a, a major manufacturing company I know of women get channeled into human resource roles because the idea, the belief is, or they're an operations, which is really the privilege place, they won't be able to manage it because of work and family issues or in, uh, in professional services firms, women often get put in a chief of staff roles, right?

Speaker 2:          14:59          And the key thing there is you're asked to do something you might not want to do it. And so the key is how you negotiate to make it fit with what you want to do. The second is we have outdated job criteria so that, um, uh, often, uh, people aren't on the screen. So somebody mentioned negotiating for opportunities and that's one of the things, um, there, so in one organization, people, people say we have higher, like me, at a certain level in an organization, people don't know exactly what they're looking for in leadership. So the best thing is let's let me find someone who looks just like me, right? And so if you don't fit that, if you don't look just like that, it's up to you to negotiate for that opportunity. I do a lot of work in Africa. Um, and a story about this woman lived in rural Nairobi.

Speaker 2:          15:46          She's a phd scientist and all of the work with the important work was in Nairobi. But nobody ever offered her an opportunity because they assumed she wouldn't move, that she wouldn't leave her family that was in rural rural Kenya or another woman who was picked up work that when her boss left and was actually doing the work of a vice president, and she did it for three months, but nobody thought to offer her the actual role. So she had to negotiate it. Women often get asked to do more invisible work. It was just a column in the New York Times by Sheryl Sandburg and Adam Grant about women housework at work asked, being asked to do things like mentor other people. You know, I think this happens for people who are different as well. Diversity Mentor, other people run a run a, uh, group, um, uh, beyond the diversity committee.

Speaker 2:          16:34          All those kinds of things that are extra work and their presumed that you will do it. It's invisible work. And so part of the challenge there is to negotiate value. And one of the things that we know is that when people do invisible work and actually has a benefit for organizations, um, and so we have to claim value for that integrating work and family. Right? So somebody said flexible work arrangements. Well it isn't just flexible work arrangements. It sort of, we have this vision of the ideal worker and boy, the ideal worker at Google is alive and well. I think you're supposed to be there all the time. Right? Um, the, the heroic stories in this book, we're about people who worked long weekends and long nights to do all the work. So if you have family responsibilities, that becomes sort of an issue in the way is how do you negotiate to make that work?

Speaker 2:          17:20          One of my favorite stories is about this woman who was in procurement, in oil and gas. And to get promoted, you had to relocate. And this situation to Ghana, and she had a family, she didn't want to live in Ghana for three years, but what she was able to negotiate was sort of a commuting relationship so that she was in Indiana for a few weeks at a time. And then we'd come back to Dallas and go back. So negotiating to make work arrangement work in the face of expectations about the ideal worker. And the final thing is about mandate for change. So by there's this research, uh, that's about the glass cliff. And here's the story. The story is that when organizations are not doing well, the likelihood that a woman is going to be put in a senior leadership role goes up, right? Think Melissa Mayer. Think Mary Barra at General Motors.

Speaker 2:          18:12          Think Meg Whitman at Hewlett Packard. And so the glass cliff means that you're put in charge of these risky enterprises. And I guess the reason it's called a glass cliff is if you succeed, great. If not, you're off the cliff. But the idea is when you take on one of these risky, uh, risky roles, you need to negotiate for support so that you're a, so if it doesn't do all that well, you're a, you're sort of protected. So when I want to do is talk about three challenges, I've sort of spent a lot of time talking about the context. Someone talking about three things, getting negotiations off the ground because the structure doesn't look the same in little end negotiations, get their situation that is really trying to understand where they're coming from and dealing with resistance, their resistance to change.

Speaker 2:          19:02          So getting no growth. Here's the, here's the challenge. Excuse me, I'm here to talk about sources of my project. Yeah. Later. Uh, so negotiations, little end negotiations don't have a structure, right? You have to construct them out of whole cloth. So what are some of the ways you'd get negotiations off the ground? There are two major ways that we write about in the book. There are others as well. The first one is to make your value visible. People negotiate with you because you have something they want and you need to make it visible in what we call a currency that matters to them. So it isn't just that you work hard. It's what they think about that matters to them. That makes a difference because you're trying to build in some kind of reciprocity that is, you're trying to get them to the table. So let me tell you a story.

Speaker 2:          19:53          This is about a woman. She was a director of external relations at a very large man, Midwest manufacturing company. And she was asked by people in another division. They were, uh, they were the legislative division to help save a really important client that they had at the state level. Um, they were about to lose the client and it was going to be a very big, um, it was going to be, this is a company that supplies, um, uh, uh, resources, you know, uh, all kinds of equipment and stuff to come to companies and businesses and buildings, a stuffer buildings. And so she did it. She helped, she saved this client. She got huge amount of Kudos presented to the board, the CEO, it was terrific. But then they kept asking her to keep doing it. They would call her up and they would say, we need your help again in another state.

Speaker 2:          20:48          And you know, she really liked to help so she would help. But she found that she was spending a lot of time doing this work and it was not her job. So the first thing that she did is she goes to her boss and she tries to make her value visible in a currency that matters to him. So she talks about how she cost her contribution, how much time she's spending and what it costs. And then she talks about what she's the, how she's really saved the client, what a benefit it has been. So she makes her value visible in what she thinks is a currency that has value. And he says it's terrific, but the time isn't right. You need to be patient. So the second, so that's making your value of it didn't actually work. So the second is using your leverage and what do we mean by your leverage?

Speaker 2:          21:38          Well, there's a concept in negotiation. Probably many of you know it. I mean, I think of a lot of, you've taken negotiation courses here at Google. The concept of Batna. Everybody know Batna. Yeah. You know your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. You asked herself, what happens if I can't reach agreement here? What am I going to be forced to do? What are they going to be forced to do? So in her situation, her Batna, I is what? What's our alternative? If she can't get her boss to negotiate what's her Bandana is actually to stop doing the work for this other group. But she does it in a way that we call smoothing out your Batna. So it isn't so abrupt or so threatening. Maybe. So the first thing that she does is she uses question. She goes to this other group. The next time they ask her and she says, you know, this is really taking too much of my time.

Speaker 2:          22:33          I'm really concerned. How will you handle this if I don't do it right? So she's letting them know about her alternative, but she's doing it in a way that's very engaging. And so they say, well, there is somebody that's supposed to be handling, but that person doesn't do a very good job, so I don't think it would really work for us. We really do need you. Then she says to them, let's focus on the purpose. I always like to say, you want to connect what's good for you to what's good for the organization. And so she talked to them about why it would be good for her to have this work as part of her job. And they say, right, it would be. And so they become her ally and they go to her boss and they say, we really need, this woman's name was Isabelle.

Speaker 2:          23:19          We need Isabelle to do this. And that gets her boss to the table. So she gets him to the table, they reorganize her job. She now has the legislative part of part of her work. And the key thing was is that she used her alternative with somebody else who could act as an ally for her. So I'm interested, do you have problems getting people to the table and what kinds of things have you used? What are some of the things you've used to get people to the table to negotiate with you? So yes, in a salary negotiation, I used an offer from another company, right? So you know there's a really interesting way to do that. I call it, we call him the Bobi called smoothing out your Batna. So one things you can say is, I have this other offer, right? But the other thing you can say is this is that's just letting you know your Batna, smoothing out your Batna. Say I had this other offer, but I'd much rather stay at Google. Right? So you let them know about your Batna, but you do it in a very engaging kind of way. And I think this idea about smoothing out your Batna is a really nice, a nice concept. It lets people know you have alternatives, but you do it in a way that I think is consistent with a collaborative culture at Google. Any other things that people have used to get people to the table with them?

Speaker 2:          24:36          Nothing else. No other hints. Okay. Well hopefully it was just some of these. Nope. Okay. So let me go to the next point that I want to make, which is the idea about getting who they are and what they want. So we had this sense that I'm in negotiation, we want to focus on people's interest, you know, to come up with mutual gains agreements. But you know, that there's more behind what people want than just the issues that are on the table. People look at the person you're negotiating with considers him or herself in the context of the larger organization. So for example, if you're negotiating salary, if somebody is going to give you a salary that you want, they want to think about what's the implication of this to other people, right? So this notion of how they think about their, uh, themselves in relation to, uh, to the things that they might, they might give you.

Speaker 2:          25:30          And so I usually like to put this slide up because one of the things we think about is we tend to see ourselves as the heroes and heroines of our stories. So we like to say we're strategic. We take the long term perspective, we see the big picture. We act in the organization's best interest. We're flexible and collaborative. They on the other hand are opportunistic. They're short term thinkers. They have narrow vision. They're out for themselves, rigid, an uncooperative. And I have to tell you, nobody wakes up in the morning, looks at him or herself in the mirror and says, I'm opportunistic. I'm a short term thinker, I have narrow vision, I'm out for myself. Average. Everybody thinks they're operating on that left hand side. That what they're doing and responding to you is legitimate and strategic in their view. So what I'd like to say is when you think about getting their perspective is to think about there good reasons for saying no to you. Good reasons on that left hand side. What would their good reasons for saying no to you? Because that's the hidden agenda of any of these negotiations, right? It's their reasons for saying no. So let me tell you this story about, this was the story actually the woman I told you about right in the beginning.

Speaker 2:          26:46          So, um, she's the vice president, chief financial officer of a division of an energy company. And the condition of taking this job was that she moved to Texas and she moved to Texas. And uh, she was there for two years and her family said at the end of two years, we're going back to Pennsylvania, which is where they were from, with or without you. And that's when she said to me, the negotiation changed. My, changed my life because what she recognized, first of all, it was that she had leverage and her leverage was that the chief financial officer of the company relied on her to have a relationship with people in the field. So that made her feel like she had value to negotiate. The second thing that she did, and I think this is really important, when you raise an issue in a little end negotiation, chances are you're raising a problem and when you raise a problem, you're the problem.

Speaker 2:          27:39          And so it really makes sense to come in with good options. We call it in the book anchor with options because if you anchor with options, you come in at a frames the negotiation. So let me tell you what this woman did. Her name is Cheryl. So Charlotte negotiated with the chief financial officer and she came up with this idea of something she called the Tri Office, which was sometime in corporate headquarters, sometime in the field and sometime in Pennsylvania. But then she thought about what are his good reasons for saying no. By the way, when we tell people about negotiation, where we say prepare, prepare, prepare, and when you prepare, prepare, prepare, you often can't hear what the good reasons are. So it's really important to leave it, I call it, we call it being mindful. So when she thought about his good reasons, first she was, she thought he might think she wouldn't be able to do the job right.

Speaker 2:          28:31          She wouldn't be able to in in this kind of as if she wasn't corporate headquarters, she wouldn't really be able to do the job. So she built into her offer performance criteria. They would look at performance criteria. The second thing is she thought he might think it was too costly. He paid for a move already and he might not want to do it again. So she built in a cluster, Sharon provision. The third thing was he was afraid if she left, he loses connection to the field. So they built in a way that she could deal with the field. He thought that she would be tired, get tired of the commute. So they had periodic check ins. And the final thing was he wouldn't want to change precedent. There's nothing she could do about that. But what she did was thinking about his good reasons for saying no.

Speaker 2:          29:17          And in the negotiations, I always like to say, you know, if you know a good reason that people are going to say no, it's great to start there. So she could say, and you know, I think you worried about my performance that this is going to jeopardize that. And he said, right. And once they're able to talk about it, it sort of can lower the resistance a little bit. It's a nice story. They did a pilot, it worked. And Child, she's vice president and general of that division. So the final thing I want to talk about is what we call dealing with resistance. That is you, you, um, uh, you raise something. So here it is, uh, you put out an idea, the person that says this will never work. You say, yes, it will. And he says you're wrong. And she says, no, no, I'm right.

Speaker 2:          30:00          And what happens in these kinds of things? I talk about this as, um, moves and countermoves. So when people don't want to give you what you want, they say things that can put you on the defensive. They're resistance. And so they defend, they question your competence. They say, this budget, sweat, align. Uh, everybody else can do this. Why can't you? Or they criticize your style. You're being unreasonable or don't get so upset. They demean your ideas, which were ever get these numbers from. This will never work. Or they appeal for sympathy. This is really the killer. I think I really need your help on this. I'm very stretched. So please just hold. That's what the boss did and Isabelle's case or they flatter you. Another killer. You're so good at this. Why wouldn't you want to keep doing it all? 80 hours of it. And so what happens is we get into this move and counter move like this as opposed to thinking about what we call turns and turns changed the dynamics. So the first term you can always use is interruption

Speaker 2:          31:13          silenced. It's very heavy, right? You take a break, you interrupt because you never come back to exactly the same place. Or you can ask a question, you can correct it or you couldn't solve a problem. So I want to give you an example. This is a story about a woman. This is again from Africa, she is on a phd, economist works for Large Ngo. The coin of the realm is doing research, but also having your work make a difference on the ground. So her name is Rosa Lee and she's coming to talk. You can tell this organization to the assistant director general. Did you get a sense of what this organization must be like with an assistant director general? And she comes and she says, I've come to talk to you about funding to present it. The next international congress. I just published an important article in the Journal of Agricultural Economics and I want to present it.

Speaker 2:          32:02          And he says, I'm not familiar with that journal. But as you know, we need senior people to come and present at these conferences. That's where we meet with donors and you're not ready. And she says, I can't believe you're saying that I am ready to present. And he says, look, I really need you to support the work here. You are best at helping me in the director general get ready to the conference. And she says, no way am I just going to help you present my data. I need to be there too. And he says, don't get so upset. And she says, I am not upset. Right. So that's an example of resistance, counter resistance. So let's look at it from a perspective of turns. So she says the same thing. He says the same thing, but instead of responding in a countermove, she says, she asks a question, help me understand the criteria used to determine whether people are ready.

Speaker 2:          32:56          Right? So she opens it up and he says, we need it. And so he said pretty much the same thing, but she hears it differently, right? He gives, she asked a question, he gives a reason then knowing that she can correct it. I understand what a priority this project is and I want to support you and the director general so you can meet with donors and he says, I'm glad you understand. Okay, so now she's getting cooled out here. That doesn't work. So she says she jumps to the problem and she said, since I am most familiar with the data, I think the best way to support the project is for me to do the presentations and be available to answer questions that donors have that would help the donors have confidence in our junior researchers. Right? So she expands the product from just herself to something that's good for the organization.

Speaker 2:          33:43          It's good for junior resources and for donors to know that junior resources that researchers are doing important work. And so he says, actually I think that would work. I'm going to run it by the DJ. Now, obviously this is a very stylized kind of situation, but the idea about being prepared when people are going to use these moves that put you on the defensive. And what I would like to say in the book, which we didn't, I didn't talk about today's knowing what you know about the person you're dealing with. What do they do in these kinds of negotiations so you can be prepared. So the final thing I just say is, you know, this book, um, we, the, the subtitle of the book is called, uh, turning small wins into big gains. And our notion about this is that these kinds of negotiations over these issues actually make some change.

Speaker 2:          34:31          So if you think of that Isabel that was doing this extra work, she becomes a role model for changing the idea that invisible work and just helping has no cost. It has a cost and it should be built in to a job. Cheryl, in this tri office actually changes a precedent. It is no longer the case that it is expected that people will move to the corporate office as a condition of taking on a very senior leadership job. They might, but it's non negotiable. It's not just assumed. And Rosalee changes the role of the junior researchers. Now the leadership of the organization is open to the idea that junior research, it's actually a good thing for junior researchers to present. So negotiation becomes a way to change kind of cultural practices. So I think it's not just good for you. I think it can be good for the organization. So we have some time for questions. People have questions.

Speaker 1:          35:31          Zone is from Beca. I'd love tips on helping him manager understand the value of work that is done outside of one's core role, right? For example, training or mentoring others. It's important for the greater good of Google or for your work, but can be hard to defend in the face of an ambitious team goal.

Speaker 2:          35:51          Right. So I mean again, I think the most important thing there is how do you connect, why it's good, what are the benefits? You'd have to be able to quantify those benefits in some way. You know, sometimes people say, you know, when we mentor people it means that they stay, you know, I reading this book about Google losing talent is something that Google isn't so happy about. So the idea if you're mentoring people to stay, especially if they're in a minority group, the idea that you're helping them stay would be uh, putting this in a currency that has value presumably to the person you're dealing with. Other people have suggestions for how you do that as well. I don't think I have to be the only one answering that question. How do you, how do you make invisible work that you do that isn't just generically value cause it doesn't contribute directly to the work you're doing? How do you claim value for it? Anybody have any other ideas? Have you done it?

Speaker 3:          36:48          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          36:54          build it into your goals.

Speaker 3:          37:00          Right?

Speaker 2:          37:04          Okay. Yeah, I mean I think the idea there is to connect what's good. I always like to say there are a few stuff, a few principles that I have here that I had in my notes, but I didn't say it. And one of them is connecting what's good for you to what's good for the organization. You need to be able to talk about why it's good and the degree to which you can do that. I think, uh, sort of, uh, it makes a difference.

Speaker 3:          37:28          Okay.

Speaker 2:          37:29          So the question was the answer was in reviews, bring it up and have it built into your goals. That's a good time. You know, and I say negotiation doesn't present itself as sort of clear opportunities, but reviews are often, um, uh, a place to do that. And in the book we talk about, we have a lot of examples about how you build in these kinds of things to ongoing conversations, like reviews, like project reviews, how you stop that conversation and build something else in that you want to accomplish. Yes.

Speaker 4:          38:01          So you started by talking about framing your value in a way that matters to the other party. But, um, in my experience as a young professional in when I was negotiating for my first job, my pre, prior to this one, I had no idea what my value was. They had grades and I had no idea how to explain that grades would be useful and I got a job. So somehow it, but they thought I had value, but it was never clear to me what they saw or how I could highlight that. Right, right.

Speaker 2:          38:34          But you know, when you're getting

Speaker 5:          38:36          hired right out of school, you don't have value on a currency that has value yet they have to determine what it is. But over time and working, you do have value and a currency that has value. I mean, I think the hiring is sort of different, right? I mean, I think, you know, Google looks for talent and good grades, right? So you probably had somebody thought you had talent and you probably had good grades and they thought, okay, I mean when I gathered from reading about Google, the interviewing process is a really important part. But I think over time, little end, that's not a little end negotiation. Actually. That's more, you're negotiating for it to get hired. It's a little bit, it is a little end in some ways, but it's not in terms of the ongoing work. So now you do have a value and want to change things where you want opportunities.

Speaker 5:          39:22          That's when you really, I think, have to show your value to persistent question is how do you know your own value? Especially as a younger professional. If you don't know your value, they won't know it either. Right? And so you also talk to people you need to, you know. So one of the things is, you know, we always think we're on our own and doing this, you not to talk to other people in your network. Help them get some advice from people who've done it before. How did they see their value? What are the kinds of things that matter? You know, I, one of the things in the book that we talk about is knowing what you know about the person you're dealing with. How do they like to hear things? What do they value? So finding information about the person you're gonna negotiate can also help you help you do that, but you're not on your own.

Speaker 5:          40:02          Exactly. Do you have a comment about that? So I actually sit on our new Grad hiring committee, so I see, so you just go by a lot. I tend to not to see what the offers are, but I do see the candidates go by. Um, and as far as knowing what your value is and that situation, um, shop yourself around, right? It's, it's like often when I want to know the value of an old piece of electronics, I go to Ebay and see what people are paying for it. Shop yourself around, see what Twitter will offer you. See what Facebook will after you see what you know, any other company out there we'll offer you and then come back to, to Google. Because you know, you wanted to work at Google even though you're interviewing all these other places, but come back to them and say, well, these guys were gonna offer me this. I have a competing offer. Nothing gets the recruiters into action faster than having competing offers. And I think you'll find that true throughout your professional career, no matter what level you are a applying to be hired into

Speaker 2:          40:53          heading another offer is a bat na, there were such suggests you need to do a little bit careful about how you use that directly. One of the things that I like to say is when you have another offer, you know your value and so therefore what you're asking for fields defensible, you can stand behind it. Some of the research suggests, especially with women, when you drag out that other offer, people don't hear it so well. I think you're an experienced person on the hiring committee. Other people might sort of not do it, but I definitely want to, I am not involved directly in negotiating. Right. Just so I was looking did they look good?

Speaker 6:          41:33          Right, right. It's just going to say in terms of like knowing your worth, like talk to your peers, talk. Exactly. Peer reviews. Um, you know, when we have yearly Perf, I think that's a great place and just just get real time feedback. Right. You don't have to wait, like to go, just don't go. And I'll get an offer. Right, right. Yeah. Hr. Um, but, you know, I think that it's, it's more than just your, you know, there is a lot of other ways than just going out to, to see what Facebook would pay you.

Speaker 7:          41:58          Great.

Speaker 2:          42:01          Other questions?

Speaker 6:          42:03          There's more questions on the dory. Okay. You can see them now.

Speaker 2:          42:06          Yeah. So when a collaborative scrappy, we're culture teams and individuals are pulled in many directions, do you have tips for managing a wide range of requests and opportunities from multiple unique sources? Well, again, it's a little bit about knowing what you want. If you don't, if you're not, you can't get what you want if you don't know what you want. And so if you're just being buffeted by request and you can't anchor on something that matters to you, I do think you need to get advice about that without, if you cause a kid getting pulled in all these different directions, that's what's going to happen. And so you're not going to be able to carve yourself out sort of a career and a program, a program to progress. So I, you know, I think it's, um, yes, you need to have people that can help you think about that.

Speaker 2:          42:55          That's why mentoring is so important, right? In a culture where this happens a lot, mentors are really key to be able to talk to people and get advice from them about what makes sense here for me and what doesn't make sense. It makes sense for me. So I think there's sort of anchoring and having, knowing what you want, cause you can't get it if you don't know it, if you don't know it. And I think it is one of the things. So there's so many opportunities, it's hard to focus on it. So, but I think if you don't, it's very hard to sort of push to negotiate for the thing, then you can't really negotiate with the things you want just being pushed back and forth. Now you might want to narrow it down to a few things and use these things to trade off each other so that you might want to, it might help you get exactly what you want. I think there are a lot of choices here. Um, and, and so I think focusing is really is really key.

Speaker 7:          43:47          MMM.

Speaker 2:          43:50          You know, I think this sounds like a theme here. There are sexy projects and Grosvenor projects on every team. How do I negotiate for the ones that will set me up for success, which are usually the sexy ones. So I guess I would say, again, knowing what you want, but you know, doing a little of the grunt but do it and we call this if then, right? So I'm willing to do this if then I do that. So you connect these different parts of what you're being asked to do and that way you really do make it a sort of a, a negotiation. So there is a cost for you doing the grunt work. But if you're, the kind of person always says no to that grunt work, I think it's going to be an issue. But if you're, the kind of person always says yes to the grunt work, all you do is get brunt work. So that the issue is really to make it a negotiation. If then if I do this, then I want to do that. So always connect these asks, we talk in the book about how to turn asks into negotiations because that's really key. You get asked all the time and how do you make it into a negotiation? So one of them is if then, if then, which builds in reciprocity, I'm willing to do this, but then something else. And I think that's important. Yes.

Speaker 6:          44:59          Can you talk a little bit about some of the basics such as anchoring, which you talked a little bit about, um, whether it's you starting the negotiations at a certain point and ratcheting back. How big do you make your initial asks? Right.

Speaker 2:          45:14          You know, so, um, uh, anchoring comes from a negotiations when you're attending to negotiate about a single issue, right? So you have an idea about a bargaining zone and we make offers and we moved back and forth on that zone and it, it tends to be the case. If you have good information about the other size, other sides, alternatives, it pays you to make the opening offer. I don't think this is a little end negotiation advice. This is external kind of advice because I think that there's consequences to doing what I'm about to say it. A little end negotiation. So let me be clear. But when you have good information about the other person's alternatives, it behooves you to make an opening offer. That's what we call a large opening on offer because your frame the negotiations and you anchor it in a way that's advantageous to you.

Speaker 2:          46:05          If you don't have good information about the other side's Batna, you have a tendency, you have, you run the risk of either anchoring too low, in which case you cut off a lot of the bargaining zone or anchoring. So much off the charts that people sort of walk away. The way I like to use anchoring in little end negotiation is anchoring with solutions. So you know you have this, so you're asked to do grunt work for example. Well do you have, can you anchor with a solution about what you would do? Some of it or who else would do it? Um, uh, so anchoring becomes solutions to problems because you're always trying to make trades. I meant to tell my trade story. So I guess I'll tell my trade story. Now, you're always looking for making trays. You know, in the, in all negotiations, you never want to negotiate about a single issue.

Speaker 2:          46:50          You always want to negotiate about more than one issue because you want to do if then you want to have, uh, you want to have trades. So here's my story about trades. This is a story about an anthropologist who studied the Navajo in Arizona and she finished her fieldwork and she's driving back to Phoenix and she passes the Navajo women on the road. And she asked her if she wants a ride back into Phoenix and this woman says, sure. And this woman gets in the car and it's totally silent for most of the ride, except when they're getting close to Phoenix. The woman, the Navajo woman notices that in between the two seats there's a bag and she asks the anthropologist what's in the bag. And the anthropologist says, it's a bottle of wine from my husband. And the Navajo woman says, good trade.

Speaker 2:          47:42          So it's important to think about traits, right? Trays are important. It's always sort of, if, then we, I didn't really talk about that that much in this talk, but it's, there's a lot of it in the book always about if then, and so anchoring in a single ish, you know, single offer kind of situation, you know, those are so rare. That's not what you're doing. Even when you're negotiating salary, that's not what you're doing. There's so many other pieces that are part of it. So Anka was solutions because I think it does the same thing. It frames the negotiation in a situation that's advantageous to you because you sort of thought about how you, uh, how you frame it. Okay. So suppliers, you know, I'm not really talking about that. Um, suppliers,

Speaker 7:          48:25          uh,

Speaker 2:          48:28          you know, how you negotiate with suppliers for on a short timeline to, to pull in dates due to urgent demand. Again, I think, you know, it's, it's an if then kind of thing will they do with this time and in return you'll give them something else later. Um, you know, I think that those are, um, uh, and, and, and then the then could be how we keep each other informed so that we know more what's happening. Um,

Speaker 7:          48:51          okay.

Speaker 2:          48:52          Yeah. So somebody Nigga isn't negotiating on behalf of you and they don't negotiate well, how would you prepare them to negotiate? Well, I think that's a really important issue when you are counting on people to negotiate for you. You want to have the first negotiation with them. What is it you want them to do? And sometimes I actually might need some help. Um, uh, when they have to negotiate on your behalf, there may be a consequence to negotiate on their behalf that they don't want to pick up. And so I think you have to find ways to sort of help them, help them do that. Um, uh, uh, help them figure out exactly how they wouldn't go shake it off and negotiate on your behalf. Um, that, that you don't, if you may not have all the information that they have about options and policies, what you want to get, ask them for that information. So this negotiation with your manager, it's actually the first negotiation. It's not something that you're just sort of talking to them. It is negotiating to get them to buy in, to be your advocate. And that's what you're sort of asking them to do.

Speaker 2:          49:55          I Dunno. Sales teams, I don't have a, that's an open ended question that I don't actually have a lot of advice for. Um, I would suggest you talk to other people on your sales team to get advice for that. Um,

Speaker 7:          50:09          okay.

Speaker 2:          50:14          That's it. I, um, I got some, I interviewed some people before I, um, uh, came here to get some other information. And some of the things I learned was the case. Scarce resource at Google is time. So one of the major things that you're negotiating about is really time. And so it's, it's, uh, trying to think about creative ways and creative ways to negotiate, to negotiate about time. And so we have some ideas in the book about that as well. Um, especially in terms of negotiating about work and personal life, uh, work and personal life issues. So are there any other questions?

Speaker 2:          50:58          Well, thank you. It's been a real pleasure. I hope you liked the book and you use it. Um, and if you do have questions, Kathy has ways to get in touch with me, I'd be happy to sort of answer them, answer them online. I think there's sort of a theme here about the kind of questions you're overwhelmed with choices and you're having a hard time negotiating about those kinds of choices. And I think it really starts with you being clear about what it is, what it is you want. I guess the other thing that I didn't say when I talk about, um, I, I said, you know, connect what's good for you to what's good for your organization and convert an ask into a negotiation. The issue is, the way you do that is it's always yes and that's what builds in the restaurant. Yes, I'm willing to do this and here's what I need.

Speaker 2:          51:44          So you're always thinking about sort of connecting it and making it a go negotiation. People always say, I need more help saying, no, I don't think that's right. I think you want to have help saying yes hand. And when you put the and out and they say, well, I can't do that. He said, well, then maybe it's not going to work. Right. But at least you've had an negotiation about it. Um, so I would encourage you in this negotiation culture to, to think about some of these, uh, some of us, some of these principles. So thank you.
