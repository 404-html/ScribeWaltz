Speaker 1:          00:06          So I'm going to start off with just a, uh, a small background here at my pace as a series. I didn't envision myself doing this so much, but it became so, and every time I'd do another book at adds meaning at least to my life. And it began when I took on the Sheryl Sandberg Lean in conversation. I wanted to expand it to be more about the range of choices we make in our life. Some people that I say are leaning in going on the autobon full speed ahead. Others have a more winding path. And my objective was that we celebrate all our choices and then we reserve judgment. And that was this book right here. And so the cover is about blue sky and open roads. That's how we should see our world. Blue sky and open roads. And then I thought it was done.

Speaker 1:          00:51          And then the next thing that happened was that my mother was Aylien. She was coming on to the end of her life and I wanted to elevate the conversation from focusing on her to something more meaningful. So I asked people the question, what's one lesson you take from your mother and how it's impacted your life? And that gave us a really rich conversation. And I found out by the way, that, uh, mothers and their kids have way more complex relationships than I probably realized at the time. And that was booked two. And this was about showing your gratitude or, uh, as I say, giving either a flower or an olive branch as you find comfort and peace in your relationship with your mom. So now I had two books and the marketer in me said, well, now you probably need to start thinking about a tagline.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Um, and, but I wasn't. So, and I thought about that. And so what the at my pace series is about is at its heart, it's about personal stories. And then from there we were able to have a conversation, an expanded conversation. And from there, hopefully there's emerging insights. Uh, so it's stories, conversation, insights. Now I feel like I'm having a tagline start to happen. And then after that, uh, I was not quite sure what I wanted to do, but I realized that I have a lot of millennials in my life. I have three children and a son in law. So I think technically I have for millennials in my life and on good days, I understand them on other days. I'm sort of perplexed by the way they frame their world. But I don't fall prey to the generalizations that we always hear about millennials. You know, these are, these are some of the ones, uh, you know, my social media obsessed, narcissistic, want to get there fast, you know, you can imagine all the ones that you've heard.

Speaker 1:          02:29          And I wanted to hear from them themselves, how they look at their world, what their challenges are and what we as as baby boomers can glean from it and also what they can share among themselves that will help them as they find their way. So just in terms of the, at my pace format, what happens is there are there a thousand word pieces, roughly their story oriented. I give guidelines and I helped contributors get their pieces together as much or as as they need. Uh, and um, so I came up with some guidelines for the thousand for the, for this one, Lisa, who's right here was fortunate. Shoot my first contributor. She was an awesome one. Uh, there's 29. And so what I wanted to do today is talk about what I learned and what you do with it. And I'm hoping that we can have a conversation about this.

Speaker 1:          03:19          I would like this to be informal and I would like you guys to ask questions or give me your thoughts as you hear them. So I'm going to start off by just giving you some of the titles. There's 29 pieces in here. I'm going to give you some of the titles to give you a feeling for what I heard. And I want to see whether raise your hand, if any of these either resonate with you or you know, somebody close in your life who you think they could have meaningful. Okay. So these are some of the titles, uh, a layered identity when the world tells, you know, detours.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Imposter Syndrome.

Speaker 2:          04:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Finding the power of me. A series of new beginnings.

Speaker 2:          04:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:11          A clash of perception and reality. How to love myself, the start and the restart, turning, caring into doing

Speaker 1:          04:28          and keeping the faith. So those are just some, um, and what was exceptional to me about these contributors as it was a look at their lives and the most uncurated way, they were extremely honest. They, uh, when you read this book, you will see that there's a fair bit of anxiety, some depression, some stress, tremendous uncertainty, self doubt, all the things that we, you know, I know as a, as a baby boomer, I have felt for years, but our twentysomethings feel that and um, and they explain where it comes from and, and what they're doing with it. Okay. So, uh, I think the way, the, the, the best way for me to begin as to describe the first piece in the book and the last piece in the book, because I think it really frames the discussion. Will, the first piece is purposeful prisons. A leasee wrote that and I, well, one of the questions I asked these contributors is, what is a book, a poem, a song, some new, something that resonates with you.

Speaker 1:          05:29          I wanted a quick insight into the window of their soul. Uh, so tell me what that would be. Um, and they could or could not use it. It didn't matter to me, but at least it helped me to understand who they were. And so we see right away said, oh, William Wordsworth, nuns fret not now. I was an English major. I happened to like worse, worse, worse. But I did not recognize that poem. Um, and it's a wonderful poem and in nuns front, not, it's really about how the constraints in our life, sometimes us purpose and meaning. And so Wordsworth discusses how nuns like convents help poets like Sinus, they're 14 lines. And how, while some people might find those boundaries constraining, infringing upon the things you want to do, Wardsworth argues that those boundaries are purposeful. They're purposeful prisons that, that anchor you and lacy who describes being a software engineer at Ballet Dancer and an observant Jew has plenty of boundaries in her life.

Speaker 1:          06:28          But for Lacey, those boundaries are purposeful. So she makes the case for that, those anchors, those very strong anchors being a good thing in her life. The last piece in the book is called color outside the lines by Kimberly Roatan. She is the oldest of the contributors. She went to UC University of Chicago. Law School, did really well, had her pick of jobs at law firms when she graduated. Uh, deeply cares about the social issues of our day, wants her life to be dedicated to the social issues of the day. And so she picked what she thought was the most, one of the most progressive left leaning law firms that she could find that she could work in. Um, but it didn't last very long for her. Even that did not work. And so she leaves the law firm and she goes and she fights for the social issues, which include immigration rights, sex worker rights, healthcare advocacy.

Speaker 1:          07:23          And she finds her way to today she is the assistant director at northeastern law school for policy. Uh, but in the course of all that, she discovered that she loves to paint. She loved to dance. She, she came out, there's a whole sort of sharing of her life and a sharing of who she wants to be, who she is. And so the, there aren't too many boundaries for her. For her, it's about expressing yourself and being true to who you are. And so we have on one side, purposeful prisons on another side, color outside the lines, which she literally as she paints with her fingers and figuratively as she makes choices in her life that defy some of the more traditional choices. Um, so we had that on the other end. And so the question is, you know, for these contributors, for these 29, where do I fit in and what are my challenges?

Speaker 1:          08:16          And finding that place where I can find a piece, a truth to who I am, um, support for the things I believe in. I think that's the challenge. By the way, I also was able to survey this group, which is, this is the first of the books that I surveyed my contributors in the previous one that just took their stories and went from there. But I wanted a little bit of data because after all, we live in a world of data and that's what I do in my day job anyway. Uh, so, um, I, I, I ended up, I read through these stories working in the stories and I, as I stepped back and look at them, I found that they're basically sort of five parts of, of I what I think the contributor has had to sort of conquer and manage to get to a place that they felt good about.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Okay. So the first one is just about being healthy. It's about being emotionally healthy. It's about being physically healthy. It's about feeling like you're standing firm on your own two feet with energy and purpose and ready to go. That actually doesn't sound that hard, but it's obviously it's very hard. And uh, one of the early pieces I worked on, uh, was um, a woman named Pam Nofx and she writes a piece called heal thyself. And what happened was I met her sister and her sister said to me, you need to get, you need to get ahold of my sister. She has a piece in her. It'd be very helpful, very therapeutic. I think you should talk to her. So I did talk to her and I'm just going to read you the beginning of her piece healed myself. Uh, she's 28, so she's older and in this range of 20 somethings, I found that the older you were in your 20s, the more you had to share or more willing you were to share what you had to offer.

Speaker 1:          09:53          So this is what Pam says. In June of 2017, I was a bridesmaid for the fifth time in my life, I bought another expensive dress, got my hair and makeup done and smiled as I walked down the aisle on the happiest day of someone else's life. I looked around the room with this group of friends and realize how far we had come since high school, six or the group of 10 were married with one more couple on the way in a few months. One couple was expecting a child, another had moved to Sanford, Connecticut and gotten a dog. Most everyone was becoming established in their careers. These people were dear friends and we shared a common history. But in that moment I couldn't help but feel pretty far from their realities. So what happens to Pam is she continues to do her her life, but she, um, she looks at herself all the time and feels like she's not, she's not attractive.

Speaker 1:          10:50          She wants to eat less. She ends up having some kind of an eating disorder. Her Ma, she cries, her mother says to her, we have to get you help. This is not, uh, this is, this is not okay. And Pam agrees. And so through a combination of therapy, meditation and Yoga, she finds her piece and she understands herself far better. And what she says at the end of our piece is that the hard work of her twenties has paid off for her and has laid the groundwork for what she thinks will be a much more positive, much, much more energizing. 30 so she's looking forward to taking advantage of the foundation she's laid. And what she really wants to do is help others who suffer like her. She became a licensed yoga instructor. She's going through other training. And what she intends to do is to pay it forward because she knows how long and how hard her path was and she wants to be able to help others.

Speaker 1:          11:44          So step one is being healthy and you'll see when you read the book, there's a set, the second piece in the book is called sliding doors. It's about a young man in college who falls off a balcony and has serious trauma and has to relearn. His gait, has to relearn. So many things we take for granted. And so he's also looking back at his life and the sliding doors because it was going this way and then it went that way. And so, you know, all of a sudden he sees his life very differently and he has the same idea which is get healthy and then bit pay this forward. And all the people in his life who have helped him, which is quite a large team, feel that, uh, there's now new meaning in their life as they realize sort of what you, what you can do for others and also the fight that people have to have in them.

Speaker 1:          12:28          So, uh, healthy is job one. Um, but the second one, which I saw some hands raise on is about managing rejection. And for these 20 somethings, uh, you know, they grew up, like many of them grew up in families where they're told they can do everything. The world's your oyster. You know, we tried to groom them for the most possible successful outcomes ever. We tried to make sure that they weren't experienced too much failure of any failure. We tried to make their life just smooth as silk. And of course, that's not the way the world is. And so I'm talking to a journalist, his name is Sam Tabachnick. He works. He worked for the Washington Post. He was a contractor and a list. Very happy one. Uh, they told him, well, probably when the contract runs out we'll be able to get you signed on as an employee.

Speaker 1:          13:14          But as you can imagine, it did not happen. And uh, so now he's faced with trying to figure out what he's going to do next. And you probably know that journalism is not the easiest places to land another job, you know. And so he sent email after email and has coffee. He talks about how many cups of coffee he has to try to network to Atlanta, his next job and all. He feels his rejection facing him. And he writes this, he says, frankly, I just wasn't used to this kind of repeated rejection growing up. I might get rejected from the travel soccer team, but there was always another team to join. I went to schools where the teachers nurtured us. Pretty much everyone got A's and B's. There wasn't a need for a 10 of tough love. So the question is what to do next?

Speaker 1:          14:04          Because he wasn't finding a job. He needed both money and purpose in his life. So he became a Lyft driver. This was not anything he ever imagined. Uh, he doesn't actually love driving cause he finds a traffic to be very burdensome. But what he discovered was that when he was driving people, he loved talking to them and he lived almost interviewing them to see what was going on with them, what they were about. And in that way, it confirmed for him the journalism and reporting. And it is really what he's about. And so he continued to be a Lyft driver until he found his job in journalism at another job for a smaller paper. Uh, as I ended up being, you know, he worked his way through it. But when the world tells, you know, it's about not expecting the rejection you're about to feel.

Speaker 1:          14:53          And I feel that was a theme that made it through so many pieces in this book, how to manage rejection, the surprise of it all, how to pick yourself up and just keep on going forward. So in terms of, uh, the, the, the, the steps that, the challenges that these contributors had to conquer to get to a good place. One was emotional and physical health. Another one was understanding and experiencing rejection and being able to make your way through it. Um, but there's a third one, which I think both the parents and the kid share, and that's called the burden of expectations. We expect so much from them and they expect so much from themselves too. And when you live under these high expectations, there's almost the only one place to go. Uh, and so I'm going to read you another piece that I, at the beginning of another piece.

Speaker 1:          15:39          So back to my asking people, uh, what is a song, a poem, a book, something that resonates with you and a piece called a clash of perception and reality. Gabriele rams starts the following. He says there's a delightfully smoked scene in season four of the office where Ryan Howard has been promoted to the corporate office in New York City. Ryan's climb up the ladder. It means he will supervise his former boss, Michael Scott, clearly pleased with his progress. Ryan's looks into the camera and says, people keep calling me a wunderkind. I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means. It means I'm very successful at your age, so it makes sense. And uh, and then Gabrielle says, I thought I was just like, Ryan's skipping a dozen steps on my way up. I crave the satisfaction of being considered a wunderkind. He goes to work for a political newspaper, he's super excited and he gets to be in on the issues of the day.

Speaker 1:          16:48          He gets to me senators, he gets to have all these super cool conversation to things. But then he realizes that she was having dinner with his father who was a journalist. So what are you really doing where you know, we'll kind of work. Are you doing, where do you feel you're adding value? The more he sorta of peels back the layers, the more deflated he feels, the less he likes the newspaper. And he realizes this isn't really a job for him. It's not even a career track for him and he is now disengaged from that. He's going to go to a public policy program in the fall and he hopes to enter into a career of politics. It comes from a very good place. He says, I want to give more to the world. Then I had a little more to the world than I take back and so it's all good.

Speaker 1:          17:30          But his expectation of being the Wunderkind, that kid who would be able to exceed all expectations, that's a hard one to manage. It's a hard one as parents, when you place that on your kids, and it's a hard one for kids who had their own expectations that are quite large and I think it doesn't always come from a bad place in the parents. We know that we know our kids and we think know we want the best for them, but it ends up being in a bad place because it ends up putting pressure that they already feel upon themselves anyway. So when you decide to go do fill in the blank, what will you hope to get out of it? If it turns out to be a path that's not meaningful for you, how will you know what's, uh, a milestone, a measurement, something that you hope to get out of it. That's what's the marker that you hope to see. And if you don't see that, you know, what would you do? I think the problem is when we start to place our answers on them and they're not their answers. But, um, I think it's tricky and maybe we have some young 20 somethings maybe in this room. Does anybody want to offer any thoughts as to what, what we could do, the older generation to be a little more effective on this one?

Speaker 3:          18:36          Uh, I'm probably actually not even old enough for this book to apply because I'm only 19. Um, but I think one of the things that a parent should do is probably, um, let their kid have other role models other than like just parents and relatives and stuff like that. Because that's like a really good way for the kid to be very isolated and have like, just, they want to live the expectations that their parents have for them. Right.

Speaker 1:          19:05          So other role models and really allowing their kids to find other ways to get their guidance. Yeah, exactly. That's a great suggestion. So the other part about that is why don't you have this burden of expectation and you'd go ahead and you decide you're going to try to go live up to it. What do you do? And so they're contributors in this book do a series of what I call experimentation and wandering as they try to find their way. Uh, there is a piece by Carla Moody called a series of new beginnings and she just, she describes graduating college, having no money, having to get a job as a volunteer, uh, living with her aunt so she can basically have free living. And during lunchtime when people might be able to do something, she just wanders the street walking because walking is free and she loves water.

Speaker 1:          19:58          She's a Pisces, she says. So she looks at water fountains and she entertains herself in the cheapest free way possible. And from there she ends up names. She just had, okay, I need some money. She gets a nanny job. From there. She goes to work for Groupon from their digital media. She just wanders from one job to the next, then she leaves Chicago and she goes to Colorado. Um, and the last I spoke to her, she's, you know, she said every step along the way, she learns something about what she likes and what she doesn't and she now understands. And this next job she thinks she'll last longer. And do you think she'll have a little longer road on it but a wandering and experimentation is the process. And two things about that. One is that I think if we were to repair our high school kids and our college kids for this is a trajectory that many golf go through versus thinking they're going to have a straight shot.

Speaker 1:          20:47          I think that would be helpful. And I think if we ourselves as parents prepare ourselves for this trajectory that's windy and has starts and stops, then that's helpful too because we placed less demands on them and we place less anxiety in ourselves, which just ends up meeting and everybody feels the anxiety that we feel. So that's, that's an example, but I'm on the experimentation piece. Uh, I want to tell a story. There's a sudden it was really funny. So as you know, I asked, you know, give me something that I source of something that means something to you, a poem, a song book. And so I talked to this man named Aaron Schoenfeld, who I've never met and he says to me, Oh, that's easy. I love chem moves, interpretation of Sisyphus. Wow. Ken Mus interpretation assists this. So it turns out, let me give you a little background on, on Aaron.

Speaker 1:          21:41          He went to go work at city year. He graduated college. He thought it'd be a basketball player, but his basketball career wasn't as long as he thought. So he studied anthropology and he's all about giving back. And he ended up joining city year and going to Tulsa to teach. Now he always high expectations of what happened. We went to Tulsa to go teach high schoolers, but he said, um, here's what he found. So he starts off and he says, uh, that, um, I spend most of my day mentoring and tutoring students who are struggling with attendance, behavior and classwork. I pull students out of class to give them individualized support. I met biweekly with students to discuss behavior and attendance goals for the week. My services spelled feudal. I could feel my activist spirit dwindling. And so then what happens? He, um, he realized, he remembers, he discovers, he says, I found out that it's tough to tell students to do their homework when their reason for not completing the assignment was that they have no time in between work.

Speaker 1:          22:39          They have no time in between working to support their families and being the primary caregiver to their young siblings. So he was serving a very impoverished, um, uh, disenfranchised community and education in the classic sense of what he was trying to teach them was just not on. It was not possible. And so then he remembered Camou and you, you know, the mythicism business, the boulder that you're trying to push up and then it ends up coming down. And so in the myth and in his interpret and Campbell's interpretation, the meaning is in the struggle to continue pushing up and he says to fight the nihilistic tendencies and woe is futile and you have to find meaning. And the in the every day grind of doing the job and moving things forward and the challenge of it all versus the outcome of it all. And so, uh, he says, come and can't move.

Speaker 1:          23:31          The most important thing is that we continue to believe in the world and in ourselves. And in the struggle there was meaning. So he completely reframes his, his job and he alters his methods. I had changed to more practical approach hoping to meet students closer to where they were instead of where I wanted them to be. And he describes what he does and he says, all of a sudden the students were improving their attendance, their behavior, their skills, and he says, all was not exhausted. My boulder awaiting me every morning, but he was okay with it. That was the challenge and the value was in that push. And so I think that experimentation is just part of the process and that I'm just like Wah Wah with Aaron Schoenfeld and with Carla Moody, you know, you have to, you have to understand and expect the fact that it's going to be sort of a fits and starts and a lot of learning along the way.

Speaker 1:          24:19          So, um, the last thing I want to talk about is affirmation. So you go through all this process, you deal with rejection, you're going to hell and it's not sequential, right? But you deal with rejection. You've got yourself relatively in a healthy place. You, uh, you know, you, you manage your expectations and or your family's expectations. You're figuring out what you want to do. But at the end game is that you can affirm what you're doing and you as the one of the contributors says how to love myself, that you really affirm what you're about and then it has meaning to you and that you can feel positive and go forward with this, whatever your mission is. So I asked her Steinberg as a comedian and she's 28 years old and she is used to being, when she gets on stage, sometimes it's a friendly audience, sometimes that's not a friendly audience.

Speaker 1:          25:04          You work hard to even get on stage. She was on a Sitcom series for a while that got canceled. She just dealt with a series of rejections that makes it hard for her to continue to move forward. And yet there was nothing else she wants to do in life, but comedy and entertainment. So she goes into therapy to sort of work your way through depression. And I'm going to read you the story that she, that her therapist tells her and I want to take from you guys and whether this would be comforting to you. Um, I think is curious. One day my therapist spent our entire session telling me this long story about a movie called Queen of the Nile, which I had never seen. It's about a missionary who goes to Africa. Somehow the mission, but missionary and a man end up on a small boat and they sail for safety.

Speaker 1:          25:48          They both die on the boat after a series of terrible events. And right before the end of the movie, the camera zooms out and reveals that they were only a couple of feed from safety. My therapist told me that woman was me. Okay, so stop. First of all, would that make you feel better? Hands up if it makes you feel better to know that you're only a couple, that the shoreline was right there next to you. It's, it's hard for me to imagine. Okay. But here's what she says now I, she said I was feeling desperate. She said, now I think go to a therapist to her or him recap on movie, but somehow it low as I was and feeling assessment and I was hearing the story brought me a glimmer of hope. My take, when you are in a moment that is difficult and gloomy, sometimes it helps to hear someone else say you are so close and you can't even see it. So for her, that story emboldened her and she felt like there is hope that shoreline's right next to her. And she kept on and she, uh, she's actually doing very well. She's, uh, she's on a series of shows and comedy is going on and, but she, she uses that as a moment and she realized, she asked it really just affirm herself and remind herself does she is good. Her, her skills are good. She can get there if she wants to. Okay. Thank you so much.

Speaker 4:          27:12          Okay.
