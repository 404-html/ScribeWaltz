Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Thank you everyone so much for coming to today's food talks with undelete. And we also have a professor of gastronomy with us today here. Um, Angelique, do you want to tell us a little bit about yourself and why you're here and what you'll be doing?

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       Well, um, and hold on. So we are coming both from Hollins. Uh, we work often together and gastronomy and all kinds of flavors. Uh, uh, I learned, uh, in the beginning from a Peter because he has, uh, restaurants, uh, name. So the Elbert's it's difficult for you to that's true. Yes, yes, yes. Uh, so it started with the older, the, the be aware of all kinds of flavors and that's why we work or running long time ago together. Uh, and now and all of the, I'm one of the two female master chefs, uh, from about 150 miles of chefs. I think I go a little bit here because the sounds is a not so good. Can you hear me good like this? Okay, great. So in Hong Kong, one of the two female master chefs about, that's quite unique. Uh, I hope in the, in the United States where a lot of more female shifts, well, what I'm doing is, uh, uh, the art of creative thinking in slavery and slave or mentioning and flavor combinations.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       So I tell you a little bit of story about culinary creativity and then we're going to make a flavor painting with about 20 components so you can experience all kinds of flavor bearing play for matches. We should maybe think, oh, I couldn't imagine that combination has a whatever made in heaven. So that's what I'm doing together with Peter will explain why some combinations have a special effects in your mouth. And so, but before, uh, we are doing that, maybe Peter wants to tell a little bits about himself and then we start with the presentation afterwards. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:02:20       Okay. Thank you. She already mentioned a lot. I have my own hotel and restaurant. I developed a whole suite of flavors. Siri, I think flavor is something that you, it's really tangible that we can measure. And I've got a phd. I applied a PG and flavor classification. So it's the only classification model off flavor in the world. Um, and where do you work? So, um, we have, we've found a way to really, uh, describe flavor in objective terms. So what I should dig is doing with creativity actually is based on a very factual thing. So thinks that Google's much like, because a, there is real algorithm, there was a real model, there's real thinking objective thinking behind it. So what she is doing is showing beautiful penny. She's going to create a beautiful painting right here. Um, and then the new may time I will discuss a little bit on the objectives, objective side of it. So, um, these are the ground rules with flavor composition. So that's what we want to show.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       Okay. So first I'm going to start with a little bit of presentation about creative thinking and about not about dream storming. That's about a note about brainstorming. What about dream storming? And then I'm going to make the painting and afterwards we do a little bit of culinary mindmapping so you'll be able to, uh, can make your own size of combination in a very, in a couple of minutes. So who loves to cook? Okay, well, I'm so happy. That's the reason why you're here. I say, okay, okay, that's fine. Um, for me the sky is the limit. And uh, the, the story about creative thinking is very important before you go in the flavor matching because a lot of times we say, okay, maybe it's not possible or we see a lot of issues on the roads, maybe it's too expensive and I think it takes too long time and we have all kinds of reasons to do something.

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       No nothing, don't let do that. So for me, the sky's the limit and uh, in thinking is to creation in doing this, the feeling and the making is the learning. And I want to tell you a little bit of story, uh, what temps it happens to be. Uh, already 14 years ago I saw a hot air balloon and that was in my car and I was dreaming a little bit and a jazz music on the background and I think, hey, Eureka, the balloon is actually a hot air, often very big hot air often do. We had a experience in a hot air balloon? Yes. Okay. You have once been in a hot air balloon. Yeah. Everybody almost. Oh, that sounds great. So, so imagine the balloon is a hot air often oven. So what will happen when you put slumps again at like a sea bass or a particular or some muscles or Zoma Paprika.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       Would it, will it, will it be kooks well, I can say so myself at the same moment now at the, because too dangerous or uh, maybe somebody else did. It's already, but I stay in my dream and my fantasy fantasy setting. Oh, when it's possible, then we can make a restaurant with the most wonderful view you can imagine around smaller villages and a small rivers. You go low and you go high. So you have the restaurant with rich. Wonderful. And uh, I keep on dreaming and then I called the a guy from a company, I said, Hey, can I ask you something? Is it possible to boots to go once with you? It's a balloon and put something in. It's the shame was a little bit quiet at the moment. You say, yes, come to my company and we go together in the air. And we, let's try it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       So I had the all small bags with a small chickens and the sea bass, and then they fill the balloon with the cold air. And then we walked in the balloon and it puts all the older small bags in the, yeah, in the side of the balloon. And then we go up and then we say, all right here, do you smell already? Something that's too big to smell something. And then, um, after it's, uh, the idea grows, that's what happened. Yeah. You get used to the idea and then the idea of getting normal and then you want more. So I say we can go with one blue, but what will happen when we put three balloons together and we have 50 persons in three balloons and we go up about one and a half kilometers, I don't know how many feet it is, but it's high. And um, uh, and we do a three course menu, uh, in the air.

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       They say, well, it sounds wonderful. And then we get more used to the rd or, and then we say what we do, we put two chefs on the top of the blue and they go up sending only outside and give me the main course. Yes, that would be wonderful. So we are all so exciting. We all really exciting saying, Whoa, that would be wonderful. And that we jumped out of the balloon to make the dessert in the metal before the balloons are lenders. Sounds wonderful. Do you think, do you think this is real? Do you think has happened? That was a good attitudes. That's great. Yeah. It's Google. So, uh, for me, uh, brainstorm, it's not anymore a brainstorm for me. It's a dream storm. It's like a hyper creativity. And then you have to be sometimes high creative too to be different or to reach some things you will never talk to you could reach and um, no, Lucas is going to, uh, show the movie. Yeah. Of the three blues connected with 50 persons, one and a half kilometers, high, three course menu on one and a half a hour. So it's a, that's me. It's a little bit young garbage. Okay. So these are two chefs who are going on the top of the balloon. That was the biggest balloon of that sign for 24 persons.

Speaker 4:          00:08:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:00       Three balloons connected.

Speaker 4:          00:09:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:03       And we go up, this is very short movie and this is about one of the asking me these high. He's on top of the balloon

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       and the temperature and the balloon is about a 90 degrees Celsius. So you have to need to convert her to uh, to put it in the, okay. So he's um, you can imagine two shafts on the top of the balloon. When the balloon is a already hall filled, they go up and there is uh, uh, on the top of, there's a small opening, they can check how my, uh, food is and this is the system from one bloom to the other balloon. So we had one kitchen balloon at two restaurant balloons in one kitchen, balloon efforting was cooped and then it go, it's go down with a police system and then it goes through the other balloons where it was a chef to prepare it for the guests. So here is far three course menu for 50 persons. Then, um, he had, uh, had to move on the top of the balloon because it was very hot, you know, cause when he was standing still, it was a, so he had to move around. So this is the first day CDs is a Dorado, which a few undergrads and cucumber.

Speaker 4:          00:10:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:37       It's wonderful. That's was so high. And now he's going upstate me with the main course only outsides and the he say, oh my God, it was so hot upstairs. There it was so worth. It was the second guy.

Speaker 4:          00:11:05       And then

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       after, uh, the main course, it was a chicken stuff where it's a duck and um, we serve with some mushrooms and some green asparagus salad. Then they disconnect the three blues and you see each balloon is going and then they jump outs, the gym park to prepare to prepare to desserts.

Speaker 4:          00:11:33       Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Thank you Lucas. Okay. For me, this is the example of believing in every rd or you do you have in every dream and uh, go on, take action. Because when I did say to that's RDA from this might be too dangerous, or I call an insurance company and they say, Oh, you have to insure yourself. Well, uh, what will happen when the balloon will crash. So it's not necessarily not necessarily to insure yourself, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:12:23       Huh.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       But for the other guests also notes. Okay. So this is me and my kitchen. This is my view from the kitchen with a lobster salads. Nice view. I, this is the kitchen. It looks if the balloon is putting their, uh, in the Alps, but this is actually a picture made from another balloon. Uh, it was in Austria and we made a triple four hours and I could make a about, uh, uh, I made it 12 dishes, uh, above the offs was very exciting. This is above the clouds. So you know, uh, the sun is shining above the clouds and then you go to the clouds and then she's very quiet and then you eat your lobster there.

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       So, um, for me, everything I do is coming route of my hearts and I believe in, that's already a long time ago. I was a chef with a Michelin Star, uh, in the restaurants. And then I felt, okay, uh, do I want to do this my whole life? Oh, yes, maybe, but not owning the restaurants. So, uh, my dream was to tell more about flavors and to travel and to do crazy things and to give experience to people, but not an experience because it's like a marketing, but experience, which is real and authentic experience. And for me it's that experience, economy experience is economy, but only when it's a meaningful experience. Uh, so this, these are the most mentions idea killers, uh, like, uh, uh, it might work in other places, but not here. And since this is the, the, the diverse one, uh, since, since I would say, since man, you are the experts, you know, when you say that to someone, they say, oh, next time, I don't want to mention my idea. So

Speaker 4:          00:14:38       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:14:38       you aren't familiar with this, but the idea chemist and the opposite of the old, the idea can, it's rd, id of boosters stuff, just, just do it and uh, go experiments. So don't shoot. You don't have a license to kill odd years. This is my message always in the kitchen. So you have to try a lot of things also to, uh, everybody has a flavor reference and a flavor memory from your childhood, from the soup your grandma made orders to. Uh, and when you love food, uh, is your memory. And uh, therefore it's important to, uh, trying a lot of things so you can make it even bigger. Well, no. Um, it's about temptation. Um, and I want to tell you about a carrots.

Speaker 4:          00:15:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       Just a simple carrots. And if I look to the carrot think, oh, you're just a carrot. You see the, the rabbits, he's laughing to the carrots because we are only using the carrot as a senate or in the soup or made us to actually do in Hollins. But, um, uh, the challenge is to make a carrot like golden carrots. Yeah. You know, like, like gold. More to give much more value.

Speaker 4:          00:16:07       And when

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       I'm also chefs and the restaurants and I have tomato bake a new menu cards. Ah, it was until three o'clock in the night and I was thinking, oh, I had the dish. But I sometimes I missed that one little accents which make a dish can make very special, timeless, you know? So sometimes you want a restaurant and say, ah, this is very nice. And another time you say, this is wonderful, you will never forget the flavor. Do we have to experience sometimes it okay any other time or say, Oh, I wish I could go back to that, to that restaurant and, and experiences again. That's what I need. I mean, as a chef, uh, I think it's important that you create dishes. That's a guests will come most remember and they will come back for. So I was always thinking, thinking, thinking all, sometimes you have it at a split seconds. You say, okay, I miss a baby. A little bit of lemon or maybe a little star on his or some, uh, maybe some seaweed, whatever. Um, but when you make a France, France,

Speaker 4:          00:17:34       oh, sorry, go back.

Speaker 2:          00:17:38       When you make a, uh, let me see. I'm missing some. So can you make inspiration? French spoons. Oh, world of possibilities of flavors. It's open. It's one logical thing is most people can only remember certain things from the short memory. So when I show it to you, carrots, just think of carrots, which are the best snake of French over carrots. Yes. Name Sir. What do you eat? Ginger. Thank you. Come on lemon. Thank you. Cinnamon. Yeah, it's great. It's a great match. Cinnamon and the carrots. Garlic. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We already here. What's about to 30 people with Fort Things? Okay. Cumin. Oh, but what did you say? Elements. Yeah, Laurel. Great. Sweep the ferrets. Okay, Miss. Yes. So you know what is happening now you'll have to think, oh, oh. And just the, the, the, the, the things we know where it matches with the carrots are in the front because maybe you've just tasted or you had just a Senate bits. Then you have to search for more. And that's the good thing to know. And creativity. That's when you have that. You can just remember seven things.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       So when you say, um, burst of inspiration coming home is four chefs sells time memories, uh, from dishes. Uh, you already eat or from your family or our restaurants. So mark has cookbooks, magazines, internet, television. But it's for a chef. It's very important to let you get inspired by the season. We'll take the best care, Doris, a wonderful carrots. I go and my mind, uh, traveling to see, I think, oh, what's, can the see offer me in this season? Maybe a nicer squids or maybe so anchovies or so I'm looking for flavored switching. Oh, the carrots will be happy from that. So if you are a carrot, what makes you happy? Yeah, that's the way chef thinks. I'm traveling in my mind to a lab or to fashion. Fashion is a big inspiration, uh, for a matching flavors and colors. So later on I will make the carrot with a very concentrated tomato puree.

Speaker 2:          00:20:34       Then you see that the colors can be inspired. Um, just to look around you to the section or arts. It's not only the colors art, but it's also when you look at this painting, Oh, what's real? This painting tell you, uh, you see a lot of, uh, deep, you'll see a lot of colors, warm colors and cold callers. And then if you take a look for a couple of minutes, then you get some emotion. And where you trust on that emotion, you can use it in your flavor combinations. Well, so now again, you love to cook and then we think again of the carrots, what can I do with the carrots? These are preparations,

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       these are all kinds of things I cannot remember. I says yes, I can also remember seven, maybe 10. Uh, when I say, oh, okay, it's a good idea to graze or carrots or two fermented or to put it on the barbecue or um, I marinaded or deep fry it or make it in a proper yachts, you know, in the foil with some garlic and oil and rosemary or I injected, oh yeah, of course. You know, you can inject a carrots. Ah, so when I have a, uh, like a, um, a needle, I could put it in and I know, or a bit, uh, sorry. Yeah. And then, then good old flavors to inject it and then put it any often. And then all the aromas are going between the carrots or I can smoke it.

Speaker 4:          00:22:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:21       So there's a lot more possible when you make the inspirations visible. And these are just a word cloud sell. So, uh, you know, word clouds, word clouds on the Internet. For me, your word clouds is, um, a lot of inspiration. Um, four techniques. These are preparations. Techniques can make a buffalo out froma or a cream from a carrot or could make an ice cream or a soup or sorry, rock. I can make a spring roll and there's Puma Flan. It's so much I can do to make this carrots, to give this carrots so much more value. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:23:06       now the thing is I can travel in my minds to another culture. So this is my loco. And uh, while you travel and you go to the markets, you was going through the markets, everybody, okay? And then you see all the flavors and the spices and herbs and the fruits and the veggies. And then when you close your eyes and you go with your, with the carrots, you go to the markets in Marrakesh, we say, oh, okay, a sort of star. I knew it was an assault, the lemon and the sort of grapefruits and oranges. She's so many things. That's what you can do, your imagination. But sometimes we say, oh, on a little bit crazy, we laugh about it, but it's really, uh, it's brings you a lot of our dealers to, uh, to travel in your mind to conflicts where you've been a concrete Smith's you with inspires like, uh, when we think of a carrot and we want to combine it with Chinese ingredients, where do you think of Chinese kitchen?

Speaker 4:          00:24:16       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       Soy Sauce. Oyster sauce, rice, wine, rice, vinegar. More Chinese, Chinese. Your child from China. Oh, sorry. Okay. Garlic. Yeah. Yeah. Johnny's kitchen. Come on Johnny. Johnny fix you.

Speaker 4:          00:24:41       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       Cinnamon also. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:48       Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Well we go along now we go to Eataly who has been in Italy. Okay, great. So when we think on a carrot and Italian kitchen, where do we obtain golf? You tell me kiss. She may be close by in your flavor memory. You're telling me kitchen come home, red wine, red, red wine, red wine, basil, tomatoes, this olive oil. Come on, go on. You can do it. Parmesan cheese, prosciutto. Porcini sync of what? Fish. You know from the Italian kitchen you have often on a pizza or Oregano and Chavez. So Parmison, prosciutto, anchovies, sardines. It's all Italian kitchen, Italian cuisine. What will happen when you templates for Jews, the carrots, which all of these ingredients get a different carrots. Yeah, so that's a little bit my message. And uh, for the painting, this is the painting in my head from all the traveling I did from all the countries think, oh, I have the character to tomato and I have to ginger.

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       And she reads, I have to Vodafone scars and saffron, a fennel seeds. I have the deal and I have even the coffee beans. When you crunch coffee beans, you have a lot of flavor. Well, what will happen when you make a carrot cake and put some coffee flavors. Okay, so this has happened in my head as a chef and these are the dishes. Then I just made this a yogurt ice cream with a roast. It's a orange shirt, Publicar with mango and the chips of, uh, carrots, tips of carrot, but not in deep fried, but to draw heights. And you often buy 70 degrees. This is the inspiration from Marrakesh with, uh, with, uh, the carrot salad with lentils, with a reduction of orange juice and some also her nudes. You know, Russell nudes, the best spice mix from a despise men there. Um, and so, uh, take care to piece to piece these cream.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       And so mint. So this is just a combination in my inspiration from Marrakesh. Okay. This is a severe issue with Kima, uh, with, uh, Korean or this is the Chinese inspiration. This is with tuna and a role with a Ferris thin, a carrot with buys, seaweeds and the major addressing, uh, from, uh, reduction of orange juice, Tempura of carrots. This is very important in this dish you have from one carats, you have, uh, for preparations. So the whole carrots wasn't the often. And then all the, uh, uh, uh, all the juices and the carrot are caramelizing. And then I could it's and it's, um, it didn't touch any water. So it's full of flavor. Then I made around the carrots. It's a marinated carrots julienned. Then I made a mousseline of the rest of the carrots, which some olive oil and some lemon juice because lemon is bringing all the flavor more intensified, more alive and then a crunch. So when you think of these flavors and you have a speech of the carrots, you have a smooth mouth feel of the cream. You have a balance of the sweet and sour from the American Mary Nation. No, the marinated carrots. And you have a crunch. So this is what you can do with one ingredients, one veggie to should use it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       These are all veggies, marinade it and rolled up. And this is the same. Okay. Well before I'm going to make the painting. Um, this is a flavor graphic. Uh, you can make a flavor graphic graphica yourself. Uh, think, oh, okay. I using aren't even in this case. Oh, which spice I do like which spices I can make a match with, uh, uh, with an NDA. And what can I do with the men? We cannot remember this. So when you draw it and make your own word cloud or a minus, oh, worlds is going open. Yep. Okay. Sorry. Next one. Excellent. Yup. Okay. Um, this is the last heat before I'm going to make the painting. Okay. Let me talk about the success factors in Alaska. Peter, here you go. Stand here. It's a little bit better. I have, uh, Peters will tell more about the success factors because it will help you every time when you go, this is the restaurant eat a dish or you make your own dish because there are a couple of, uh, it's not rules, but a couple of, uh, ah, some position Brussels compensation rules accomplishes. And why you, why you will hear this, you will never forget it because it will make every visit to a restaurant and every dish you mate, it's still be made difference. Nope. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:31:02       So the thing is I want you to, you're saying you need imagination with them and imagination. You've got all these wonderful combination of things and then there is also kind of a theory. So you need to kind of a theory to bring it all together. And that's what, uh, what, um, there's this slide shows is for one those because it's very special. Umami is a, of course one of the, it's called one of the basic flavors. Um, your mommy is a very rich family or four flavors. What is one of the, um, culinary success factors is that your mom should be there. So if a dish Mille lacs your mommy, there's something missing. This what, what, what Lashley could sing. So knowing about your mommy is very important. This is the other important side of it. Uh, knowing about what every component does in the Tisch.

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       So we think that flavor is basically about my field and in mouth feel they're ours. Those three different forces. One force, it's one forest. We call contracting a Mattel. We receive it has everything to do with salt, with the ascendancy, with sour. Um, thanks a contract to your mouth. That's why we chose the word contracted. Another substance is called another direction or the force is called a coating. And this is about all the fats and all the shivers. And everything that really leaves a layer behind your mouth. And then there is another vector, another force that's called drag or drop a, which is basically the crunch or everything that has a texture, things that you can chew on, things as you can bite off, things like that. So these are different forces. And the, this is basically the basic of every flavor throughout the world.

Speaker 3:          00:32:42       When I was in Beijing, I gave a master class and BG and then all these Chinese people exactly understood more what I was talking about within their cultural frame, within their cultural frame of flavor. So it's very important, I think to realize the flavors. It has a real structure and I call them vectors. And these are real vectors with forces behind them. Of course, we don't have a measure for these forces. That's what we need to develop, will be wonderful to have a scale where we don't have the skills yet, but I think these skills will be developed. Um, smart people at Google should be able to do that for sure. But this could be the base of, of any algorithm or flavor. So now we're going to go back to practice, um, in building the painting. Yup. So actually, okay. Um, so I will tell every time if it's coaching or worth trying or, Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       So this is the carrot, a carrot, sorry. This is the pumpkin and a sweet potato in the often lot of Bailey's and garlic roasting, roasting, roasting, then are pureed foods. And that's a little bits. It's not sweet, but it's, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's coating, but it says flavor with a little white wine vinegar to lift it up. Excuse me. And this will be kind of the basic for the paint. Oops. Oops. Okay. So coaching, right. I'm gonna ask some witness. They want to help me.

Speaker 3:          00:34:29       You're going to have to go, you're going to be able to taste everything. So you will see that there is this a bit of acidity in it because otherwise you'd would be to coating. So the acidity, it works as a countervailing power within the coaching within the door, right?

Speaker 2:          00:34:45       Yeah. That's perfect. That's what competition is about.

Speaker 4:          00:34:50       Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:00       it's a little bit sooner because I did made it this morning. So, uh, okay. I do it a little bit different now. If you stay here, we, we'd give you some other, uh, so you put big dots. Take your time, take a nice job like this.

Speaker 4:          00:35:17       Oh yes. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:21       Just on every plate. Some.

Speaker 4:          00:35:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:27       Okay. No, I have, um, this is a occurred. Cool. What's, um, for your a yogurt I might occur trough with some Miso and missiles from uh, and soybean paste and fermented soybean paste. And it's, every Japanese from a family has its own, uh, Michelle, so it's a little bit salty and it's a very nice combination together with the Kurds. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:36:07       great.

Speaker 3:          00:36:27       Again, a coating substance. All right. Taste it. You will find the acidity. So that balance of way, a bit of the richness of the coating.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:36:41       That's the balance you find within the substance.

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       So just this nice dose and line. And this is some Kurtz, uh, to, uh, but it's mixed with saffron to make it some more, uh, mystics see

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       [inaudible] success factors. For instance, at Google, I'm the London and Paris and Zurich. And Dublin. We work with Google chefs, we develop dishes, but based on the color and her success factors, then they were served. And then we asked just which one, three alternative do you like best. And then every time you find that the ones that have the culinary, our success factors are found to be without any inflammation naturally the best. It's very interesting to revalidate and reevaluation of these connect success factors and presentations is a very important one. So the way things look, the presentation of a dish to name you give it, they should test try it was all a part of flavor. It's often forgotten when people think that flavor is sweet, sour, bitter, et cetera. But this is much, much, much more. And you need to take everything into account to really understand what flavor is about. So the name presentation, color is an important aspect of it. Balances and important aspect. Uh, smell is an important aspect and your mommy is one and a very identifiable, identifiable flavors. There's more so, and then you need a balance in my field. Differences in that. These are all, let's say the coating substances of you will find that we need more to make a nice balance and a nice dish or a canvas or a painting.

Speaker 2:          00:38:44       Yup. Then we have the tomato, a tomato with a,

Speaker 4:          00:38:52       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       Mixed together with the sweetness of the,

Speaker 4:          00:38:57       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       Oh, sweet potato and the pumpkin

Speaker 3:          00:39:03       tomato is a very special ingredient because there are many flavors within the tomato is you have a, let's see, already harvested tomato or a, an unripe type, then the acidity and the darkness will be there. But when you have a very rich tomato, which is a, a harvested late, then of course it will be much sweeter and much Richard. So it's very important to look at what type of tomato, half for the effect that you want to use. Do you want to have something sweet? Do you need it? Riper type of tomato in their suite. Sweeter one. Then, um, if you're just wanting to talk to us with their, yes, it is.

Speaker 4:          00:39:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       Okay. Then we have a very wonderful ingredients. He was, you will smell. It's so volatile hall. It's a fermented, uh, spices and veggies from the Indian kitchen, like a, like a onion, garlic curry leaves and is very strong. So, uh, I, I'm, he gets until a 40 degrees Celsius, mixed it with skin flora since flour and olive oil and it's still be connected connecting cause it's not spicy but it's full of flavor.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       You say part of the second factor factor that I mentioned, the smell of our dish is very important. Or using an oil like this, you have a very rich flavor components and you will notice that within seconds everything will smell like the of here. So it's an important aspect is fine. Split shot already have it in my nose. Your House. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:40:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:41       Okay. Then for the crunch, a juicy crunch, we use the leaves of the Andes and you can use a later. I like a kind of a spoon. And then with the Endif if you pick up the creams, like a crutch, we need a crunch. Piedra

Speaker 4:          00:40:59       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40:59       So also this is about it all, all uh, must build. It should be interesting. So you need crunch bites, you need to do to fix that practice and thinks that break every cargo was crunching your mouth to make, to have the lead, the creamy substances. It will be a kind of boring. Um, so I'll now we're going to have different lectures, Matthew. So here you have, I get the leaf rakes and makes a high pitched sound, which is much more like crispy. Um, they're all, they're going to be nuts. They're going to be Christmas. Um, they are all different mounts fields. That really helped to make a flavor imbalance.

Speaker 2:          00:41:44       Okay. Do you already a smell? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:48       Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       Say the officer's juniors coming a little bit to the, to the flavors and,

Speaker 4:          00:42:00       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:00       Imagine that the oil wouldn't be there. The dish would be less interested. Right. It's a smell that test.

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       Okay. Now we have a green oil. No, just agreeing oil. It is, um, uh, make from a slack, Parsley and Tarragon. Target has a lot of a slaver and often when you make a, an oil herb oil, it's, it's gonna Cause in some Brown Greens, a color. And then we blanch it first just in water without salt and put it in, put it out at the same time, make it cold, very quickly, squeeze out all the water. And then we mixed it with 40 degrees Celsius, uh, oil, uh, until it was like this. And um, uh, it's a glorified which makes the, the oil much more intensive than uh, than you do. It's a which is when it's wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:43:04       No. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       Look at what the color does on the painting.

Speaker 4:          00:43:12       Oops.

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       Part of presentation.

Speaker 2:          00:43:23       So Am I, you are going to eat this led well, uh, you have to mix a lot of things but it will happen.

Speaker 4:          00:43:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:43:35       At the same time when you ever taken is going to connect

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       the terror gun, the partially our fresh flavors and they are often confounded with a, with a sour, that's the very important to distinguish is freshness from Saudis fresh is intolerance do go together once in a while because then the oil like this, it's just a freshman chief job without the soundness. So there's the reason it doesn't influence these mafia on the contracting side, that's two coat coating but also gives fresh news.

Speaker 2:          00:44:18       Okay. So now we will talking about the carrots and um, this is the purple carrots for me is this, is, this is the example how to, how to it seduce or 10 tastes. So juice, juice, a carrot, well it's not that difficult. You just put it in. He often for a long time with a lot of a bay leaf, I think this carrot had about six Bailey's crushed. So a lot of flavor can come out of the babies, a lot of garlic. Then we first blanches sewed up. The plant cells can uh, can uh, open open and then all the sweet juices can caramelize and it's in the open on 160 degrees Celsius. Uh, sorry. Next time I will have it would found hearts in my head and then roast gross gross. And it's going to flavor like um, dope. Yeah, licorice, licorice, you know, liquors. In Holland we are fond of liquids. So this carrot is like licorice just to carrots with three ingredients. And I did it with, uh, just the normal orange carrots and it's, it's quite different. It's more caramelized and it's less intensive than the purple one. So I have for everyone, I have one piece yet, so if you like it, just please take one piece. Otherwise I don't, we'll have enough. Um, and we have a whole carrots to combine it with all the other flavors on the dish show. What is nice to uh, yeah, puts the,

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       I think one of the things in the astronomy that people forget a lot is to cook vegetables. Vegetables are a lot of times and if you read them raw, they are and their love more flavor to find and carrots or in whatever vegetable when you add temperature. And the often here as well, when I'm here, I'm often surprised all the things that are even involved here, Kale and sprouts and, and much of these things, I'm actually my turn for the better when they've been cooked and then you can eat them. Of course, uh, uh, coal if you want. But I'm cooking vegetables and the lower temperatures, getting these, getting these flavors out is a very important side of the uh, flavor story of Chicago for vegetables.

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       This is a freshly made tomato puree from uh, tomatoes, onions and cooks, reduced all the water LRN until it stick. And then we put it in the blender. And then you have your own fresh puree from goods ripen.

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:33       And uh, this is the, the color blocking how you see in the fashion when you have an orange shirt, uh, within the, uh, rec trouser and you know, so well and flavor is the same. The characters very sweet and the tomato is a little bit of acid. So it will give much more life to a, to old things. Yup. It's often when you miss something and this then start with adding a little bit, maybe some capable, all little bits, a sour, a tomato puree or a,

Speaker 3:          00:48:20       I soon as he is often forgotten parts of the dish, including better bitter in acidity. Our thought that the people don't like those things and uh, they're kept away with, for depth and for, um, having great dishes. You need a good addition of some acidity in some bitterness. Not too much, but a bit slack. Salt. It's good to add.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       Let's do all US fresh olives tried on us. Okay. We have the, the fresh ones, you know them, it more flavors will come to you when you are aware. I would like to eating but then see difference, it's flavor, the difference. All the dried Kalamata olives and we put in boats on the painting so we can experiments. And what is happening when you put out all the liquids? It's, it's very strange flavor. I don't think you've ever flavored like this and all it so intense. It's a little bit better. Just a little bit and a little bit more salty. Okay. What do maybe we'll do.

Speaker 4:          00:49:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:50       You could just a little bit. So here and there. Yeah. And uh, these ones we put liver togetherso it's in the same area. So you can taste boats. Yup. Okay. Um, let me see what I have the, we do the same with the capers. We have the fresh caper fuel note him. Yeah. And when you dry the fresh capers any often at 70 degrees Celsius, so don't be in a hurry. Uh, the often is doing the job and you dry it. You got to crunchy s it's ingredients. It's very nice. It's very nice flavor. We put us next to each other again. So you can flavor the difference.

Speaker 4:          00:50:49       Yup. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       Of course you understand what you're doing with um, can drying things in your, your intensify flavors in it. That's fine. If for your flavors you're also changing things. So you're, you're reducing the sharpness of the raw and the rock paper is a very sharp facilities. Tasty tried one. It's much more on the salty salt. So you, the whole profile of the Cape is changing by, again, adding temperature I think through, think of that's a lot of work left the oven due to work. You can do your own thing while the oven is working. You don't have to stand next to it. You don't have to help it. You don't have to look at it, it just works by itself.

Speaker 4:          00:51:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:39       Okay. Yeah, it's from the Japanese kitchen, a topping, uh, usually use for rice. And I made it myself. It's from a seaweed roasted sesame seeds, white ones, the black ones and Wasabi flavored ones, uh, which, uh, you know, I need it in the, uh, Tufts in the pen. Um, dried capers are also in it and it's a really nice crunchy mix. I'm going to put it on the, on the side of the curve with the,

Speaker 4:          00:52:26       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       Where did Nisho because they're a little bit French. Yeah. And then, uh, you take a little bit and what's the measle Kurtz and then with free Kaka and you have a wonderful combination.

Speaker 4:          00:53:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:18       Yup. Okay. So we are almost there nuts. Yeah. And that's some things I will leave here because it's getting a little bit too busy on the, we do first we do the crunch, we have a cracker. I make prom, a tapioca flour with saffron and what are spread out, dry it, and then I deep fry it. And the current is importance in a dish, uh, without, without a crunch. This can be very, uh, sometimes boring. Even the crunch we put on the saffron cream.

Speaker 4:          00:54:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       Yeah. Just put it down. Put it in. Okay. And we have to, same with the seaweed. Seaweed cracker also made from Tacos, Tapioca and with crunchy seaweeds we put on the, we put it on the,

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       on the missile, not everywhere you're in there. Then we have more, we have the walnuts, just plain bullets, x different crunch, then Endif or Dan, uh, the saffron crackers and I put it crunch also. What does the Kurds,

Speaker 4:          00:55:22       oh,

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       these are all elements that belong to the drying components on the plate, but evidently the nuts are different in math field. Gender crispness of the saffron and the, um, seaweed that'd be half of that one.

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       This is a very important one. You know, that the breath, what's the cheese and the ham and then the cheese is coming on the outside of the breads, you know, that's, and then you get that smell from the caramelized cheese. Well, this is the, the, the crunchy part of the, of the [inaudible]. Sorry. It's only gonna be sites of the toasty. Yes. This is wonderful. You only need this when you flavor it with the sweet potato and the tomato, and then you have old Italian Umami flavors. You can imagine.

Speaker 4:          00:56:32       I play dumb. You didn't mention it's Parmesan, but, um, most folks probably everybody knows since. Why was it together with the motto? Of course. It's a wonderful book. Oh yeah. Pharmacy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       Just a couple. And then the rest we do supports just a couple of, yeah, hold on. Yeah. Okay. We're almost there. Uh, let me see. We have, uh, this is very rich. These are LG crackers, not to LG from the television. What's Lg from the scene? Very, very strong. Don't eat it. That's the first. It's a beginning. Of course. It stays very low in your mouth.

Speaker 4:          00:57:42       Okay. Can you put some? Yep. Okay. Let's see. One thing.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       Yeah. The chef, because there is a camera and I have a very awful.here. Yes. You see? Okay. Then, uh, we leave just a little bit separate. Um, I started with the carrots and I almost ends with the carrots. But first, uh, when we talk about no waste, um, you can make a powder from every ingredients you can imagine. So when you have a left overs from veggies, just dry them any often and then put it in the like a coffee bean machine. The small thing, you know what I'm here like, right. Very quick one grinder. Grinder. Yes. And then you can make a wonderful power. So, um, I put some powder sees that's taking place, right?

Speaker 4:          00:58:56       Just to finish up with green hair. Yeah. It's awesome. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:59:15       good. No, ours do a hell key hints. Yeah. Course. So then we ends where we started with the currents. Uh, you see what's happening, just a, the LGG powder. It's a mixing, but two carrots, nicer. Yup. That's what's happening. The carrots a or I mates from when you juice the carriage to the juicer, then in the container, your rudder, the pelvis, we meaning just try to pull up and you have a wonderful, uh, carrot powder, which you can use in a patisserie or in, uh, in, in the Doh or dressings. Okay. All the sites.

Speaker 4:          01:00:14       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       Well, that's actually has a lot of flavor. Okay. Off of reading. Hers are you have one. Okay. Okay. I forgot one thing I have to sign. Go to. Sorry. I have to sign the painting. Yes. So I say, go on Google maps. Yeah. So it's for you.

Speaker 5:          01:00:45       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:00:53       I would like to invite you to come around to painting and just experience all the combinations. So bon appetit.
