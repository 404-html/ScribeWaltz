Speaker 1:          00:01          All right, so please give me a hand in welcoming to the stage. Jim letterer.

Speaker 1:          00:12          Hi, I am Jen letterer and you are a unicorn. Now, what just went through your mind when you heard me say that when you heard I am a Unicorn, were you closer to the side of yes, I am a unicorn. Thank you for finally recognizing me or were you to the side of like at best, at best, you're skeptical. Now other Unicorns in the room, those of you who are like totally embodying, already knowing welcome, really excited to have you. But the others, the skeptic, the ones who question what in the world I could possibly be getting at with that, the ones who may be rolled their eyes a little bit when you heard it, even if it was an internal role, you are the ones that I'm really excited to be with today because I have learned that one of the fastest ways to grow is by learning to ask the right questions by having a critical mind and by embracing that skeptic. And it kind of likes to talk a lot of games in the back of your mind. So

Speaker 1:          01:35          don't shy away from the questions that might come up today because everything I'm here to share with you was actually born out of my own skepticism, my own questions and doubts about what is being taught in regards to leadership. There's all of these buzz words around leadership, right? Oh, and your power be vulnerable. Lean in, right? Just, Oh, your shadow. And here's the thing. I agree with all of it. Okay. I think it's great authenticity rock. But the way I see it being talked about can a lot of times lead to misunderstanding, pressure to be a certain way, which when you're thinking about being authentic just seems ridiculous and it can lead to pain.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:44          So here's an example of a scenario, a conversation that I have seen play out multiple times. So someone says, Hey, I'm really ready to step into my power and own my greatness and be a leader. Where do I start?

Speaker 2:          03:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:02          So all you have to do is be authentic. Like really just like be yourself.

Speaker 2:          03:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Um, okay, got that. Really appreciating that. Thank you so much. But a quick followup question. What do you mean?

Speaker 2:          03:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:18          So like you just need to be your yourself. Oh. And your vulnerabilities puts your shadows into the world. Really show people that you have overcome all of your battles and you are stronger.

Speaker 2:          03:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Um, again, really appreciating that advice. One last followup question. No. Um, if let's say I'm not a hundred percent confident with what I have to say, or I'm actually not even sure I'm worthy of being a leader. And then I don't even know what to say. Like what Ben. Oh, it sounds like you just need to believe in yourself a little more. Like have you tried positive affirmation? Because I feel like once I really started to believe in myself, it was all good from there. No, again, so much for that. Amazing. Um, the mice and then you're left with, okay, I got it. I got it. The key to my success lies within. Yeah, but there's all this talk about what you have to do, the authentic be vulnerable, but there's not a lot of talk about how you are suppose to get there and what it is really supposed to look like for you.

Speaker 1:          04:52          So much pressure on that vulnerability piece. Right. And I see this trip people up a lot. They will say things like, Jen, okay, so I have a story, but I'm not really sure I'm ready to share it with the world. And is that honestly the only way I can make a difference, I have to expose my deepest, darkest secrets to the world can make a difference. And then there's people who say live the kind of blessed life. I don't have this big terrible thing that happened to me. So does that mean that I'm not as effective as a leader, as someone who has been through hell to get here? And then there's this really weird message about trying to be grateful for the things that have happened, right? Trying to love the difficult challenges in your life. Now it may sound like I'm mocking some of that advice because I am kind of again, all of that has a place. You guys all have a positive effect. Amazing laying in front of you right now, you are limitless. I believe in the power of a lot of this, but only when it's used correctly. Not from this place of pressuring yourself to stretch out pride of your comfort zone farther than you're ready for or risk the safety of yourself in honor of leadership.

Speaker 1:          06:29          So what is it not about the thing, the story. What if it's not about what you're putting out into the world? And it's more about how you are showing up in the world being not doing.

Speaker 2:          06:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:51          So do you help me kind of explain this journey of coming to conscious leadership and how you can get there. I brought some friends, I brought some friends along with me and these friends include a unicorn if you didn't see it coming, this Unicorn represents you and me, but you as well. So we have a unicorn. We also have trolled off little throwback sound maybe. Oh, I know this guy represents your fear, your self sabotage, your ego, all of the noise that gets in the way right before you go and try and do something great as this guy. Okay. And our stomping grounds for this journey. Our belt out of rose quartz. Okay. So the first rose court is intuition. The second row sport. I feel like Vanna white at the moment. Excuse me, let me step to the other side. Um, the second round, sports and safety, that's third. Authenticity and the four impact. Now, if it's not about, the thing is, it's not about your story. If it's not about clinging to a specific identity of something that happened or something you experienced or something you feel that you are. If it's not about that, then what are we looking for

Speaker 1:          08:28          and what we're here to look for and explore today is the lesson, the lesson you learned because of the thing that happened. And if you're someone in here who has lived a really blessed life and you're like, oh you trust me, you picked up some lessons along the way. Living in this world, the lessons that turn into pattern that turn into beliefs that turned into a false truth, right? You picked up and embody and Harry with you every day.

Speaker 2:          09:09          Okay?

Speaker 1:          09:09          Your story is not with us today, but your pattern, your beliefs, the things you feel are true about yourself. Those are with us right now. That's where I want to beat big believer of the power of present moment. So that's where we're going to say the things that are with you right now are the most powerful tool. Tell learning about yourself.

Speaker 1:          09:40          So you have to understand we're coming in mid scene here, okay? We're like turning on the TV mid scene back in the day when you actually turned on TV and didn't just pick what you wanted to watch. Um, and the Unicorn just had a thing happen, right? Something just happened and she's having a conversation with her fear and it sounds something like this. Oh my God, Oh my God, something just happened and I need to make sure that that thing never happens again. Oh my God. And fear is sitting there saying, I told you not to do that. I told you not to be so noticeable. I told you this day under the radar, what have we learned today? What have we learned today?

Speaker 2:          10:26          Okay?

Speaker 1:          10:26          And the Unicorn says, well, I learned it's not safe to be seen.

Speaker 2:          10:34          Okay?

Speaker 1:          10:35          And I'm not lovable.

Speaker 2:          10:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:37          Now these are the Unicorns, false truths that she picked up. You may have your own, you may be starting to kind of realize what yours are, or maybe not. That's okay, but you're out this journey. Just see if you can tune into what are my truth. That's a question that I would love for you to dance with. So as a Unicorn realizes it is not safe to be seen as a unicorn. I still have things I want to say. I still have things I want to do. Just because it's not safe to be seen doesn't mean I have to quit all together. So she tells fear. First of all, you stay in the dark, right? This is what everyone tells us about fear, what it in the jar. Don't worry about it. Don't look at it. Be Fearless, right? So let's see how this works out for her. We're going to put him back in the dark, not to be heard from because she said, I'm going to be fearless and I'm going to go out into the world as a white horse. Now, why horses are still powerful creatures. They can get a lot done in the world. So she didn't lose all her seem right. She just realized, okay, this is what it is. This is the card I've been dealt.

Speaker 2:          12:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:11          So she moves into her first rose quartz intuition. She gets quiet and she hears it's not safe to be seen. You are not lovable. Now. You have to understand that from here on out in her journey, her entire being, her entire intention is always about keeping her and her truth. St

Speaker 2:          12:46          Okay?

Speaker 1:          12:47          No one is going to make her bud. No one is going to convince her otherwise because she has learned. She has experienced that this is her truth, but she still has things to say, so she presses on leaving her intuition behind because as far as she's concerned, the lesson has been learned. It's not going to change, so still just keep it as is and know that that's the truth,

Speaker 2:          13:20          okay?

Speaker 1:          13:20          Now, in the land of safety, this is where you start to gain the tools that help support your truth. So in this land, this is where you might start looking for other white horses, other people who are playing under the radar, not rocking the boat too much. You start to become very paternal with looking at what other people are doing, being incredibly aware of the competition, because listen, if the internal conversation is you're not lovable,

Speaker 2:          14:00          okay,

Speaker 1:          14:00          the external goal is I have to at least be likable. I have to at least be likable. Look at me. So there are a lot of, there's a lot of pressure to get people on board with who you are to validate your truth, to validate this new life as a white horse. Cause you got things to say and nothing's going to stop you.

Speaker 2:          14:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:30          Now in my world, in this space,

Speaker 1:          14:34          I was solid with my white hoarseness. No one by this point could tell me I was a uniform and I had just moved to New York fresh out of college here to be a dancer. Now you can imagine that the cocktail of not being lovable and it's not safe to be seen, there's a killer doc Dale to be bringing into the entertainment industry. Right? So I would go to auditions and I mean hate it. I would have to take the rest of the day off just to bounce back from the damn experience. And then I will get callbacks and not go. I would not go to dance class for like months at a time, but still tell people I was a dancer and I didn't realize it at the time. But all of those patterns were me supporting my truth, being myself safe because I had learned it's not safe to be seen. I'm not lovable, so I'm going to go almost, but not quite. I'm going to go as far as it is the unsafe and then I'm going to pull back because it's called survival. Moving a little bit farther. I accepted that. Okay. The dance thing is not going to be where I'm at because I don't show up for it. So I started singing. I co wrote an off off Broadway show. I co wrote an album. They did great. The performances were awesome. The songs are amazing, but I did not do one performance sober.

Speaker 1:          16:20          I was at least three drinks lubricated by the time I stepped on stage.

Speaker 2:          16:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:26          Not because I so badly wanted to embody the rock star lifestyle and be drunk on stage. I really didn't even realize what I was doing. And again, I was fighting for my truth saying I am a white horse and it might not be safe to be seen, but I'm going to do as much as I can in the limits that are in my life. So I danced with that for a while with almost, but not quite.

Speaker 1:          17:03          And then as I moved into being authentic, now you guys, you have to realize I was being as authentic as I knew I could be by this point. The fact that I was a unicorn was like a deep buried memory at best. Again, if I even had the memory of it now, by this point, I had gotten the opportunity to run a talent management company. Now this was like, oh, I found it. I found my sweet spot. I can help people get into the spotlight, but I can be an arm's length distance from it and feel sick. And I was good at this job. There was negotiating, there was power. I was a decision maker. I was working with really high powered producers. I was moving a rube and things were good, so I Yay because why not? I finally found a nice balance where I can work with artists. I could be involved in that world, but I could also stay in the shadows, make an impact, be authentic. And Stacy.

Speaker 2:          18:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:26          because I was fighting for this. True. You have to understand that everybody is doing the best they can at all times. It may not seem that way, but everybody is fighting for their truth.

Speaker 2:          18:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:46          So as I moved into impact, the company was doing great. Actors were booking really amazing thing. I was getting compliments some producers who were watching me, how I ran my company saying, you're doing a great job and keep going. Just as I felt like I was hitting my stride, I was winning all the races. Right? I was the best white horse, just the one I got comfortable with that.

Speaker 2:          19:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:21          The whispers started coming in.

Speaker 2:          19:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:25          And the whisper asked me,

Speaker 2:          19:29          okay,

Speaker 1:          19:30          but all of these actors to be seen.

Speaker 2:          19:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:36          Might it be safe for you to,

Speaker 1:          19:42          Nah, ignore that. Right? Because why would I risk everything I built all of my success, all of the people who were counting on me to continue on this path. Why would I risk follow a whisper? No, not going to happen, and that is why I so fiercely believe that you cannot just convince yourself into a new reality. You cannot just start with the blows and think that it's actually going to change what you believe to be true. You cannot go to a single mom of two kids who is up at 1:00 AM at her kitchen table crying because in an eviction notice, you can't go to her and say what? She doesn't want to believe that you think she doesn't want so badly to experience this abundance that everyone is talking about. She wants to, but she's fighting for a truth.

Speaker 2:          21:09          Okay,

Speaker 1:          21:09          a true, that probably sounds something like every nickel you earn, you've got a bleed for it and you're not even worthy of much. If that is your embodied truth and someone says to you, the universe is abundant, they might as well be looking at you and saying your Unicorn there is, it doesn't resonate because of everything she has experienced in her life thus far has proven otherwise.

Speaker 2:          21:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:48          No, it's not about convincing yourself. What is it? What is it that gets you to switch and say, oh my gosh, that might be possible for me.

Speaker 2:          22:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:04          So in my world, the whole, maybe it they've been like that with her was not working on me. Like the universe was like, okay, she's stubborn. She's not going to react to this one. We got to go at it from another angle.

Speaker 2:          22:18          Universities persistent.

Speaker 1:          22:21          So it went after my other belief. You are not lovable.

Speaker 2:          22:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:27          And at the time I was dating someone who revealed themselves to be a narcissist.

Speaker 2:          22:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:34          And it got to point where I had to stop painting the red flags white. I had to look at what was really happening here, the lying, the cheating, the manipulation, the emotional abuse. And I had to look at it and say, this really all I'm worth.

Speaker 2:          22:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:58          And the whisper came in

Speaker 2:          23:01          and asked,

Speaker 1:          23:02          what if you are lovable? The questions, the questions that get you to wonder what? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          23:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:15          Not the demand to believe that it is true. Me. Ooh. The Taishan to ask what? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          23:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:29          Why is the place where you can begin to have somebody release? They're true and that is oh really brave thing to do because you don't know what's waiting for you on the other side. In hindsight, you look back and you're like, oh, that's why I had to let go because that was coming in and it's all real beautiful from the backend. But when you're living it and someone asks you to let go of the truth that you have been living for possibly multiple decades, it's going to take a law or it's going to take one moment where all of a sudden you realize, wait a minute, wait a minute. The thing I thought was true might not be true. And with that in my world when I realized, Oh, maybe I am lovable, then the maybe it's safe to be seen came with it. So I had it back to the beginning where I came from, cause I had somebody to talk to. I knew that was going to happen. All right. Who? She went back and talk to fear because he was like, Hey, remember how we said it wasn't safe for me to be seen? Well, I'm starting to doubt that. And you had all this crazy stuff to say and fear is like, I'm so glad you came back. I've been trying to get your attention. You were out there trying to be fearless. I'm back. You're trying to get your attention because I'm not your enemy.

Speaker 1:          25:16          And he said, by the way, you know that you're a unicorn.

Speaker 3:          25:22          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:22          And she's like, what? This whole time I'm out there, you saw me. I'm out there. I'm like, no. Fear was like, can I come with you now this time? Can we do what it done? And she's like, well I'm a uniform. I did all that on the white horse. How'd you what I can do with a Unicorn now the fear says I'm coming with you. Let me get, let me get my outfit now. Yes, I'm going to put his outfit on. I promise you it's worth the wait. It's totally worth the payoff because look, you guys, if you were to hire somebody, a private investigator to tell you exactly what's going on with you, who is your really good news for everyone? We all have one and he works pro bono. So this is now, hmm. We're starting to build our squad goals, right? So off she goes as a unicorn back at her intuition, same thing. She gets quiet. The truth is it is safe to be seen and you are lovable. So just before

Speaker 2:          26:44          our re thing from here on out is about protecting her and her truth by eating to bill that true.

Speaker 1:          26:57          Now as you move the same thing, she's learned lesson to bring your intuition with you because those change things can change along the way. This isn't the only catalyst that's going to happen in her life. So she brings the intuition and of course you get your man who has your back ready to let you know if anything weird is going on.

Speaker 2:          27:19          Okay?

Speaker 1:          27:19          Now this same thing you guys. This is the really important place. This is where the positive affirmations can start to work because they are no longer debating your truth. They are supporting what you now are already open to believing.

Speaker 2:          27:42          Okay?

Speaker 1:          27:42          This is where maybe you have to stop hanging out with some of the white horses that really used to fit kind of who you were, but now that you're a unicorn, they're kind of intimidated by the whole thing and it just gets weird. No, you lose some people in this space. It can be painful. This is also the space where you do want to explore those stories and those things that happen, those panelists in your life. This is where you get to own your power and you decide what gets shared with the world. What gets put out there, because baring your soul does not equal leadership and power. Oh, knowing your stuff so you can become a mirror of what is possible, not is what we're working on. So I can't tell you what authentic leadership looks like for you. If that means bearing your soul is telling the world your story, go for it, right? It's all you. Kim. Kardashians means to strip down every other week and get on social media to feel empowered. Hey girl, do you? But there is a not messaging out there that is telling people you have to overcome and prove that you're stronger than I can take John All the judgment because your fearless. There's enough of that. I'm here to give voice to the person who says, you know what? There's more to me than one event that happened in my life.

Speaker 2:          29:31          Okay?

Speaker 1:          29:31          And this is where you get to start exploring all of who you are. And then when you move into authenticity, remember we're bringing all of your tools. You're not leaving these safety pools that you just built behind because you know you're going to keep building as you go, right? Asking for help, working with a coach, working with the therapist, really out, allowing yourself to be supported. Not because you're weak, but because you understand that when I get this support, it allows me to be more of who I am.

Speaker 2:          30:14          Okay?

Speaker 1:          30:15          So in this game by this space, I started realizing that number one, I want to infuse comedy into everything that I do, so I'm going to do it.

Speaker 2:          30:29          Okay?

Speaker 1:          30:29          It's the kind of authenticity that when you book one of the coolest speaking gigs of your career and they're like, hey Jen, are you going to have slides in your life? Know what? I'm going to bring a stuffed Unicorn. It's roll down, throw the card. Cool. Awesome. That's the kind of stuff that happens. You're not looking around wondering what other people are doing because it's irrelevant to what you are working on here and what you have to offer.

Speaker 2:          31:01          Okay,

Speaker 1:          31:01          so this final piece, when she moves into impact and she has her intuition, her safety, her real authenticity, not the one that someone told her he's supposed to have in order to be authentic. This kind of self awareness.

Speaker 2:          31:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:24          Is the conscious leadership because you start to become a living, breathing how to list for people.

Speaker 2:          31:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:38          You're not running around trying to save them.

Speaker 2:          31:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:43          Because you know that the catalyst is just the question, how to list is that moment that makes someone go, oh, maybe what I thought was true isn't true. As a leader, if you can get people to feel safe enough to release that. True. Did they have been calling for dear life out of survival? If you can get people to release that, that is leadership.

Speaker 2:          32:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:26          The rest of their journey, right? They have to choose to go back to the beginning and talk to their fear about what the hell went down and am I a unicorn? And when did you choose to not tell me I was Unicorn? Right? Wow. Is conscious leadership.

Speaker 3:          32:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:46          Oh name. When people say own your power, step into the light might be seen. When I hear people say, be seen, the first thing I ask is, are you seeing yourself?

Speaker 3:          33:07          Okay?

Speaker 1:          33:08          So if you don't begin with positive affirmations, right? If it's not just a leap to convince yourself of what it is, then where do you begin? You begin by looking for your truth. What am I fighting for right now? What do I believe so much that it's true that I will deny everything else. Someone could come in here right now and tell me I, I'm a Unicorn and until I feel that I am until I feel that,

Speaker 3:          33:40          yeah, that's all. Yes.

Speaker 1:          33:46          Getting quiet, having the courage to wonder what if where so many people that say to me, Jen, I don't even think it's responsible for me to dream in that way. Right? It's just, it's just not worth while. I've got a job there, but got family up things like a things, it's not responsible to dream. Right? While it's a truth, people hold on to a law. I have to keep running my race. I'm a white horse who wins all the races. Don't tell me to slow down. I'm surviving.

Speaker 3:          34:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:33          And as a conscious leader, you are the invitation that it is safe to start that exploration for yourself. A good leader does not judge their success by how many people they've been able to convince. Right? Or how many people are trying to now be like them. A conscious leader looks around at their world and says, I'm here to help. All of you be more of who you are. Even if right now you're a white horse, the best white horse you can be. So when the question comes,

Speaker 3:          35:26          you hear it

Speaker 1:          35:29          and you're not afraid of it, and you're willing to follow it. So it's not about what you're putting out into the world. It's about how you show up. Hi, I'm Jen. Let her and to you our Unicorn. Thank you.
