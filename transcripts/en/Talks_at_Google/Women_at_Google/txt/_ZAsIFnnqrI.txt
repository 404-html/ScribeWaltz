Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you for coming. We have a really important topic here today for the talks at Google. It's my pleasure to be able to introduce and mc the next hour with Kyra Kyle's. She's here to talk to us about a very important topic. One of my colleagues actually heard her speak at a conference and we felt compelled to really help broadcast the message, diversify or die, why news media need to reflect their audience. What we'll do is we'll hear from Cara, speak for, uh, go through the presentation. We'll have a discussion, I'll ask a few questions. We have some open mics for a lively Q and a. To tell you a little bit about Kira is, she is the co founder of Mith lab entertainment. She founded this company with her sister. It's a multicultural agency, multi-platform. She's also the former editor and chief of Ebony magazine. So without further ado, please welcome Kara Kyle's

Speaker 2:          01:11          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:17          Good morning everyone. How are you? Good. Wonderful. So thank you so much for the warm introduction and it's really great to be here. I really appreciate people coming out to talk about a topic that is extremely important to me. Um, as Natalie mentioned, you, I've been in the journalism industry for about 20 years and it's interesting that the industry has changed in so many ways, especially as it pertains to technology and the advertising models. But there's one area where I feel that it's woefully behind and that's why I'm here with the dawning title to diversify or die because sometimes you have to scare people in order to make them make a change. So we're going to go with the minority report now. So just to give you a little bit more detail about me, I did work at Ebony magazine where I was the editor and chief and also the senior vice president of digital editorial.

Speaker 3:          02:04          And honestly that is the first black owned company that I worked for. And Ebony is an interesting story because this is a 70 plus year old company. And the reason it was started is because even back then of course there was a dearth of positive news or affirming news or even just factual news about African Americans. And it's, it's sad to me in a way that something like that is needed. I mean we obviously love it and we're excited about that and other black owned and black run media entities. But the fact is this problem, you know, has his predates most of us and it still continues. So I also have had the benefit of working with a lot of mainstream outlets and that's what gives me some perspective in terms of, I came from Tribune, I worked with the Sun Times, I've worked with vibe.com work with a number of dailies.

Speaker 3:          02:49          And even in college it was already obvious to me that there was a majority of white males to be honest at, at these places. And because of that, there was a certain perspective. None of this I think is malicious. I don't think it's done to x anyone out. But there were just certain factors that are affecting us. And I think we have to be cognizant about it, not only as participants, like someone like me, but our audience. You know, someone like you and that you're empowered here at Google to be able to do something about it because you're such a huge factor, uh, with the media industry. So I'll tell you a little personal story about how I figured out really that I could never, never, never leave the journalism industry because, I don't know, I, it was like, there are so few of us, we feel compelled to remain within it even though it can be very brutal in punishing at times.

Speaker 3:          03:37          You know, we were losing ad revenue, we're losing people many times. But there, this is one of the reasons why. So Hurricane Katrina, um, I was in the newsroom at the time and I was one of a handful of African American journalists where I worked most of the black people to be quite frank, that worked there were, um, in the secretarial pool, administrative security. There were not very many black journalists. So one day I was called down to the big board room, you know, and I was kind of intimidated because I'm thinking typically, you know, the big editors don't call down like an editor or a reporter at the time. I was a column is what on Earth did I do? So I'm thinking, did I write something wrong in a story? You know, was there like a bunch of people with pitchforks waiting for me outside of like what happened that they're calling me into this room?

Speaker 3:          04:21          And what happened is it was hurricane Katrina had hit a, everybody was scrambling to do coverage. And so these editors called me down to this big board room with these, you know, all these books and leather bound books and couches. And what they wanted to ask me is if I thought it was okay if they refer to those effected by Hurricane Katrina as refugees. So it was like, okay. Um hmm. First of all, let me tell you that I cannot exonerate you no matter what you do. I, you know, I like to think of myself as very regal, but I'm not the queen of blackness. There's nothing, you know, no one I can wave and say, this is what you should do and you won't get in trouble. But I will answer your question with a question. If something happened in Iowa or Idaho or here in Chicago, would you refer to the people affected as refugees?

Speaker 3:          05:11          And they immediately said no. So I think I'm glad they asked. I'm not grateful that they asked. They should ask, but I'm glad that they asked and that I was there to talk to them about this because it could have been a very big misstep. But I think that that's what brings us here today is that because there were so few people there up in those top higher echelons, they honestly, we're going to go with that. Had I not said anything and they had an occurred, it did occur to them to ask, which is important. But the fact is that they couldn't come up with a consensus without asking me is another issue. So you might recognize this for him. So media is definitely failing. It's multicultural audiences and this is dear white people, which by the way is very good on Netflix if you haven't seen the show.

Speaker 3:          05:49          And um, I don't think that this is a point that the, we can go over too much. I think people believe sometimes that there's just like this small descending minority people who want to see all this positive news about multicultural groups. And I really don't think that's true. I think people just want to see factual, accurate reporting. They want to see nuance. They want to see stories that are not just crime or stories that are not just about race or politics. They want to see stories that reflect the American population. So when I say that to people, sometimes they think, well, you know, there's been some progress, but the fact of the matter is there hasn't been enough progress compared considering the American population, which I'll go into. So what I've done with the presentation is I have put some factoids in here because I think, you know, when you, when you're telling personal stories, people kind of get it.

Speaker 3:          06:37          But I think if you see numbers than people totally get it. So this one is don't sleep. And for obvious reasons, you know, we, I think we take a lot of things for granted, especially in America regarding our population. But in just five years, about 50.2% of children born in the United States will be minority. So the whole definition of minority is changing. Uh, in 2020 white children will be the minority in the United States and this is according to the census. And then in 2016, this is really jarring. 62% of the population that identifies as white, we'll drop all the way down to about 44%. So when you see these newsrooms and things are changing in certain areas, but when you go to a lot of traditional newsrooms, what you will see is, you know, white, older males and that does not at all reflect the population.

Speaker 3:          07:26          So there are issues and things that are lost in translation because of that. So, and I know this as well as anyone, you would love to believe that maybe media coverage will change because people are just awesome and people are awesome, but it's not just altruism that's going to get us to this next area. So I think it's important for people to realize what the potential of this market is. And so I'll just go over a couple of the stats that I have here, but for example, magazines. I came from the magazine industry. We all know that print magazines are not doing very well just because the advertising model has shifted so much, but of the mainstream population, which 55% are reading magazines, minority populations read 65%. So there's an overindex there. In terms of radio, you know, everybody talks about the death of radio when you've got podcasts.

Speaker 3:          08:14          We've got all these technologies coming out. However, minority communities are listening to 20 hours of radio a week compared to 10 hours for just the mainstream population. Um, in terms of apps, watching videos, which is another really important area also for advertising's, people are always slipping those little videos in there. 56 hours a month. That's what black, uh, citizen's alone are watching on their apps, their 81% more likely to show support for a brand, which is super important because we always talk about brand influencers and people that can tout your brand, especially in a crowded marketplace. And this is extremely important to note. 76% will share their opinions, you know, on some of the social media. So I think that's important to think about because when things don't go right, you know, it can, it can be an ugly situation. I'm sure we've all heard the term black Twitter and we've all heard about dragging and it is a real thing.

Speaker 3:          09:07          You know, I've, I've only been kind of dragged ones like just a light tug, but I can promise you that I don't want any more of that. So I definitely advise against being dragged. Um, that another reason that African American audience is important is that it's becoming much a more educated community. Um, household income is increasing I think because we see so many of these stories and headlines that talk about what isn't going right. You know, the crime rates or um, issues with black lives matters because of that. There's a sort of almost like a blind spot with the mainstream media when it comes to this population. And that is why I believe there are so much like story ideation around these negative developments. And I do Miss President Obama, sorry I had to say that I know everyone's gone. So 75%, I think this is horrible.

Speaker 3:          09:56          75% of African Americans distrust of the media that they read. So if you think about it, and that's insulting to me actually as somebody who went to school for this worked hard on fact checking for me to be writing something. And you know, when I was maybe in more of a mainstream outlet, I don't think I experienced this as much when I was at a black owned pub publication. For somebody to be giving me the side eye to the rate of 75% that is extremely high. And I think that demonstrates that this is not a problem that is just among a small group of people. This is widespread. And I'll tell you why. You know and I have some examples. The funny thing is whenever I talk about this topic, it takes me two seconds to find a new example. I wish I could bring you an example from 2016 and say, Oh, this is back in the bad old days.

Speaker 3:          10:43          No, I have a very fresh example for you so I won't go through all of these cause I really do want to get to talking to everybody about this issue and what your thoughts are on it. But I'll just highlight a few. The ones that make me the most physically ill, we'll start with Ms Kardashians. No shade to their cardiac and clan. They are doing their thing. However, Kim Kardashians, by no means invented corn rows. The fact that a magazine would put out a story saying that she created this trend called boxer braids, which basically is the way my mother used to braid my hair when I would swim when I was like seven years old. I was like, this is a slap. I mean, did you do any research? Did you ask anyone? Have you ever been anywhere? Because that to me it was just so galling and I think it really offends, um, individuals.

Speaker 3:          11:25          I have in the audience here today, Wendy Wilson, who was one of my colleagues from Ebony and we talked about that in the fashion industry in particular, it seems like there is just this, this blindness towards black women. And this is an example of it. Here's another one that made me irate when I'm the New York Times referred to Viola Davis is not classically beautiful according to who did they not see her at the Golden Globes when she was serving with her yellow dress. I mean it was just the, the nerve of someone to come up with something like that. And when you say classically beautiful, you understand what the implication is, what does that mean? That she's not blonde, that she's not, you know, what are you saying when you talk about that? No, she does not necessarily look like scarlet Johannson but is there not room in the spectrum for her to be considered beautiful as well?

Speaker 3:          12:10          Um, the Mike Brown situation, uh, when in Ferguson, when the news outlets and I, again, I don't think this was purposeful. I think it was because they were racing against the clock. You're trying to get new information, but a lot of the stories showed the image on the left if you can see it where he's putting up his hand and I don't necessarily think it is a gang symbol or something, but there's some what of an implication there. And then on the right, you know, you see him just living his life or you could have used the graduation picture, it could have used something else. The bottom line is it, a lot of media outlets hit back and said, hey, we were under time crunch. We got, this is the picture that we had. We had to run with it. However, I think it's obvious that in many cases when there's a story about a white team, even in a similar situation, they will get a graduation picture, a picture with family, something that doesn't have any sort of a negative connotation.

Speaker 3:          12:57          And people notice that. And it actually started a trending topic on if the aforementioned black Twitter of what photo will they use when I die, because any one of us, you know, it's taken a picture that we might not necessarily want to see again. And to use that as the photo, it does definitely sway public opinion. And I can admit to you the outlet that I was working with, we were in the same position. We did use that photo because honestly, when I looked at it, I didn't see it as being in any way nefarious. But once the public said, hey guys, this picture is bad, please take this down or find something else. We did. The issue is when people say something or when the public speaks out and then no one, no one responds. And then this is my fave. Oh boy. So we recently had the revelation that, um, how to show natural hairstyles.

Speaker 3:          13:43          So I don't know if you could see the picture on the bottom right. They had a story about how to rock natural hairstyles in pop sugar and every single woman in this story was white. Now I understand that all hair is natural when it comes down to it, you know, unless you're growing some kind of acrylic out of your head, everything is natural. But black women have clearly taken this term and we're using it for the purpose that we have not traditionally been able to wear our hair as it grows out of our heads. In a traditional workplace mean there's still legislation that allows you to fire someone if they have locks. So we're not at a place where we can, you know, all lives matter of hair, you know. So when this publication did this, the retribution was swift. But my question was, why did you ever do this?

Speaker 3:          14:27          You know, if you had just had somebody around somebody's diverse in your circle, this never would have happened. Some of these things are totally avoidable and that's the issue. And the last one I'll point out, and this is because again, I don't think this is malicious, but extremely hurtful that cosmo did a lineup of trends that were, you know, dad like rip, goodbye, you ugly trend. And then they had hello, gorgeous and they were ushering in the new beautiful trends and about 90% of the goodbye ugly trend. We're black women and models Joanne smalls like it. It was terrible, but I don't think, again, it was not done deliberately but, and they apologize for it, but the fact is no one looked at this lineup and thought this could be a problem. You know that that is the problem. So again, sad that the examples continue.

Speaker 3:          15:14          So what are we looking for? You know, Naomi's clapping it up for us. We are looking for fair representation. No one is looking for to be treated better than anyone. Just like you don't want to be treated worse than anyone. What we're looking for is even simple issues. Stock Art. I, and I had this happen, I will not name the agency, but one day, just out of curiosity, I decided to do a search in this popular stock art agencies collection and I put in the word ghetto. If I didn't get back, every black person known to man that was in their catalog, I could not believe it. I mean in this happened in 2016, um, most of the images are of people of non color. It's very hard to find any sort of minority in the stock art. So I think the issue is that, and it's being remedied, um, within the community.

Speaker 3:          16:02          I know several women, for example, who started agencies where they take pictures and they make it available to the media is used so that there are these, these different images out there. But the sad fact is that in these major agencies, there's only a very tiny and microscopic selection you have to choose from. And that's why if you look, you'll notice that you kind of see the same feature images and a lot of stories. And that is why, because there just are not a lot of images of people of color, period, not just African Americans. Um, I think asking people to be part of stories that are not about race, that are not about class, that are not about politics. Asking people questions about riding bikes. You know, I ride bikes somewhat, you know, not very well. But I do, you know, I, I would like to be interviewed for stories that don't necessarily base upon the way that I look.

Speaker 3:          16:46          You know, as a person, like we're all humans, we're all Americans and we're all peak global citizens. Why shouldn't we be included in other stories? Um, being authentic and showing people, you know, just because it's cool, you know, for example, um, I think sometimes like people fixate on a certain pop culture citizen, like, uh, you know, this is an unpopular topic right now, but a black China for example, or something like that, and the people just discovered who this is. It's like, come on now, you know, and they go all in and they give them covers and they give them this and it just rings false because it's obvious that you're not interested in anyone else. You're just interested in specific black people that are undeniably popular at the moment. And otherwise, this wouldn't be something that you would work very hard at. So that can be a huge problem.

Speaker 3:          17:31          Um, I think even what I learned when I was in school that the professors always told us, um, interviewing a lawyer, interviewing a professor, make an effort, especially if it's not a story based around race to talk to people of different areas of the spectrum because you want to mirror the populace. And I think that unfortunately because people are in a rush and they have these circles of people that they talk to, they just want to continue in that vein. But I think we just really have to ask ourselves to expand and there are publications that are doing a much better job because I don't like to keep it all negative. You know, I want to talk about some good success stories. Washington Post has been doing an incredible job. I'm Huffington Post, black voices does a great job with a small staff. They're able to cover a lot of issues.

Speaker 3:          18:13          They have a lot of op eds, but they also do really good investigative reporting. There's, they stress the importance of covering black community across the diaspora. Buzzfeed is doing a really good job and what I really want to commend them for is transparency. What what I've run into, um, as a member of the National Association of black journalists is that news outlets don't want to tell you who they have there. They like we're, we're a group of people that are always asking questions, but this is a question that we don't want to answer. So you don't know what the proportions are. Even when they do surveys, there's a low return of, of, of organizations that will provide background. So buzzfeed did that, you know, they talk about how many people they have, they talk about black and they talk about Asian, they talk about women, they let people know what they're doing.

Speaker 3:          19:02          And yes, you open yourself up to criticism. Someone could look at that and say, well that's not enough. But the bottom line is I think that if you open yourself up to that criticism, it shows that you are willing to fix it. And when you hide it, it makes it seem like you want to keep things in the status quo. And I think another important question for us to ask, you know, I know that as I said, Google is extremely important, but even just as individuals we can do things, you know, something that I just did recently and I was just using my own example because I don't want to put anyone else out there on front street necessarily, but a friend of a friend of a friend of mine went into a seven 11 in Chicago. She, she, she was a mother. She sent her two boys that were teenagers, like very young boys into the store to pick up food for their lunch.

Speaker 3:          19:44          And within minutes they were back outside with nothing. And she asked him what happened and the little boys, they just said, you know, it's no problem. He just didn't want us in there cause we're black. It's okay. And she's like, wait a minute, what that is not okay. She took them back in the store. She asked the clerk what he did and I think he told on himself because he, when asked about it, what he say, he said something to her to the effect of, well, I'm an American. Like what do you, what is this? An immigration office as a seven 11 you know what I mean? Like what does living in America have to do with anything? But that little video of her encountering this man and really confronting him about what he did to her sons. I posted it. I encourage a lot of other people to post it.

Speaker 3:          20:21          News outlets got into it. And from what I understand, he was removed from that store. So there are things that we as individuals can do with the power of smartphones, with the power of social media. If we see things that we don't like, there's something that we can do in response. Back in the day, there was the letter to the editor that could take months to surface and you know, the reaction would be equally slow, very glacial. But now I think there's an immediate reaction and you don't want to the gun. Everything is not a racial situation. But I think it is extremely important that we take our voices and that we channel those into positive change. Because the bottom line is that as I said, the demographic is changing, the country is changing, the globe is changing. And the last thing we want to do is have the media that's supposed to be a catalyst for revolution. You know, be the one that's kind of putting down the revolution. So that's, that's pretty much everything that I wanted to, to say to you. And I'd love to hear what you have to say to me about the topic. I know it can be hot button and sometimes people can be a little fearful about bringing up the, the, the issues. But I think that's the only way that we'll ever come to a solution. So thank you so much for your attention. I appreciate

Speaker 2:          21:27          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          21:32          Thank you so much, Kyra. This is, you have a powerful voice in such a strong message and you know, it is a tough topic. But with, with staggering statistics like this, we have to bring change and it doesn't come quick. It doesn't come easy. It's been a long time coming. But um, by having this conversation here today and the impact that you've had in the industry, um, it's a start and there are ways that we can also take action. I'd like to just start learning a little bit more about you. You just, how did you get an industry had an accelerated master's program at Northwestern, dove right into journalism, right? What sparked that interest?

Speaker 3:          22:16          No, I've always been interested in writing ever since I was a little kid. I often tell the story that my mom used to occupy my time when I was a child by putting me in front of a dressing room mirror and I would sit there and do these little broadcast so she could shop, shop, shop, and I would be doing the weather and talking about the news. I even had a Barbie magazine with my sister that we forced my poor father to read. He'd come home from work exhausted and have this terrible magazine, you know, printed out and ready for him to read. So it's funny because oftentimes people say they want to be something when they're little and then that doesn't materialize. So in my case, that is exactly what happened.

Speaker 1:          22:51          Amazing. And you, you, you veered into the print media, you also, you're heavily involved in multi-platform. Um, and you've kind of dabbled in each form, if you will, on this topic of diversity. And in the topic of media, are there some sub verticals that are doing it better than others, whether it's broadcast, prime time, newspapers, digital? I would

Speaker 3:          23:15          they just by design, because digital typically is, it's a younger workforce. It's, um, more malleable. There aren't these entrenched employees and entrenched ways of doing things. Digital seems to be leading the way. For example, I believe it's about double the number of women working for some of these online outlets compared to your traditional dailies. So they are far and beyond leading the way. And I think they've actually worked collectively to bring up the statistics of the number of minorities in media when added with these traditional outlets. TV, I believe is among the slowest, if I'm not mistaken, and I, and that's probably because it's a visual medium, like we still have situations. I don't know if, if most of you saw the story about the woman who does the weather, who she got all these nasty viewer notes because she was wearing her natural hair on air.

Speaker 3:          24:07          And I mean the things that people said you would have thought we'd climb into a time machine and gone back, you know, the 1950s or sixties because it's a visual medium, it may be harder to adjust and to embrace those trends. And viewers are older, so they're used to seeing certain things. So if they wake up and they see someone that doesn't look like what they're used to, they'll turn it off. And because it's such a delicate situation, they need that advertising model. They still continue to follow the audience in that way. So I think unless you had a lot of young people tuning in and voicing concerns about what they're seeing, that one is one that will continue to be kind of stagnant. And also behind the scenes is extremely important. A lot of people see people on the front lines, they don't see the directors, the producers, the writers behind the scenes on TV. That is also not very diverse. And in newspapers you can kind of tell a little bit more. But again, you don't necessarily know the background of, of people that you're reading. But just statistically speaking, as I understand it, it's about 17% of the total news workforce of those who responded are minorities at this moment. People of color.

Speaker 1:          25:12          So how with with such low numbers, how can we bring change? Does it, it counts just being, um, I'll share a little bit about the Google practices because we, it's not just at the hiring stage, it's also in the inclusion. Diversity and inclusion is something that's one of our pillars and values at this company. Work to be done. And, and that's because also in working on the pipeline of applicants, so there's another pillar that's really critical to Google, which is an education inspiring the next generation and thinking about computer science. And the last pillar is our community. How do we make sure that we bring access to everyone, training SMB, small and medium size businesses or others so that they have the tools to grow, um, where, how do we start bringing more diverse voices into the world of journalism? Is it in the schools? Is it h how would you think about that approach? Yeah, I definitely, yeah,

Speaker 3:          26:07          I think education is a critical piece because you, you do need that training in order to go into journalism though nowadays, some of these sites you might question that. But, um, I think one really important thing is that it's still kind of a privilege to work in journalism. People expect you to work for free. Some people can't afford to do that, especially somebody, a person of color, maybe somebody who hasn't inherited familial wealth. They can't afford to do a free internship. I've had situations when I was working with ebony where someone was working in retail and also coming in, but they didn't have enough hours to really make a significant difference. I think that paying interns a decent amount would help because that would give them impetus to join the field and to be trained the right way and also to then get advocates from within the industry that can reach back and say, Hey, I had this really great intern.

Speaker 3:          26:59          Here's the role that this person could fill. Um, people always hire from within their circle. I think that's across the industry. And if you don't know people, you cannot hire them if you've never met them because they've had to work a regular job because they can't afford to work for free. You know, it's a, it's a moot point to talk about diversity if you're not doing those things. And that goes across the board. Even in Hollywood, you people can't afford to work for free for agents and that kind of thing. And that's the reason why you see some of the white washing that people talk about in the movies. I think also it's the audience. I think the audience has to demand better. I think they have to call people on the carpet. I recently saw I horrible industry article was a review of the movie girls trip.

Speaker 3:          27:38          It, I don't know what happened here. It was just really pointed and really biased. And instead of evaluating it like you would bridesmaids, this author decided to compare this movie that has nothing to do with anything to um, Tyler Perry's movies. And I think it was because that was his frame of reference, you know, and that that would be like comparing the Coen brothers to Seth macfarlane. It doesn't make sense. Right. So, um, you know, I think it is about exposure. It's about audience driving change and it is about, you know, supporting journalists of color when you see them and they're doing great work, support them on social media, follow them, you know, get more familiar with their work so that they can be touted. You know, we've had several journalists who have gotten the kind of treatment and it really helps, um, you know, and, and I think we just have to continue in that vein. It's, it's not one bullet solution. It's like a comprehensive change that we're going to have to see.

Speaker 1:          28:30          Beautiful. You mentioned, I mean that the, the need to have stronger and more inclusive journalism voices. I think there was a stat on your side about 75% of African Americans actually trust the source of news that they don't write, don't trust. Right. What happens is they're just, um, no more readership or do they turn to different sources? What, I mean,

Speaker 3:          28:52          I think the people, I think people continue to read because this is the information, but I think they take it with a huge grain of salt. They think, okay, the police are always right in these stories that I read. The person that's killed or hurt or put in jail is always wrong. Um, I think that there has also been a proliferation of blogs and different sites, you know, and I would say for example, like very smart brothers, the route, you know, they're in different areas, some of our entertainment shadow and act that have come to fill in these gaps. And I think they're very successful, but because they don't, they still aren't the juggernauts and some of these other sites are, you know, bt has a huge audience. And so there are news really infiltrates, but you know, some of these smaller sites may be aggregated, they have influenced, but they're still not going to have the, the half of say, the Tribune company, which has all these different affiliates. So, um, I, I do believe it's bringing forth new voices, but I still think bringing forward new voices is effective. But it would be even more effective if we could get some of those voices into the traditional outlets that people read the most. And some of those people that read the traditional outlets are the main ones that need to read the new voices because they're just kind of indoctrinated in what they're accustomed to. And sometimes that's very biased information.

Speaker 1:          30:05          It's uh, it's true. If we look at another industry, the, the movies industry, what happened with the Oscars last year, it was pretty blatant terms of the lack of diversity and one approach they took. And I don't know if it's the right one for other industries to look at, but they said a number in terms of how they wanted to elevate the number by 2020, I think it was right, of women and African American and Latino Writers. What's your perspective on that?

Speaker 3:          30:32          I think that's a good step. Uh, I, again, I do think it also has to be within the rank and file. It has to be the producers. It has to be the script writers. It has to be, there have to be more people behind the scenes, the directors, the cinematographers in order to really make sure that we're seeing movies that reflect the audience that's sitting in front of it. I mean, I'll say I've been reading recently and I am a huge game of Thrones fan. I once woke up with a person cause they kept talking around the scenes. I'm like, no, you're going to be quiet or if we're done here. Um, but I mean it is weird that in this fantasy world where there are dragons and white walkers and Zombie horses, you can envision maybe three, four people of color period. And as weird to people, I think you're coming into a time where people are not willing to accept that.

Speaker 3:          31:27          And then on the reverse we have the Black Panther trailers came out and people lost their mind. What is happening here? Why wasn't there a role set aside for Matt Damon? I'm not going to go see this. And it's like, listen, Matt Damon had his term when he was on the Great Wall of China for reasons unknown. You know, we're going to, we're going to let that go. We're going to let Matt Damon take a bench on this one. But um, I, I think that you, it's got to come from everywhere. Having the judges have more diversity, which is what they did is great, but if there aren't more movies, it's still not going to solve anything. We need more movies out with people of color behind as well as in front of the scenes. We do have good visibility in front of the camera and that's getting better, especially on TV.

Speaker 3:          32:06          I think television is really doing a great job, but um, you know, the industries are old and they show, they're showing their age and I think we're now starting to come up against a generation that's not willing to just accept that they're going to say, hey, if you don't make it, we'll go make it ourselves. That's why you saw the success of get out that movie. I don't think it could have been made like five or six years ago. And now because of the response it's getting, you'll see more provocative films like that, you know, everything is not, you know, I respect the Tyler Perry because he's doing amazing things, but everything is not Tyler Perry and nor should it have to be. And that shouldn't be the framework by which movies with a black or black executives is judged. So though like it's a shared

Speaker 1:          32:43          responsibility from corporations to also the talent producing the movies. And he was a, a colleague of mine who pointed out that Disney's Milan movie, um, they were about to cast a, a white male to be the of the love interest and uh, it was a petition of 90,000 folks, which she signed it to, to make a stop and then they kind of changed the riders. So there is a way to have a voice.

Speaker 3:          33:08          You're able to have an immediate boys and I think that's important because there used to be a time it had been a letter writing campaign or something which is very sluggish and ineffective. The movie would have been in the theaters by the time people knew about the protests. I think that that as you point out, that is a terrible thing to do. Why would you do that? There are, and there really is a galling lack of Asian representation in movies, in pop culture in general. You know, you're starting to see more of that but not enough. They can't afford to do that at this point. And I'm so glad that people spoke out and I hope that teaches them a lesson cause I wanted to see ghost in the shell, but I couldn't cause even though scarlet Johannson is like one of my woman crush Wednesdays, I could not do it because you know what, it's such a huge opportunity that you missed. And I think people need to understand, they may ignore a protest, but when they see the box office numbers drop, there's no way to ignore that. And Hollywood is driven by money. So as the media, so if you speak with your dollars and you don't invest, they will figure out a different way to do things they always have.

Speaker 1:          34:04          Hmm. I'm going to ask you one last question and then we'll open it up and we've got some mikes here. If he wants to start lining up with the questions and you're dying to ask her camera, but, um, it's a, a little, a bit more about, you know, we opened up with who are you? I want to also ask you, um, a topic that's come up and out of our Anarbor office. And it is a series. First Time I discovered I was black and that was a Googler who thought of the series, create and produce a 30 minute video segment inspired by what he'd seen on CNN of the same title. Okay. When was the first time you realized you were black?

Speaker 3:          34:44          It was a wonderful day. I can remember that much. Um, you know, I think I was exposed early. I would say maybe the content, the context of color and race and that maybe when I was about four or five, because I grew up in a predominantly Irish neighborhood and I didn't, my mother really didn't have a choice. You know, there were children playing with the hair and rubbing on the skin and I was like, what are they doing? And they would ask us, you know, why our dolls, where this, cause my mother bought us black dolls because she wanted to reinforce our beauty ideal. So we had some beautiful black dolls, like one look like Felicia Rashad. They were so pretty. And the fact that we had them, you know, Austin cause questions from the kids in the neighborhood. So I believe as early as that, I figured it out in the my mother, you know, talk to us about it, you know, talked about the differences, talked about history to us in a way that we can understand and consume.

Speaker 3:          35:36          So I felt luckier than some other children when I went to school and they really weren't aware of our history in that and they seem to be more subject to being like shamed for being different. Whereas with me, I was like, you're just mad because your hair does it do this, you know? So, um, you know, I had a different and much more positive I, you know, feeling about it then if I had come in there and been surprised, you know, you and I were talking earlier today about the sports caster, who, who said that, you know, he doesn't know what he is and race doesn't matter anyway. And I mean, I feel like this is a man that he probably should not, you know, at this point about 50 years old, he's, if he's passed at least three mirrors, he should, he should know.

Speaker 3:          36:15          But you know, I, the fact that that's still happening though, that just tells you how fraught with controversy, the topic is identification and I'm embracing your culture. It's still something that is not easy for anyone for sure. But shouldn't you be able to hear the voice that you had such a beautiful narrative and growing up and hearing that story and being able to project your voice right and to read about likeminded voices as well. Exactly. Right. And I think that's extremely important. You know, in the black community and people of color. I think there's a saying, it's like you have to see it to be it, you know, seeing even President Barack Obama ascend that way, you know, kids my age probably didn't think that that could happen just based on the way that society is set up. But there are generations of children that for them that's a goal. They don't even think twice about it because they've seen it and it, it's sad that we just need to see more examples and then in people being free to talk about them in, in various outlets and in movies and TV and pop culture. Absolutely. You spark some ideas as well as to how we can do that sponsorship and, and others. Okay. Wonderful. Well turn to um, some live questions and pass it over. Okay.

Speaker 4:          37:27          Thank you so much Carter. He'll come in and speaking with us. Of course. So we've heard a lot, you know, for uh, women, female executives of color come and speak to us and share the experiences. Some of them actually expressed that they felt more discrimination as a woman than as a person of color. So let's get your experiences, you know, does that align to your expectations and your experiences and what you've seen, the media industry or, or, or what, yeah, what's the situation there?

Speaker 3:          37:52          No, for me personally, and again, this is just for me personally, I feel that blackness cannot be extracted from my woman as I feel like they're one thing. Um, black women in general are treated differently than white women are treated. And I don't have the statistics with me at the moment, but in just in terms of being in a workplace and having internal advocates, black women felt much less supported than white women. Now white women felt much less supported than white men. So it's like they say, you know, the old saying, it's like there are levels to this. So I think that, you know, when I come into a room, people see a woman. But I think first and foremost, a lot of times they see a black woman. I don't think I'm able to, you know, I'm a woman now and no sort of like, you know, so I can only speak to mine.

Speaker 3:          38:39          But I think what I like it because I think I find it empowering. Like that's a double challenge that I'm facing in society and for me to be able to make it as far as I've made it be able to sit here and address you all. I mean, I think that that, I hope that inspires other young black girls. I hope that inspires people. I don't want to make light of the challenges that I face and say, oh no, it's no problem. Because I don't want other people who are experiencing problems to think that they, you know, are being singled out. No, it's a problem usually. But my hope is that by doing this and by talking to more people, it will be less of a problem until it's not a problem at all. So that's the goal. But that's an excellent question. And I'm sure there are different people that would answer it differently too.

Speaker 3:          39:20          There's, there's this concept of allies I Google because no matter how you identify, right, you can have sponsors in the room to make sure that your voice is heard. And I think it's something that is work in progress here and that we're also trying to influence in the world. But, uh, with the beautiful leaders, I mean, and I, I love them that that's a priority because I think sometimes we take for granted that if you worked somewhere, you'll get a mentor. They'll just appear to you out of thin air. No, people have to step up. Yeah. And I think that that's great that you're encouraging that. So that, that's terrific. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          39:54          Hi, my name's Jonathan. And first I just want to thank you for taking the time to speak with us. It's been a really powerful message, uh, throughout your career. You've had the opportunity to work at a number of institutions, large and small, some that have gotten it right, some that continued to get it wrong. And you gave all those examples earlier where it was almost like, how could this happen? How could you get to this point in your creative process or have you in your execution? And no one asks the question and the checks and balances oftentimes came from the public. Uh, would love to know, in your experience, what are some of the hallmarks of institutions that get it right? And what are some of the checks and balances they establish internally to make sure that the product that they put out is more reflective, is more diverse?

Speaker 3:          40:39          Well, that's a, that's a fantastic question. And I'll say, to be fair, obviously it's not just the media industry. I mean, we all saw that tone deaf. Um, Kylie Jenner, Pepsi ad where she solved black lives matters issues with a carbonated beverage and somebody bought space for that, you know, and only until people said, what are you doing? Did they pull the commercial? I've never would have aired it. You know, it was like a Saturday night live sketch waiting to happen. Like you did Lauren Michaels work for him. Beyonce is black, right? Yeah. So I well that wax figure, have you seen that? They have her looking. Okay. But anyway, we'll talk about that later. But um, I would say in terms of checks and balances, I think it's important to have people of different backgrounds with different experiences in the room. Unfortunately, especially in the United States, I think we have a lot of segregation at work and at home we have a lot of segregation in terms of who we to.

Speaker 3:          41:33          So maybe some of these people didn't have a friend that they could say, hey, we're doing something at work and you know, I, it's going to be pretty big. I'd like to get your thoughts on it. They may not have had that. So if you don't have that in your friends circle, you should have it at work. And I think what you also need, which is super important, is you need to have people of color in the leadership roles too because there sometimes people in the room and they're intimidated to speak. Like when I got called in there for that Hurricane Katrina conversation, I did think they all seemingly have made up their mind that it's okay to use this term refugee. I might end up getting in trouble and I might, you know, I might jeopardize a promotion in the future by being that girl that came in here and told them what was what.

Speaker 3:          42:12          But my great grandmother marched with Martin Luther King. I could not, you know, and I'm not saying that like I'm some martyr because guess what, I would have gotten another job I'm sure, but I couldn't do it cause I couldn't be the one. I actually had readers call me when they would see things wrong in the newspaper. How did you sit up there and let that happen? So I also had that responsibility to and I had to tell them, you know guys, I can't control everything but I did take my responsibility seriously. Some of it is not only just having people in the room, empowering them to speak and also having them at different levels of the company, not just in the creative and out front fields but in behind the scenes so that they can stop it before it. Even as you mentioned, get so far up in the creative process that you're already casting for Kylie's, you know police officer, she's going to hand the Pepsi too. They should never have. No, that's a number of happened honestly. No problem.

Speaker 6:          43:01          You mentioned fragmentation and how people have like a great ability to control what they see in her to interact with. Do you think the media landscape is getting a lot more fragmented these days in terms of people being able to self select more and more specific outlets and do you think that's going to present like a big problem for the types of issues we're talking about?

Speaker 3:          43:20          Well, I think it already presented a big problem. I think it has a lot to do with our election results to be honest. I mean, and not to get super political, but there's proof that people reading erroneous information, people reading kind of race baiting or just plain, I'm not factual information had an effect on the way people voted, had an effect on the way people came out to vote. And I think we do live in a time where you could be in a bubble if you want to, if you decide to wake up and use one news source for everything and only go to those things that agree with you. Like I'll admitted my in my little circle of Facebook friends. Most of us agree when someone doesn't, it's really jarring, but that's actually not a great thing because then you're kind of, you're being reinforced and you think what you're doing is right.

Speaker 3:          44:08          You don't have any educated dissenter. I'm not talking about a troll, I'm talking about somebody who really knows what they're talking about. We are seeing more consolidation of news entities teaming up and working together because of a lack of resources. They almost have to work together. But I, I do think that's what I'm kind of afraid of is that people will become so disenchanted with the way that the traditional media is that they will just say, I'm not going to read that. I'm just going to rely on this small blog with like three people that don't have enough people to do an investigative bureau. And I'm going to do, I'm going to go with whatever they say. So I think it is a problem, but we can head that off by bringing some of those voices into the mainstream in larger outlet.

Speaker 1:          44:47          Thank you. Thank you. You touched on it on the issue with, uh, the cost of journalism and needing to be able to, to sponsor and fund quality journalism. Um, but when we look at the numbers and shifts, where in, in terms of the minority will become the majority at those ad dollars will need to kind of be invested. There was a question that came in from one of the colleagues, which was when you think of the traditionally black publications, um, their voice is really focused on, on their audience with this shift in demographics, how do you see that? Is that kind of evolution for those publications to Ebony's jets in the world? So that's a great question. So

Speaker 3:          45:32          I can say from my personal experience and what I observed and Wendy and Melissa yell out if I'm incorrect, they worked with me, um, at avenue when I was there. Uh, sometimes advertisers seem to believe that they can get advertising in these black publications investing less than they would for a mainstream outlet. Even if they see that the numbers that they're getting are very similar. And I think that's another systemic issue. The fact that you think you should pay less for the same. So that is a problem and it's hard to really get hardcore with them because then they can take their dollars and invest digitally with some of these outlets that may not be as established, but it doesn't cost as much to invest that way. But again, journalism does cost money. Good journalism does. You can't do investigations. You can't be thorough. Sure.

Speaker 3:          46:20          You can write a lot of opinion pieces that are based in existing fact, but you can't do any deep digging if you don't have money. So that, that is an important thing. And in one that I think that the technology industry could assist with if they could fund certain initiatives, if they could help, um, maybe invest in investigative arms or invest in certain investigations period. I think that that would be helpful. Um, it's, it's a very difficult question because one would think that the shift in demographics would mean a shift in budget, but it hasn't. And a lot of people point to the fact that yes, there are niche black publications. But you know, I grew up reading all of the different magazines too. I even had a situation, this was very recent where I went to a car dealership, spoiler alert, I did not buy the car cause I did not like this guy's attitude.

Speaker 3:          47:04          He said to me, I told him where I worked at the time it was ebony. He came up with this wonderful anecdote, you know, trying to relate to me. He was like, you know what? You're going to think this is funny. And I was like, oh my God, I know I'm not going to. He said to me that he loved will Smith when he was a kid. He would by will Smith on anything. Didn't matter what it was. He saw an avenue magazine with will Smith on. He goes, so here I am, this kid. I get up there and an Ebony magazine and I'll be like, and the punchline is what? And I was like, every day that I buy a magazine, these are not black magazines and no one, the cashier has never stopped me. I, I'm, I don't get the story. You know, why don't we just go back to the dealership and then I ended up buying a totally different car. But that's what I'm saying. Like there's still this stigma and thought that it'd be weird for a person that's not black to buy this magazine. But it's not weird for me to buy a magazine that isn't black owned and doesn't have a black person on the cover. So, and this happened last year, so it's not, you know, some ancient tale I'm telling and that says a lot about that situation. Sound unfortunately it was for him and it's failed to learn something. You won't tell that story again. But hi.

Speaker 7:          48:11          Hi, my name is Latoya. I work on a team called the news lab and um, we are all about working with journalists technologies to help build the future of media. Um, I lead a piece of work on the team call inclusive storytelling. How do we elevate the voices that we don't traditionally here in media? I'm just going to point out one thing. You mentioned that you need sponsorships in dollars. That's exactly what our tastes great. Trying to, you know, increase. Uh, we support the IDA B Wells Society for instance, which is about training journalists of colors to be investigative journalist. I wanted to ask you your thoughts on what more technology companies can do. If you think about, you made the point about Pepsi and people of Color not having a seat at the table and not being in positions of power to say something. When we think about newsrooms, I think we've seen the numbers, the leadership, I think it's 86% of editorial directors, so on or white men. Right? How do you change that? What does it take to shake up the newsrooms? Is it a matter of just hiring more people, going to find them? What's the role of technology company can play and really inspiring that change? It's something we think about. We don't have the answers, but it seems to, that change comes down to getting more people with a seat at the table, but how do we make that happen?

Speaker 3:          49:23          Well, you know I I really liked and was encouraged by what Google is doing with Howard University by creating this space where people of the university and students are interacting directly with Google employees, seeing what their future can be, seeing what the potential is. Something to that effect in the area of journalism I think would be very impactful. I do think like what you mentioned, the Ida B wells, that sounds amazing. I also noted that Google is going to be a partner in evaluating the number of minorities in journalism for next year, which is great. Having that transparency is extremely important because how can we fix the problem if we don't even know the full scope of it? Maybe you using technology tools to create, um, job bank databases or helping create programs or fellowships that pay a stipend. As I mentioned, the problem about news entities not paying or paying below standard, maybe in some way trying to help boost that amount of pay so that people can afford to enter the industry.

Speaker 3:          50:18          And then training. So in Abj offers amazing training for managers and people want to go into the management track supporting those efforts so that you don't just have people who are the writers and they get on CNN and yeah, everybody knows them by name, but they don't necessarily have as much power behind the scenes as these producers and these other people who are telling them where to go and what to do and what to focus on. So I think that what you mentioned is a great start and just continuing to do that and also making it easier to find people are candidates. It would be important. I think, um, technology is very helpful in that it connects people that might not otherwise be connected. But what I find that it does a lot of times is it just makes it easier to connect with those you already know.

Speaker 3:          50:58          And I would love to see some technologies that push you beyond that. One of my mentors and former managers, Jane Huert that worked at the Tribune Redeye what I love about her is that she would go out of her way to go find people of color, people representing different areas of the gender spectrum. She did this, you know, with a conscious thought, this is what I'm doing. And not in a way of this is a token higher, but this is a super talented person. I'm going to work with this person. I'm gonna make sure that they feel welcome to make sure that their voices are heard. She will ask you, what do you think about this? You know, in a way that doesn't make it feel like you're being pigeon holed. And I think it's, it's also that the manager mindset of not bringing someone in so you can just take a staff picture and look like you're doing something, but really making them part of the process. And she did that really well. So I bring her up as an example of what I would love to see more managers do and I'll be at nab and get to it. Okay. I'm sure you will. New Orleans. All right.

Speaker 1:          51:56          So there's this photo on this screen that I have to ask. What's the story?

Speaker 3:          52:02          I just liked the way I look at it. No one's going to fail. So I went on the real, uh, I think it was wet in the, the end of last year. Yeah. December, uh, to talk about, which is another important thing and something that companies can support. It's like the root does their own version of this. A lot of entities do. The power 100, uh, for Ebony was a way to highlight people that are doing great things, not just entertainment and celebrity that you see every day, but people in technology, people in nonprofit, people in the business world and initiatives like that are important because again, it's that see it to be it mentality. So I was really happy to go on there and the ladies were lovely. They were very kind, you know, I didn't get to drink whatever was in that mug. I'm not sure what it is to this day. But yeah, it was, it was a great and empowering experience. So I, I think we just, we need more initiatives like that. There are many people of color across the globe doing terrific things. It saddens me that sometimes those people don't get the attention that they deserve. And I think that if we can work on our media coverage work on our media newsrooms, we will see more of that. And in the problem will not vanish overnight, but we will make a lot more progress.

Speaker 1:          53:11          We are strong believers. Our CEO has even said it, a mix of diverse perspective and ideas and backgrounds will only lead to better products and better experiences. Right. And I, I'm hopeful. Um, I guess as a

Speaker 3:          53:26          final question, it would be what are you most excited about for the next couple of years? What I'm most excited about is two folds. I'm excited by people of color deciding that they will invest and create media outlets, show TV shows that they were showcased, their talents and that they're doing that and that they're getting a reception for that. They're not waiting around, they're not begging people, please write me in or please cast me. They're taking matters into their own hands. I think we're seeing a wave of content creators of color that are making a big splash. It's not a niche thing. It's not something that just a handful of people are seeing. You see that with Easter Ray. Um, you see that with Donald Glover. These are not people that are just trying to be stars. They're trying to make opportunities for other people. And I think that that's great.

Speaker 3:          54:16          Jordan Peele as well. Um, the other thing I, I'm a very excited about and some people in the industry might disagree with me on this is the audience power. I love that the audience can get you right together really fast. You know, I, I used to, when I was in the newsroom, I know people used to hate when the phone would ring. They'd hate emails from the public. I love them because that's how I can do a better job. How can I do a better job if I have no idea what the reception is? There were some people who live in this little ivory tower and they think that the public doesn't have the savvy to comment on what they're doing, but you're doing it for them. So why can't they have a two way conversation with you? I love the fact that people get dragged on Twitter.

Speaker 3:          54:53          Sometimes it's funnier than others. I think it's appropriate though. It's, you're putting something out there. You can't dictate to me what I'm going to, to engage in or what I'm going to like or hate. And I love that. So I think we're seeing power to the people. So to speak, and also power to the creators. And that I think is exhilarating and I'm excited to watch where that goes. It's fantastic. But you've been an inspiring and powerful and beautiful voice are so lucky to have had the opportunity to have a conversation with you. It's an honor to be here to see another friend later at the conference. Yes, thank you. All right, wonderful. Thank you so much.

Speaker 2:          55:32          Sorry.
