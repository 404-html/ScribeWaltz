Speaker 1:          00:07          I am here to introduce Lori. Ken Shot Laurie introduces herself, uh, uh, describes herself as an intellectual Omnivore, her undergrad degree from Swarthmore or in biology and religion. She got her masters from Harvard Divinity School and Theological Studies and her phd from Boston University was an American studies. I describe Lori as a personal friend as well as an all around fascinating person. She hosts lectures and discussions and all sorts of topics including but not limited to a politics, economics, charitable giving, religion and mass incarceration. Uh, the last two being related to our positions as clerk of the first parish, unitarian universalist of Arlington and coordinator, other mass incarceration working group. Her diverse background gives her an interesting and informed perspectives and all of these topics today. She's here to talk a bit about our third book, gender inequality in our changing world. And I'll hand you off to Laurie. Great.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Thank you very much. I want to thank all of you for being here, particularly Jonathan for inviting me and Tim for handling the mechanics of making the thing work. Um, and so just a brief background, gender inequality and our changing world is a brand new textbook. Sociology. I'm in a story and more or less as we said intellectually on before, uh, but I teamed up with a couple of sociologists to write this. And the reason we did this is because this sociology of gender or textbooks that are out there now tend to have been written in the 1990s when there was this really sort of triumphalist sort of idea, that sort of view. Then it states as the norm, you know, everybody's headed our way, Washington consensus, and they had updated edition since then, but the fundamental conceptualization reflects that era. And it seemed to us that we live in a much more diverse and complicated world than we did there.

Speaker 2:          01:48          The people thought they did in the 1990s. And so we teamed up together to, to try to focus on what's going on with gender inequality in the contemporary United States, but really put it in a richly international global context and in an historical context. So we're focusing on the theme of change. How does things change? How do things change? What is changing with changing more quickly, with changing? We're slowly all of this. Um, it's one of those huge topics that if I'd realized what I was getting into, I probably would've said no. But in retrospect, I'm glad I said yes and I'm very grateful that you are all here today. What I'm planning to do is what I call a flyover. It's a 450 page book or something like that. And I'm going to try to talk about it in 30 minutes. So there's no way I can touch on everything in there, but I'm just giving you a flyover perspective of what's in the book and some of the things that I think people might find interesting.

Speaker 2:          02:40          Um, I'm going to ask that. Well, I'm going this quick speed through people not comment or question during the slides because several of these I included in the book because they're so interesting that if I were in a classroom, I could use them to do 20 or 30 minutes of conversation right there in the classroom. And that's not the goal for, so it's a please do not be triggered by the slides into conversation until the end. And then there will be time for Q. And. A. I'm going to try to keep this very hard to 30 minutes. Makes Sense. So the first question is where is gender inequality? Um, and they're three different maps and I'm going to show you that are looking at gender inequality on a global scale. Um, this one is the United Nations has a gender inequality index and any metric you use, any index you use has its problems.

Speaker 2:          03:29          Like this one makes Saudi Arabia look sort of the same as the United States. And that's because lots and lots of women in Saudi Arabia go to a university and get high education because they're not allowed to do anything else. There are brothers are allowed to go work, go for play sports, be with friends, go socialize, whatever. And all the young women can do is go to the university. So they go to university and that makes the society looked like it has very good to quality for women with you measure it just by education. So clearly we have some problems with this index, but there are some patterns here that are real. Um, it is true that by many different metrics, the United States has more gender inequality than most wealthy democracies. And the two things, the two places that are changing most quickly, our China over the last 60 years and Latin America over the last 20 years and Latin America is changing very quickly.

Speaker 2:          04:21          Also in terms of economic inequality. It's the only religion of the world in which economic inequality has decreased over the last 20 years rather than increased. So there's interesting things going on in both of those countries. And in China that's very intentional that the communist government, when it came in, said women hold up half the sky. They said that girls had to get primary education, that employment had to open up to women. And it takes a while for these things to percolate through. But China's changing very quickly as a result, partly of intentional policies. But that's not all that's going on. So the next metric that I would like to offer is, um, this is gender gaps in life expectancies. And what are the key distinctions here that sociologists of gender, Gender Studies, people use is between sex and gender. Sex is what we're born with.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Whatever it is, whatever complicated is, it's what we're born with related to reproductive anatomy and everything that goes along with that. Gender is what cultures make of that, how cultures put meaning on that. So six males are more likely to die at every age. That's includes prenatally. So you know, this stuff, this is when, when nobody knows until recently, uh, um, what, what sex they are. So that has to do with sex. Gender affects how that happens, how quickly it happens to the balance between them. There are societies in which is not true. There are societies in which women die younger. That's high level of gender inequality. There are societies in which women live much longer than men and that is awesome. Excessively longer than men. And that is also a form of gender inequality. So the countries that are marked in red are the countries where the gender gap is too long, that men are being disadvantaged by gender.

Speaker 2:          06:09          And that has a lot to do with violence, has a lot to do with alcohol, is a lot to do with risk taking behaviors. Um, and then the blue countries are where women are likely dying of gender, although in a few cases I think it's because the gap is small because medical care is really good. It's not like Iceland up there is a particularly bad country for women, but that gives you another perspective on the patterns here of gender inequality. Here's another perspective on this. Again, if we have a natural sex ratio and, and all, um, all of this is a little difficult to tell because what's natural because there's no culture that doesn't have culture, right? So we're, we're sort of guessing where the natural state is, but the natural state seems to be that about 1.05 boys are born for every girl, of course, we really should say 105 boys for every hundred girls.

Speaker 2:          07:04          But, um, and there are a variety of countries where that's not true. So the India, China, some other smaller countries have many more boys per girl than would be average born would we natural born. And that's because of sex, selective abortion. And it, um, the notice that India and China together and contain about a third of the world's population. So when you have those countries selecting strongly for male births, that means we have a real disproportion in the population. Um, the red countries are where there's too few girls boys born. And the reasons for that are not completely understood, but I believe that at least I'm sure that at least part of the answer is that when a woman is stressed during pregnancy, male fetuses are more likely to miscarry back to males are more likely to die at every age. Males are more fragile.

Speaker 2:          07:58          So those countries are countries, I believe in which women are so often so stressed during pregnancy that their sons in utero are more likely to die. So gender inequality affecting both the, the woman and the next generation. So those three ways of thinking about what's the big patterns here. Um, there are four key causes of gender inequality that we outline in the book. And this is where the book starts. Um, economics, nearly all societies use gender to allocate who does what work and to give. And nearly all societies give men preferential access and control to economic resources. The degree of that varies a lot. How that works varies a lot, but that seems to be very, very common. Families, nearly all societies assign the majority of unpaid family care work to women, childcare, eldercare cooking and cleaning and just keeping everybody alive. It seems to be women's ultimate responsibility to keep their families alive.

Speaker 2:          08:59          Control of sexuality, patrialineal societies or societies where family membership and inheritance are trace through the man's lines, through the father's line. And the simple frame of that is you, you get the name of your father's family. Um, but in, in patrialineal society, there are many societies where only sons inherit from their fathers. Um, or only fathers can give, can be quick to their sons and daughters, but it's called to the fathers maitre lineal societies. You had trace inheritance through your mother's line. Now this results in very different types of societies because obviously we all know, given baby, we're pretty sure who the mom is. We're not necessarily sure who the father is and societies that are patriots lineal and consider patrialineal tracing to be really important half to control women's sexuality, their reproductive capacity. And that means basically all of their behavior so that there can't be any doubts about which baby is assigned to which man and how stringently that's done varies a lot.

Speaker 2:          10:01          But there's a fundamental difference between patrialineal matria lineal societies. The vast majority of people have lived in patrialineal societies and then violence, traditional societies worldwide wide expect the male head of household, the men who are in charge of the family and therefore the society to maintain discipline within the families. And usually violence is an acceptable method. Um, and in addition, nearly everywhere, the threat of sexual violence constraints, women's lives in a variety of different ways. A lot we could say about that. So starting with economics, the type of economic system that a society has affects the degree of gender inequality in. And it's not, you know, tight correlation, but sociology is always about loose correlations here. There's always going to be exceptions to the rule. Hunting, gathering economies, you share food. You can't really own much in the way anything else because you have to be able to carry it with you.

Speaker 2:          10:57          There isn't much economic inequality to be head horticultural economies which use hose and other hand tools but don't have big plows or domestic animals. A big domestic animals tend to have separate cultures for women and men, they use gender to assign the work roles very strongly, but there tends to be a sort of balance of power between them. Agricultural and pastoral or hurting economies tend to be the most unequal. They tend to have what's called family economies for the whole family. Whatever that definition is, works together to create everybody alive, to create all the things that aren't necessary and the men of the family are given control of the resources that are necessary. Ownership of the land or the animals, whatever their core resources and also the right and therefore the responsibility to control the family. Labor force, I. E. The women and children. So that's the most unequal type of society in industrial economies to begin to open up room for individuals to earn their own incomes, including for women to earn their own incomes.

Speaker 2:          11:58          And that makes it possible for women to have a degree of independence that it's impossible in a family economy. Um, the, this affects of obviously the women who are earning their own incomes, but it also fits women who aren't because they have that possibility available culturally, economically. And so industrialized societies tend to increase gender equality, increase the focus on the individual as the unit of decision making, knowledge based economies like the one we're in, especially here in this building. Um, value, intelligence, expertise, creativity, social and relationship and emotional skills and the ability to sit still and focus and concentrate. These are all skills that women tend to have is at least as much as men. And so in knowledge based economies there tends to be increased in gender equality, although as we have seen, nowhere has become gender equal, um, in the United States. Now, if you look at young adults, age 25 to 29, 37% of the women and 30% of the men have a bachelor's degree. So we're really, she seeing a shift there. But if you control for education, then men earn more than women in every demographic group, including young singles, unmarried, Yo don't have kids that the sort of most free individuals still men earn more than women if you correlate correct. For Education.

Speaker 2:          13:28          Two key factors are important for increasing increasing gender equality within families. So again, if we look worldwide, one of them is women having access to reproductive health care, contraception, abortion, maternity care and not having genital cutting, particularly in fibrillation. Um, women's lives. You know, it's, it's just affects so many things in a woman's life. If she can control when she's going to have children and if she has a really good chance of surviving childbirth, which in some societies CIC is each time a woman gives birth, she risks dying and her children risk ending being motherless. Um, the other key thing is if men bond with their children and become engaged with their infants, they are much more likely to continue to care for their children throughout those children's lives. So this is where we see the sex and gender thing. You know, that, that it really makes a difference when men, um, w w what seen sociologically is that when men take paternity leave some amount of time when they're infants or small, that's long enough to bond with that child that affects how they behave as fathers for the rest of their lives.

Speaker 2:          14:38          So that requires paid paternity leave or you know, uh, generally paid paternity leave to be available to have this be really common and policies that overcome social pressures. So in most countries, maybe all countries, there's some degree of stigma against men who prioritize childcare. And the countries that have been most successful in getting men to do this are the ones that create maternity leave first and then was called parental leave, which can be taken by either parent, but they require men to take some amount of paternity leave dedicated for men first. And then either parent can take the parental leave and those societies are seeing the stats. I'm sure there's a limit to this, but for each month of paternity leave, a man takes his, the mother of his children, not always his wife, um, has a 7% increase in earnings in the future. So this really significant.

Speaker 2:          15:30          Um, one note here is that women tend to United States and other advanced countries, economically advanced countries still are having huge what's called motherhood penalties. That when a, when a woman is a mother, she earns less than, it's less likely to get hired or promoted really for the rest of her life. Even if you control for experience, it's not just, Oh, she took some time out of the workforce. She's a little behind in you're accumulating education and experience. Even if you control for that, women still earn less if they are mothers. Men On the other hand, more earn war if they are fathers. And it's not just because they tend to work more, which some men do when they have kids, they say, okay, I really need to focus on this. Even if you control for that, men tend to earn more if they are fathers get this fatherhood bonus as long as they do not.

Speaker 2:          16:21          Or there are two criteria. One, if a man spends significant time taking care of his own children, then he doesn't get the fatherhood bonus. Like if he takes that paternity to leave, probably won't get it. And if he has brown skin, you have to be white to get the the, the daddy bonus. Um, which is related to but not the same as African American men are much more likely than a white American men to be equal or close to equal partners around taking care of small children. So there's a lot of different factors going on here. Okay. This is one of my favorite charts. This is about control of sexuality, but using it from a small statistical point of view, if you look at the percent of people in a society saying that their society should accept homosexuality, there's a strong correlation with the per capita GDP.

Speaker 2:          17:09          That's a $70,000 there. Zero down there. And as you can see, there's a pretty strong correlation, but there's also a lot of diversity. And that diversity I would argue is cultural. So there are countries are whole regions that are much more likely to accept homosexuality than others and then it then predicted by their GDP. So these sort of purple dots up there, those are European countries and they tend to be relatively embracing. These aren't green dots. Here are Latin American countries which are poor but also more embracing for their GDP. These red countries down here, Subsaharan Africa don't be born there. Um, if you were gay, um, and then these are, um, Muslim majority countries, those orange dots. This is the United States, which is pretty tolerant but not nearly as much as you would think based on its GDP. Statistically. Uh, and the reason this is so important, it's not just because of what it means for gay folk in these societies, but also because what tolerance of homosexuality means is a belief that sexuality belongs to the individual.

Speaker 2:          18:17          That in this traditional family based patrialineal systems, sexuality belongs to the family. It is part of reproducing, reproducing the family. It is part of creating that labor force. Women's bodies are very tightly controlled so that the family has its official integrity, often described as purity, um, kept intact. The more a society sees sexuality as an individual thing, something about individual choice, something about individual prep preference and pleasure and relationship. But a matter of individual choice, the more people go, hey, it's a matter of individual choice. You can choose who you're going to be with. Um, so this is a metric for that. How much is Heidi has moved from seeing sexuality as a property of the family to seeing sexuality as a property of the individual. Um, so it's a very important graph from that point of view. And again, this is what I mean by Latin American countries are changing quickly.

Speaker 2:          19:16          Um, violence. Some key things to know about violence. Men commit the vast majority of violence, both that what's socially approved and what's not. And that's about maintaining social order. It's about defending the community. There's some evidence that may be the classic Vikings were an exception to that, that women fought equally. But in the modern world that don't seem to be any exceptions. Um, and, and very few historically, um, men are also much more likely to die violently. Um, in 2008, uh, they were about three times as likely as women. And that's, that's common. Yeah. The men worldwide, this is worldwide. Statistics obviously are roughly give or take a year by year, three times as likely as women to die violently. But violence against girls and women lie behind many of those other forms of inequality. That's how you enforce family discipline. That's how you exclude women from the workplace and from the street.

Speaker 2:          20:08          You know, that that's how a lot of these things happen. Um, key point violence is not inevitable. It's not just, Oh, men are going to be violent. This is back to the sex gender thing. Because levels of violence vary enormously between different societies and within one society they can change quite quickly. They can also change over the generations. Those Vikings, those warlike notorious Vikings, are the ancestors of the modern peaceable Scandinavians. It's the same gene pool. So it's not about the jeans. Um, and then as of 2011, violence had decreased, whether it looks at decades, centuries or millennia. And here I highly recommend Steven Pinker's better angels of our natures. Why, why violence has declined. The book draws a lot on that. Um, I can do only a little bit with it, but it's a great book. And he documented this and then talked about a variety of reasons why that's true.

Speaker 2:          21:01          What's going on in Syria has caused an increase in violent deaths. Um, but it's too soon to tell whether that's sort of a blip in the grand historical chart or whether it means some sort of trend. It, it's, so this is not as true over the decades now as it was, but you may be going back. I hope so. Um, so this is drawing again from Steven Pinker's work. When government is not trusted to provide security and justice people have what he calls it. I call self hope, self-help justice. Where in my society, if somebody robs my house, I called the police, I say help somebody robbed my house and they hopefully find who did it. And you know, they take care of it. Whereas in a traditional society, if somebody steals something from you, there's no police to call on, right? There's no government to call on.

Speaker 2:          21:47          So you have to be willing to exact retribution more to the point. You need to have a reputation to exact retribution so that they won't steal from you in the first place and they won't beat you up in the first place and they won't kill you in the first place so that it's a family level fit. And that's called honor, that having that reputation for being quick to respond to insult is essential for preservation of groups in societies where there is no government that can provide protection to families. So you get this culture of male honor, which gets intertwined with his idea of female purity, the patrialineal society, family, all of that. In such societies, girls have little schooling, women are economically dependent on their men and their families. There's high levels of violence within the families as well as between families, high death rates, high birth rates, those need to go together, high levels of poverty, high risk of political violence.

Speaker 2:          22:41          And war, all of which reinforces ineffective government. There's a spiral going on here. When girls get educated, things change. That seems to be one of those levers. Um, so women are able to contribute more economically if they're more educated. Families become more economically stable because there's more people able to do more diverse things. Child mortality decreases really quickly. Giving women, giving girls a primary education really affects the survival rates of their children. Um, birth rates decreased because families like, Oh, you know, hopefully my kids will survive so I can have fewer of them and women have more choice in whether to have children. So the next education, the next generation is better educated. It's healthier, it lives longer, and the population size stabilizes. Women have more say in their families and communities and one of the things they do is use those families and those that, those families and communities to create structures that help them keep their kids alive.

Speaker 2:          23:37          It seems to be one of those universal things. If you give women political power, one of the things, the first thing is they go for is clean water supplies. Um, and governments provide more public services. It's a little more complicated what women do in countries like ours in the United States, but in countries where you're just on the edge, women really like clean water. Um, so public poverty goes down, public health improves violence, decreases chances of war, decreases another spiral. But going a different direction. Say here's how to encourage girls schooling in poor countries. And there's a lot of different parts of this. You need schools, but you also need the, the teachers and books and Internet access. Your quality is really important. There's a lot of places in this world where people can go to school for several years and still not really become literate or numerate.

Speaker 2:          24:26          And when parents see that their girls are not getting educated, they're much more likely take the girls out of school because girls Labor's always needed at home, always need it and families and the girl isn't benefiting for the schooling. Girls are more likely to be withdrawn. Um, of course it's good for boys too that they actually learned something in school. Um, make girls safe on the streets and in school. The violence thing provides safe bathrooms and sanitary supplies. There are parts of the world, like Pakistan, a third of the schools have no bathrooms and no running water. And when girls go off into the fields or whatever to relieve themselves privately, they are more likely to get assaulted. This is particularly a problem. What's girls start menstruating? Uh, there are places where, um, pilot studies have just given out menstrual pads and girls attendance. Adolescent girls are much more likely to go to high school if they have something, they can be private with conditional cash transfers.

Speaker 2:          25:23          These are huge in particularly Brazil and Mexico are best known, but there's lots of countries around the world that are giving cash transfers to mother's much more than fathers, um, because they use the money differently. But to poor families if they meet certain criteria. And typically that includes sending their kids to school and getting basic medical care including immunizations. And that really increases both education and the wellbeing of the next generation. Um, but unconditional cash transfers can work too. There's been pilots studies done and think it's in Morocco, in Malawi where you just give families a little bit of cash, not very much, and they're much more likely to send their daughters to school because they're pulled away from that edge of survival. And many families want their daughters to go to school. They just can't afford it. Um, reproductive healthcare again, um, you know, mothers being in good shape needs their daughters are more likely to go to school and focus on disadvantaged groups that nowadays, if you look at primary education and you look at the dominant group, I think it's every country or nearly every country, maybe every country there's gender parity at the primary level.

Speaker 2:          26:30          The place that we really hurt around gender parity on the primary level is in marginalized groups within countries. Usually ethnic groups could also be a cast. That's where you see gender inequality within the country. So at primary level it gets more complicated after that. So those are two key things to keep in mind when we're talking globally focusing on United States, there's two things I want you to know. Gender inequality decreased, decreased by many different ways between 1970 and 2000. And since then it has leveled out. We see this map over and over and over again. And then educational levels, how much education people have, which sociologists use as a proxy for social class as a much larger impact on life patterns now than it did in 1970 or before, um, or 1980 or before. So here's one of my graphs, um, that shows this. So this red line is the frequency of rape in victim studies where researchers get on the phone and they call households randomly selected around the country and they say, what crime have you experienced in the last six months?

Speaker 2:          27:37          And the totally this. And so if that, that beginning spot is 1973 of normalized to 100. And as you see, the incidence of rate has gone down by roughly three quarters, 80% since 1973. Big Change, but it has more or less leveled out since 2000. Um, the dotted line of there is the incidence of rape as reported to police. Most rapes are not reported, but their police reports went up and up and up during this time period when the rate was actually going down because of the work to de de de de stigmatize rape, the women became more likely to report it men too, but mostly women. And then since around 1995, the reports have gone down at roughly the same incidents as the, um, what's being done by victim studies. And then this blue line is the murder rate during this time period, again, by the same normalization.

Speaker 2:          28:34          And as you see, the murder rate has gone down by roughly 50%, and there's lots that violence in general is gone down. Lots of discussion. Nobody's really no consensus about why that's true, but the difference between that and that I would argue as gender, that there is an increasing understanding that gender equality is good, that women should be able to say no, you know, uh, that, that coercion is not a desirable part of masculinity. These are all changes that are happening with gender and that's making that difference, which is a significant difference. Um, another graph, this is the divorce rate per thousand people starting in 1870. This spike is right after World War II. Lots of people married in hasting came apart. This spike is often called the feminist movement, but I would say it's more broadly all the changes of the 1960s which were huge and couples didn't always change at the same pace and became much more likely to come apart.

Speaker 2:          29:31          But as you see, the divorce rate has been coming down pretty steeply since then. Still high historically speaking. But that, that's a trend line down, you know. Um, but if we look more closely at different economic groups, it's all among college graduates. So these three lines are for people who are not college graduates and they started in the 70s and this is when they got married and their chance of divorcing within 10 years. So those who got married in the 70s had a significantly more higher chance of divorce is they were not college graduates but, but the, the difference is much more now than it was then. And that is the pattern that comes up in one cluster of statistics after another. Um, here, this is life expectancies among Americans since 1900 and as, um, the, the um, blue lines are for black folk and white lines are for white folk and the solid lines are for women and the dotted lines are for men.

Speaker 2:          30:35          And that will be true in all graphs of this sort of. Um, and as you can see in 1900, the race was the really big determining thing. We had this small gender gap, which indicates high gender inequality and race really affected life expectancy as a century has gone on. That's somewhat reversed over here. Ray still has an impact. Gender has an impact. Um, the gender gap for blacks is significantly higher than the gender gap for whites, but gender and race are more coequal than they were. Um, if we look more narrowly to now to education, it's really different. This is for Americans with, with no high school diploma just since 1990 to 2008. And this is the line for white men and that's the line for white women. And as you can see, life expectancies for white Americans without a high school diploma had been going down there.

Speaker 2:          31:30          Now basically it's the same as life expectancies for black Americans without a high school diploma. And there's a lot of things that are correlated that since I sent in these slides, there was a New York Times article talking about a recent study talking about levels of suicide and deaths related to substance addiction, both alcohol and illegal drugs. There's a lot of despair going on among less educated people and that's related to all of this. Um, so the gap for education is huge. White men with a college degree live 13 years longer than white men without a high school diploma for White Women. The gap is only 10 and a half years, but that's, that's a decade, you know. Um, here, uh, this is one of those things we could look at a lot, but we want, this is looking at full time earnings meeting weekly earnings by gender and education.

Speaker 2:          32:21          Since 1980 men's earnings average decreased unless they had a bachelor's degree that these men up there with a bachelor's degree went up by a quarter in terms of their average earnings, women's earnings increased unless they did not have a high school diploma. So the general trajectory for women and the general trajectory for men, it's really different here man could pretty much count on earning more than women in their social world. Now, not as much likely, but not as much labor force participation rates have really changed. Men had been going down since the 1950s. Women obviously went up, but then women have also been teetering down since around 2000. Um, some of the reasons for men's decreasing participation rate are really good. Yeah. When men are staying in school longer, they're taking time off to take care of kids or travel. They are retiring that in the 1950s, the typical man died before the retirement age. Now the tickle, but typical man lives past retirement age, big difference affects the labor force participation rate. This is good. Um, but, and they're often in reasonably good health if they are well educated, less educated women. Men However, suffer from very high levels of unemployment under employment and incarceration and they often retire or leave the workforce because they are in ill ill health rather than because they're ready to move on to something else. So it's a very different demographic.

Speaker 2:          33:48          Here's another, if you look at percent of births to unmarried women, which is getting a lot of conversation these years, um, if you look at groups of women who did not go to college or had some college, they're real racial differences. But if you look at women with a college degree, those racial discipline differences disappear. Um, at this point, black and Hispanic women have the same, basically the same birth rate, whether or not they are married for, for white women, there's a difference. But again, among college graduates, the differences disappear.

Speaker 2:          34:22          Here's looking at those who have never married by age 40. And as you can see, there's huge differences based on race, gender, and education for black men. Without a high school diploma, it's, well less than half will ever marry by age 40, which probably means ever. Um, two thirds of Americans say that a man has to be able to support a family before he gets married. One third of Americans think the same of for women. So that's part of what drives this gender difference. Obviously lots more that can be said there, but this is a graph of the ages of people when they marry. And as you can see back at the turn of the 20th century, it, it was really, um, uh, the, that, um, gender affected this a lot and now race affects it more that there's been a shift in what, what drives this, what fundamentally drives this, and this is again related to these ideas about financial stability that nowadays most people feel, and this is all ages, all genders, all race and economic groups, educational groups feel that they need to get some sense of financial stability before they get married.

Speaker 2:          35:36          They need to get themselves professionally. That was what the college graduates call it. Just, just some financial stability for folks who don't have a professional aspiration. Um, and communities where many men never achieve financial stability. They don't get married. They, but most people want to have children in their twenties when it really works well to have children. So a lot of people are, are, and women in their twenties are often saying, I can handle raising a kid or two and most of them have a kid or two, not lots. Um, but I can't take on being financially responsible for a man as well. So we have huge patterns going on here. Um, so that gives you a flavor. What I mean when I say that education is really affecting our country more than it was, whereas gender inequality headed is my final question. There are sort of different possible answers to this and I don't, I'm not coming down on anyone's side, but one theory is that gender equality, we will continue to increase in United States.

Speaker 2:          36:38          So we have a lot of positive feedback loops that are just going to keep going. A knowledge based economy. Two thirds of women in nearly half of men say they believe in the social, economic and political equality of the sexes. Ref. Roughly half of those people describe themselves as feminists. The other half don't. But you know, that's the, they still believe in equality of the genders. So you know, um, laws not always followed, but laws prohibit gender discrimination and they allow it in force. Say that women have a right to refuse sex and use contraception at least so far. Um, and social tolerance of violence, particularly sexual violence is decreasing, has decreased in, seems to be continued to decrease. So all of those factors suggest that gender equality will continue to increase globally. Nearly all big international institutions, governments, not all governments. Many governments have realized that increasing gender equality and women's empowerment seems to be key to creating stable societies with prosperity, with economic stability, good economies, lack of violence.

Speaker 2:          37:42          All of this seems to be intertwined. You know, I'm not saying anything radically new here. We'll bank will say it too. Um, and many poor and middle income countries have started a positive cycle of growth, more education, more women's employment, increasing health, women's empowerment, these things, again, positive feedback cycles going in a good direction. There are theories, however, the gender equality will stagnate. As I said in the u s metrics have stagnated since around 2000 women still have primary responsibility for unpaid family work everywhere. Even in the most egalitarian countries like Sweden, the Nordic countries, they're working on it, but it's still really women's ultimate responsibility for their families and for less lucky and prosperous countries. Um, ethnic groups that are marginalized or stigmatized or live in war zones often have really high levels of gender inequality along with all the other things they are suffering.

Speaker 2:          38:38          And it's really hard to break those cycles for a stigmatized or violence prone areas. Um, so theories that gender equality, inequality, inequality will increase. Societies tend to become more stagnant and more intolerant and more full of resentment when economic situation is either level or falling. When people have a falling standard of living, they often finds feely they'd need to find someone to blame. And this can intersect with masculinity, that if a man feels like it's his responsibility to be a breadwinner and to be therefore in control of his family and he can't do that, men can become very resentful. And some men try to shore up their sense of masculinity by exercising it in other ways. I eat dominating women and dominating children. Um, so that is a pattern that has been seen in many different contexts. If the United States is headed into a period of economic decline or some people in the United States are headed into a long period of economic decline, if this pattern has its obvious risks, um, and another way plug countries as well, not just the United States.

Speaker 2:          39:44          And then women tend to suffer more from men than men from political and economic instability from social disorder and war. Children's suffer the most, right? Because they're the most vulnerable. But the more a woman has to work to keep her family alive, just to subsist subsisting the lesson or she has, she has for anything else. Um, and climate change and environmental stresses, economic stresses look like they are increasing. The Pentagon has put out research suggesting that there's going to be increasing economic instability, political instability and military instability worldwide. So they are preparing for that. Again, I don't know if that's what's going to happen, but it's certainly is a possibility that environmental stresses will lead to more social stresses, will lead to more gender inequality in countries where those cycles, uh, can actually reverse. So thank you very much for the city. Questions, comments?

Speaker 3:          40:50          Um, so the part where women are going at graduating college now more than men, how does that track by class and race?

Speaker 2:          41:00          Ah, it's more true for, um, families that were, the parents did not go to college. So in elite families, it's very likely to sit down at all of the children will go to college no matter what. The small exceptions, not, but, but families where some people go to college and some people not. That's where you really see the differences that the girls are more likely to go. And one of the reasons for that it is believed is that, um, is gender discrimination in the workforce. That at any given level of education, the boy or young man is more likely to get, get a job and a better paid job than the woman at that level. So women have to get more education or in order to get economic equality. And then on top of that, women see themselves as having primary responsibility for children. So they really want to get economic stability. So there's, there's gender issues driving the motivations in families that are less elite, less privileged.

Speaker 4:          41:57          Uh, when you talked about factors that affect a family's decision about whether to support their daughters going to school, you mostly talked about factors that were internal to the family, the economic situation or the attitudes towards the girls' education. Uh, one of the things that's been surprising from watching the world news, at least for me over the last decade, is the growth of the belief of a political cultural. That I have the right to tell other families not to send their daughters to school, but that's seen as, um, a major political plank of a group like Boko Haram or in Pakistan. And I was curious whether you see that as being the outgrowth of economic factors or is this something that also could play into unfortunately one of those last three slides?

Speaker 2:          42:51          Oh, absolutely. Um, the real answer is very complicated as you can imagine. Um, and I glossed over it, but that safety issue that a lot of how the Taliban, Boko Haram, other extremist groups have deterred parents from sending their kids to school, particularly their daughters is by making schools seem threatening that, that, that there may be violence there, there isn't violence all the time, obviously, but if you were scared that your kid is going to get attacked, raped, killed for going to school, you're more or less likely to get, send them to school. Um, and I see the, um, yeah, Boko Haram literally means Western knowledge or Western education is forbidden or is taboo. And I see those movements is very much part of a reaction against Western ideology, Western colonization. Um, and, uh, I'm not justifying it, but, but saying yes, there's a global debate that's going on now and one of the places it's playing out is on this dispute on who should have control over people's bodies, particularly girls and women's bodies.

Speaker 2:          43:58          Should it be the family and community as it was in traditional societies or should it be the individual? Most of the world sees the United States and Europe is saying individuals should have control over their bodies, over their destinies, over how they dressed, how they behave, and the men of Boko Haram and the tempo and the Taliban see that as a real threat to them as men, but also to their whole traditional society that's based on the group defining what individuals will do. So gender is one of the places that this fundamental argument over who, where the locus of control should be is playing out.

Speaker 1:          44:40          Does that help? So how do you imagine the impact of the birth gender sex inequality in 15, 20 years in China and India and Africa? Um, now that those kids that are maturing into adults, but the gender equality's all off.

Speaker 2:          45:03          Thank you for asking. That is, it's not just in the future. It's happening now because this had been going on as long as people have had access to ultrasounds and that that's young adults now. And so particularly in China, India, Vietnam, a few other places, you have really big disparities and there's real concerns about the militarization that happens when a society has too many uh, men that they need. Young men, young men who can't settle into a family are often pretty hard to control. Um, and so and, and particularly in societies where the sense of membership, the sense of belonging is still very strongly rooted in families that, you know, the China, as I said, it's changing very quickly. And that was partly because of the ideological changes as partly because of the economic changes driven by industries, industrialization. But it isn't like a society changes instantaneously overnight.

Speaker 2:          45:56          And so young men in China now know that they have really hard odds around getting married. The only ones are going to, but the lesson lean ones or not. Same thing in India where one of the things we talk about in the book is issues of rape and we focus on Indiana in the United States, but there are a lot of young men in India, lower status, young men who know that they're never going to be able to afford to marry. And in a society where marriage is how you get your value out of life, that can be devastating. So yes, this is already rippling through these societies. The key thing that I, I'm going to take the opportunity to add is that South Korea used to be in this camp and it is among adults. It's still is, you know that. But if you go back and look at the graph now, Jen, it's, there's some sex selective abortion going on in South Korea, but not nearly as much.

Speaker 2:          46:45          Not enough to show up on the map. And the reason for that it seems is partly ideological preaching about, you know, gender equality and all of that. But even more the country put in a strong public pension service for older adults because in traditional societies, when you get old, you need to rely on your children to keep you alive. And in traditional societies where only males can have access to good jobs and ownership of property, that means you need to have sons or you're going to be destitute. And South Korea got access to ultrasounds and good simple abortion technology at a stage where parents still depended on their sons to survive. Industrialized societies, people tend to want to have one, two, maybe three children, sometimes zero. And so they were using sex, selective abortion to make sure they'd be secure in their old age. Once the country started putting in secure what equivalent to social security, the use of sex, selective abortion went down a lot.

Speaker 2:          47:41          That works. Making it illegal. It doesn't work. It's illegal in China, it's illegal in India, it's happening. Um, so that's the key thing there. And yes, all of this, those societies are consciously and intentionally struggling with these problems. Do you think that would lead to war, gender, and inequality, or to greater valuation of women? It can lead to a greater valuation of women as sexual and reproductive partners, which tends to lead to more gender inequality in the broader political and economic realm. China has had an increase in what's called wife theft or wife capture, where you grab a woman and go marry her, uh, whether or not she was already married, um, that that's an extreme form of gender inequality. Whether or not she has consents, obviously, you know, if it's fun by physical capture and that's not happening everywhere, but that is one of the patterns that's emblematic of what happens when there's a real gender imbalance that women get valued as sexual and reproductive objects.
