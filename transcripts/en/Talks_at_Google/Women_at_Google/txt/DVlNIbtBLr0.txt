Speaker 1:          00:06          Started. So today we're really excited to welcome for laying flat again and released from being called roommates at Chapel Hill. They both going on some very fascinating careers, so we're going to set a lot of records for running. She's running for Olympic Games now. When you bronze medal in one and just a few weeks ago, she wants sex leading the American team. She holds the record for the 3,100 and 500 meter indoors and pretend name 15 k mark racists. It's fascinating to me personally how long she's been able to stay on top of her games and so many athletes peak or only to a single moments works for Nike running and doing digital marketing. And after she graduated and then did a career change and went to culinary school and having our city. So what am I looking at this Cup book? We know that the authors have a serious chops both and knowing, running and annoying cooking. So it's no wonder it made the New York Times bestseller list. Please welcome Caroline and Elise

Speaker 2:          00:59          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:04          Thank you so much for having us here at Google. It's such an honor to be here for me. Um, I always admire Google as a company and worked in digital marketing at Nike Promo is 10 years. And if I hadn't been working at Nike, I probably would've wanted to come work at Google. So it's awesome to be here and see what an amazing campus you guys have. And today we've been traveling all over as part of our book tour. We've had the chance to go to some awesome running cities and speak to runners and athletes of all levels. And for us, um, this is an opportunity for us to spread is such an important message to, to athletes and what we're teaching people is that there's more to healthy eating and just killed, killed Jews. It's a, also health food is a juicy burger and you want to teach people that help who doesn't have to be planned in boring. It can be really nourishing and really flavorful and keep you satisfied so you're not reaching for junk food. So I'm going to dive into that. But first, I know you guys probably want to hear some stories from Shalane, um, just since she's just returned from an incredible race in Rio.

Speaker 4:          02:05          Yeah. So about a couple of weeks ago, I ran a little race down in Rio. It was an incredible experience. It was my fourth, but I never take it for granted. Getting to wear a USA across my chest. There's so much pride and honor behind that. Um, and the race itself, I had high expectations hoping to land on a podium and wear a nice little necklace around my neck after the race. But that didn't happen. I play six, but we had the highest finish for an American team ever. We went six, seventh and nine, which was huge. We have the definitely, I'm a tough challenge. You East can seem to dominate the distances. So it was quite an accomplishment for us. Um, uh, but I did have to overcome a lot of fear actually for this last race of my Olympic trials, qualifier for the marathon was in la and it was funny. Have you run in the heat eat

Speaker 3:          02:57          before he can pretty taxing

Speaker 4:          03:00          and arduous. And so I never run a heat Marin on, um, suffer in la at the Olympic trials. And that's obviously I'm kind of a tough, tough race because you're trying to make the Olympic team and you have to finish top three. And I ended up, um, having a really hard race in the final three miles. I barely finished, but I hung on for third. And so I created a lot of fear at first time I'd ever had to receive an IMV after the race. And it kind of scarred me that experience running and such, um, uh, deprive dehydration state. And you would think at this level I would know everything. But really I don't. And um, so I have a lot of fear going into Rio cause again, it was going to be a hot and humid race. So I had to over come a lot of fear going into that.

Speaker 4:          03:45          And, um, I reached out to a lot of resources to overcome that fear and, uh, uh, hydration plan. I relied on my best friend to help me come up with that. And then a lot of, um, research. I went to, um, uh, Olympic training center and did an, a hydration analysis. And then apparently I'm a, they classified me as an aggressive sweater, so I had to probably drink three times more than the rest of the athletes out there, but I was able to do that and have a successful marathon. Um, but beyond that, um, you know, talking about fear, I'm Alisa and I, um, completely made career changes a little bit and collaborated on this beautiful cookbook. Then three years ago, the idea started just at my kitchen table while we're eating a delicious meal and at least it made some career changes. And I was trying to meet the goal to make it before the Olympic team. And we came up basically over this meal, the idea of writing a cookbook and sharing the knowledge that she gained and how I felt kind of deprived and just, um, a burden with my own diet as an athlete. And I wanted to make sure that I was feeling properly. And, um, so that's how it began at least this year. A little bit more of the story.

Speaker 3:          05:02          It's some things. And so it's been such an honor for me to write this cookbook, so we've known each other for for 16 years. So to get to write a cookbook together has been a lot of fun with it. We were college roommates and teammates. Um, and then we both have a chance to move west after graduating from UNC, um, and then working for Nike in different capacities. So I worked in a cubicle wall Shalane Wayne's down below on the fields running laps and I always would look out my window and wish I was down there on the field too. Um, and anyways, um, the cookbook came to be, we hadn't seen each other in a couple of years and I had been, I had the chance during my career, my career in marketing to work abroad. Um, I worked in Geneva, Switzerland, um, for not to be named video game company.

Speaker 3:          05:45          And during that time I got really inspired by the food culture in Switzerland. My Diet changed drastically when we moved over there from, um, and I can suffer it in college. I suffered from a lot of injuries and I thought it was a healthy leader and what I had been eating in college that led to the stress fractures and led to me suffering from, um, athletic game area. It went away as soon as I moved to Switzerland and changing my diet, my diet changed for meeting white meat, chicken breasts, a whole roasted chicken and from Veggie burgers to grass fed ground beef and from processed fake butter spreads to real butter. And all these decadent foods that we had learned to label in our country as unhealthy actually made me healthier and happier and stronger than ever before. And so I had this realization that I had been depriving myself and these amazing foods that not only tasted it tasted great, but we're also helping my body absorb vitamins and nutrients so much better than what I had been eating, running at a high level in college.

Speaker 3:          06:43          Um, and I decided, decided that I wanted to feel to inspire other athletes of all levels. And so I, um, we moved back to the u s and I went to study culinary nutrition at a top school in New York City. And after that, uh, wasn't really sure what I was going to do and how I would get my message out to athletes, um, but had the chance to have dinner together and we reunited. We hadn't seen each other. Um, so that night we were talking and sharing stories from college and catching up on good times. Um, but sooner conversation got more serious and we talked about how many athletes we had seen suffer at every level from our own teammates. Um, in college too. A lot of young female athletes I'm suffering due to eating mostly a processed foods, diets and calorie counting calories and feeling like they had to follow the prescription way of eating instead of, and seeing food just as fuel instead of seeing it as indulgent nourishment.

Speaker 3:          07:37          Um, and so that night I said to, um, showing, she told me how she always felt while she was marathon training, drained and, and hangry, and she just felt depleted all the time. And I told her that night, maybe you just need more better in your life too. So we quickly started revamping her diet and we thought maybe we should write a cookbook together some day so we can get this message out to thousands of runners across the country and athletes. And, um, I never actually thought we would get our courage up to write the book, but, but a whole, a whole year went by with a lot of text messages back and forth and more dinners together. And finally I took my daughter being born for me to realize like, this is what I need to do. And I quit all, put all my other projects to write our book proposal fulltime and just went for it.

Speaker 3:          08:28          And I tried to channel channel shall lanes, uh, energy and competitive edge as must, as much as possible. And I poured everything into our book proposal. We sent it out not knowing if anyone would ever want to publish our book. And we said, well, if nobody wants to publish it, we'll publish it ourselves. Um, so we sent it out to publishers and we ended up with eight bids for our books. So we got to pick our first choice publisher, which was, um, Rodale and they've been, they've done an job of making them beautiful buck that we hadn't envisioned and sticking to our nutrition philosophy, which is, um, we came to call it indulgent nourishment and indulgent Martin nourishment. Um, we want to prove to people that healthy food can be cool. It doesn't have to be land and you can eat these amazing foods and hot and use local seasonal ingredients and top it with olive oil and olive oil based dressing or a buttery sauce.

Speaker 3:          09:23          And by eating this way, eating these real foods and fueling yourself, um, you ended, you're not, you don't have the cravings anymore for the job getting the bars and the package package foods. Um, so we, uh, are proud to have the first cookbook for runners that doesn't have calorie counts or nutrition facts. And instead we're teaching people to get back in tune with listening to their bodies needs. And, um, we've been beyond excited to buy the amount of media. The media has been really excited about what gets appeared in runner's world and then women's running magazine and outside magazine and food and wine. And we were just a couple of weeks ago in New York City to be on good morning America. And Best of all, like we had this really high goal that people told us we would never achieve, which was to make the New York Times bestseller list and right.

Speaker 4:          10:13          That's the best, right? We're going to shoot them the best. Uh, Shlain is competitive and I channel

Speaker 3:          10:22          porter called heart and soul into this book and we want, um, not only to inspire people to get into the kitchen, but to inspire people to seek out the best ingredients that are body to buy local, seasonal food. Um, it's not only better for the planet and better for you, it just is more nutrient dense. So it will leave you feeling satisfied and more energized and not reaching for a sugar fix and not reaching for a coffee fix all day, which I noticed you guys have plenty of opportunities.

Speaker 4:          10:53          Not the coffee's bad. Um,

Speaker 3:          10:56          and as part of that, um, we've been trying to show people improve that dieting doesn't work. Um, a lot of people in our country or Yoyo dieting and every year it's a different kind of diet, whether that's, um, a paleo diet or a low fat diet or juicing or any of these extreme diets in the end. And the science is there now and we go into it in the book, but diets just, they're no fun. They caused your body to have, um, metabolism swings. And in the end, a lot of people try these diets and they don't work and they end up gaining weight. And instead when you get to eat real food and um, take the time to get into the kitchen and cook, you'll feel so much better than, than ever before. And one of the things that you tell that's kind of our most important message is the single greatest thing you can do as an athlete to improve your performance and your health and is happiness, is to learn to cook.

Speaker 3:          11:55          And Pete was just showing with us how you guys have a kitchen here where you can learn to cook, which is amazing. So I highly recommend that you take advantage of the cooking classes here. Um, people often tell us like, I don't have time to cook, right? Have a full time job and I'm training and I have kids and it Shalane can get out, go in the kitchen and cook after a 20 mile training run at high altitude and made homemade sauce and homemade meatballs in a hurry. Green Salad. Then I think the rest of us can to a lot of people think, well, she must have a private chef with Navarra.

Speaker 2:          12:29          I'm going to hire you.

Speaker 3:          12:32          She's not only cooking for herself, but often going to the training camps and cooking for all of her teammates too. Um, so it's pretty impressive to see that. I'm a let her talk about some of her favorite recipes in the book here in a second. But I'm the other, the other thing I wanted to share about, um, the good fats. So we'd really, all of our recipes are full of flavor and the reason they're so flavorful is because they're so rich in good, healthy fats. And there's been kind of ingrained in our culture over the years since when we were in high school and college that fat is bad for you in fat causes heart conditions in fact causes weight gain when in fact the opposite is true. Fact Prevents Weight Gain Fat, helps regulate your metabolism, it helps you feel energized. It's a great source of energy.

Speaker 3:          13:19          Runners get so focused on protein, protein, protein, and carbo loading. And really fat is a great source of energy. It helps when you're eating a salad or veggies or something, um, hurting and helping you put fat on top of it. It helps your body absorb all the vitamins and nutrients better. Many vitamins are fat soluble, so you can't get the most out of what the foods you're eating without having the fat in your diet. And especially for Google and, um, employees that is so important for brain health. So it keeps you smarter and prevents, um, depression. So anyone who works here probably had a mom that was cooking good meals with healthy fats as a kid because that's how you guys got here. Yeah, it was good for your brain health. I have a toddler goes to Europe, two years old and she eats is it, this is incredible, uh, way of eating and I know like it's really good for her brain development.

Speaker 3:          14:11          So especially for kids where their brains are developing, they need the good fats in their diet. And that's, we talk about butter because we love butter, but it's not just butter. You, you have a range of fats, you have coconut oil and olive oil and even fat from really good quality meat sources. So grass fed, ground beef and aids. And for us, we prefer dark meat, chicken over white meat chicken because it's more, it's got more of the good nourishing fats in there and also more vitamins and minerals. So, um, there's lots of sources of great health and fats. The ones you want to avoid are the ones, the cheap oils that are in packaged foods. And, um, there's a lot of packaged foods out there. Um, when I'd see actually people think chips and cookies, but there's so much more. It's also that the dressings and the sauces and all the quick fixes that we have in our grocery store to get dinner on the table faster.

Speaker 3:          15:00          But in our book we teach people how to make dressings from scratch and sauces and Pesto and calmness. And when you're making these foods from scratch, you're able to use to really good oils. Whereas if you're buying Hamas in the grocery store, which sounds like a healthy food, it's often made with cheap oils and preservatives, which are great for your body. Um, so we really want to inspire people to get into the kitchen and put on an apron and make it, have fun with cooking. Um, make it, uh, activities you do on a Sunday afternoon to prepare meals for the week and a half stuff prepared in advance. Um, so I'm going to let Shalane share talk about some of her favorite recipes and how

Speaker 4:          15:37          the one paid, right? That's gain celebrity status. Um, I guess you can, if we were to measure a celebrity says through Instagram, at least one tool. But um, so these are our superhero and muffins and as you can see, they look delicious and you can make him with chocolate chips or not. I spread the chocolate chips. Um, so these are great. Really. See she didn't cause they have some good butter in it and they also are made with almond flour, which is a little bit different than your traditional flower. Um, so the very satiating. They stick in my stomach and I feel like I don't get hungry or hours, which is great because I don't want to be running around high ingredients, at least describes it. Um, so I'll hobbies for breakfast, I will have them as a snack. I'll have him for dessert. They're stable and people are cooking these up like crazy.

Speaker 4:          16:26          They're definitely different because we're tricking people. They taste awesome, but they've got a Zucchini and carrots in it too. So, um, these are for what we classify as a long Sunday run. These muffins were designed for superheroes like you. They're packed full of veggies in Sweden with maple syrup instead of refined sugar. In addition, almond meal and whole grain oats, replacing nutrient strict white flour user, my goto muffins, nourishing and sweetly satisfying for an easy grab and run breakfast and do not fear the butter. You only got one with healthy fats is a great way to start your day. That helps transport important vitamins throughout your hardworking body will help keep you satisfied longer. Um, so yeah, I recommend these. These are huge hit for kids, for husbands, wives, um, for parties. They're just are nice.

Speaker 3:          17:18          Do you want to talk about some of the other foods that you love? Training Therea Burrito?

Speaker 4:          17:22          Um, yeah. Let's see. So I pretty much primarily, you know, a lot of them say once you create this cookbook and you've already tested all of these recipes and numerous signs of eating all of them, it feels like a hundred times each. But I genuinely don't stray from the cookbook. I feel like I can rely on this because they know every ingredient is going to have is power pack. I everything I'm putting in my body, it has a purpose and I like knowing that and I can control that. Um, I always say in athletics you control what you can control cause there's a lot of variables that you can't control. So I try to control what I'm putting in for fuel. Um, I'd say another favorite food, um, is our high altitude vice and meatballs. These are also a huge fan. I had 10 teammates go to the Olympics this summer in Reno and I made these up probably once a week for them.

Speaker 4:          18:11          Um, and bison, we eat quite a bit of bison because it's really rich in iron, which is really important for endurance athletes because burn an endurance athlete, especially if I train at high altitude, um, I need the red blood cell production and it gives me energy. It transports the oxygen. Uh, so there's thought and stories behind each one of these recipes. And on top of being healthy for me, they're delicious. Like I created them. So, um, I think in the past I used to just eat super bland and boring and I wasn't excited to eat my food and I just felt like this burden, like I was describing and counting calories and worrying about getting to this race weight, which is optimal for performance. And I used to stress about it and now I feel like I can indulge in these great foods and not have to worry about my race way. I find it comes naturally now I'm without all the stress of counting, I think it was actually counterproductive. So I'm just hoping that uh, these recipes can really enhance whatever goals you have athletically or just health wise.

Speaker 3:          19:15          A lot of people ask us, we're going to have some questions, time for questions, but I'll go ahead and ask the question then. I know we're going to get asked. Um, everyone asks us that every stop, every city, well, I don't run a hundred miles a week and I eat these foods. And really, um, this is if you're not 120, so a lot of people are like, Whoa, well I don't run that much. So it is really applied to me. Can I really eat that? And the answer is yes, this is for anyone of any level, whether you're a marathon is a 12 hour day at Google or you're chasing after a toddler is you're running. My running is three to five miles and often with a stroller and not every day. And it really varies. And when you eat this way, this is, this is good food for anyone. When you eat this way, you're just so satisfied and so energized that you're gonna want to get out there and do these adventures, um, at on the one hand. And then just real food isn't real. Real food doesn't cause weight gain. It's all the sugars and processed foods. So if you really made a commitment to sourcing good ingredients and getting in your kitchen and cooking, then yes, you can eat this late too.

Speaker 5:          20:17          Okay.

Speaker 3:          20:18          So yeah, if anyone has questions, we have time for answering.

Speaker 6:          20:24          So we have a mic set up right here for questions. Please form a line, ask your questions.

Speaker 5:          20:32          MMM.

Speaker 6:          20:33          Actually I have a couple of questions. Um, the most important question for me is like how do you source them, you know, what do you call it? Good food. Like for example, um, beef. So, uh, I've tried the different kinds of beef before I owned a, there's only one source would be if I had that was really good. Uh, but that's from Hawaii and it's really hard to get to.

Speaker 3:          20:53          Yeah, you guys are really less with access in Seattle state, incredible ingredients. So I would really highly recommend getting to know your farmers that your local farmer's market, um, and they find direct from a farmer is going to give you the best source of the, um, when you go to the grocery store, you have the options of the organic, some hiring versus stories like that with Luke grocery stores will also have the graph said options. So I always choose the grass fed option, organic labeling as a bit misleading because it's gotten to be so mainstream that now you have mass produced organic foods. So anytime that you can get your food closer to the source and in Seattle and have amazing access to local farmer's markets, that's the best bet. And you could make a commitment to go to a farmer's market once a month, but even if you don't have time to go to the farmer's market, a lot of farms will deliver direct.

Speaker 3:          21:48          So even where I live in bend, Oregon, there's a CSA which is a community supported agriculture farm share and they will deliver, I don't know if we will have deliveries direct to here, but in bed he could have um, produce and meat delivered direct to your office or into your home, which is an awesome opportunity. And a lot of food labels are really like misleading. You see like grass and cage free and all of this. But when you're buying direct from a farmer, you don't have to stress when you're getting it from a small local farms there, they're the ones who are committed to taking care of their land because they want to be able to pass their park down in generations. We have a great source that we love is pine on ranch in bend, Oregon, just outside of where I live. And they have a website, um, hi. Not Ranch and you can order on amazing ice in and Yak and have it delivered. Mail lit like ice axes.

Speaker 6:          22:41          Yeah. Yeah. My daughter loves Yak. My two year old Pine Mountain Mountain Ranch Moodle

Speaker 7:          22:57          most. Okay.

Speaker 6:          23:01          Um, I don't want it to you. Let's just get, we'll ask him, but I do have another question. So you mentioned the bar could meet the chicken. So what does that mean? I know

Speaker 3:          23:11          guys, you have the chicken. Um, so when I buy chicken I buy a whole chicken and I get it from a reputable a farmer or reputable grocery store. Um, even like whole foods, you can buy the whole chicken and use every part of it. And that's the best way to eat meat because you get to the chief. The dark money is the thigh and the late. Um, but also I use every part of the chicken so we don't eat a lot of me, but we definitely have meat every day and eat it as like as a side. So we have a lot of vegetables and the meat is a smaller side dish. Um, and just it's, you use every part of it. You can make bone broth, which is incredibly mineral rich, nourishing time, which is great for fall flat fighting inflammation and for recovery and are getting, we're getting into the flu season. So we have a recipe in here for bumper off and that you can make like a chicken stew, which is full of ginger and garlic is really good for boosting your news. Listen.

Speaker 6:          24:06          Um, I also have a question about the, um, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck out of people, but um, so there's me, there's advantages, but we also eat a lot of a flower and rice, you know, how do you source had those kind of things like that from Costco or from, you know, a whole foods or wet do just awesome because we need to use a lot of them. Like on regular basis.

Speaker 3:          24:27          My favorite source for whole grains is Bob's red mill. And you can find it at a lot of wills, even like Safeway or mainstream purchase where you can find Bob's red mill. They're based in Oregon and they have, um, all kinds of whole grains like Farro and Kheema. And you can get, um, like ground flowers too for making, we have a lot of wholesome treats in our book and they're made with whole grain flours. Um, rice, I would say we like to stick to short grain brown rice. Brown rice is more nutritious and make sure arranges for the texture and you can find that in the bulk section at any health food store

Speaker 8:          25:05          concussion.

Speaker 6:          25:07          So I've been a question about, uh, during and post workout nutrition. You know, I find that it's really hard obviously while you're running and then immediately afterwards, you know, the last thing I want to do after a long run is still in the kitchen for 20 minutes cooking something. Do you pre mean just food or how do you handle that? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          25:24          Um, concerning while you're running. So do you like, do you consume a sports drink or a joke? I've been using the power bars. Super happy with it, but yeah. Um, we have some treats in here that are great for like while you're running as well as post run. Um, my favorite that we have our opinion shoes, which are just a natural, um, but they're cooked a little bit new, the chewy. So it's like, you know, you see a lot of those sports gummies, so replaces the synthetic kind of gummies and this simple sugars that are not as great for you. We also have what we call Guinea up energy bars and they're made of dates and variety of dried fruit and um, and that's in it. So, um, gates and nuts are great for light source to fuel you. Um, when I'm competing I just drink a sports drink.

Speaker 4:          26:14          And so that's, uh, but that's necessary. Like there's times and places where you're drinking the sports stream. Otherwise I'm thinking usually like a coconut water most of the time or just simple water. Um, but I get you after Ryan, the last thing you want to do is get in the kitchen. Um, so sometimes I'll try to like prepare a little bit and maybe half my meal prior. Um, but right after a run I usually have, um, our beats movie sounds weird. It's delicious. And that really just get something in immediately because you have kind of a window to kind of refuel and it'll make it feel a lot better. And if you refuel right away, you're going to be a little bit more motivated to get in the kitchen. So my goto though, once I get in the kitchen are just some veggies and scrambled. The egg, it's really simple.

Speaker 3:          26:56          Um, but yeah, at least you have more. Yes. If you're not hungry Radtke rounds you so thirsty as, and he is a great solution and especially you're putting other ingredients in there besides fruits and veggies to balance out all. You don't want to just have this big sugar rush. So putting all in veteran there for the good fat and whole milk yogurt has made me like any good organic whole milk yogurt. It that into your smoothies is great. Awesome. Thank you.

Speaker 9:          27:22          Hmm. Huh? I'm a question you'll be always on carbs. So on the one hand it's the fuel, like we do carb loading before a marathon and I probably during their training and on the other hand there are a lot of abuse against carbs like the, I read the book from fuel method tongue. I'm the big book of enduring sat book, have some extreme views but it does help a lot. They also have the quick recipe there. He wholly against human carbs and even against carb loading before a marathon. He also recommends things like a grass fed grass fed beef from local farms. So what's the Obo on light carbs?

Speaker 4:          28:06          If I were to just ask about the women that I compete against, men like in the Olympics were running the marathon during this athletes, none of them are not consuming carbs. Everyone would be like car. They need carbs. You need like a gen to doing endurance events. So that may said it would not do the no carbs, not really into any trend at all. Like, we just think that what you eat on a daily basis and weekly basis and then you're training for example is what you should be fueling basically before the race. So I will add in a little bit of extra cars the week of the race, but I don't go hog while I don't go and sit and have like a giant bowl of pasta the night before. I think I would spend half my racing the importer. Yawn. You have to like everything in moderation. Anything extreme is not what we're about. Everything is all about moderation. Um, so we find that it is important to do the carpet loading but it's very small. So like more more of my snacks, snacks throughout the week we'll be carbo oriented, but otherwise they eat exactly the way I would eat through my training.

Speaker 9:          29:10          Do I need to, uh, limit carb intake to loose weight because okay.

Speaker 4:          29:16          No, that his car,

Speaker 3:          29:18          there's a big difference in the change process. Carbs and hopefully parts. So you do want to avoid the process. Carbs like the bread, white flour and white sugar and breads and all the packaged foods out there. Made with really highly processed carbs that have no nutrients but the carb, carbohydrates fees and our books are all are complex carbs like sweet potatoes and whole grains and all these things that are going to be balanced energy versus these unhealthy spices. Um, not only because he's not brave but also lead to weight gain. But it is good to avoid the processed carbs.

Speaker 8:          29:58          Okay.

Speaker 10:         30:02          I'm going gonna just, I'll just full up little bit more on that specific question again. Carbs. So he wasn't doing his intellect so you consume carbs but we'd like not white carbs. So pastor the buckwheat pasta and yes. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          30:18          [inaudible] it out. Um, so the night before I run the Boston Marathon. I mean loading up on this week that too, cause no, he's going to explain why it seems to, it's a great source of a carbohydrate as opposed to like we were talking about this strip flowers that really have I no nutrition. So we pass it. It's kind of misleading packaging. Um, same with wheat bread. If it says whole wheat Pasta, whole wheat bread on the outside of the package. If you flip to the back and look at the actual ingredients, the first ingredient is just wheat flour. It's not actually a whole wheat. So when you're buying red and one of the first grade, it would be whole wheat flour and I'd just be loud and there's a lot of other things like that. This lean packaging. Um, we eat pasta, we're not gluten free, but um, but we don't eat like a big map of the pasta. Instead we will have a small serving of pasta with a lot of sauces and salsas pack with veggies and meat and all the good stuff. Um, and then others good carbohydrates are runners is um, grabbing rights or his favorite is wild rice and we have a, a wild rice salad in here. That's amazing. I'm on Fario or Kheema and there's lots of other great sources. Um, but we're not going to say don't eat pasta.

Speaker 10:         31:31          Yeah, the one thing that's, what about like, again, we get some [inaudible] assuming the no yogurt milk

Speaker 3:          31:42          Sherry there. Yes. Yes. The dairy is pretty hard to digest. A lot of renters are sensitive to dairy and sensitive. They can live in. A lot of runners suffer from GI distress because when you're running, your blood is flowing away from your digestive system and going to your hardworking muscles. Um, so dairy can be very hard to digest because of how it's processed in our country. Um, it's very, it's homogenized and ultra pasteurized. So they're heating it to these extreme temperatures. It's killing off all the good probiotics and enzymes, which makes it really difficult to break down the lactose in the dairy. And so we have, in our book, we don't use cream or milk in seven we use varies that are easier to digest, like whole milk yogurt, which have probiotics in it and aged cheeses like Parmesan and they age the cheese. It has, it has the enzymes and it's a lot easier to digest. You also love goat cheese and doesn't have a lactose that's in Berryville a of people have palms.

Speaker 10:         32:40          So shallow. You don't drink coffee with milk?

Speaker 4:          32:44          Oh No, I do, but not a lot. I usually I prefer actually almond milk. What's the time?

Speaker 10:         32:57          Uh, you mentioned that you used to count your calories a lot and like you wouldn't be satisfied with the food, are happy with the food and the answer is you change it. This diet, not diet, weight off eating. Yeah. Uh, he helped a lot and you don't change your diet much. Can you elaborate more on like how much you change your eating close to raise or if you change at all?

Speaker 4:          33:18          Yeah, so like at least helped me realize that the way our culture and how you grew up, who is in green to have everything both that. So like in my fridge it would be low fat yogurt and um, I would have, you know, fake butters price thinking this was all healthy. Am I do here I was, I was thinking I was doing myself that I was doing a good job taking care of myself. Um, but it always left me hungry and not feeling satiated. I always felt like I was constantly hungry and just could never feel full. And there was a reason why. It's because I was eating all, everything so low fat and a lot of low fat foods. Just put mom in a lot of sugar. So out of my body was just burning it and just ripping through it. So it was feeling hungry all the time, which is not fun to run around hungry.

Speaker 4:          34:03          And I have a lot of training. I run them close to, you know, sometimes 20 miles a day and that left me just not in a good place. So I felt like, um, you know, with counting calories and having to eat all of these kind of landlord foods, I just felt like unmotivated and uninspired to eat and uninspired to get in the kitchen and cook and once at least taught me how to integrate, like making my own salad dressings was really good oils. I'm eating chicken the eyes and said of all the white breasts, um, having nice buttery sauces on my pasta. I just started to feel like it was more indulgent. I was enjoying my food more and I just felt like I didn't need to count calories. So it's just my weight was naturally finding a good place and I didn't feel like you have to stress about it anymore.

Speaker 4:          34:50          And she told me that she was like, only numbers you should be concerned about or what your watches reading and what your splits are for your workouts. How many miles are running a day. Worried about those numbers. Ben, in the idea of counting calories and plus on top of it, I couldn't count calories because all the foods I was eating more natural foods. I don't know how many calories are in each, you know, I'm an apple unnecessarily. Every Apple's different. And when you're eating whole foods, there's no need to read the nutrition label. So it just completely opened up. Um, my way of looking at food and it's been like a huge relief. And I have found that here at age 35 and I feel rejuvenated. And then he, my fourth Olympic team and that's hard to do at my age. Not many 35 year old Olympians. And um, I feel like it's because I've changed my diet in way, well I should say diet, my way of eating.

Speaker 10:         35:39          No, I have a follow up to that. So sometimes when I'm in happy training, I wake up hungry. Like in the middle night, like four or three. You have this kind of stuff or do you change your diet?

Speaker 4:          35:49          When I used to, I used to always have like a snack by my bed is I would wake up and it'd be like, oh my gosh, I'm so hungry. I can't wait till breakfast. I have to like promise snap right now. So you said literally I'm food on my nightstand because there's usually like a packaged bar or something. Um, you know, athletes, it's a bars are always like pushed at you all the time. Um, so now I go to bed and I'm full throughout the night and then I'm ready to eat in the morning. But I'm not like we've all the nights, but the hunger pains are what waking me up, which, what happened a lot when I'm cheating heart.

Speaker 5:          36:21          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          36:25          Before I ask my question can invite you ladies to sit. You've been standing where the rest of us. Um, so, uh, I was kinda curious cause there's a lot of trends out there and one particular one, I have a friend who really got excited. Soylent. Uh, what is your take on silent? So lend, it's uh, uh, nevermind. I guess if it's a they da is that they're sourcing a bunch of sugars and fats from different places and then they put them in a bottle or a powder. Right? So it's supposed to be pre balanced, all that stuff.

Speaker 3:          37:06          There's warranty eating. Then just like the nutrients, there's the act of eating and sitting down to a meal. Part of the community and the social aspect of eating food and cooking wakes up your digestive system. There's so much more to you than just like drinking down nutrients so that those products scare me. They're also really highly processed in a lab and they're not, um, it's not real food. So yeah, not crazy about that. I never even heard of it.

Speaker 10:         37:37          Ask a non food question. Just what a couple of questions to a [inaudible] about running Moscow. Oh, my first question was can you comment? Like what is your opinion on the, there is some amazing work [inaudible] like what's your in? Okay, very.

Speaker 4:          37:58          It's like my boy, I came, you actually even conceptualize, so he's asked me about the Olympics and then 10,000 meter, which I am bronze medal from Beijing, China, and then 10,000 meters. And um, but in Rio this summer, um, there was a woman for Ethiopia who ran the world record in the race and it was, I couldn't believe my eyes watching her. It's beyond my comprehension.

Speaker 10:         38:24          I'm Charlene isn't America.

Speaker 4:          38:27          Yeah. Um, and so she ran, um, half of the race faster than I could run, like, so at five k or 5,000 meters, she's ran her first 5,000, hundred second 5,000 faster than I've ever run one. So I can't even conceptualize, um, it was just an outstanding performance. Um, unfortunately with athletics, sometimes what seems unbelievable is unbelievable. Um, I don't know what to think about it, um, just because, uh, as maybe many of you read over the summer and there was a lot of, um, doping stories and, um, you know, with Russia being extracted from the Olympics and not allowed. So it's hard to, it's just hard to know what is real or not real. However, I will say there's not many 10,000 meter races and opportunities to run really fast. So maybe, um, she really just is that good, but we'll find out. But she resumed. It was so impressive. Yes.

Speaker 1:          39:27          And then can we just talk a little bit, what is next for you next? Branding wise? Yes.

Speaker 4:          39:35          Um, well I'm taking a nice little great, um, on this book tour. It's fun to do something different. I, my lifestyle is very monastic. When I'm training for a marathon, it's three months of a lot of dedication. It's run, eat, sleep, running, sleep for p, it's very much the same thing. It's what I call groundhog day. If any of you seen that movie, that's my life. When I'm training for a marathon, it's not very eventful. Uh, so it's fun for me to do other activities and engage with people. I feel like when I come out of marathon training, I'm in like shock and I don't know how to even communicate. It's like, do I even know English? Like it's a, it's a little scary. So it's fine to just be inspired by my running community and the cooking world. Uh, it, it motivates me to get back to my training by taking a break. And so probably come December and January I'll be back at the grind of running a sleep and I have aspirations. My, my love affair with running is a in Boston. I love the Boston Marathon. I grew up there, so I may show up in Boston next April. That may be part of my plan. Um, but beyond that, I don't know. I'm taking one race at a time. Um, a lot athletes thinking four year chunks, but right now I'm just going to go

Speaker 5:          40:48          one flight month was that,

Speaker 1:          40:52          so I want to ask about morning rounds and you may have to luxury not to have to deal with this, but, but how do you deal when you're trying to get a long run it in the morning, you know, do you wake up at 4:00 AM to eat and then go back to sleep for a few hours or

Speaker 4:          41:02          um, if I'm just doing chaining. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, yeah. So I, I like to eat about 90 minutes prior to the start over run. Um, and I know that, that maybe this is like a luxury for me because that's my job. Uh, but so if like for example, if you were wanting to start your run, what at like 5:00 AM you're saying and you want it to get in before work or,

Speaker 1:          41:27          or, yeah. Or You'd have family or three hours at like, you know, 7:00 AM 609.

Speaker 4:          41:36          I mean, the key is the key in the morning, and this is maybe a little bit too much information, is to get up and get it moving so that you're not gonna have any GI issues out on the trail. How did it make a pit stop? So that's usually what most mentors are. Like, let's get up like an hour before, so I get some food in, make sure that you've made your bathroom stop and you can head out on the trail on the road and be good to go. Um, so I usually get up about like an hour before, but sometimes that's hard to do if it's dark and cold. And, um, but usually on the ride to like we're drive or if I'm going to go run to drive, um, or run dry it to go run, I will take like a smoothie or one of our superhero muffins and

Speaker 3:          42:18          that kind of right before I get out there. So yeah, you don't have time for breakfast. And I, I run an early and before my husband leaves for work in before I start, we're being in. Um, so I don't, at that hour at 6:00 AM I'm not hungry, so I'll just get up and have some coconut water mixed with water, diluted with water and either coffee or tea. And I'm like a couple of days just frozen quick energy. But a three hour run is different. Like I know less than that. So, um, you definitely get some good quick glucose,

Speaker 1:          42:57          right? That's the end of our talk. We're going to have a book signing over at that table over there. There's still some books available for purchase over here and everybody please give a warm thank you to Shane and Elise.
