Speaker 1:          00:07          Well. Good morning and welcome to talks at Google in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Today it's my great pleasure to introduce the great and Jane Lightman. Jean is one of Boston's most exceptional representational artists and teachers as a teacher. She passes on the knowledge and techniques she has received as one in the line of Boston School of painters that has been unbroken for over a century. This was a remarkable lineage, I believe is unique and the American art community. She can describe it far better than I can and I'll leave it to her to do some. Gene holds a distinguished artists membership at the Concord Art Association and became a Copley artist member of the Copley Society Boston in 2004 in 1989 she was elected a member of the prestigious guild of Boston artists where she currently serves as vice president of the board of managers and curated a major historical exhibition, a woman's perspective, founding and early women members of the guild of Boston artists 1914 to 1945 please join me in welcoming Jane White Man.

Speaker 2:          01:33          Thank you, Jonathan. Thank you all for coming today. It's an honor to be here at Google and have the opportunity to talk with you about art. And in particular the art of the Boston School, which is not a physical school is Jonathan explained it's a painting tradition that's been handed down from teacher to student for over 100 years.

Speaker 3:          01:55          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:55          And uh, in my talk today I'll introduce the Boston school painters, the founders show you the work of the founders and I'm also the European masters who influenced them as well as their successors.

Speaker 3:          02:10          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:11          I'll also show you images of my own work and explain how I include the essential elements of the Boston school and to my painting. So, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:24          okay.

Speaker 2:          02:25          The Boston school painters are essentially impressionist in the sense that they paint what the eye sees with particular attention to the lights and the shadows and the colors

Speaker 2:          02:39          because their paint, what there, I actually sees some areas are more distinct and others are more diffused. So there are sometimes called optical realist. And this should be distinguished from photo realist where in photo realism painting, every square inch of the canvas is painted in precise everything. And in the exact same focus, but the way that we actually see is some areas are more defined and others are more diffused and so that's the way the Boston school painters like to paint. As you can see, they don't all paint alike, but they're all interested in how the light falls across their subject.

Speaker 3:          03:21          Okay,

Speaker 2:          03:22          and the most important trade mark or the Boston school painters is that all of the parts must relate to the whole giving the paintings unity or breadth.

Speaker 3:          03:34          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:35          Probably the earliest vulva impressionist painter was Velasquez, Diego Velasquez who painted this beautiful scene, Las Meninas and you can see how he has captured the light and the relationships of the light as they fall on on the scene and pay close attention to the dwarf and the dog and the lower right hand corner because they're beautiful examples of impressionists sing.

Speaker 3:          04:03          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:03          From Mira was another impressionist and the way that we're using this term, he was fascinated by how light fell across the scene and his paintings have a truth or the look of nature. You feel like you're in the room with, with the subject.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:19          He's arranged the model next to the window and he's described how the light falls across her arm and across the top of her head covering the back wall and onto the table.

Speaker 2:          04:30          And he's painted relational color. He was one of the first painters and really the only Dutch painter to understand that there's color in the halftones, which is the area between the lights and the shadows. And here he's painted this beautiful blue note and the top of her head, her head covering, and he's looking at relational colors. So rather than painting this breasts, pitcher and, and bowl a yellow as it would be in in life, he's showing you that it's reflected in all the colors around it. So this is relational color versus absolute color. And you'll see this over and over again in the Boston school paintings.

Speaker 3:          05:08          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Chardon also include an influenced the Boston school painters and he painted beautifully composed, still lives using simple kitchen objects and note how he paints these beautiful abstractions of lights and shadows as they, uh, move across the canvas.

Speaker 3:          05:28          Okay?

Speaker 2:          05:29          In the late 19th century, Americans flocked to Europe to study art. In the academies, particularly in France and Germany. And they learn, they're the essentials of painting and in particular design, which was a key element, so important in academic painting. And this painting by Joe Only owns your Rome called Gray Eminence hangs in the Museum of fine arts. It's a wonderful example of academic painting. And I learned from a Google search. The Gray Eminence refers to the power behind the throne. In this case, this monk standing on the stairs who was the power behind the throne in the court of King Louis, the 13th. And Cardinal Richelieu, Edmund Tarbell is considered the founder of the Boston school. In fact, the early painters we'll call terrible lights, he traveled to France as a young art student in 1883 and studied in the academy. Julienne there. He learned the fundamentals of drawing and design and painting.

Speaker 2:          06:32          But he and the other early Boston painters, Boston school painters, and I'll show you their work in a minute. We're influenced also by the color and the light of the French impressionist. And uh, they incorporated those to the color and light and the drawing and design. And they brought those back to Boston and taught them what became known as the Boston school tradition. And note here, and you should blur your eyes, which is the way to look at a lot of these paintings with a blurred I, you can see the abstractions of dark silhouettes cut into the light starting on the bottom left corner of the canvas and traveling up and down and up until he gets to the right upper right corner. Beautiful abstractions. And like for mere, he's fascinated with the play of light across the models neck and also across the wall throughout the whole scene.

Speaker 2:          07:26          This is also by bell and a wonderful portrait. Again, abstract did abstract had saying of lights and that are silhouetted against a dark background. The painter here shows is the beautiful form and colors in her face and her arms and also in her her dress. And he's seeking something here that, um, is, is a unique, I think to a lot of the Boston school painters trying to find the beauty, uh, the whole harmony and the round forms that you see when you look at the scene is reminiscent of John Singer Sargent portraits. And people often ask me if sergeant was a Boston school painter, but he was not. He painted in Europe, um, studied in Europe, like the Boston painters, but his paintings are a little bit different. And as you can see, the models is that he's a genius. And I'm not taking anything away from sergeant. He was an absolutely superb, phenomenal painter and a number of different genres, not just portrait, but he's not seeking out the subtle color tones and the round form in the face and the neck and the arms, which I think you can see here. He's painting a sort of lively, um, painterly, um, ensemble of lights and darks. Frank Benson was another early Boston school painter and he liked Tarbell study that the academy, Julianne and Paris.

Speaker 3:          08:56          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:56          his outdoor paintings glow with sunlight.

Speaker 3:          08:59          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:00          As you can see here, he's also fascinated by the colors, the relational colors, the blues and the yellows on her dress. Also on the inside of the boat and on his son's shirt. These are his children here. The whole painting is a wonderful ensemble of blues and yellows with a little hint of reds in here for some interest.

Speaker 3:          09:24          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:25          Benson was also an avid outdoorsman and he, uh, as he, um, he also did beautiful etchings and paintings of wildlife. And notice here his wonderful designs, the, the would call what's called negative shapes here of the, uh, inside the wings of the Canada geese and how he's spaced them. He sort of has a wonderful rhythm here that's played out from here to here to here. It's a really beautiful example of design, very simple design and, and Vinson was a master at that.

Speaker 3:          10:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:01          Another early Boston school painter was Joseph to Camp who studied with, um, uh, frank douvenette in Germany. Notice here. He's, this is also a wonderful example of Boston school. What's essential to the Boston school, which is lost and found. So, um, uh, found edge, uh, is where the light and the shadow or contrast and so this would be a found a edge here. The shadow against the background. Also her just very, you have to look closely, but her chin here against the background is a found edge. This is a law sedge under her neck. So this just dissolves into the background. The same thing with the back of her hair that dissolves into the back of her neck and shoulder. And then all the way down into the apron and now look at how her apron dissolves into the tabletop, the shadows on the tabletop. And then this wonderful still life here of porcelain objects is a great example of lost and found. So this is a, a found edge here, which is sharp here against the black of her apron. This would be a lost edge where the other, other side of this porcelain dissolves into the background. So you'll see lost and found repeated in a lot of the Boston school work.

Speaker 3:          11:25          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:25          William Paxton studied with Joseph Decamp, our previous painter and Paxton Excel did interiors. I'm very much influenced by Vermeer. This is a painting at the Museum of fine arts called the new necklace.

Speaker 3:          11:41          Okay,

Speaker 2:          11:41          this is another wonderful painting by Paxton. I'm also at the Museum of Fine Arts and another great example of lost and found and also beautiful impressionist color. So you here some lost edges here and um, very simple, not highly defined, a licensed shadows in the face which dissolve into the back of the neck. But you really have to see this painting at the museum to appreciate the absolutely gorgeous colors that the artist puts into her back. And also her arm. And notice the beautiful form on both his wife Elizabeth Paxon was also a wonderful painter and she excelled at it still life paintings. He or she makes this terrific ensemble of a mass of objects. It's called the breakfast tray and she has a variety of edges here. This is all an angle. So here's a sharp angle here around a sharp edge on the edge of the cup, beautiful variety of edges and the Napkin and also wonderful color ensembles. These yellows and blues harmonize beautifully and then she has a little note of red here for interest.

Speaker 3:          13:02          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:02          William Paxton, student Ives gamble was responsible for carrying that tradition on through the 20th century. He taught a number of students in the forties and the fifties sixties I guess 50 sixties and seventies when this tradition was very much out of favor with the artists and the arts schools of the day. A gamble, loved painting, these sort of allegorical paintings. But again, note the beautiful Carmona is color relationships. I love the blues and the yellows and this painting and then he has also some notes of Rudd.

Speaker 3:          13:37          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:39          The PA, the Boston school tradition would have surely died out if it hadn't been for gamble and a number of his students have gone on to teach, including my teacher.

Speaker 3:          13:51          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:52          One of his early students was Robert Douglas Hunter. You might be familiar with his still lives. He was a very well known, a still life painter and also noted for is harmonious compositions. Um, he painted what he said all nature in one glance and it does feel like this is a, uh, this classical still life has a beautiful harmony or unity about it.

Speaker 3:          14:17          Okay.

Speaker 2:          14:17          Gambles student. One of his students was Paul Ingrid Son, who was my teacher and Paul Excelled. He's also has gone on to teach oh, dozens of painters over the last 30 years in mansion now in Manchester. New Hampshire has an Italia, Paul Excels at portraits, civilized interiors figures, and this is a beautiful portrait of a dancer. Uh, one of my favorites of his, and he has uses a full use of relational color, beautiful color transitions between the, the warm notes in her cheek across the, around 400 chic to the cooler blue notes at the edge of her jaw. Also beautiful soft round edge at the edge of her jaw.

Speaker 3:          15:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:00          And across her neck. And more than that, more the tech, more the, uh, more than the technical accomplishments of this painting, he's infused the, the, uh, portrait with expression in life.

Speaker 3:          15:16          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:17          This is Pauline Robertson's Italia in New Hampshire and this is one of his cast drawing students. When the student begins to study in the Boston school tradition, the first thing you do is you'd make do charcoal drawings of these white plaster casts. And that's what the student is doing here. And that's what I did when I first started studying, um, in the late eighties with Paul. So this is my cast drawing and it's the perfect teaching tool. It's, it's the, um, the opportunity for the teacher to what's called true, the eye of the student to recognize values and proportions. Everything is seen relationally. So I learned to see the height and relation to the width. I learned to see how my values, how dark my shadows had to be in order to make my lights pop out and get what's called a light effect, which is so important in this painting.

Speaker 3:          16:13          Okay.

Speaker 2:          16:13          And I also learned to distinguish a variety of edges, as I've already pointed out. So there's sharp edges where the value contrast or the highest. And then in order to describe the form, I had to learn to understand softer edges. And how to make things look round. And of course in Socrates beard here, I had infinite opportunity to do that.

Speaker 3:          16:35          Okay.

Speaker 2:          16:36          This is um, Paul's teaching studio and uh, where I studied in Roxbury back in the 80s. And a few things to point out about the studios for these Boston school painters. First of all, you notice that the wall color is a middle value. It's not white. We never use white walls because the light bounces all over white walls. And so it's hard to see what your, the light is doing on your setup. This is the setup here. Also, we have high Northlight because Northlight is steady, there's no sun shining through to, um, to change the shadows. So the shadows are fairly consistent throughout the day.

Speaker 3:          17:16          Okay.

Speaker 2:          17:16          Another thing I want to point out is in our painting, we actually have to stand back from the setup and the Easel at least three times the height of the painting so that you can see the whole thing at once. Because obviously you're trying to get harmony or unity. So you have to be able to see all of the relationships that the values and the colors and the proportions all as Robert Hunter said in one glance. So you stand back and then you look at the painting and the setup and then you actually walk up and paint from memory. So I'm not looking at the setup when I'm painting this painting.

Speaker 3:          17:55          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          17:55          it's just an interesting note. So I studied with Paul for almost 10 years and um, finally cut the umbilical cord and the early nineties and started painting on my own in a studio in Concord, Massachusetts. And I enjoy doing portraits of kids, children. I've also, because they have nice round form and their faces and I love that. Um, I also liked doing landscapes. This is a painting of the Minuteman statue with the Northbridge and conquered.

Speaker 3:          18:27          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:28          But my passion is flowers and in particular pns, um, what I love about them are the round shapes and just like the figures with the white dresses and the earlier paintings that you saw, I get, I'm very excited by all of the colors that I see in the halftones between the lights and the shadows. So these white p and A's have an infinite, infinite variety of color in those half tones. I also love the variety of shapes in the pns and colors and sizes. And here I also am painting hydrangeas. Those are all so fun to paint and most of all for me, pianists have a real life force about the mine titled this painting. She, because the challenge for me is to get the life, the, the essence of these p and ls. And um, so I that was a, this is she for that reason.

Speaker 3:          19:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:31          So I want to explain to you, show you how I actually set up a design, make an arrangement and um, and then, uh, decide until it's until I'm satisfied with it. Because as Benson said, design makes the picture good. Painting can never save a picture of the composition as bad.

Speaker 3:          19:53          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:54          So in this set up, I was interested in getting what's called a cure Schiro effect. I, I was interested in a very dark background with a bright flowers, um, uh, shining out, uh, with a lot of light on them. The problem with this though is I sat with it for a few days was that there really wasn't a good, powerful center of interest. Everything was pretty similar. So there are a lot of little flux here and, and not particularly, um, catching eye catching. So I added in some white panties for interest and started playing around with these. But the problem here was that they were too spotty. So I've got one here, one here, one here, and I'm not really interested in sort of into it individual panties. I'm interested in massing them together and seeing what they do as a big abstract shape.

Speaker 3:          20:43          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          20:43          So I started doing that and trying to get something interesting and notice also that I'm starting to play around with the background flowers. Make those

Speaker 3:          20:54          okay.

Speaker 2:          20:54          Harmonized with the, um, with the center of interest. Because you want your background to accentuate it, but you don't want it to take away from the center of interest. It's Paul used to say, you don't want something in the backstage to be jumping out saying, look at me, look at me. So you're interested in a center of interest that's complemented by the background. So I'm continuing for a few days. This was interesting, but it was a little too symmetrical here.

Speaker 3:          21:25          Okay,

Speaker 2:          21:25          now I'm getting a little bit closer.

Speaker 3:          21:29          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          21:30          And finally, this is the finished painting that I, that I, um, was happy with them. The design. There's some interesting negative shapes. There's an interesting massive light here, a movement or just you're among the flowers that's um, that's uh, accentuated by the background and then also notes of red and it's, it's predominantly a yellow and blue painting. And I consider the green to be part of the yellow family. And then I've added some for interests, some coral notes here.

Speaker 2:          22:03          So now I'll show you start to finish how actually do a painting. And this is another set up in my studio. Um, and, uh, the canvas, as you can see, a side by side and I'm standing fairly far back in order to see the whole thing at once. So these would be my first marks really. This is like maybe the first 20 minutes of working with a very large brush and a very blurred I, because I'm looking to see the big abstractions of light as it falls across this, um, set up and also the biggest color values that I can find. So this is sort of the approximate color and value of the lightest area, which would be the P and A's. And then this is the background, the dark notes around it. Actually, this is the background. This is the dark shadow. So what I'm trying to get them approximately the right place.

Speaker 2:          22:58          This is now I'm getting more of the lay in, it's called. So this would be the first, probably 30 minutes or one hour of doing this painting. Again, big abstractions of light and shadows. I'm not painting objects, um, painting, um, masses of lights. So for that reason you can see that there's a law one edge on one side of the flower that I'm, that I'm starting to, um, delineate. There we go. And what I'm interested in here is how that edge dissolves into the dark shadow along the vase and where that is an approximate relation to the edge of the canvas. So I'm continuing to search for my light masses. I'm letting tones dissolve the background that are called half tones. I'm looking for the leading edge. These would be the hour baskets called. There are no lines in nature, so I don't paint around anything.

Speaker 2:          23:57          I'm just painting edges and the variety of edges that my eyes sees. And also you might notice that I've only painted the left side of this vase because for compositional reasons that was very important to me. For one thing, the shadow dissolves into this shadow, but also the arm here has a relationship to the arc of this, um, flower up here and through this shadow. This was very important to me in the design. And I want to make sure that I've got this fairly well delineated, delineated at an early stage of the painting. And then there's a, there's sort of a secondary line or movement here. So, um, and this would be the, what's called the s, uh, the big look for the start. At this point, I've got everything going pretty well. Um, I've got the visual orders, so the, the areas that are, um, that jump out at your eye when you blur your eyes also come forth and, or come forward on the canvas and areas that dissolve recede on the canvas.

Speaker 2:          25:01          So it's, it's what my eye sees when I blur it. Um, very, uh, uh, with a very blurred, I, I'm also looking for, for shifts, shifts of value, and also shifts of color. So I'm looking for rare. My read, my, um, I'm sorry, my yellows dissolve into bluenotes and um, just color shifts all over here. Also, it has the appearance of, of images coming out of a fog, which is, um, also that lost and found look. So the rest will be refinements. So I'll go area by area now and start painting. Uh, the, the, um, top left here was one area. So again, I'm not painting objects, I'm painting areas of light and shadow and how, where are they dissolve into one another. Uh, this is also when I'm working area by area. I'm working in the way that we call painting from the back straggler.

Speaker 2:          26:02          So if you can imagine a shepherd who's hurting a flock of sheep from one pasture to the next, he moves that big flock of sheep, sheep belong, but he might have a small group that sort of lagging behind and those are his back stragglers. So he goes and he pulls those flock of sheep forward and then another flock of sheep will lag behind. So we're painting from the back straggler here. And in this case, as you, you're, you're trying to get the whole ensemble moving pretty much at once, but obviously you have to paint area by area. You can't paint the whole painting all at one time. So the back straggler for me would be this bottom right hand area and that's what I would have painted the, uh, probably the next, after I painted this area, I would have gone and painted in this area. So I'm always also pushing the light effect here.

Speaker 3:          26:50          Okay.

Speaker 2:          26:51          Looking for big colors shifts. And um, at this point everything is, is pretty well defined and I'm fairly happy with it, but it doesn't have the harmony or the unity of the setup of the concept that I'm looking for. And it's important to understand. We're not copping simply, blindly copying nature. We're looking for something bigger, that breadth that I was talking about earlier. So I'm working day to day, pulling back, looking for the biggest, biggest relationships I can see with a big blurred I with these hydrangeas and how they relate to the whole ensemble.

Speaker 3:          27:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          27:31          I often use a mirror, which I look at upside down because it reverses everything backwards and upside down and it helps me see what the very fresh eye,

Speaker 3:          27:43          okay.

Speaker 2:          27:43          So this was my finished painting and I couldn't find any more back stragglers here. It has the harmony that I was looking for and the big look, it also has the vibrancy and the lights and the shadows and um, unity, strong light effect, magical color relationships, all very important in this painting.

Speaker 3:          28:09          Okay.

Speaker 2:          28:10          So I wanted to, um,

Speaker 3:          28:13          okay,

Speaker 2:          28:14          just tell you a little bit about, you can see a lot of the early Boston school paintings at the Museum of Fine Arts and Contemporary Boston school painters. Uh, a number of us are members of the guild of Boston artists, which was founded by Tarbell and Benson and decamp and the early Boston school painters. It's a nonprofit gallery on Newbury street. And uh, continues today. We just celebrated our hundredth anniversary. So I'm, this is actually a photo of the gallery in 1914 for the inaugural exhibition. And the gallery is still there. This mantle is still there and now they're paintings of contemporary Boston school and also other wonderful painters painting in a different traditions, tonal list, uh, Hudson River school, some fabulous painters. So encourage you to take a look at the gallery and see these paintings for yourself. Some of the, uh, just a few of those painters are Mary Menifee, his wonderful portrait painter, and also does beautiful still lives.

Speaker 3:          29:13          Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:13          David Curtis, who's also a student of Ives gamble, uh, like my teacher and he paints wonderful. Still lifes, I'm sorry, landscapes on the north shore.

Speaker 3:          29:23          Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:23          Anita Johnson who paints all kinds of figurative work as well as I'm still alive.

Speaker 3:          29:29          Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:30          And Pamela Penn, Dell who was, um, a student of Robert Hunter's and um, does a number of different, uh, paintings as well as sculpture and beautiful drawings as you can see here.

Speaker 3:          29:42          Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:43          So, um, thank you very much. Also, I appreciate being able to use the images from the art renewal center and I'll take any questions that you have.

Speaker 3:          29:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:54          That was great. Thank you. Um, I'm curious, oh, give him the longevity of the Boston school. Is there any obligation on the part of you as a student or other students to go out and become teachers on your own?

Speaker 2:          30:11          Yes, I absolutely, I'm, I'm deeply appreciative of Pauling son because he is passing this on and there are other teachers, other people teaching this. I'm actually throughout the country. Um, but I think we as students do have an obligation to pass it on. And I do some teaching myself. Merry men of fee also teaches David Curtis stages. So there are a number of us who were, I'm endeavoring to pass this very valuable painting, traditional one to the next generation. So if there are no more questions, I thank you all for coming today.

Speaker 3:          30:50          Yeah.
