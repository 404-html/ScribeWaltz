She's the winner of the British reality TV show, celebrity big brother five and has been nominated for four film fair awards and all the year she's delighted us with her acting and dancing and mostly Hindi movies, but also Tamil, Telugu and Canada. But more importantly, she has this passion for the auto wellness and how we can transform ourselves inside out through modalities like yoga, meditation, or good nutrition, which is one of the main topics she wants to share with us. And if you get lucky, she might actually lead us through a short yoga practice. So please help me with a Bollywood style. Welcome to [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:38          That's terrible.

Speaker 3:          01:40          Well guys, let's, let's hope we can change that. So if I do come in next time, let's see more people saying yes to that confidently. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:52          no, we have a pretty active program with the several hundred classes a week, just in the San Francisco Bay area alone. We have 50 classes every week and they're pretty packed. But on your channel, one of your signature [inaudible] master hall, right? We've got to make everyone do that. So can you demonstrate it once and then I'll get the whole audience with Joe in a couple of times? What do you say?

Speaker 3:          02:12          So swaths through a whole muster all means stay healthy and just throw caution to the wind and just be happy. So that truly is my mantra in life. Uh, stay happy and stay busts. So I do it like this, so I slow.

Speaker 4:          02:30          All right, let's do it with a couple of times. Do it again. One more time. A little louder. Slas with the Ham hocks throw. Thank you. Nobody. You can see my biceps, but yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:46          So I understand you're here for a woman's empowerment conference. Yes. How did that go? And, uh, what is your vision for empowering women around the world?

Speaker 3:          02:54          Oh my God. Um, yeah, that went really well. I've, I've just still, I mean we're close to, you know, women's Day on the 8th of March. I thought this was a great opportunity and when I was offered it, I said, great, I'll tour around the U S and. M. More importantly I think, um, since I've just started this wellness series are through digital media, I just star, I just thought this would be a great opportunity also to come and visit you guys, learn from you and help. I'd rather get help from you to help me help the world. And, uh, you know, I've been acting for the last 20 years, but this truly is my colleague. I really believe that I became an actor and I became someone who was famous so that I could be of some use in this sphere. And, um, I, for me, health is truly my passion.

Speaker 3:          03:57          I have suffered with cervical spondylosis as seen people who are not near and dear to me suffer with cancer. And um, I've been able to change my life through yoga, through meditation or through good eating habits, which I call the lifestyle modification. I never use the word Diet because I think it's just so vulgar. Vulgarized that word Diet that the minute you say diet, people are put off by it. They think it's going to be bland food. It's not going to be tasty. It's going to be sodium, less oil lists. So I said, how do I, how do I debunk these, these meats with food health? And um, there are, there is a lot of information on Google. Great. I just thought I'd make, make it easier to China to kind of make it a one stop shop for people or who really can't afford a gym, don't have the time to work out, don't know what to cook for their children.

Speaker 3:          05:04          Um, and I just think that women especially are already in such an empowered position. You know, since we're talking about empowerment, I thought to just give them the knowledge of and empower them with the knowledge of health, uh, which I think is something that is far more powerful than the feminists. Sort of empowering, you know, um, I thought through my channel I'd be able to channelize a bit of my knowledge to the experts that I have on my channel to be able to empower people with the importance of health. How important it is to breed. Yeah. Which we're not doing in this time and age. We're so busy running after our goals up or not breathing or forget doing primas. How many of you actually sit down and take a breath of fresh air?

Speaker 3:          06:06          Very few. Yeah, you do. Yes. You know, I'm not directing the question to you, but none of us sit down and just inhale and exhale. We don't do that. You know, our chest is an opening. Okay. Teach them right now. Let's change that. How do you do it? Nope. Just leave. Just open up, you know, positivity or negativity. Trust me, there's lots of it. Okay. And when you're inhaling and exhaling, you're not doing it just from your chest in your body. You're doing it from your mind. So it's your entire mind and soul that is getting purified. You know, oxygen is reaching your lungs and it's purifying your body and your mind. It opens up your mind and all the space that you guys are in. Trust me, it's going to help you a lot. You need your mind. You're like Yolo, mind workers. And uh, I just think that small little things like that.

Speaker 3:          07:18          Breathing, chewing food, chewing food. How many of us to our food study got to chew our food 32 times. Each muscle has to be true 32 times as why you would do that. Because that's, that's the reason beginning given 32 teens, none of us do it. We just, which has got Bullitt, we've started gobbling off food. We've stopped. We don't even concentrate on what we eating. How many of you look at your food with gratitude and see, oh my God, wow, this is going into my body. None of us do it. You do it. That's why you look so big in the pink of health. He looks well nourished. Yeah. So we know you don't, we just have stopped living. We, we're just living, we've been not enjoying our life. And I just think that, you know, before it gets too late, because I've lost a few people that I love very dirty, all to bad health.

Speaker 3:          08:17          And I just felt that it was important for me to take this off as a cause. I mean, we, you know, I've worked with HIV patients and uh, I've done something and you know, in that sphere of, of health and I'm like, Gosh, what if we could actually just rewind. I live better lives, you know, rather than reach a point of no return. We own to, you know, vitamin injections. Today we're all d three deficient. Most of us, 80% of us are d three deficient because we don't want to stand out in the sun. So I'm like, um, small little things. I just think I want to bring focus to the old way of living and I want to do that through this jungle. And it really comes out of out of my heart and less from my mind, and I've said this before, I just saw the world is going digital and I thought let me do it this way because it'll reach out to more people are really happy. Then the day we launched we, we touched all the nearly 1.5 views, yes million views and it was a huge compliment and also reassuring that people are interested in health. I don't know if they just want her to see shows by Shanti Lycra, but that couldn't have been the only reason. So we have a few subscribers now. We've touched nearly 67 k

Speaker 1:          09:40          so health, wellness and how to uh, one of the popular category, all the questions he doesn't know. But one of the accomplishments we are very proud of among everything else is that you choose to be what we call a youtuber. You've chosen the platform that is more than a billion people coming and watching some video the other every month. Yeah. So in fact the audience may not have seen it. Can we roll a video just to show everyone a rules paste of what she'll pass channel looks like on Youtube.

Speaker 3:          10:09          Hello everyone. I'm here to tell you why I'm here and what this channel is all about. Out of the various things that I've done in life. The reason to start this journal is to bring about an awareness for what I value the most life. How many of us do we really value life? Why is the quality of our health deteriorating?

Speaker 3:          11:56          I didn't know they were going to play that. Gosh, I give the hood speed on my own. I, if I knew they were going to have to speak. So

Speaker 1:          12:03          repetition is good. So I have two questions. Where you up first is how the experience with Youtube and then secondly you've got one on some of the smartest youtube folks sitting right here. Do you have any ask for them? Yes.

Speaker 3:          12:14          Yeah, I want to ask them to help me. Um, obviously I'd love to hear from you how I could popularize this and I realize why. I think I'm one of the first celebrities are to be a youtuber because it takes so long, it takes so much time. You know, we're such a pampered lot and also spoiled in the way that we paid for every minute. And this is something that I'm doing free and, and I'm, I'm seeing this song with a lot of humility. So I realize when I embarked on this venture or this journey that I taught, you know, I just shoot and I'll just start putting up stuff. But it wasn't that easy. There was, you know, there was work going into what we supposed to shoot, what we supposed to actually put out or targeting all the important questions or as a Lima and what is it that, you know, how do we start off?

Speaker 3:          13:15          How do we, you don't keep that interest going. What is the first thing that would catch people's eyes and uh, or imagination, how do we get them interested in health? It was so much homework and then the hours of shooting, eight hours of, of doing yoga. Yeah. Eight hours every shoot of doing, you know, six hours. I couldn't do beyond that because I started cramping. Yeah. And you know, when you do yoga you can't eat. So I was on, I was just sipping on liquids and you know, fruit. So I shoots would begin at like nine in the morning and I'd have to keep light. So you fully enlightened by evening? No. So I understand what the beauty of it is. I discovered, I discovered so much through that journey because I mean when you do yoga, you don't do it beyond an hour, but at the shoot, because I obviously wanted to, you know, do my best and I wanted to do every Asana, Asana to my optimum best because I wanted people to, oh, you know, to, to realize that this is what you can achieve or, so I didn't know I had that kind of strength.

Speaker 3:          14:30          I didn't know that I could actually stay without food for six hours. Yeah. And it's, that's the power of yoga. It truly is mind over body. Absolutely. And so do the shoot would, would go on, I'd be okay. And soon as the shoot was over I'd be like, I give me anything to eat. So that is amazing. And then also the cooking. So we didn't have a food stylist. It's youtube. We were really good, deep goody baseball. So, so be like, you know, cost cutting. I said we can't afford me. This is not a normal shoot. So everything from cutting the vegetables to euro, I'm putting it on the plate and showing it to people. I've done it all my self. So, and it was, and we did nearly like eight, eight dishes a day because we wanted a bank before we, we started rolling. Yeah. And the minute we had like 60, 70 videos in hand, that's when I launched it. But the work has been going on for the last nine months. So, uh, it was a lot of hard work and that's when I realized, and then after you finished it, I also had to debate. So every asinine is dubbed by me. So it was a lot of hard work. So I realized why no celebrity wants to do this. I was like, good gracious God.

Speaker 1:          15:50          So that's great feedback and we'll take it away and we happy to share some best practices with you. But one suggestion is actually that behind the scene story you just told me that it still will make for an interesting episode because people want to hear that. Your fans want to hear that. So go back and relive the production. There's one more video.

Speaker 3:          16:11          Crazy. Um, but what did you take out of it? I want to know from you because you are a Yogi yourself and you're very passionate.

Speaker 1:          16:19          Yeah. So my biggest takeaway is when I was a kid, I ran away to an Ashram and I had to learn yoga. And we are primarily taught by bearded men and orange. It was an esoteric practice and thanks to now supermodels, super actresses turned Super Yogi knees. It's become more accessible to a larger population in the, it's got demystified and you frame it in more contemporary terms and you make it accessible to a lot of people otherwise who would not have looked at it. So I want to thank you for doing it.

Speaker 3:          16:51          You and I want to thank you that, you know, you're in San Francisco and you're such a, you know, uh, diligent follower of yoga and you're trying to spread the word, which is really wonderful. So huge round of applause.

Speaker 1:          17:04          Thank you. [inaudible]. So speaking of one yoga, one question and then we'll go into a practice mode. Bollywood is not exactly the right environment for a yoga mindfulness kind of practice. It's a frenzy, plays things more quickly and there's a lot of tension and stress and a lot of travel. So how do you reconcile those two worlds and bring it together?

Speaker 3:          17:28          That's a really interesting question. Um, that's why I'm not doing movies right now. I haven't done for the last seven years. I think maybe nine, but I'm still here. I'm still at Google and uh, I've made my choices. I've been there, done that. I've been been part of the menu for the last years. Um, I do, I do TV. I choose to do that because I can't be part of this or erotic timings. And you know, I have, I have a four and a half year old baby. And for me I'm very clear that that is my, he is my priority, my family is my first priority and I want to give time to myself and unapologetically. And when you're an actor, it's very hard to do that. So, I mean, obviously my recognition comes through movies. That will always be my claim to fame. I'm very proud of it.

Speaker 3:          18:27          Um, but if, if I do choose to do a movie, it'll be, it'll have to work around my schedule. We'll have to, we'll have to be a film that is, you know, that'll start an end quickly. Also, I think I turned to yoga because of, of the frenzy life that we lead. Um, it's, it's a very hard life. You're constantly living in a glass fish bowl and um, you're getting trolled. Um, Instagram determines how famous you are, how much you liked. It's, it's, it's really shallow. And though I have to say in the most hippo and hypocritical sort of way that I love that. I love it. I really do. Uh, but the time that I share with myself, that for me is just, it's just my time. You know, it just helps me cope with everything. So even if I'm told and if somebody writes about that article, it's just, that's part of my life.

Speaker 3:          19:37          The morning that I wake up and I do my plan, I, Emma and I'm in the sun, basking in its glory and my feet are tired, you know, my feet is formally on the grass that is life, you know, just, just being able to do that, to breathe the air and to just live this blessed life for me, that is far more important than all the, you know, the craziness of, of our job. So I think that's what keeps me grounded. So a lot of people tell me, how do you manage to be, you know, so positive and you're like smiling. I have, I, I get upset. I'm only human. Of course I get upset. Of course. I, uh, I go to my times of, you know, why would they write something like that? But then I'm out of it. I don't carry forward. And I think help yoga has helped me do that.

Speaker 3:          20:35          Yoga has made me believe that what cannot be cured has to be endured. And that is once you understand that all life is so much more easier. Otherwise being an actor as a really hard job that'd be telling you to be bought of it for the last 23 years has been, I don't know how, I don't know how I've lost it on so long. We'll do yoga, meditation really, really, and I, Oh, I'm jet lagged. I have traveled all the way from India. It's, and I've, I've done Orlando and I've come, I've come here, I've done an event last night. A baby slept like seven hours. But uh, I got up and I just went out in the open and I just did a couple of breathing exercises and I'm good to go.

Speaker 1:          21:23          Fantastic. So would you lead us through a practice and make us do that? I got one more thing for you. We can't have Shilpa shatty here and not do a little phone card. That's like having Michael Jordan here and we'll slam dunk. So teach us how to do the Tem Cup. Oh, can we have some music? Be Embarrassing for all of the respect that I bought. It's only on Youtube. So only a billion people will be watching it.

Speaker 3:          21:58          Yeah. Lovely. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:02          All right, so everybody stand up. We need music. Yeah, he's actually, he's playing some music for us on this.

Speaker 2:          22:12          Okay.

Speaker 5:          22:17          How do we do this? Go. Okay. This is out of my faucet. Yeah. I thought this office is, that'd be one thing, but what's occupants? We did a few more people joining you, right? How many people want to dance with you? If I said it took crime?

Speaker 3:          23:07          Come on to your sites. Get onto your site and now come up.

Speaker 2:          23:12          Yeah, sit up.

Speaker 3:          23:15          Yeah. We can all sit in Sukhasana. Okay. If y'all don't know what that means, just one leg up. Still Cost Center. So comedians happiness. So it's the Austin of happiness. When you order this us center, the entire concentration is on your core. That's where all our strength lies. Our core.

Speaker 2:          23:42          Oh,

Speaker 4:          23:46          what is [inaudible]? Most importantly, before we start, for all those people who don't know the meaning of [inaudible], Purana means life. And Yama means control. So the god of death is called Yama cause he could draw his life. So Proud Ima actually is the control of your life force, which happens to breadth. So when they see a in your breadth, you all controlling your mind through that ad. When your mind is in control, there's nothing that you cannot achieve in life. So most importantly, while most blood, we need such fast paced lives, even if we don't get the time to do all the Asanas, if we just get the time to just do a few bright I umas, it takes 10 minutes. I have 10 minutes. Can actually, Elaine can actually align your mind, body, and soul. What would life would be so worth living? So we'll start off with the simple technique of just inhaling and exhaling through your nose, okay? When you inhale, let your chest open out, okay. Okay. And Yada withdraw. They say this is a Moodra of width. Wisdom. Your heart and your mind are aligned on your knees. Taking a deep breath.

I, I'll be RP that I use it. Do you not do this? He's far more loaded than me. He's been doing yoga for so much, so much time. [inaudible] like if you can be in an Austin now for more than an hour and a half, you like Judy going to teen Cindy, you become a true Yogi. If you can be in a post for three hours.

So one way to get a feel as police, your right hand on your abdomen, meaning see it forcefully, just policemen, sports. I'm thinking, Holy Shit. You can just let it naturally. Then you'd do a CV.

I'm down with a bad cool takes to San Francisco. I was out last night, but I'll, this is a great way to cleanse your, your brain to oxygenate your lungs all. You suddenly start feeling a glow on your face when you continue with this practice for maybe a month. If you do it every day, these three parameters, if you can do everyday or maybe four times a week, you will see the difference that it will have in your life on your life. So I always see that fitness is like a marriage. You can't cheat on it and expect it to work. So you have to give it some amount of your time, commitment and love. So do you want to continue? Should we do go into Shavasana? Awesome. Yeah, you tell me it's in a mascot. We're going to be too difficult for them. It's like, Dude,

Yeah, just every part is like, it's like a dog yard. Just, yeah, just, just warm your body up. Yeah. Just kick your legs around. We'll just do the next rotation cause it's very important to warm up. I cannot be more emphasis on warmups or never do. I'll never get into a regime or an exercise routine without a warmup. So you just look to your right first center slowly to the left center. Look straight up. Try and go as behind as you can stretch your neck and you come down the same way. Try to touch your chin to your chest, right in the center. Straight ahead. Rotate your neck. Now three times looking towards your right. Come to the center three times on the opposite side. I'll be going to thought Asana. Okay. Are you standing like a tree?
