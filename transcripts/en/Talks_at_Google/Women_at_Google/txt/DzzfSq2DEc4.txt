Speaker 1:          00:00:06       So welcome everyone. Our speaker today, this is the first time she has missed a very special engagement. Uh, and that is the Vancouver Ukulele circle. So Stephanie Gray is actually an avid Ukulele player, but in addition to that, uh, she is a Canadian who has spent more than 15 years giving over 800 talks and debates as well as hundreds of media interviews on abortion to diverse audiences in the United States, Canada, Australia, Latvia, England, Ireland, Costa Rica, and Guatemala in university settings. She has debated Dr Fraser fellows, a late term abortionist, Ron Fitzsimmons, then executive director of the national coalition of abortion providers, Elizabeth Kevin Dash a then legal director for Naral pro choice America and doctor Malcolm pots, the first medical director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Uh, she's the author of love unleashes life, uh, abortion and the art of communicating truth. And we have copies of her book available, uh, for a subsidized price of $5. So if you're interested, come and, uh, buy a copy after the talk. So with no further delay, I will introduce Ms. Stephanie Gray.

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       Thank you. It's wonderful to be here. I love asking questions. In fact, I have a friend who has nicknamed me inquisitive Stephanie, and in my vast travels around the world, I have asked a lot of people the following question, who inspires you? And whenever someone answers that question for me, I then follow it up with why. And here's what I've discovered. Very often there are different answers for who inspires the individuals I've encountered, but I've begun to notice a trend, a theme when it comes to why certain individuals inspire us and as I have asked people for the reasons for why certain people inspire them, what I've discovered is it seems generally the people who are inspiring have suffered in some way or they face some sort of obstacle or some sort of challenge or some sort of difficulty. And what sets them apart from those who don't inspire is how they respond to their suffering.

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       To the challenge to the difficulty and what I've noticed this trend is that it seems inspiring. People in the face of obstacles and suffering and difficulty have at least three qualities in common. They put others ahead of themselves, they have perspective and they do the right thing. Even when it's hard, you do the right thing even when it's hard. And so what I wanted to do today was look at each of those qualities in more detail and relate them to the very controversial topic of abortion and a particular, I want to share with you various conversations and encounters I have had with people of all different backgrounds and viewpoints when it comes to abortion and how I have been able to use those three qualities and show how they align very much with the perspective that I hold, which is the prolife perspective. When it comes to that first quality that of putting others ahead of ourselves, I would suggest that regardless of someone's political persuasion, love is universally attractive.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       It is universally magnetic, and ultimately that's what putting others ahead of ourself is. That's what love is. It's willing. The others good. And I would suggest that again, regardless of our political persuasion, each individual has a battle internally between times where they put others ahead of themselves and times where they don't put others ahead of themselves. I was once debating with a college student in Florida a few years ago and we were debating on the topic of abortion and in our conversation, I'll admit, I was thinking to myself, he sounds selfish now. Perhaps I could identify that so readily because I knew that there were many times I have been selfish. In fact, I can think of a time recently on one of my frequent flights, I had settled into my seat and there was one empty seat next to me and sure enough that passenger came along to sit down and as she was coming down the aisle, she was talking with someone else and it was very clear that they were traveling together and it was very clear that the person she was with was further at the back of the plane and this thought entered my head, I should offer my seat.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       That would be nice. I'm traveling alone. I can take her friends seats so they can sit next to each other. But then I thought to myself, I don't like sitting near the back of the plane and I don't feel like getting up. And so I didn't offer my seat and I have to admit later that day I was kind of reflecting on my day and I regretted that decision of inaction and I thought that was selfish. And my overarching thought was if I move, how will this impact me? That's self interested instead of if I move, how will this impact them? That's other oriented. So I recognize that weakness within me and that that wasn't attractive. The attractive quality is the one that is other oriented. So I bring that up, taking us now back to my encounter with his college student talking about abortion, where he sounded selfish and I was thinking to myself, even though I have made selfish choices, even though he sounds selfish, I believe deep down we're all drawn to selflessness.

Speaker 2:          00:05:49       How can I draw this out of him? And besides loving questions, I also love stories and as it should happen as I was with a student, a story came to my mind that I had read about in the news. The year was 2012 that this student and I were talking and around that time there had been that Costa Concordia cruise ship accident where the cruise ship had been steered a little too close to shore on you're an Italian village and uh, hit ground and sank and people lost their lives. And so I said to this student that I was dialoguing with, do you remember hearing about that on the news? You said yes. And I said, that made international attention. And I said it drew international attention, not just because it was a major passenger vehicle that had an accident, not just because people died, but there was another element to this story that shocked people around the world. Who remembers what it was.

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       Anyway,

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       the captain left the ship and that's what the students said to me. He answered my question about this story by saying, well, the captain abandoned ship. Now, apparently the captain says the the ship fell over and he fell into a a boat. But the point was, the news had been reporting it this way. And so the student remembered that. So then I said to him, and how did our world respond? Did our world respond by saying, Hey, that was a really brilliant choice of that captain, or did our world respond by saying, how could he have done that? And he said, well, it was the ladder. Our world was saddened by that kind of reaction. Studies it, let's contrast that captain with another captain. None of a cruise ship but of an airplane. And I said to this student a few years ago, now, this was many years ago now, but back in 2012 a few years prior to that, in 2009 there had been a US airways plane that had taken off from Laguardia when my country of Canada got in the way.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       We have these really annoying Canadian geese and I don't know if they make their way down here, but they certainly made their way to New York. And so there was a whole flock of Canadian geese that were flying around the exact same flight pattern as this us airways flight. And so I said to the student, you know is this plane was taking off and these Canadian geese were flying nearby. They got sucked into the engines of the airplane and it caused immediate engine failure. Do you remember that? I said to the student, he said, yes, I do. I said, the captain of that airplane Chesley Sullenberger realized that he needed to make an emergency landing because if he didn't control the landing, the plane was going to crash with a dual engine failure. And he realized he could not get back to LaGuardia. You couldn't get to Teterboro or any of the other surrounding airports.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       And so we thought, I'm going to try to do a water landing. And he managed to safely land that US airways plane on the Hudson River in what became known as the miracle on the Hudson. And I said to the student, when that plane came to a stop and everyone inside would have gone to the nearest exit to get off, that meant the people at the back of the plane would have gone to the back exit. But one of the first people to get to the back door didn't realize that the tail of the airplane was tucked in the water. So when they whipped that door open, the Hudson River starts flooding into this airplane. So I said to the student, now everyone is getting away from the back of the plane and they're escaping out the middle doors and the front doors and they're getting off except for one person, Captain Chesley Sullenberger as everyone's getting off and away from the back, he's staying on and walking towards the back and his water was filling the cabinet about waist level.

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       He walked the aisle, not just once, but twice to make sure no one was left on the plane and he was the last person to get off. What did our world say about him? I asked this student and he said, a hero. Correct? I said, why? And he said, well, because he had dependent passengers and he cared for them. He prioritize their needs. He put them ahead of himself and I said, do you think that's an example we should follow? He said, yes, and so I knew by his reaction to that story that he shared the view I have that even if we sometimes fail and being other oriented, we know that that's how we ought to be and that's the example to follow. And so once we can establish that, I then brought it back to the topic of abortion that we were debating and I said, if you agree that it was correct for the, the the pilot to put the passengers ahead of himself to prioritize the needs of his dependence, then wouldn't it follow that when it comes to the topic of abortion and an unplanned pregnancy that a pregnant woman ought to prioritize the needs of her dependent her preborn child, much like a passenger on the airplane who's in a vulnerable position and need someone who's more skilled and older and capable of helping them to help them out.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       Now, some people respond by saying, well wait, there's a big difference there. You're comparing apples to oranges, the people getting off of the airplane, those passengers, we're human beings, embryos and fetuses aren't, so you can't make that comparison. And I would suggest that that comparison is valid or invalid depending on indeed whether embryos and fetuses are human beings like the passengers on the airplane. And so in my work I often wrestle with that question in conversations with people trying to discern when does life begin? And a good question because remembering I love questions. A good question that I'll often ask people is this, do you believe in human rights? And I can tell you I have asked that question around the world and consistently I get one answer. Yes. And if someone believes in human rights, I then like to say, okay, well what about this human's rights in the case of this seven week embryo?

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       Now sometimes people will look at an image like that and say that's not a human. And if that's someone's reaction than in conversation, I think rather than preaching at an individual, a good strategy to take is to just ask a question. And the question I like to ask is, what are her parents? Is the pregnant woman human? Is Her partner human? If yes, wouldn't it logically follow that their offspring must be of the same species? So then someone might object and say, well, even if biologically that's human, it's not alive. Well, I found myself in a conversation with another college student a few years ago and I asked him what he thought about abortion. He said, I'm pro choice. I said, why are you pro choice? And he said, well, because the fetus isn't alive. And so I just asked another question. If the fetus isn't alive, why do you need to do an abortion?

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       And he stopped and he looked at me and he said, I'm going to talk to you. I never thought of it that way. And so we spent about 30 minutes engaging in a friendly civil dialogue as a result of a question. If someone objects to the idea that the embryo was alive. I think another good question to ask is this, is the embryo growing at moment of fertilization when you have a one celled embryo, is that one cell growing into two and are those two growing into four and eight and 16 and so forth. And if yes, when it followed by virtue of the embryos growth, the embryo must be living and if the embryo has human parents, wouldn't it follow by virtue of that that the embryo must be human. And if we believe in human rights, then wouldn't it follow what we know to be a living human has the same human rights as you or me.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       Now someone might objected that point and say, but it's just a fetus or it's just an embryo. And so I think a good question to ask that I've asked many people is this, what kind of fetus I think about that term for moment fetus, that's not species specific. So other species have fetuses, a dogs, if he does his dolphins of fetuses and humans have fetuses. So the word fetus doesn't so much tell us what something is but tells us how old something is. So again, with my love of questions, I'll often ask people, when a fetus is born to human parents and is in the arms of the mother, what do we now call the fetus at that moment? And people will say, well, a baby. And, and then when the baby turns two, what do we call the baby? I'll ask. And toddler is what people say.

Speaker 2:          00:14:19       And then when the toddler turns 13, what do we call the toddler? I was once giving a talk and elderly woman piped up. Impossible. That's what we call that individual. And then when possible turns 21, what do we call impossible. Even more impossible, right? So the point is that we humans have words to refer to age ranges within our species. And so the words adult or teenager, toddler, baby, fetus and embryo, simply tell us how old an entity is not what an entity is. If we want to know what that entity is, we have to ask what are the parents. Now when it comes to the abortion debate, one, one thing that I have found, um, that provokes a lot of conversation is defining the exact moment the fetus or the embryo came to be. And a lot of times we as a culture will resist the idea that when debating abortion, that life would begin at fertilization.

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       And so what I'd like to suggest is that if we weren't talking about abortion, we as a society would more readily accept that life begins at fertilization. In fact, we already do. And a good question to consider involves this, this, this, uh, the following. Uh, imagine someone is not pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy. Imagine they're trying to achieve a pregnancy, they desperately want to be pregnant, but they're struggling with infertility. So imagine this person goes to an infertility specialist and that physician recommends in vitro fertilization or IVF where sperm will be an egg will be fertilized by a sperm in a petri dish in a lab. Now setting aside the ethics of that, which could be a whole other group talk at Google, a setting aside the ethics, ethics of that. Imagine the individual then goes to an IVF specialist. Have we as a society ever heard someone who's in the business of making life, someone who's an IVF specialist and we ever heard them say, I just don't know when life begins.

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       If you think about it, when someone is in the business of making life, we never claimed to not know when it begins. We know exactly when it begets. The one moment that the IVF specialist is trying to replicate in the lab is the moment of fertilization. The IVF specialist is not happy with just a sperm sample. They're not happy with eggs harvested by, uh, perhaps, uh, a student in debt trying to get 10 or $20,000 for such a procedure. They're not satisfied with just the eggs are just the sperm. The one moment they're trying to create in the lab is not, you know, uh, three weeks where you have a heartbeat or six weeks where you have brainwaves or a nine months just aided fetus. The one moment the IVF specialist is trying to create in the lab is the moment of fertilization, which I think tells us we do know when life begins.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       We know it begins there particularly when we think about other species a little less controversial than our own. We never hear horse breeders say, I just don't know how to breed a horse. I don't know when a horse becomes a horse or you know someone who's, you know, breeding dogs or have a veterinarian and general saying, I don't know when a dog becomes a dog with other species. We have great clarity. So why with our own species when it comes to abortion, do we claim to not know when life begins or we claim that that it's confusing when with these other species or this other topic like IVF, we have great clarity and we know that moment to be fertilization. When it comes to the debate about abortion, what I have found in debating people formally and informally all over the world is that it's less of a scientific debate and more of a philosophical one.

Speaker 2:          00:18:01       Less a question of when does life begin? Because really we know the answer to that fertilization. But more question about personhood, which is not really a scientific discussion but a philosophical one. And there's a whole school of thought by a philosopher, Peter Singer from Princeton University who argues abortion, um, is justified and he even argue some infanticide would be justified. His School of thought comes from the perspective of a definition of personhood that would exclude preborn and some born children and he would say a person is someone who is rational, conscious and self aware. And so I, I have encountered people and perhaps some of the room today, some, some listening in who would argue that even if biologically the embryo and the fetus are human, that philosophically they're not persons. And that's why we could justify abortion. That's why we wouldn't have to protect embryos and fetuses the way it was.

Speaker 2:          00:18:58       Good for Captain Sullenberger to protect the passengers on the airplane because there are people but embryos and fetuses aren't. So then the question we have to wrestle with is what is the right definition of a person? Is a person, someone who's rational, conscious and self aware. So that if you're not those things, you're not a person. Well, what I like to do is ask the question, why isn't, let's say a one celled human embryo at fertilization. Why isn't that embryo rational, conscious herself aware. I think we know the answer to that is, well the embryo is lacking the Oregon necessary to be rational, conscious and self aware and that's the brain. So then we, if we step back from and say, well why? Why doesn't the embryo at fertilization have a brain? We know the answer that will, the embryo is the embryo hasn't had time to develop.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       The brain in time is reflected in our age. So the one celled human embryo, yes, isn't rational conscious herself aware in that moment but ultimately isn't able to do those things or be that way because of how old she is. Now let's contrast that with let's say an Amoeba. The AMOEBA is not rational. Conscious herself aware. Why? Well because the Amoeba doesn't have a brain. Well why doesn't the Amoeba have a brain? Not because it hasn't developed it yet, but because it's not within its nature to develop a brain. Because it's not within its nature to be a thinking thing. So in other words, and Amoeba is not rational conscious or self aware because of what it is versus a human embryo who is not rational, conscious or self aware because of how old she is. So then that brings me back to the question about human rights.

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       Who gets human rights isn't the necessary criteria simply being human. If we were talking for example about women's rights, the necessary criteria for getting the right would be being a woman. If we were to talk about children's rights, the necessary criteria would be being a child. So when we talk about human rights, the necessary criteria simply is being human, not being human in a certain age. And so the question is, should personhood be grounded in how old we are or should personhood be grounded in what we are? Well, to answer that question, I find it helpful to go to the United Nations. The United Nations has a number of different documents on human rights. And as I have read these, I've been astounded by several things that have stood out to me. The first is that in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that a is a document by the United Nations. It very clearly says all members of the human family have the right to life.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       So in other words, to get the right to life, all that matters is that you're a member of the human family. But that document does reference persons and it referenced persons, references persons. In article six in an article six of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it says everyone has a right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. Well, let's define our terms, who's everyone? Earlier in the document and the preamble, everyone's defined as all members of the human family. So this document is essentially declaring if you're a member of the human family, you should automatically be considered a person. Now to understand why the UN would say that, I think we need to put that document into context for and understand the history of how it came to be. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in the late 1940s of course we know when the early 1940s we had the Holocaust where what happened?

Speaker 2:          00:22:40       Some humans were deprived of personhood status based on some feature about them, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and so the UN comes up with this document to say no. The one thing we all have in common is our human nature and to ensure that we don't repeat the injustices of the past. It codifies, it puts in writing this idea that if you're a member of the human family, you ought to automatically be considered a person and you should not be deprived of your personhood rights based on some quality like ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and in the same way, if that's true, then we ought to say the same thing about what we know to be a human embryo in a human fetus. The quality of age shouldn't be the basis for which someone has personhood status and therefore they ought to be considered persons according to article six, by virtue of being human, not by virtue of being a certain age that enables them as a result of their age to be rational, conscious and self aware in that moment their is what is consistent as their age and therefore abilities change.

Speaker 2:          00:23:50       If you think about the question, when do we become persons? I think what's helpful is to look at the timeline from the moment of fertilization to the moment of birth. And if we draw the line anywhere after fertilization, we're ultimately basing it based on a developmental stage or based on an age which would fly in the face of human rights doctrines which aren't to uh, acknowledge human rights based on abilities or aid. But instead of knowledge, human rights based on being human. And we know at the moment of fertilization, but oneself embryo has all the genetic material distinguishing her from the mother and the father. And from that point forward, you're going to change your appearance. You're going to change your abilities, you're going to change your age, but you're human identity distinguishing you from everyone else is going to be what remains the same as I have dialogue with a lot of people over the years.

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       Not only have I found the question of personhood being raised in conversation, but I have also found the question of the dependency of the pre born child being used as grounds to justify abortion. Where some people will say, look, if if someone has an infant and they don't want the infant, any of us in the room are capable of caring for the infant, but if someone doesn't want their fetus, none of us in the room are capable of caring for the fetus. Therefore a woman should have a right to have an abortion. When I hear that argument, what crosses my mind is does the greater dependency of the fetus make the mother less responsible or more responsible? Well, I found myself in conversation a few years ago with a different student and this young woman said to me, look, if you have a baby in one hand and a fetus and the other hand you obviously pick the baby.

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       And I thought to myself for a moment about babies versus fetuses. As it just said a moment ago, you know, if there was a baby in this room napping, we could all leave and come back and the baby would be fine. But if there was a fetus left out on the podium here and we all leave and come back, the fetus is going to be dead. So I thought in a sense, babies are stronger and fetuses are weaker in relation to each other. So I thought what, what the student actually said to me, although she didn't verbalize it, was this, if you have a strong person in one hand and you have a weaker or person in the other hand, you obviously pick the stronger person. And when I kind of translated in my mind what she'd said to that, I thought to myself, you don't, civil societies actually do just the opposite.

Speaker 2:          00:26:27       We tend to prioritize weaker people rather than stronger people. Again, the captain prioritizes the passengers are ought to and so forth. And so I thought to myself, how do I communicate that I think civil societies actually would prioritize weaker people ahead of stronger people and as it should happen, a story came to my mind. And again, as I said, I love telling stories is the story that came to my mind, uh, relates to this. And so I said to the student, what you just said about babies versus fetuses. Reminds me of a picture of my friend posted on Facebook and I said it was a picture of a river and in the middle of the river was something slightly curvy sticking up. And in reality it was the kind of picture that I would keep swiping away if it hadn't been for the caption. And the caption my friend posted with this picture was this, my husband is a hero.

Speaker 2:          00:27:18       And then my friend went on to explain why as I then explained to the student. My friend wrote, my husband is a paramedic and is it at midnight he was called to the scene of a car accident. A woman had been driving down the road. She lost control of her vehicle and is it spun out of control. It landed in a nearby river. When my friend's husband got to the scene, he saw that that woman driver was sitting on the roof of her sinking car, holding her 10 month old baby in her arms. My friend's husband jumps in the water, swims towards the car and then realizes he can only take one person at a time to shore. I looked at the student I was dialoguing with and I asked her a question, who do you think he picked first? Obviously she knew the answer.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       Will the baby correct? I said, why? If you had to explain the reasoning why he picked the baby over the mob to take first, what would it be? She said, well obviously, cause if he picked the mom first, then by the time he got back to the car, the baby could have rolled in the water and drowned. Correct. I said, so would you say it's fair to summarize your response to this story by acknowledging that you believe when you have a strong person in one hand, like the mom and a weaker person in the other hand, like the baby, that we ought to prioritize the needs of weaker people? She said, of course. And then I brought it back to her original point about babies versus fetuses. And I said anyone could care for a baby and a baby could be left alone for a while, but only one person can care for a fetus and cannot be left alone.

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       So in a sense the baby is stronger like the mom in the story, whereas the fetus is weaker like the infant in the mom's arms. And since you believe that we should prioritize weaker and more vulnerable people ahead of stronger people than shouldn't we actually prioritize the needs of the preborn trialed. That point was something that was emphasized very clearly in a different encounter that I had through what someone shared with me. I was once at an exhibit that was looking at parallels between historical injustices and present Dan justices. One of the parallels being the Rwandan genocide and abortion, the argument being that at the time the Tutsis were slaughtered, they weren't deemed to be equal to the WHO to extremists but rather inferior and because they were deemed to be inferior, the dehumanizing actions were justified. The parallel then being that someone generally who supports abortion does not say I think embryos and fetuses are equal to us and I want to kill not at all, but instead deem the embryo and fetus to be inferior and therefore rationalizes actions which would take away that human's rights because they don't consider them equal the argument than being if we were wrong in the past about dehumanizing one group of humans, could we be wrong in the present about dehumanizing and other group of humans.

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       So one of the signs that this exhibit that I was standing with was this one and a woman came past and stopped and began to speak with me and she told me that she was from Rwanda and she told me that most of her family had been killed in the genocide from the mid nineties and I will admit I became very self conscious standing representing this sign because I began to wonder if perhaps this woman would be offended by the comparison that I was making, but instead of assuming and wondering, I thought the best thing I can do is seek to understand and ask her a question. And so I looked at this woman and I said, given all you have told me about the brutality that your family were, your family members were victims of what you just barely escaped by fleeing the country before things got really bad. How do you feel? I said about this comparison I'm making. And she stepped back and she moved her gaze really for me, she hadn't really looked that closely at the picture and then she just stood in silence for about 20 seconds. Is she looked at this poster

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       and then finally she pointed to the picture of the abort a child and she said, that's worse because at least my family could try to run away. This woman recognized the greater, uh, humans vulnerability,

Speaker 2:          00:31:56       the greater another's responsibility to wards that well. So if we think about that, that first quality that I have identified, that inspiring people seem to have, that people I've dialogued with have shared with me. It is the idea that we ought to put others ahead of ourselves even when we failed. We know deep down that that's something to aspire towards and it's clear that the human embryo and fetus are an other, just like the passengers in the airplane. The next point that I wanted to address today is the second quality. I have found an inspiring people, which is that they have perspective. One of my favorite authors is Doctor Victor Frankl who has written the book man's search for meaning. I love books and I love gifting books to other people. And Man, search for meaning is probably one the leading book that I have given to a lot of people.

Speaker 2:          00:32:56       The other one would be essential ism. Bye Bye Greg Kanaan, which is a phenomenal book, but not what I'm here to talk about right now. But man, search for meaning I've given away to so many people. And this book was written by a man who was a holocaust survivor and a psychiatrist. And so man, search for meaning is really a two part book. The first part is about his experiences in the concentration camps. And the second part of his book is his theories in psychology. And one of the points that he makes in his book is the following. He said that he observed both as a prisoner and as a psychiatrist who in a sense as a prisoner, was studying human behavior as he was being victimized in, in the concentration camps. One of the things he observed is that he would have expected all of the guards to be cruel and most of them were.

Speaker 2:          00:33:39       But he said every now and then, surprisingly amidst all the cruel guards, there was someone who was kind and then he said amongst the prisoners, there were some who when treated like animals became like animals and were cruel to their fellow prisoners. But there were others, he said regardless of how brutally they were treated, maintained their humanity and in they're starving state would, would save morsels of food, not for themselves, but for a fellow prisoner. And when Doctor Frankel makes this observation, it draws him to this conclusion. Someone can have a similar experience but still choose a different response to the experience. And he says, the last of the human freedoms that can never be taken from us is the freedom to choose how to respond to the situation that we're in. That is what perspective is inspired. People who have perspective can be in a horrible circumstance in a sense beyond their control.

Speaker 2:          00:34:46       But the recognize what is still within their control is their response to that circumstance is their attitude. And Doctor Frankl has come up with a mathematical equation that explains the power of perspective because in the concentration camps he saw a lot of suffering, suffering that was so bad that some people sought to commit suicide because they despaired. And Doctor Frankel said early on in his, in his time at the concentration camps, he decided he would never kill himself. Moreover would he not commit suicide. But he was going to try to dissuade his fellow prisoners from doing that. And he discovered the way to try to convince them not to despair was to help them find meaning. And so his mathematical equation was this d equals s minus m despair is suffering without meaning. He recognized in the present circumstances removing the suffering was near impossible,

Speaker 2:          00:35:47       but he could decrease despair to the extent that he increased meaning and Dr. Franco years after coming out of the concentration camps sites and example, where where this equation in a sense was brought to life with a young teenager, he learned about in Texas who had become a quadriplegic. Lot of times when people are asked, you know, imagine if you were suddenly paralyzed, would you want to keep living? And when we're not in that state, we think, no I wouldn't. Well, Dr. Franco sites and example of someone who found herself not being asked that question in a hypothetical, but that was reality. She became quadriplegic. She would spend her days watching the news, reading the news, and whenever she came across a story of someone who is going through a very difficult time of someone who was suffering in some way, she would ask an assistant to bring a stick and place it in her mouth. She would then use that stick bend over to press keys on a keyboard so she could write letters of encouragement to the people she'd read about in the news. And Doctor Frankel said, her life is filled with an abundant sense of meaning.

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       We decreased despair in the presence of suffering to the extent we increase meaning. That's what I mean by perspective. I saw the power of perspective up close and personally a few years ago when I had the privilege of spending an afternoon with this young man, Nick Wojciech, how many of you have heard of this motivational speaker? I did a quick Google search as to whether, um, you had a toxic Google with nick for Trish and I don't think you have. So I highly recommended this guy's hilarious. So it helps that he has an accent. He's from Australia. I just think accents are cool and uh, uh, but he's really funny. So anyways, I know someone who knows someone who knows nick and um, he was coming to the city. I used to live in, in Canada, in Calgary. And so I thought I got to try and meet this guy because I talk about his story so often.

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       So sure enough, he was a willing to meet with me and my colleagues and we surprised my colleagues with him. They didn't know that he was coming and they all knew his story. So when he came to the office, they were shocked like there was no way this isn't you. And then nick looks at everyone, he goes, I'm not nik void church. I'm his stunt double. So anyways, nick is a funny guy. He lives a full life. He loves traveling the world, speaking to millions of people and inspiring them, getting access to audiences I could only dream of Getty access to. And it's because of what he doesn't have. It's because of his lack of limps. He at this disability as an opportunity, but he didn't always have that attitude. He didn't always have that perspective. When Nick was a child, he was bullied and taunted and made fun of so much that one night while lying in the family bathtub, he thought about rolling over and drowning himself in an act of suicide.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       Now. He obviously didn't do that, but what's also obvious is that his circumstances didn't change. He still lacks the LIMS now that he lacked in that bathtub. So what's changed his perspective? Instead of thinking about what his lack of limbs prevents him from doing, he started to think about what his lack of limbs and enabled him to do. The afternoon I spent with him, I spent also with another family. He had invited along and that family included this two year old girl Brooke, and as you can see, Brooke doesn't have arms. Nick's lack of limbs was not diagnosed in Utero by ultrasound. It was only discovered when he was born. Brooks lack of limbs, her lack of arms on the other hand was discovered while her mom was pregnant via ultrasound and when the mom went for a routine ultrasound and they saw the fetus didn't have arms, the doctors offered to do an abortion.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       Brooke's parents said no, they didn't have a smartphone at the time. So they went home. And where do you think they went? Kugel. I've told this story so much, but I have to say I've never told it at Google. So I think that's really cool. So uh, they went onto Google and they typed no arms enter and the first hit was Neva Boyd change and they spent the rest of that pregnancy looking at videos of someone who was like their daughter. And then an opportunity came two years after she was born for them to drive eight hours through the mountains from British Columbia to Alberta in western Canada to see in the flash someone who looked like their daughter. And when I saw nick and Brooke Interact, I thought he is uniquely positioned to motivate and Inspire Brooke in a way her parents can't, in a way her sister can't, in a way, none of us could. And it's because of what he doesn't have. His obstacle is now his opportunity. That's the power of perspective. I think that can be then obviously related to the abortion discussion. How can we change our perspective in an unplanned crisis situation? In another occasion where I was on a college campus, a student came to the microphone and said, my stepmom had an abortion because she was told her fetus was going to die at birth. Are you telling me she was wrong?

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       And I first expressed sympathy to the students saying that I was sorry for the suffering that his stepmom went through and I don't pretend to know what that must've been like and I said to him, you're a question is a fair one and I'm going to answer it, but I said, if you'll bear with me, I believe I can best address your question by engaging you in a dialogue by asking you some questions. Would that be okay? He said, sure. I said, okay, well the question I have for you actually involve setting aside the abortion topic for just a moment and entering into a thought experiment. I said, I want you to imagine that someone you love dearly on the opposite end of the country calls you, calls you today and says, I've just been diagnosed with cancer and I've been given four weeks left to live.

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       I looked at this student and I said, would you wait until week three, day six to hop on a plane and go say goodbye to the person you love or I said, would you take the next flight out and savor every moment of every day of the next four weeks with the person you love? And he said, well, the second option. I said, me too, and here's what I think this says about us. What do you think it says about us is we recognize when we have a minimal amount of time left with someone we love, we want to maximize the minimal time. We don't want to cut short the already short time we have that's perspective. So I said, let's take that principle, that perspective and let's apply it to the situation your stepmom found herself in before that poor prenatal diagnosis. She probably thought she had 50 years with her child and in one moment of hearing that news, your baby's going to die at birth.

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       She went from having 50 years to roughly 20 weeks. I said, based on your analysis of the thought experiment, why would we cut short the already short time we have left instead? Wouldn't we want to savor every moment of every day of the next 20 weeks with a child that we love now upon the birth happening in the trial dying? Would there be sorrow, grief? Absolutely. But if you have the abortion and you want it to be pregnant with there be sorrow and grief. Yes. So having the abortion instead of carrying on 20 more weeks is not going to spare sadness, but it will rob you of the gift of time. And that's again where we want the power of perspective. The final point that I wanted to address this morning was that quality of, of inspiring people, which is to do the right thing even when it's hard.

Speaker 2:          00:44:08       If you think about it, that fits with your code of conduct. I know you have a slogan here of don't be evil. And when alphabet came to be, it came and got a little broader, uh, to do the right thing. But we know that we should do the right thing even when it's hard. And I think that's relevant in the abortion discussion. If we think for a moment about the circumstances that a pregnant woman could be in, and if we think about the reasons that were prompt someone to have an abortion, we can acknowledge this is hard. Magine being pregnant from a rape and being in poverty, having health problems, uh, just not wanting the child or being really young, having no support in each of these situations. What, wherever someone sits on the abortion debate, what side of the fence they're on, there's agreement to be pregnant and port be hard to be pregnant and young would be hard to be pregnant from rape would be excrutiatingly difficult.

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       There's no denying the difficulty in these circumstances. The question is what ought we do when circumstances are hard? Well, let's imagine the circumstances are these, but not with a pregnant person, but someone who's parenting this born child. Would it be easy or hard to take care of this child and poverty hard? It would be easy or hard to to care for this child and be 14 hard. Would it be easy or hard to parent this child knowing every day you look in her face, you're reminded her father was a rapist. It would be hard. Would we ever allow someone to end this child's life because the circumstances for the parent

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       or heart wouldn't.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       We would say we need to do the right thing even when it's hard. And so I would suggest in the various encounters I've had that we, that we have the same attitude when it comes to this life. Since we know this is a living human being who according to article six of the UN ought to be considered a person who's simply younger than the rest of us. And since human rights aren't grounded in age, they're grounded and being human, then we ought to say, here is we say there we have to do the right thing even when it's hard. And that brings to mind several people I've had the privilege of meeting who I believe by their stories have inspired me to do the right thing when it's hard in my own life, the way they've done that. And there's a few months ago I spoke in Guatemala and I spoke alongside another speaker.

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       Uh, my friend here Lyanna Lyanna and I met for the first time in Guatemala. She speaks both spink Spanglish, she speaks English and Spanish. I on the other hand, only speak English. And so I had a translator translate for the audience by talk, but because she's spoken Spanish, that meant when she gave her talk I couldn't understand it. So it wasn't until we got to the restaurant after giving our first presentation in, uh, in, in the hotel, we were staying in that evening that we shared our stories and got to know each other. And as we were talking, she mentioned that she was 37 and I said, no way, I'm 36. And then a short while later she mentioned that she had a daughter. And I said, well, how old is your daughter? And she said 25

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       and then I did the math and I thought 25 years ago I was 11 which means 25 years ago, Leanna was 12 and Leanna told me her story that growing up in Mexico City when she was 12 one day, two men kidnapped her, held her for two days and brutally raped her. She got pregnant from that rape and when she went to the doctor and discovered this, the doctors offered her an abortion and Leanna asked the doctors if abortion would help her forget the rape if it would help ease her pain and suffering. And the doctor said, well no it won't do that. And she realized in that moment that if ending her baby's life wouldn't benefit anybody, she wasn't going to do it. And Leanna said if abortion wasn't going to heal anything, I didn't see the point. She said, I just knew I had somebody inside my body.

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       I never thought about who her biological father wise, she was my kid, she was inside of me and just knowing she needed me made me want to get a job to help her. But in an interview Leanna did. She shared that although that was her attitude about the pregnancy, the rape itself caused her life to become a living hell. No matter how many times she showered, she could not get rid of the feeling that she was dirty. And so she started to entertain thoughts or she thought about committing suicide. But when she thought about committing suicide, she remembered she was pregnant and she had to think not only about herself but about the child. And so she didn't kill herself. And she looked at me in that restaurant in Guatemala and she said to me, Stephanie, I saved my daughter's life, but she saved mine.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       In another story of an inspiring person I've met who I believe brings this third principle to life, I'm reminded of a young woman by the name of Veronica who was a college student who got pregnant unexpectedly. And um, her boyfriend wanted her to have an abortion and her friends wanted her to have an abortion, but she ended up telling her parents and moving back home and getting support. And she sent me this picture of her and her daughter, Emilia. And I'd like to read for you what she said to me when she sent this picture. She said, the picture I've enclosed of Amelia, and I doesn't fully show my face, but it's an important picture to me. Emilia became very ill with respiratory problems around seven months, which meant a lot of nights dealing with fever, congestion, pain control, and a sad little baby who kept waking up due to having trouble breathing in her sleep. She said, I took this picture one night when I decided to let her sleep on my chest instead of the crib and she slept throughout the night. And so I did that every night until she was better. And she said to me, it represents what we do as mothers, that we stop looking at ourselves as individuals with needs. And instead we begin to look at how we can serve another and therefore love another. And with doing that she said comes learning to love ourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       And finally I'm reminded of my friend Debbie. Debbie's story is similar to Leanna's in Veronica Veronica's in that she was unexpectedly pregnant, but unlike Leanna's and Veronica's story, Debbie had an abortion. And she deeply regrets having made that choice but realizes like all of us, she cannot undo her past. But you came convicted that if she had regrets and she knew the impact of her choice back then, that she lives with now, that she would have wanted someone to tell their story. And so she's decided to tell her story to try to help people think differently when it comes to the crisis they're in. And so she travels to different audiences and she talks about her choice and she talks about regretting it. And once she was in an audience where a student had a friend on route to an abortion clinic and he's simply sent his friend a text, there's a woman here who regrets her abortion.

Speaker 2:          00:51:30       And the friend texted back why? And so this young woman was willing to sit down with Debbie and listen to not only Debbie story, but give Debbie and opportunity to listen to her and what her reasonings were for abortion. And she felt she had no support, that she couldn't get through that pregnancy and parenting. So Debbie said, all support. You and your friend here, we'll support you. That girl didn't go to the abortion clinic that day, but she did go the next day to hear her child's heartbeat and then she decided to carry through with that pregnancy and several months later this baby girl was born and to wrap everything up before we move it into questions, they just want to leave you with the thought that whether it's this teenage mom who not only is delighted that she has this baby, but she encouraged another friend to carry through with the pregnancy that that friend is grateful to have. Whether it's this teenage mom or whether it's Debbie or whether it's Lee Hannah or Veronica, whether it's little brook or her parents, whether it's a captain Sullenberger who prioritized the passengers on his airplane, whether it's Nick Vori church that you remember. All these people in think, you know they're inspiring because they put others ahead of themselves because they had perspective and because they did the right thing even when it was really hard. And that's the challenge that I leave all of you with today. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          00:53:07       At this point I would be happy to engage you in a dialogue, a conversation and a question and answer periods. So if you have questions about the topic in general or anything I've shared, I would be happy to answer them in. Mark has a microphone over there and in tea we'll take it around. So

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       any questions? I was wondering how do you suggest creating a dialogue like this in an environment which is almost entirely for abortion? So how do you, how do you even start this conversation when you know there was such a strong outward resistance to a pro life point of view?

Speaker 2:          00:53:44       You don't, hopefully it came through in the stories that I shared that I think a lot of the times the way we start conversations, whether we think it's an environment that's going to be friendly or not so friendly is to start conversations with open ended questions. So I will ask people, what do you think about abortion? And if that might seem like a really random, not so much lunch table conversation, you could maybe find an article in the newspaper or something that you read about online that somehow relates and bring it up and see, did you see that article about x, Y, or z? And it made me think, what do you think about this topic? What do you think about abortion? And really seek to understand where that, where that person is coming from. And to give you an example, once on an airplane, um, a guy sitting next to me, we, we shared what our jobs were and he asked what I did and I said, I, I go and give talks about abortion.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       And he said, really? That's fascinating. And I just looked at him and said, what do you think about abortion? And he said, I think it's necessary sometimes. And I just asked another question. I said, when do you think it's necessary? And he said, like, cases of rape. And I said, you know, I agree with you that rape is a horrible evil and we need to not only support the woman who's been victimized, but we need far more serious consequences for the rapist. And then I said to him, I have to ask myself a question though, and the question I have to ask myself, is this, is it fair to give the death penalty to the innocent child? And his passenger looked at me and he said, well, I never thought of it that way. And so I didn't go in boarding my plane with the intention to, you know, speak about abortion. I just asked a few questions when someone asks me what my job was. Any other questions?

Speaker 4:          00:55:30       All right. So I have a friend who says he's pro life. Like if you were with a woman who's pregnant here at rarely dare everything in his power to persuade her to choose life. But he says he wouldn't want to impose that decision. So what else? What is your,

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       so that's, that's a common perspective people have is I feel this way and I might even encourage you, but I can't force my views on human so far is I don't think the law, for example, should reflect how I would live. And when someone says that, I think analogies are helpful, I would, I would ask a question and, and, and draw an analogy out of it. I would say, well, would you say that you're against rape? Yes. Uh, and if someone was going to commit rape, would you try to stop them? Yes. And do you think if you're incapable of stopping them and they actually commit rape, that we ought to have laws that ban rate. So there are consequences for that person. And if they say yes, then I would say, okay, so you clearly think under some circumstances we should have laws that say certain actions are wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       So then why when it comes to abortion, would you treat it differently if abortion ends the life of a human being? Now if abortion doesn't end the life of a human being, then I think we can call into question. Should we have any laws against it. But since we know we're dealing with a human being that's living, then if the act of abortion ends that human being's life, it's not enough for me to say, I personally won't kill someone. But if you want to kill someone, that's you're right. If the facts are true, if the evidence is there, we have to go to its logical conclusion and say, if this action end someone's life, it's wrong. Not just for me, but it's wrong for everyone. And we ought to have laws against it as we do with rape and other types of murder and and other things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       So we can't determine whether we should quote unquote force our views on other people until we know what the view is. Like, for example, a lot of times people say, I support a woman's right to choose. We have to finish our sentence. That's not grammatically correct. Choose what? It's hanging there. I support a woman's right to choose what color shoes to wear with her outfit. Sure. What kind of ice cream she thinks is the best. Sure. But I don't support a woman's right to choose to kill an innocent child regardless of the child's age. So in a similar way, if I said to you, I support a man's right to take, you would have to ask me to define what I mean. Take what and if it's a support of man's right to take his bag and walk out of the room, totally okay. But I don't support a man's right to take someone else's bag out of the room. So we need to define what we mean by choice, by take by, by all of this stuff. And if in defining it evidence leads us to the fact that we're actually ending someone's life or violating a human right then, then we have to create a structure legally that bands that for the interests of our fellow human beings.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       Any other questions? I haven't really quite formulated my question on top of using that same analogy then. Um, what could kind of, what incarcerating a mother be when, when we're talking about the issue, the issue being that woman do not have enough support right now. Um, so what would, what good would, um, making it illegal do for the woman and, and showing her that there is support for her? That there is like another way?

Speaker 2:          00:58:56       Very good question. So certainly I would say it's not just one strategy. Add the uh, you know, and I know abandoning all other strategies, the, the slogan I like to use is make abortion unthinkable, but in believing it ought to be unthinkable based on the evidence of dealing with a human being and believing in human rights, um, believing it ought to be unthinkable doesn't exclude me from saying I also believe it ought to be. I do believe it ought to be illegal and unthinkable. Um, what would be the consequences for woman who violates the law? Well, the first point is no woman is currently violating the law. So we're not talking about, for example, putting women in jail who had had abortions. What we're talking about is a hypothetical. At some future point when the law changes, what ought the consequences be? And even when we say something is illegal, you know, it's illegal to steal what the consequences are for any individual who steals vary from case to case.

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       You might find a situation where a woman has an abortion under emotional duress. She does not actually is not freely choosing it. It's against the law. But someone's pressuring her or forcing her to go there against her will. So that would be one example. Or you have cases like Andrea Yates where you have a woman who drowned her born children in the bathtub and believe in her case, she was not found, she was found not criminally responsible. Um, her actions were still wrong and they're still unlawful, but a case was made or could be made in circumstances like this where someone was not have the right frame of mind to be fully consenting to the action that they were taking. So all of that needs to be taken into account. But the reality is the law currently isn't against abortion. And so what I think is very important as efforts are made to have the law changed to reflect human rights, that all of us have the inalienable right to life.

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       In the meantime, we have to offer support to women. Absolutely. And there are a pregnancy centers, there are homes for pregnant women, there are at nonprofits across the country that exists to do that very thing and to not only journey with a woman through her pregnancy, but to really walk with her after her pregnancy as well. If she chooses to parent rather than adoption, she's going to need a lot of support in these centers exist. And I would say very much should have our attention and support. So I hope that was helpful. Any final questions?

Speaker 4:          01:01:17       Or you're given giving an inspiring talk. So you're kind of like that good person quality at your that you're kind of mentioning. So I was going to ask a personal question. What inspires you to be who you are to give talks around the world?

Speaker 2:          01:01:30       Oh, well thank you. I, in terms of what inspires me, you know, I'm just speaking of pregnancy centers there. My mom volunteered at a pregnancy center when I was a young child. Both my parents were really active in the pro life cause you could say generally speaking, but in particular my mom volunteered at a pregnancy centers. So when clients would come for pregnancy tests I would often go with her and I would do it on letterhead while she was in the office counseling the girls. And when those clients gave birth, my mom would go to the hospital with flowers and I would come along. And so from a very young age I saw that there were women in crisis who felt they had no support. And I saw that there were people like my parents and my mom who would support them and love them through that difficult circumstance and turn that obstacle they were in into opportunity.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       And that laid the foundation to really convict me to want to use the skills that I had to help those who were more vulnerable and in need. And I went to university actually with plans to pursue a different career. But I heard an American speaker who came to Canada and I was a college student. His name is Scott clues, and, and he gave a presentation on this topic that blew my mind. And in that talk he said, there are more people working full time to kill babies. Then there are working full time to save them. And I'll admit, when I heard those words, I became very convicted that I want it to be one of the people being a voice for those who were entirely incapable of raising their voices against what was happening to them. And, and a lot of things unfolded. And here I am 15 years later. Thank you very much.
