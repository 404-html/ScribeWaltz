Speaker 1:          00:06          I'd like to introduce Karen Page and Andrew Doernenburg, um, to uh, talk today where we're, we're going to talk a little bit about their new book, which is in front of me, kitchen creativity, but this is also their 11th book. And I've been using your books for multiple years as inspiration from when I was first cooking, but also now to help provide inspiration to our chefs, uh, in our units around the world at Google. So thank you first for being here and making time to see us. It's a true pleasure, but a little bit about authors before we dive into the book. And we would like to make this a, uh, kind of a conversation. So as you have questions that come up, typically leave it to the end, but if there's something that you have a tidbit you really want to get out there, please let us know.

Speaker 1:          00:47          We'd love to make this a conversation and we're going to do a quick interview and then we're going to break into what we do at kitchen sink, which is our teaching kitchen. And we're going to do some cooking and chef, dd. And the team are going to put together a delicious treat and you look at the sample it. So that's always a plus. Um, so a little bit about, uh, about our authors. So, uh, for Karen on my right here, after skipping a grade care and received her letter of admissions to Northwestern, university of age 16, the first person to do the whole thing. And I know, right? Well you're the first person to attend college, um, self financed your education, uh, with seven academic scholarships. Super Cool. Uh, you ran your own birthday cake delivery business. Love to hear more about that. Later on, you were awarded a Ba in economics and certified in the women's studies from Northwestern university and he three named one of six honorable mentions and glamorous top 10 college women competition and featured on the cover of Newsweek as well.

Speaker 1:          01:43          You were invited to the White House twice back in [inaudible] 86 you also earn an Mba from Harvard business school, uh, Northwestern named you. And then you three, one of the universities, 100 leading professional alumni. Congratulations, council of 100 right on, uh, an avid meditator. Uh, you both like to run. Uh, interesting to hear that. And you live in New York City with your husband to your right. Andrew. So welcome Karen, great to have you here. And uh, Mr Andrew grew up in the bay area here. Great to see another bay area I individual. Um, and you, you kind of transitioned from farmland to suburbs, so your families, uh, um, background and backyard had a lot of trees. You're obviously into gardening and, and kind of led you into the culinary world where you started cooking at a young age. And uh, you were mentioned as first cooking at Mcdonald's in your early years as well as, uh, one of the few like Jeff Bezos and others and also worked at Mcdonald's doing quite well.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Now from a time you're adulation. Cute. Everyone, everyone has their, their start somewhere. That's awesome. Uh, three days out of high school you became a firefighter. Um, so obviously with the amazing devastation and in northern California with the fires lately, um, it's great to see that you were, um, putting in your dues early on, but at the same time found that after awhile a firefighting was, uh, even though it was your best day of putting out fires and cooking for the team, your best days ahead, we're really getting into the kitchen, see, became a chef. You worked in some amazingly talented, uh, restaurants, um, worked under some top chefs and then after, uh, deciding to leave the kitchen. So you worked with lady a shower for a while, for a while, decided to leave the kitchen and then I ended up putting together some amazing books that we're going to talk about in a moment. You also earned your som certificate. Interesting Tidbit and sure,

Speaker 2:          03:33          yes, yes. At the same time. No, at different times. I think it's an important part of anybody's culinary education. Absolutely. Absolutely worthwhile.

Speaker 1:          03:43          And then, um, interesting, uh, piece as well as you followed a, your was it your grandmother's left for, to photography and d might run, mother actually had a dark room, which you probably have no idea. Yes. But it was a place where you developed film, which you probably have no idea what, that there was a time where that happened. Yes. That's my fault. So you and you did all the photographs for the buck, is that correct? For this one or this one then? Vege Flavor Bible. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So Ma Ma multitalented individual Sarah on the room. Indeed. So it, it's, it's my distinct pleasure and total excitement. I can't say it enough. We talked to ned copy for the last hour and how excited I was to, to see you guys here. Please welcome her authors.

Speaker 3:          04:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:24          I can't have to interject by saying, first of all, Scott, thank you for that and amazing introduction. I was worried we're going to be here for hours if you're starting out just like Steve, but that was lovely. Um, but the reason that we're here is actually because of this man. And, um, we, I haven't had the pleasure of meeting him in person before, but, um, we have been, uh, in the email and email touch and in virtual touch, um, ever since he gave this wonderful interview to this national magazine where he mentioned one of our books, his, uh, his, uh, favorite book, which we actually got to see today, which was thrilling and it gets bound together. What were you describing with butcher string?

Speaker 1:          05:01          Yeah, so kind of fallen apart. This is priceless. So if anyone tries to take this from me, good luck. This is the first edition culinary router street and it is in the same condition as it was 17 years ago when you signed it. It was literally signed in 2000. And it was a book that I used, um, for inspiration on a day to day level when I was writing menus. And we're going to talk about how chefs and gain their inspiration and I'll call Ariens and, and even home chefs, home cooks gain their inspiration. And there's such a variety of techniques in becoming creative. But this book is something that's very near and dear to me. And when I brought it out to Andrew when he was dining at our restaurant, I humbly said it's, it's getting used as you can see the binding's falling off. So my only feedback for the publisher is a stronger binding here cause the butcher's twine is not quite working or duct tape included. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          05:52          But inspiration, I mean part of our inspiration for being here is really Scott and the amazing reputation that Google has for its culinary program. And to know that you've been here for how many years now is it both your, that you have helped to have a raise it to a really a world class level when you started out there was just I think a handful of cafes and now, you know, they're, they are all over the world. Um, but for those of us who've never eaten any Google before, this is a first, um, to know that it is legendary in terms of the choices available, the quality of the food and now being here at this wonderful new location that we understand just opened, um, a matter of weeks ago. Really. Um, it's, it's something that gets us on a plane from New York City to come out to the bay area to see what it's all about. And the fact that we, if we had any role, um, the most, my new role and, and being an inspiration to you, then we're thrilled to be able to be,

Speaker 1:          06:51          to be here with all the Googlers for the first time. So thanks for having me. I often talk about, um, your books. Obviously this has just been released a week ago. So many of you probably you're flipping through it, but a lot of your books follow that same thing theme, which is to really unlock the creativity and the potential in chefs' minds. And again, whether it's a professional chef or whether it's shops at home. And what I found that these books are so amazing at is I always say it's hard to plan to be creative on a specific day. You know, you can book the time in your calendar and say, on Wednesday I'm going to write a menu. But you know, you don't feel well, the weather's bad. Something comes up in the news and you're just, you're not feeling it. Tell me how this book is helping chefs and individuals kind of overcome that. There's, there's a lot of great pieces in there, but maybe unpack a little bit of some of the initial thoughts that you put into this book to help chefs and home chefs really kind of get that creative edge and bring their best forward.

Speaker 2:          07:46          Well, I think it's true that for any of those who cook, whether it's at home or professionally, um, you're always looking for inspiration and there's a lot of sameness. Otherwise it takes place when you're making the same thing day in and day out. So if you can learn to bring creativity or you're cooking, it's going to add that much more enjoyment to you, to everybody that you're cooking for and with. Um, but beyond that, it's really a matter of the creativity is the most important skill that we can possibly have. And so if you can learn the skill of creativity from the world's best chefs, what better way to learn it? We had, um, done research on the fact that CEOs are saying that the number one skill for success in leadership and in businesses creativity, it's not integrity, it's not global thinking, which is a little interesting.

Speaker 2:          08:35          Um, but the fact that it's creativity makes it a study, a subject that's worth studying. And so, uh, we also realized that the only one in four people survey say that they think that they're at their creative potential. So to the extent that we can become more creative, it's something we can apply to our daily lives. It's something we can imply it in the kitchen. And so what we did with kitchen creativity is we wanted to create the ultimate culinary brainstorming tool. So if you want to be more creative, what are some of the things that you can use some of the best practices and used by the world's best chefs to become more creative and really, um, we map out the process of creativity, which I know we're going to get into, but, um, both in a general way. Um, in terms of culinarily coming up with a new dish, I'm trying to, uh, take old dishes and make them new again. Um, but then also from just a best practices standpoint, how do you let your creativity flow? And we've got some advice from some of the leading creativity experts in the world talking about how to make that happen.

Speaker 1:          09:34          Yeah. It so don't, don't downplay that. I think one of the things that, uh, gotten me excited about culinary artist for me when I looked at a years ago was the pedigree of chefs you have in your, in your back pocket. I mean, I'm interested to hear how you informed, is it some of the initial relationship with these shops and when you're talking about every top shop out there, whether it's Danco repair, uh, Danny Meyer's restaurant, or you've got amazing chefs that are taking their time to share some of their most intimate secrets on what's made them successful. Um, and I don't take that lightly and none of our chefs at Google that do such an amazing job and bringing the food program to live here. Do either, I mean these are the inspirational chefs that they look to aspire to be. What were some of the initial, how did that happen? Like what was that first chef you're like, oh my God, if I could just get this right.

Speaker 2:          10:22          How did that go about? When we started out, we had never written a book before. And so how do you get the world's best chefs to talk to you? We didn't really know, but the ace in our home was that Andrew was working as a professional chef in Boston and he was working with Chris Schlesinger and Lidia Shyer, who at the time or two of the best chefs in the country who happened to be in Boston. And so having, starting out with the two of them and then he went on to work with Anne Rosenzweig at a Arcadia in New York City. And once we had the three of them in our pocket, we can kind of go to people because there was three big names that they knew us personally. They had some belief that we could actually write a book. And so they thought, well, if Lydia is Ann and Chris isn't an ANZ and then you know, I'm into. So from there we went to other top chefs in Boston, in New York. From then, um, we were doing the research on weekends and evenings. We would travel to San Francisco and knocking Gary Danko store. Actually he would also work with metal in it, that Matt and Cam and the up at the school for American chefs at or vineyards where Gary, when Gary Danco,

Speaker 4:          11:20          we met others. Jeff's through her too. But the key is Karen writes a great letter. That's how you do. She goes, well, we just interviewed these other people. Would you like to be included in our new book? And even though they didn't know us, they knew the other people. It's like, and also asking for 15 minutes who only need 15, 20 minutes. And that always almost always turned into an hour. And I'll never forget, we interviewed the chef Barbara Tropp, a legendary restaurant tour shaft, China Moon Cafe in San Francisco. And at the end we, we talked to her for like almost an hour and a half years. I've never had a conversation like this and we're like neither of weight. And then she says, well, try not to edit my words too much, where like you went to Princeton, you're good.

Speaker 2:          12:05          Yes, she's spoken poetry. Just an amazing woman, founder of the women chefs and Restaurateurs Association that we talked about is near and dear to Dee and myself as a former board member of that. So I think once you kind of get started, then it, it easier to get the ball rolling. And that's true of any aspect of creativity. Um, the good to quote, it's like, you know, whatever you can imagine, um, and I won't get the words right, but, uh, you know, be bold, take action, and then it, it really has a magic to it that really starts to unfold. So once you take action in a certain direction, we talk in the book, there's an atcs, that section of the book, the back of the book is laid out like Flavor Bible. If any of you are familiar with that where it's a three column format, uh, a to z. But instead of flavors, we have apples to Zucchini in the flavor Bible. We have every other topic under the sun from architecture to um, Alice in wonderland, Alice in wonderland. There's actually a restaurant based on

Speaker 4:          13:00          some wonderland, the book. And we actually finished up with a yoga, Rick Bayless of the frontier grill and Taco Bompo restaurant of the year on the James Beard Award. He's been doing yoga for 20 years and this is what's fun about knowing these people for so long. It's like, hey Rick, would you mind, you know, doing a yoga pose for us. So is did his chef's jacket and he was pops up on the counter and does yoga for us.

Speaker 2:          13:23          He's amazing for as long as we've known him because we interviewed Rick Bayless for all of our books. We had never seen him do this amazing pose before. But you know, anyone's multitalented as you, as Rick who has been doing yoga for 20 years, it's um, it's pretty awesome. So what an inspiration to talk to chefs in it. And again, you know, when you're talking to chefs for your 11th book as opposed to your first book, it's a whole different ballgame because they, you built up a certain level of knowledge and trust. And so we were talking to people about what inspires them and they went a little rogue with that. Went there, went there. And you can tell us quite honestly, you know, I look at my ingredients, I talked to my ingredients and so I'll take an apple and I'll put it in the center of the table and I'll have a conversation with the apple and say, okay, yeah, Paul, what are we going to do today?

Speaker 2:          14:08          You've done some interesting things before, but what are we going to do today? And that there's this level of intuition. You could call it mediumship, channeling, whatever you want to call it, that that takes place. And, uh, we were talking about the most respected chefs in the country. So Jose and is based in Washington, DC. We'll talk to his ingredients. He said, if you talk to your ingredients, they will always tell you a story. You just have to have your ears open to hear that story. Guy Olivera who just won the James Beard award this year is the best, uh, outstanding pastry chef in the United States. She's the one who puts the apple and the parchment paper in the center and Restaurant Danielle in New York City and says, talk to me, apple, um, to Phillip Foss from El Ideas in Chicago.

Speaker 4:          14:48          Phillip Foss. He's great. Uh, this is a very fascinating restaurant. It's, it's in a loft way out in the middle of nowhere. They say, take a car, you know, don't take public transportation. Um, but he will say, the ingredient is my child and I want my child to succeed and be happy and it's up to me to care for the child and, and make sure it's a physically, emotionally, and mentally and spiritually happy. So he treats his ingredients like the children and raises them again, has that conversation and he has the craziest menu I think I've ever seen. He will do a menu based on the 80s he will produce a dish and play a certain piece of music that is inspired by. Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:29          Madonna is like a virgin. Like what? Yeah, that was for the Ada that he'll serve. Um, cocaine, which is basically a lime and coconut powder on a mirror with the razor blade is Michelin Star restaurant. I hear that he's, he's out there, but he's got a Michelin Star. He's respected, he's so celebrated. And so, you know, there are chefs out there who are creative. They're pushing the envelope and they're doing a lot of things that are a lot of fun. And you might not serve exactly the same things at home, but you can be inspired by the thought process. He does a job. He does a dish of frosties and French fries, which was inspired by his daughters as a single dad for a while and raising his kids and the babysitter took them to Wendy's where they learned to dip there. Did anybody do that? If their French fries and cross, did you ever have it in a Michelin starred restaurant? If you go to El Ideas in Chicago, you can taste it there.

Speaker 1:          16:20          So, um, what, what I love about these books again is it, it's caters to a variety of audiences. You've got people that are cooking at home, you've got people that are beginning, beginning to look, cook or learning to cover. You've got people that are cooking for many years. And I, what I love about this in essence is it's very similar to our program here is we're really trying to enable people to pick up skills and give them the competence. And um, when you, when you dive into the book, you're going to see that the quotes in here are not only from some of the, the biggest and baddest names out there, but they're the really great tidbits that really helps unpack what they're thinking in their thought process. So let's think, let's talk a little bit about the book. So the book is very interesting. This is a book of no recipes.

Speaker 1:          16:56          Um, this is a book of, and thank you because there's a lot of recipes out there, but it's really around, um, uh, a few different aspects. So you start the book around mastery. And so there's a section on that which I'd love to talk about briefly. And then section two is more around alchemy and the transformation stage. And then number three is around really that creativity aspect, which obviously is the bulk of it. Can you, can you talk about the three different sections, uh, briefly so we can kind of get an understanding of why you went back direction? Um, and then what we'll bring in some examples?

Speaker 2:          17:25          Sure. Um, well we start out with mastery because it's, Picasso lets us know you can't break the rules unless you knew what the rules are. So you start out by understanding the rules. And the way to do that is really to learn to think like a chef shop, like a chef in season, like a chef. And so in terms of thinking like a chef, we have done lots of research on the leading books that chef's everywhere say that you should have in your culinary library at home. We've narrowed it down to the 20 top books and if you read these books, if you really absorbed that information, you're going to know what the best chefs know and that will give you a starting point in terms of knowledge, in terms of skill you want to learn to. Well actually one of the things that's important with the chefs is, and the shopping aspect of this shopping is a skill that if you are willing to invest in the same level of ingredients that the best chefs work with, you're not going to have the same results.

Speaker 2:          18:15          Um, sometimes the hardest part is figuring out where do you buy it. Um, and chefs have already done that hard work for you to find the very best of the best ingredients. We have a list of the purveyors that provide chest with some of the, uh, hard to find ingredients, spices, herbs, seasonings, things as, yes, yeah, lots of grains and flours. They don't want the, their, their polenta milled a certain way or their flour mill the certain way. And so, um, we've got a guide to where to shop like a chef. And then in terms of seasoning, like a chef, I mean that's really what we were talking about it in culinary artistry. So many years ago when we banished chefs to a desert island, asked them to bring only 10 ingredients that they we cook with for the rest of their life. The number one ingredient was salt.

Speaker 2:          18:57          And Salt is really the master technique. All the chefs in the room are nodding their heads like, yes, of course. Um, but to learn to add sodium to addition a way that enhances flavor without necessarily adding flavor, which we get into in the alchemy stage of things. But um, there it gets a little more complicated than beyond, above and beyond the Flavor Bible. We talk about different elements of salts. So not just which salty different chefs use. Some use sea salt, some use mind salt, some use, you know, pink salts, you know, there different salts for different purposes. And thinking more specifically about the salt you use, adding and adding not only sodium, but in some cases who mommy threw a salty ingredient or um, other, uh, ingredients that are complex that will add more than one. Taste. It once. If you learn how to work with them, it can really elevate your cooking.

Speaker 2:          19:47          We talked to one chef, um, the other night in New York City, we did an event and he was talking about the fact that he was actually ran out of salt, which was like the first chef I've ever heard. But it happens, that's the exact reaction run out of it at the restaurant. But at home he opened up his refrigerator at home and he had fed a cheese there. So you took the liquid from the federal, which is salty and he used that as sort of a liquid salt ad hoc and only, you know, it's a, it just one of those things that it's like, well of course you could use salty ingredients. It doesn't have to be solved. And I think part of what cook kitchen creativity is all about is how can you open your mind to thinking not about specific ingredients, but think of concepts that you're adding to a dish and to use it and really extrapolate from there.

Speaker 1:          20:29          It's interesting to think through the whole aspect of just seasoning because people think, oh, you just have solvents done. Well there's, there's types of salters layering when to add the salt, when to add it and not getting in the end of the fucking light. And these are the tips that are within the book that really helped, um, uh, a good shot, become a great chef and a great chat, become an excellent chef, whether again, you're home chef or not. Um, so the, the first day just mastery in it, you made it very clear that, you know, and all the chefs had this in the book that to be able to master anything, it's a lot of practice, a lot of discipline. It's a lot of time. And once you understand the rules, then you can attempt to break the rules. And then I think it kind of takes you to that next step. So talk a little about the next section, which is around that transformation, that alchemy stage.

Speaker 2:          21:09          That's the stage that we really been writing about and talking about four years now under the guise of culinary artistry, the Flavor Bible and what to drink with what you eat. So I'll give me is really about how do you take something common and turn it into something precious. And what we mean by that is that there is a benefit in the culinary world that one plus one doesn't equal two. There are instances in which one plus one can equal three or more. And what we have dedicated our research too over the years is trying to identify what is the lock that you can put there, the key that you can put into the lock to really turn it to unlock the deliciousness of particular ingredients, whether they're herbs or spices or other seasonings for specific ingredients or is, and this is what led us both to some ace school, is realizing that if you've got a perfect plate of food in front of you and you've got the wrong wine in your glass, when you have the two together, which you inevitably do because you eat and drink together, it's going to clash.

Speaker 2:          22:04          It's going to ruin the food. So we, we became committed to studying wine and earning our Sameei certificates because it was so important to me. Is it a mass part is an important way to master flavor. And that was the best means that we had to be able to train our palettes and to learn more about what, what was the secret to matching the best wines with food. And so we also interviewed dozens of the best someways all across the country, including it, some of the top restaurants and people that you're well acquainted with and really compiled that into what to drink with what you eat, which is the ultimate food and wine pairing guide. Because you can look up the food, it will tell you what wine or beer, spirits, cocktails, water, coffee, tea or etc. To drink with it, to enhance the flavor of that food.

Speaker 2:          22:50          Vice versa. If you're starting with a bottle of wine, you're starting with a beer, you're starting with something else, what food can you serve with it to best enhance what's in the bottle or what's in the glass. And so when you bring all of those elements together, that's what really what we're talking about in terms of alchemy. If you master some of the principles of what are the key flavor pairings, what are the key, you know, so the, some of those standard, you know, son Sarah Oysters or peanut and Anwar and salmon. Um, if you master some of those, it gets you so close to the ballpark that you could actually be only okay chef with a modicum of talent. But if you understand those principles and can apply them in the kitchen, it's going to make you shine to a whole new level.

Speaker 1:          23:30          Yeah, and I always, we always talk about thinking about what's in the glass as a sauce also. And again, you know, a really easy way to do that quick tool as if it grows together, it goes together. So if you're in Italy and you're making pasta from northern Italy,

Speaker 4:          23:46          see what they drink in northern Italy, if you're in the bay area and you're grilling a steak or gosh, I have a bottle of this end, you know, the right there in Napa valley and they're all next to each other. There's a natural synergy. But also I think it's also funded, and just wrap this part up a little bit, is that it's not just wine. You can, you have a lemon soda with a salad and that could almost be your dressing on a salad. So you think outside just the classic pairings. And like, we all know that you can actually drink white wine with many things. You can actually drink red wine with fish now it's okay. Peanut and Warren Salmon. So think you know, of all the beverages, what do you can bring in? And again, that's going to change a of meals just by having the proper beverage. You know, that's, that's the three there.

Speaker 1:          24:33          I think you hit on a lot of a lot of key points and it goes much deeper than just the actual dish itself. It goes to what's being paired at your surrounding. And it creates that experience that if any of you think about your most epic food experience you've ever had, it couldn't be a hotdog at the ballpark. It could be at a Michelin Star restaurant. There's different things that all came together. Absolutely a great culinary and makes that look so easy. And Zach, a lot of these tips are in the book and so it's super, super exciting. There's a great quote in the book and it starts off by saying, um, you know, to, to not copy other shots, but to be able to get inspired. I, and many others feel that copying is actually the gateway to get into. Can you speak to that because it's kind of a contradiction, but it actually makes total sense.

Speaker 2:          25:17          Yeah. Smell that that's sort of the, the, you know, Hook in the beginning of the book is talking about we want to teach you creativity. What's the definition of creativity? It's not copying, coming up with something that's new and useful and surprising. And yet by definition, how do you get to that point of being able to do it? You need to learn the rules. How do you learn the rules you'd copy. So that's the push me pull you. And I think that that is a lesson that comes through time and time again in the book and that it's never one or the other. It's never a hot versus cold. It's, it's both. And, and we talk, um, in the back of the book under why you'll find yes and being one of the key rules that you need to master for creativity. And if it's the first rule of improvisation, if you've ever done any improvisational acting, you know that if someone says something like, okay, here's the premise of this scene, I'm going to walk in and you know, I dropped the book on the floor.

Speaker 2:          26:10          Uh, you don't say, oh no, no, no, you didn't drop the book. You'd have to say yes, you dropped the book. And that was the book that I was on, the wait list for it. The library. It's like yes. And um, that was the book that my ex boyfriend actually wrote. And you, you add onto the story. So you always add onto it because you never want to break that chain. So the key that you can take from the improvisation or rules and to apply in the kitchen is, or no matter what happens, you trust that it's there to serve you. And it's for a reason. And what we tell people is, it kind of goes, if you at in the beginning of the book, there's a list of ingredient of different classic dishes and what their origins were. And a lot of times they came from mistakes.

Speaker 2:          26:51          So there was something that went wrong. You know, the Burrito Burrito gets knocked into the deep fat fryer. Hey Jimmy. John Goes, or the, the Ravioli gets knocked into the deep fat fryer. Hey, toasted Ravioli turns into a thing. People love it. So it's never, things are never really mistakes that if you pay attention to it, and so it pressman and wolves in San Francisco, the intern under cooks the egg that you asked her to hard boil. It's soft boil. It oozes out. Wait a second, that's kind of cool. And you find out that people love things that who's out of other things, all the secrets out of our, our mistakes,

Speaker 1:          27:28          right? I think front Adria talks in the book about the fact that, um, you, if you're unique and if you're doing something innovative that no one else has done before and you're not copying, and then no one can really judge it against anything else. And I think that's a good point. But you cannot go that direction unless you've got the understanding of the technique and the master to begin with. And obviously if Rhonda is one of the most acclaimed chefs out there, and so he can, he can easily pull that off. But I think it's a great testament to get inspired by seeing what other people do, have conversations, whatever your inspiration is this the document you do, you have a lot of great tips in the book around how do you capture that moment of creativity? It's about always being positive. It's about surrounding yourself with others on great conversations. It's about writing things down. And you know, most most chefs, great chefs have either a, you know, a pocket book

Speaker 2:          28:12          and a notebook right by the bedside because Brian, you wait

Speaker 1:          28:16          cup sometimes you've had this amazing thought. Or for me it's, if I exercise it's like I get that mom moment of that would work and they, you know, you have to write it down and it's about all these great little tips that sometimes are not revolutionary. It's just, yes, this makes total sense. Let's do this more often. And you can take that outside the kitchen as well.

Speaker 2:          28:33          Yes. And that was one of the benefits of being able to do book number 11 is because chefs were really up front with us about their creative process involving, um, in a lot of cases, a personal reflection time. So whether that was through journaling or through meditation, we found out that a lot of the chefs we've been talking to for years where you're very deep meditators, um, talk with Eric repair of Laverne or down, which is on the world's 50 best restaurants list about his Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice that he credits as a source of his creativity. Mario Batali, who was studied TM after being recommended to it by Jerry Seinfeld of all people. Um, and so he studied through the David Lynch Foundation. Um, and uh, other chefs are big meditators, yoga doers, martial artists, a runners. Because for those of us who are runners, like Andrew and I have run marathons. When you're doing 26.2 miles, you know, it's all mental. It's not physical anymore. So like

Speaker 1:          29:27          business, it's very, very, uh, you bring out all your senses when you're cooking. How many people here love to cook at home? All right, I kind of figured it, you're going to be so more inspired now this, but, um, when it brings out, it brings out all, all of it and it's very draining. It's emotionally draining, sometimes more than even physically draining depending on what you're doing. And I think that, you know, whatever you need to do to create that balance is going to keep you at your best so that you can be at your best consistently. Because, you know, working with men and if we're not feeling creative that speaks in the [inaudible], you can see it. You can, you can smell it, you can taste it or you can't. Right.

Speaker 2:          29:59          And when you look at, he calls that the aura of a dish where you know that the most important aspect of the dishes, that connection between the dish itself and the person who's eating it. Sure. And she believes it's love that you can actually taste it if there's Solon a dish, if there's love in a dish or if there's not, if a dish falls flat, she knows that people are just started cooking with everything that they can bring to a dish.

Speaker 1:          30:19          Sure. So we're going to do a transition here and speaking of bringing everything that we can to a dish, we're going to do a little fun year with eating and the team. So we're in the kitchen sink, a teaching kitchen at Google and Sunnyvale. And the team here is going to talk through, we're going to move the chairs out. They're going to talk through kind of how they look at inspiration when they create meals and recipes for our Googlers. If they teach them to cook. And a, it will be a kind of narrating back and forth and asking her all sorts of questions and seeing how it comes to light. But we're excited for this. So chef dd, welcome. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          30:51          Let me get out of your way.

Speaker 1:          30:58          So tell the audience here and obviously our virtual audience a little bit about what you do and what kitchen sink is for the folks in the audience, they probably understand it, but you're, you're delivering, uh, cooking classes to Googlers. Yes. Sometimes families, sometimes families. And you're teaching people on a variety of spectrum, whether they know how to cook the comfortable with cooking or, or not at all.

Speaker 5:          31:21          Yup. Um, sometimes we have people that cook six, seven nights a week, sometimes the just getting into the kitchen and they want some basic knife skills and basic cooking techniques. So, um, we have a full culinary program. Single subject classes could be who literacy based skill building. Um, we do a core culinary program, lots of team events, um, guest chefs. So, um, usually two classes a day or more. I do have the coolest job on campus. I get to live in this amazing space

Speaker 1:          31:54          every day. And you're in a brand new teaching kitchen here. So I'm gonna move the chair out of your way. And why don't you just talk a little bit about, I know that, I know I have a kind of an understanding of what you're looking through here, but I was talking to Karen and Andrew earlier about what I call the chefs' arsenal. And the chefs' arsenal for many shops is expected, especially in the older days when we were trained as you've got sugar, you've got salt, you've got fat, whatever that fat might be. And those are the three things that typically dominate and deliver flavor. And we still use those, but we use them a lot more thoughtfully. Um, we have a very intentional look, uh, outlook on the food program at Google. Uh, and we want, while we want to deliver on deliciousness, I love the fact that you said that, and that's in the book. We want to deliver on deliciousness. We can do this in thoughtful ways. And so you're going to talk through your dish today and kind of how you're doing that with the Google twist. Um, and talk through some of the ingredients that are your modern day arsenal that are still delivering on the attributes of sweet sugar. Salt and fat, you're doing them in a thoughtful way.

Speaker 5:          32:50          Um, yeah. So one of the things I think about when I'm building out a dish, um, let's start with seasonality. I think that's really important. Um, and I'm thinking about the dish today. Um, I just was thinking about all these amazing fall squashes that are coming into the market. So roasted up some butternut squash. We have some Delicata squash roasted as well. And then, um, thinking about, um, other ingredients that would go well with this dish. So, um, some Nice Kale mushrooms and not only mushrooms, roasted mushrooms, so some roasted Shataki mushrooms really get into super tasty salty Umami for sure,

Speaker 1:          33:34          roasting a lot. And I, and I don't, for those that can't see the ingredients up close, you're developing a heightened sense of the, of the flavor of why the caramelization of the natural sugars in the squash and the mushrooms. You're extracting the water to get more flavor. And so you're, you're really delivering on flavor. And most of this, if not all of this has it all plant based. And so you're highlighting the seasonality as we're heading into fall. Um, we have some of the squashes here, but you've got some staples that are always on our menus, whether it's the chemo,

Speaker 5:          33:59          why are the mushrooms and things like that, a roasted shallots as well. So yeah, really nice plant based dish, not one of the things. We also um, driving kitchen sink as well. And then, yeah, thinking about you could take this set of ingredients and then I think about, okay, how am I going to build flavor, um, with a sauce or the dressing or the sparkling water or the wine. Right. So, um, today I wanted to take a kind of a, a trip and a map to uh, Thailand and use some Thai ingredients. Okay. Excellent. Um, so things like fish sauce, right, salty, Umami. It's that layer of salt that's not just, just solid caramelization too. A lot of flavor in there. Um, soy sauce. Um, another, no Fermin, fermented sauces, fermented flavors, really rich in Umami. Um, palm sugar, a little bit of sweet, but also bill nuts. Yeah. Right? Yes. Um, Kinda caramely Vanilli not just that plain white sugar thing happening out there. Um, fresh ginger or classically for tag along the route. Um, Thai chilies, a little bit of that heat and that sensory that you want to pause you right now, right

Speaker 1:          35:18          now because of what you're, you're, you've delivered on so many attributes that are so important to any rate meal. And obviously within our, our guidance that we provide where chefs, we have a saying called flavor roles, flavor rules. It has to be there or why bother just go home and pack it up. But there's also rules of flavor and with DDS talked about is you've got amazing flavors here and happened to be plant based. They don't have to beat, you've gotten a mommy that sixth sense of that, that neediness through machines soy saw. So you've got the spice through ginger, you've got spice through Saracho or Chili, you've got the herbaceousness from the Cilantro, you've got the crunch from the nuts. You've got all these different aspects that for a district truly be craveable for you to want one more bite. You need to get all of these elements together.

Speaker 1:          35:58          And what dd is going to do now is to pull these together in a way that, um, is going to want the diner to go back for that next bite. And as our focus here, we're, we're trying to help our users make better choices with food because the food here is something that is plentiful and bountiful. It's easy to make wrong decisions and our job is to make it easier for you to make better choices and to enjoy what you had. Because a lot of times users come to us and say, this is the highlight of my day. Lunch was like the highlight. So it should be, it should be me experience.

Speaker 2:          36:29          Hopefully not. No one's saying no or yes,

Speaker 1:          36:35          there's audience has questions. You guys can chime in while dd starts putting this together.

Speaker 2:          36:40          You picked some of my favorite compliments to. Uh, I, I love this combination of squash and mushrooms, the earthiness balancing the sweetness of the squash. I think it's still seasonal and yet there's a real complimentary nature to that and actually do that.

Speaker 1:          36:55          I thing I like is the fact that the nuts, the nuts, we'll add crunch, but also it's protein and it's fast. So when you were talking about fat being such as playing a role and it still does and fat is actually soon to be considered a flavor, but that's a good way to make the dish even healthier as opposed to like a creamy dressing or something like that. You can get it all there. So you're actually getting two for one. Actually a little bit of a mommy too. So that's a really key thing. And if he doesn't like print them nuts, it's like

Speaker 2:          37:20          walnuts. You know how we were talking about earlier that kind of stealing that, taking it nice and it's a check out the book of course, before you got here, how was like, right, I've got to put the mushrooms in there, so thank you. I basically read well and your tension and of course King Wah with it's high protein content. Always feel virtuous when I have it. I love the texture. It's more of a textural thing for me, I think then flavor, but I love the earthiness of it. Um, knowing that I'm doing something good for my writing, right.

Speaker 1:          37:54          There's a beautiful array of colors for those that are up here. You can smell it and it's a cold dish. So imagine if some of these words were heated and you could easily add your warm mushrooms are warm. Squash and temperature plays a lot into what we do as we're, you know, creating dishes because you eat with your eyes first, but you even before that is if you walk into any cafe or restaurant, the first thing you generally get is a smell of something. And hopefully it's something that's, you know, not overpowering like Cologne or perfume, which is why chefs don't wear, it's beautiful, which is why chefs don't wear that. So refreshing. One of the things that I loved, needed to speak to is the, the disciplines within the program of Google about really practicing your recipes. I mean this is something that you've made before.

Speaker 1:          38:35          Not something that you see on top shop where you get five ingredients, you put something together. That's perfect day one. And the reason I mentioned that and I love that the TV shows that have really brought the popularity of food and getting more people excited, but at times I think there's a challenge out there that a lot of people think that just throwing ingredients together is, is the way it is for shops. And that's not the case. They spent so much time testing and training and retesting and retooling and what we call a signature recipe. It might take us weeks, months, or years to get to a point and talk a little bit about your thought process of how you got this, cause I know you just didn't go in their fridge or if you're like, ah, that looks like fun, but you had some bought with this. So let us give us some, some insights as you're compiling mixed fleets. Yeah, absolutely. So like I said, back to, um, seasonality, um, deliciousness, craveability um, you know, super important. And so, you know, going back to, you know, roasting the butternut squash, um, thinking about, um, the fish sauce, all those fermented things. I'm actually surprised I didn't put me so

Speaker 2:          39:37          paste on this because I'm obsessed with me, so it's always better with me sir, but often better with me. Great. The magic ingredient a little bit

Speaker 1:          39:46          with salad dressing or um, you know, adding it into a dish.

Speaker 2:          39:52          What do you said about roasting the squash? Because again, every ingredient also has a key that unlocks it in terms of technique. You don't boil it, steam it, roast it to get the ultimate flavor.

Speaker 1:          40:03          Yeah, great point. Um, you know, adding in the crunch with, with some of the red bell peppers and also a little bit of sweetness. We roasted the shallots as well. Nothing concepts in the book. And then, you know, we balanced taste right, the sweet, the sour, the salty, the bitter and Umami. So it's like chefs favorite two words need salt. Yeah. Yeah. I think even in the book, like people, people new joke that the chest can look at a dish and say it needs salt in nine times out of 10 the right. Yeah. So you're about to put this together and obviously the team is in right now Jerrod's tasting nutritious, that it's so key. How many people here have, have cooked at home. And there's always something. There's that one little element missing, right? It could be salt, it could be acid, it could be that balance.

Speaker 1:          40:48          And that's the fun in, in the kitchen is to come up with what is that perfect balance that you're looking for and what would DDS got here is a perfect opportunity to deliver on amazing, delicious, because you've got all that going on. But what Thai food specifically, it's either really good or really wrong, right? Because if you're too high on the sugar, if you too high on the spice, it just throws the balance off, right? And so what she's doing now, it's, she's going through and she's looking for those, those, uh, specific balances and incorporating the ingredients. How's it tasting? Good. Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee checked that.

Speaker 2:          41:24          I think with the sweetness, sweetness gets a bad rap that you don't want to eat too much sugar, which I think is true, but also sometimes all you need is a little bit of sugar to be a enhancer and you get, and there's that peak, um, aspect of when you're looking at how to season, where you learn, okay, it's, it's, it's enhancing place. Enhancing has upset starts stalling flavor. And so if you add too much sugar, it will do all the flavors. So you kind of have to work on getting to the peak of that apex. But is it still going up in the new four? It starts going down and I think that's just a matter of trial and error. Repetition, as you said before, personal tastes in some instances.

Speaker 1:          41:59          Yeah. And that's a challenge. A personal taste obviously with, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars running around. What are our approach on that is to create food that is approachable for everyone but personalizable for everyone as well. And so a lot of the time will be garnished is on the side purposely. So that people can add their element of, of acidity is spice, et cetera. Um, and, and I find myself doing that more and more when I cook at home is because everyone has different tastes. So a question for you, for both of you, if you had three ingredients that are always in your refrigerator that you would rely on

Speaker 2:          42:29          and it always changes, right? Absolutely. Cases during the season. Two we'd have to have me sit, well champagne, I don't know about that ingredient is getting importance. It is always in the original parmesan cheese Parmesan is a world war horse because we ate Vegan for two months and we've found that it was really hard to live without Parmesan. Sure. Why would you want to do that? Yeah. Yeah. All right. We still farmers on, cause I'm, I'm picking up

Speaker 1:          42:59          Jesus Umami name. Okay. And then actually none of the refrigerator on the, on the next month or next to the stove as I always have a wide variety of winners. Champagne, Sherri Balsamic, white Balsamic, dark balsamic. And what's cool about vinegars? I think this is the, if you want to be more creative tonight by a different bottle of vinegar, make each same salad and do a one with balsamic vinegar tonight, one with a squeeze of lemon tomorrow and one was champagne vinegar. The next day you'll have three completely different salads and also vinegar, seven different degrees of acidity to so champagnes and he was very soft lemons role. It's always off. So we always have a lot of vinegar. So it's sort of basically salt sour. Actually it says own sauce. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          43:42          Touch your skin. Says we've got a little bottle of that, uh, after we leave feeling inspired to cook tonight. Yeah. The thing is is that if you have those key ingredients, whatever they are, and I think it changes from week to week because we don't like having the same thing every night. So some nights it's like, okay, we better have rice and beans and Avocados because that'll get us in the Mexican realm. We want to have a good salsa on hand or either a fresh, uh, uh, pick up the guy a or a great, uh, jarred salsa and just be being able to throw those elements together very quickly so that you can eat in a different country every night of the week if you've got or every week. You can sort of shake it up if you want to use over some leftovers. But when we are in a pasta mood, we want to have pasta on hand.

Speaker 2:          44:28          Um, Olana Pesto, we love the combination of pasta, pesto beans. If you know it's one of those 10, 15 minute meals that you boil up the pasta. If you, sometimes you even, even authors who write about food, don't want to be that ambitious to do an got to be, that takes an hour. You just want something, okay, I want something delicious and one in 15 minutes. Right? The combination of the Pesto and wiping and pasta is a staple. And then we throw in some Greens because you want to have some nutritional value in there. So she's a good one for smart kitchen. It's expenditure different. Going into a pasta and go into a salad can go into a curry. I stuff when I got that, I was looking at this really what made this dish special is the fact that dad decided to take it to Thailand.

Speaker 2:          45:09          I smells great, but look, if I looked at these ingredients fall, yeah, I could easily turn this into Chile. You know like this be, this will be my Chilean home. Swash Greens, mushrooms, beans. Yeah. Bands you can go to a completely different place. So the question we'll use at night is like, well, what country do I feel like being in tonight? And often sometimes it's a split because one of us is researching one thing and when this is research and the other thing it's like, oh, he has it. Have couscous was, I've been reading about Moroccan food all day. It's like couscous, why would you want couscous? You need, you need noodles tonight. So that's always a music question to ask yourself. It's like, what country do I want to be in? And then it's like, okay, then you go in and grab everything you have at a huh. Super Fun. Super Fun. So DDS

Speaker 1:          45:51          plating the demonstration played up in the team behind you. I'm just gonna play that. The samples, what I'd like to do now is to open it up to any questions that we might have while the, the authors are here and finishing up the plate up and then we'll have a quick sampling and then we'll do a book signing after that. Uh, so if there are initial questions to start racing your hands, um, if not, I'll just keep gathering because I don't think I don't have this opportunity often. Yes,

Speaker 3:          46:19          just start.

Speaker 2:          46:26          It's totally meant to be flipping through it. You flipped through a to z. Anything that catches your attention, it catches your attention for a reason. I think flipping through it is the absolute best way to read the book. You can read it chronologically, it's laid out in a chronological manner, but you don't have to, I would say pick it up whenever you need inspiration and we wrote it to be there for when you do.

Speaker 1:          46:47          So the question just to repeat it for the audience, that oil on video is that it is or a starting point in the book and I think you captured the graders. There could be but it doesn't have to be and I think that that would be the same for many of the books that you have is I literally was in culinary Igert street just a few days ago, not because of the fact you were here, but I had some questions just around ingredients study to write for a menu for the Montana event and I need a little inspiration and I was not feeling creative at the moment. Help me, Karen, help me out. And so you can definitely use those books at anytime as resources and I think what you're going to find in this one, did you indeed do that even more so because there's so much good stuff in here with all the chef tips, the quotes, amazing. No additional questions from the, from the audience

Speaker 2:          47:31          in the front and then we'll go to the back. Yes. How did you season the roasted vegetables? Yeah, just a little bit of olive oil and salt and pepper. So really simple that way you could really take this base dish here in a variety of direction. So, um, if I was feeling more Mediterranean today, I could have done lemons and Federer, Parmesan and or some champagne vinegar, maybe some Bazell. Um, so keeping your sort of my core roadmap simple. Plus we have leftovers. Today's tie tomorrow can be submitted to ade and it's like a whole new dish we season at home for the exact same reasons. You want the flexibility if you want to be in a different country the next day. If you season it upfront with something that's very identifiable, but this specific cuisine you're going to have, you're going to stay in that country the next day and the next day is it up? We never call it leftovers. We call it the encores.

Speaker 2:          48:31          We are, it's like, yeah, you just, some of that a little bit, it's really interesting to add your question is I know what you're getting at, which is, you know, what do I need to do to get to that end result? And you know you could use butter, you could oil, oil doesn't really matter at this point. You obviously chose oil because it's neutral and it's a little lighter fat, but what you've done really well in this is the technique. You've found a way to diocese in a way that they're consistent size so they're going to cook evenly. You found a way to brown them off so that they still have texture and caramelization but they're not mushy nor are they crunchy. These are the things that make or break a great meal and take a little bit of time to to think through but nice job on that.

Speaker 2:          49:09          There was a question in the back and we're going to repeat the question just so we can get it on the entire process. The entire process when it comes to the research for our books. And this one in particular, you know, we, for this book, we had both a bottom up and a top down approach where the bottom up approach was basically talking to chefs about what they felt was important to know about their creative process, about how they cook and all of them have different specialties is some of them have different countries that they specialize or different techniques that they specialize in something that roots their cuisine and makes it different from anyone else's. And so we wanted to understand from talking to Kyle cannot at single thread about his influences and working in Japan and that Japanese sensibility that he brings to his food in conjunction to the crazy stuff that he's doing with Heston Blumenthal and that he'd learned at elderly.

Speaker 2:          50:09          We're working in elderly, so he sort of brings it all together in a really interesting way. Other people like Rick Bayless from Frontera Grill in Chicago is much more specialized in Mexican cuisine. And so we wanted to really understand that by talking to Rick, we talked to his chef to cuisine, but we really wanted to understand their approach to thinking about things. And the beautiful thing about it is that when you talk to people who are at the best of the best at what they do, they've been doing it in some cases for decades. And that creativity is reflected in evolution. That their cuisine goes through the evolution of their thought process, where they're designing a new menu and had brainstormed a list of adjectives that best described certain dishes. So they organize their menu not by appetizer, entree and dessert, but by characteristic. So it shows the level of thought process that they put into it.

Speaker 2:          50:59          They're also used inspiration by d of different paintings and different works of art in their restaurant. It will come up with dishes that are reflect reflection of that. So, um, the research is extensive in terms of speaking to chefs. We also do extensive research on a restaurant reviews, trying to understand their restaurants from it, from a local critic's perspective. We reviewed their cookbooks, we view their menus. Um, and then we kind of put it all together and kind of bring it all together. We also studied creativity from the ex, uh, from the point of view, various experts on creativity. So we spoke to experts like Michael Gal, the author of how to think like Leonardo Da Vinci and the art of connection on how do you, uh, really bring those elements of creativity, what are the things that we should be looking for? And he is identified some of the key genius thinking attributes of Leonardo Da Vinci. We saw them in the world's most creative chefs. And so I think through that, um, opportunity of really bringing the two together, we saw how chefs, we're the perfect exemplars of some of the best creativity that's going on in the world today and to really take a look at their best practices and really try to translate that for anyone, whether it's a professional chef or a home cook, um, to help you to be more creative when you least feel the inspiration to be creative.

Speaker 1:          52:25          So we have one, one or two more questions. So one thing that I'm taking away from this and I hoping you are as well as the thought and to intentionality, depending on whoever you are that's creating something is immense. And when you are preparing your next meal or when you're at a restaurant, I would say when you're preparing your own meal or someone else's cooking for you specifically, get home, turn off the TV, turn off the distractions, and take a few minutes to really be mindful of the experience that someone else has prepared for you or that you prepared for yourself. And the reason I mentioned that, and this is in the book as well, is music and other distractions can either enhance or completely detract from the experience and knowing the thought that went into just something as simple as a salad. And this is not a simple dish and it was delicious by the way, that roasted mushroom, the winning, the winning hook there that got me to go through x bite was that mushroom. But think about that as you're, as you're creating things and have a conversation with people when you're cooking for them. Because this is what it's all about. And the reason I mentioned turning down the TV is it so easy just to be mindless and just, you know, it's not dining anymore, it's just kind of feeding and we all do that at a time. But thank you for all the work that you've done here. Was there another couple of questions before we line up for signatures?

Speaker 4:          53:39          Yes. So we have some big occasions. Great

Speaker 2:          53:48          question. You know, a lot of times it's, it's very personal. I mean the holidays are times that we need to get together with family or friends, loved ones. And there's a lot of childhood memories that are involved. Um, Andrew and I, our families had different stuffings when we were growing up. Sit down. We have a multiple stuffing celebration, um, this time of year. But a lot of times, you know, there's a sacredness. You don't always want to be. Creativity isn't always a good thing. You know, Daniel Ballou says, if you're making steak free, you let it be steak free. You don't want to get too creative with that. Um, and sometimes there's sacred cows are sacred turkeys when it comes to thanksgiving, then he don't want to mess with. They do want to have a happy Thanksgiving and you know, have it be as peaceful and calm around the table as possible.

Speaker 2:          54:30          You don't want to mess with people's favorite dishes, but there are times that you can take what the essence of Thanksgiving is. And, uh, if you can deconstruct what is it that's important to you? Well, I want to have some pumpkin dessert on the table. It doesn't have to be Pumpkin Pie. And then you can start playing with it. Okay. Am I going to do a pump and tart? Am I going to do a Pumpkin Ravioli? Am I going to make it a side dish? You know, how am I going to play with that? Am I going to come up with a pumpkin cocktail? So you can have, you know, there's a place in New York City where we had, um, a, a Turkey sandwich that was served with a bag of sweet potato chips and a cranberry fizzy drink. And you realize all the flavors of Thanksgiving or right there, but they're in a completely different format.

Speaker 2:          55:13          If you can take the, figure it out, you know, do the deconstruction of what are the flavors that me Christmas to you or Hanukkah to you or Thanksgiving to you and narrow them down. And it's like, okay, well I have to have stuffing or I have to have gravy or whatever your thing is. Sorry. Or should always champagne. Oh, right. So, you know, you can, you can play with that. We have an exercise in the beginning of Stage three in the book where we ask you to think about what your five favorite childhood dishes were and to really analyze the information that's packed in there. Because we think that all of you know more than you think, you know, um, and it's all packed in your favorite childhood dishes. So if you take a minute and just sort of make a mental note and it's like, oh yeah, my mom's blank, or my grandmother's blank, or my father is blank.

Speaker 2:          55:56          When he pulled up the grill and made this for me when I was growing up, I forgot what those dishes were. And then think about what made the dish special to you. So for me it was caramel apples. And you'll see a caramel apple example of different dishes you can make with the combination of apple caramel and nuts that are other than a whole apple on a step. So we've got a solid example. We've got a cocktail example, um, different desserts, you know, an upscale Dysart example using that same set of flavor affinities or flavor chords as we called them, but in a whole different way. And if you take that simple example and you apply it to whatever your favorite flavors are, whether it's tomato basil and a Parmesan cheese or something completely different garlic, ginger and soy sauce, you can take that set of compatible flavors and apply it to a whole host of different dishes. And that will get your creativity going big

Speaker 4:          56:49          quickly. And I would just add one more thing is that, uh, for like, it's like w please Thanksgiving because that's a biggie. Um, when you make your cranberry sauce, take half of it and make it a different way. So have your, have the one that's gonna make everyone happy. Thanksgiving for God sake. But maybe take another one and look up cranberries and think about cranberries and like, I don't think I'll pop some ginger in there, maybe a little tumeric and I'm a little orange zest and that might not be your family's typical one, but then you're have something new. And we went vegetarian five years ago, um, and we were invited to thanksgiving. So guess what, I learned how to make mushroom gravy that year and now, and again, they'll go on five years. I'm still working on mushroom gravy, mushroom gravy, mushroom gravy. So getting this ad you don't have, have the classic thing there, the big, again, it makes everyone happy but then just don't a couple extra dishes and was like, what's two extra dishes at Thanksgiving? You know, you sort of pointed out like, this is new, let's, you know, and that's also a fun way to do it, because also we'll give you a chance to sort of chill out around Thanksgiving and make something New York already in the kitchen anyway, you know? But just do have, excellent,

Speaker 2:          57:53          well, I know we're at time. I know there's more questions. Uh, what I'd like to do is first give both of you a huge round of applause for coming. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          58:00          Great.
