Speaker 1:          02:37          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:51          That was so cool. Thank you, Theresa. Thanks for having me here. Thank you. I just totally nerded out. So, so welcome.

Speaker 3:          03:00          Thank you for coming. Thank you. It's lovely to be here. Um, do you want to talk about what you just played?

Speaker 4:          03:05          Oh yeah, sure. So the first piece I played was very old. It was by a German composer named Bach. He had of many, many children, so he was very prolific in child making and music writing. So that was probably one of his most well known a cello pieces. You guys probably have heard it somewhere before, right? Like Nike commercials and basically anything with a cello, it's like synonymous. Oh, what's that? That's the cello piece. Um, and then after that I was actually the main theme from the new wonder woman series. Um, and I did do the original with Hans Zimmer's, so thank you. So, uh, and it's very exciting that very soon we're going to start working on wonder woman to some music for that. So I'm very excited about that. And that was it. Now I'm sitting here.

Speaker 3:          03:53          Thank you. Well, I am a huge fan of Dina. Um, I actually met her a couple of years ago. I gave her my business card because I was like, I need to meet you. Like, it was a really creepy and stalkerish way. Um, so I was like, Hey, let me interview. Um, so, uh, so thank you for coming. I actually seen her twice in concert. [inaudible] she's amazing. So I wanted to start with really background questions. Like when did you start playing the cello? What made you choose that particular instrument? Was it Kinda like your choice? What's it like forced upon you by your parents? Like what, what was that?

Speaker 4:          04:24          Yes, so, uh, I was born in Shanghai, China, so I was made in China. Um, and my first instrument, like many, many Chinese children was piano. Uh, so I started when I was three years old and then later I moved to the u s my parents are actually both classical musicians, so there are classical music teachers who live in San Diego and they, so they popped me out and then they came to us because they were able to, uh, have an opportunity to go to school in the u s for music at a scholarship. And that was very, very rare. And like post communist China like right after. So they took the opportunity and my grandparents, my mom's parents actually raised me, uh, for a few years while they were here studying. I got really, really large. I weighed when I came to America. I'm not kidding you.

Speaker 4:          05:05          I was like 82 pounds at five years old. That is not normal. Right. So I was like a little round ball. Oh, I play the piano and then I moved here. Uh, and my parents thought that I should play one of the instruments that they knew how to play. Cause obviously that would save money on music lessons. So I started on the violin. I was really bad. I played twinkle, twinkle little star for, I'm again, I'm not exaggerating like six months, like I couldn't, I could not get past twinkle, twinkle little star, like, well, she's not talented. Right. So, um, then I switched to the cello and for some reason, even though it's like kind of similar, it just came a lot more naturally. Um, and, and I seem to like progress pretty quickly. So my dad decided, okay, this is what she's going to play.

Speaker 4:          05:44          And from there on out, I was, I have to say forced to be honest, I was forced to practice eight hours a day every day, which I'm grateful for now. Uh, I didn't have much of a childhood, I have to admit. And I was very, hence probably my love for metal now. It was very like, oh, I hate my life. And my parents. I mean it was, it was really extreme and I've talked about it before, so hopefully they'll forgive me for like, you know, spilling the, the family secrets. But they would like lock me in my room sometimes to practice and they're like, let me out once in a while ago. The bathroom, maybe eat something if I was lucky. Um, but I have to say that type of like very regimented, strict training. Um, really I have to say it did pay off in the end cause like if you don't practice for that many hours every day and we know whether it's cello or swimming or basketball, you don't build that type of muscle memory. So I was like more comfortable playing the cello than really doing anything else. Um, so yeah, to answer your question, I was forced into the family trade, but I'm happy to be here now.

Speaker 3:          06:43          I mean, yeah, that sounds that your, your parents sound both terrifying, but also thank you to your parents for it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No

Speaker 4:          06:49          slightly terrifying. But, but also at the same time, I mean, I don't, I think it actually takes a lot of, uh, a courage and a lot of determination and sacrifice on their part. You know, cause I, when I have babies, I don't have kids yet, but I'm like, I don't know if I can spend that many hours. Like, you know, like yelling at my kids practice

Speaker 3:          07:05          dedication. Yeah. Cool. Um, so, uh, you know, whether it was growing up or now, you know, uh, what do you think where, you know, other than your parents, uh, music influences that, that kind of affected you or that inspire you to like keep playing and, and, uh, you know, whether it's this instrument or, or other type of music. Cause you mentioned metal as well.

Speaker 4:          07:26          Yeah, definitely. So, um, again, growing up because my parents were ultra conservative and just very, very, you know, classical music is good. Anything else? It's a music of the devil. You can't listen to it. So I actually, and of course, what happens when you don't allow people to do something, they get very curious, especially me because I'm really a contrarion in many ways where I'm like, Oh yeah, I'm going to. Um, so, so the very first exposure that I had to like, I guess heavier music or the underground alternative was a Marilyn Manson. And how did this come about? So I was in awe. I was in seventh grade, I suppose, a little bit later in life. I mean, that's not that late in life, but seventh grade. Um, and I, I remember I had this crush on a kid named Luke. He was like a combination of a goth and a nerd.

Speaker 4:          08:11          He was like a Nerdy Goth, right? You've got these really thick coke bottle glasses with like thick, black rooms. Uh, but he also had like long hair, like down to the shoulders and like black lipstick and my, Oh my God, this is kitty. So weird. I love it. And, and, um, the neighborhood we grew up in was not very alternative or like, you know, so everybody was pretty much the same. Very preppy. Uh, like the weird one. You yes. I'm like, he's weird. I'm gonna follow him around at lunch, like, like a little looser, like a stalker. Right. And then, so one day he's like, Hey Tina, have you heard of Marilyn Manson? I'm like, who? She know, I don't know what that is. So he let me borrow his antichrist superstar CD, because back in those days we listened to cds. Good. So, yeah. And I had a boombox in my room that we got at a garage sale from the next door neighbor, so nearby garage sale.

Speaker 4:          08:56          Um, and there's a CD player at the top and I remember I would turn the volume all the way down to like a little bit pat like below one. So like 0.9 volume and put my ear up against the boombox is my parents. I mean I wouldn't be here today, I'd be dead if they heard that. So. And I'd be like, I'm so cool. So that actually had a huge impact on me because I, I mean imagine coming from classical music to, I guess that's like industrial, it's not really metal but like heavy industrial, dark music. And I was just so off music and I was, I was very fascinated by it. I started like trying to like, oh I found a clip. Sorry, I'm going to go way off tangent right now. Stop me. Okay. So all these memories of pouring back. So I found this clip on earrings, like just like the clip, I'm part, there was no actual earring, you know, like the plastic part, that kind of the metal plastic, you know what I'm talking about?

Speaker 4:          09:44          Yeah. I'm like, oh that would make a really cool nose ring. Cause I want it to be cool, but I didn't have any piercings. So I would go to school, I would run into the bathroom and clip this like plastic clip on everything like between like, like a bowl, you know, on my nose. I'm so cool. So anyway, so that Marilyn Manson and then a few years later in high school, my best friend, her name is also Tina and she, uh, she had a guns and roses tape. Oh my gosh, a cassette tape appetite for destruction. So I heard that. Um, and then the third musical influence that I heard, but I only heard the first two tracks of their album was a daft punk CD that I got at yet another garage sale. But it was scratched up. So only the first, it wasn't even first teacher at first track and a half worked. And so I would like listen to it for like a track and a half and then it would like skip and then stop working. I rewind it and just keep listening to it. And that was my musical influence that in classical music.

Speaker 3:          10:37          So go and that actually makes sense. It, if you follow Tina's career, it makes sense because she's really all over the place in a good way. You know, she's not the typical cellist and you know that you would go see, um, at the Disney concert hall, you know, like she does all of this school stuff. Like I, one of the concerts that I saw her at, um, she ended up playing Super Mario brothers, uh, the theme and then all of a sudden went into like a heavy metal version of it. And I freaked out because I was like, this is like, it's like she's dedicating this to me. Like I, it was, it was so big for you, just for you. That's right. Uh, and it was, and it was really cool. So, you know, like, uh, it, it's, it's, you have these, she has albums out, right? Like there's this one called game on where you play a video game music. So, how did that come about and, and, and how do you as a musician, you know, cause you, do you, do you do your own compositions and arrangements for when you're doing a cover and like, you know, putting your own spin on it, like how does that blend of metal and classical come about?

Speaker 4:          11:36          Right, right. So this album that she's talking about, it was actually my first album. I finally got signed to a major label to Sony to almost two years ago. So game on was the first label released album that I did. But actually previous to that I self released nine albums. My myself, I self funded it, I recorded it myself, didn't know what I was doing, but I figured it out along the way. If you listen to like my oldest albums, it's like, well that's really bad, you know, and uh, hopefully it gets a little bit better as I'm figuring out what to do. Um, but I, you know, I released albums that were fully classical and my parents were happy about that. And then I did some like super metal ones. There's one called cello metal because that's just how creative I am. Cello, metal.

Speaker 4:          12:15          Um, and then, uh, so when I got signed to Sony was weird timing because I had planned on doing a music video, music video, sorry, a gay music album. And I've been, since I moved to La, I feel like everyone's in the entertainment industry in some way or another. Um, so I started doing, when I came to college, uh, as like a side gate to make money amongst other things, I try to sell Avon, et cetera. Wasn't very good at that. Um, but I started doing session work and slowly I built that up and I s I ended up playing on a lot of video game, like in the actual soundtrack. So I had thought, oh, maybe I should do some versions of my own, of the stuff that I've played on or some of my favorite game music. Um, and so when Sony sign me, they said, oh, we were thinking that maybe you could do like a video game music album.

Speaker 4:          12:57          Like, no way. Check out my spreadsheet because I love Google spreadsheets. So I already had a spreadsheet of all the music I wanted to do, you know, the tracks. Um, and so it was really one of those situations where it was like, perfect, perfect timing. Um, and so I just kind of picked some of my favorite music. Some of the games that I, I did play a little bit and then some just like epic music that I love, like final fantasy seven. I mean it's just like opulent music. Um, so that's how that kind of came about.

Speaker 3:          13:20          So. Cool. Do you have a favorite video game?

Speaker 4:          13:23          Um, it doesn't count. I don't know if it counts as a video game, but like what I'm playing right now, it's just really bad. I don't know if you guys play home scapes or garden scapes. No. Do you like what's that? It's like my mom plays a two. That's when you know it's bad. I was like telling my mom, oh, I found this thing of like gardens scapes.

Speaker 3:          13:39          Well me too.

Speaker 4:          13:40          I'm like, oh no, I'm like playing the same games as my mom. Um, it's kind of like little matching games and then you can like win points and like upgrade your garden. I know.

Speaker 3:          13:49          Okay. Not Men. I would play it on iPad and your iPhone and stuff. Oh, there you go. We know we have to check it out or promoting current scale now. Um, so yeah, you mentioned you're a album, cello medal and I mean you have songs by like black Sabbath and Metallica slayer. Like it's so, so good. It's these are, these are not just covers, right? Like there's like arrangements I'd go into this that like did you end up, you know, really getting into metal and then it seems like sometimes, correct me if I'm wrong, but like when you're playing the metal versions of songs like you, you kind of treat the cello like a guitar.

Speaker 4:          14:29          Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So when I was listening to that, guns and roses, appetite for destruction, you know, slash I was like, oh my God, I want to be slashed. How do I become slash so, um, I think basically what I did with the electric cello is just try to experiment with it. I use, you know, guitar effects. This is a pedal board metaphor, a guitar player. But I thought that's close enough. You know, it's kind of in the same range. And so, um, yeah, that's exactly what I tried to do. And even with the wonder woman main theme, I sometimes, you know, I would go on youtube and look at the people just upload like the track and there's some comments like, oh, the guitar is cool. I'm like, it's not a guitar, it's cello. But, but at the same time it's good because I want it to sound like a guitar player. So the fact that it's a little bit confusing, it's like both a good and a bad thing, you know?

Speaker 3:          15:08          Yeah, no, then that's true. It's actually, I, because I'm a Nerd, uh, I've also corrected people because there'll be like, oh yeah, I love that little like Guitar Solo in one room. And I'm like, that is a challenge. What are you talking about? Um, so, uh, speaking of wonder woman, um, that is such a cool, that must be such a cool experience, you know? Uh, tell us about that. Like, what was it like to, to get involved, first of all, with, uh, you know, one of my favorite composers of all time, which is Hans Zimmer, you know, and uh, and then junkie XL that, that they made this really cool iconic theme. Well, you know, what was it like and how did that process come about, uh, to get involved, to be involved in such an iconic movie? Okay.

Speaker 4:          15:47          Right. So, um, I think to, to backtrack, the way that I met Hans was actually through youtube. Um, and because my, so my very, very first music video I released it, oh my gosh. Like 10 years ago, I think. Yeah. I'm old. So 10, no, I'm not that old, but 10 years ago, um, it's called Queen Bee and it was my like, metal version of flight of the Bumblebee. I know it's been done before, but you know, I was just starting, I was not very original. But anyway, so, um, I did a metal cover and he actually saw the music video because he spends a lot of time watching youtube videos, like looking at musicians. Um, and his office actually contacted me. Um, and at the time I wasn't my, I was trying to become like a metal cellist might. My life goal was to play with Rammstein and like, that's what, and I thought like, Oh, if I like release this music video, maybe like metal bands will see the video and they'll be like, oh, she should like, come play with us.

Speaker 4:          16:32          So that was my entire purpose. Um, but instead that somehow accidentally segues me into a career in soundtrack work. So now, like the majority of my work here in La, I work on, you know, movie scores, TV scores, video game stuff. Um, and so he saw the video called me. I ended up, uh, the first movie that we worked on together was Sherlock Holmes. I'm the very first one. I remember I walked in, I actually, I had this so bad. If he watches us, please don't get offended, Hon. Sorry. Um, I actually didn't know who he was. So when his assistant call, like I'm calling from Hans Zimmer's office, I'm like, who, what? Um, so I went in, I still didn't know what I was expecting to his office in Santa Monica and they're like, oh, Han's is having lunch in the next building cause there's like all these buildings.

Speaker 4:          17:11          So I went up there and I did recognize Guy Ritchie. They were really having a having lunch. And so I sat down and there's like all these like, you know, Cole celebrity people. And then like me, I'm like, Oh wow, okay. I guess I'm in a good situation. And so that's how we started working together. And then we worked on a bunch of, of inception, a lot of movies after that. Um, and so this one, I think they had actually been experimenting originally they were thinking it'd be a vocal, like a female vocal. And for some reason, you know, they tried different singers. Like it just wasn't quite fitting. And the Han said, oh, we should have Tina come in with their electric cello and do some weird shrieking sounds, you know, like a screaming Amazon. Um, and so I went in and that, I mean, it's a pretty, it's like a simple melody that repeats over and over and over.

Speaker 4:          17:50          I must have, I mean, I literally played it like at least a thousand times over and over and over, but we finally figured it out. And the, um, the theme is actually layered. It's, it's not just one electric cello, but it's like 30 layers of electric cello to get that like really fat. That's all you, yes. It's all me. So yeah, lots of multi tracking. Um, and actually junkie, I, I've never even met him in person. He wasn't actually there. So it was just myself and Hans and then all of Han's is people's entourage. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was, but they both compose the theme, right? I believe so. Yeah. There's a lot of times, there's so many people working on different components of it, so, um, but yeah, definitely.

Speaker 3:          18:27          That's so cool. I mean, I remember the first time I heard that theme was, I think it was Batman v Superman, the movie. And there's that scene where, uh, spoilers, a wonder woman basically saves Batman because she actually has powers. Um, no offense, Batman. I love Batman too. Um, but um, she basically does this and the music comes on and you and I hear the cello and I'm like, oh my God. Like this is like my jam. I was so happy about it. That's so cool. Yay. Um, and uh, speaking of hands up, that's actually one of the best concerts I've been to. And I go to like 30 concerts a year, like it's bad. Um, and Tina was there and along with all these other great studio musicians that, that a Hans brought and they basically just play his scores and that's, that's was such a cool concert. I mean it was, they played everything from inception to Sherlock Holmes. You guys played, obviously you play wonder woman parts of the Caribbean. Like, what was that like and, and what, you know, was that kind of like a dream of you to like, you know, be on stage with the best musicians in the world and like, you know, what, what's that compared to like, you know, what, what you want to do in the future or dreams of yours.

Speaker 4:          19:32          Right, right. So of course it was, I don't know if you've guys have seen it. It's on Netflix, like the uh, live in Prague, like our show that we did in prognosis two tours ago, two years ago. Um, but when Hans for said like, oh, we're thinking of maybe taking this on the road instead of being locked up in a dark room all day, you know, writing music. And I thought, great, because for me, I love studio music, but while I'm still young enough to prance around on stage, I want to take the opportunity to travel, to perform live. Um, and so it was really, really amazing. And we played mostly arenas, which is crazy because we all thought like, are, is anyone going to come? Is it going to be like five people? You know? But it was amazing cause I mean Han's is huge, so all over the world, you know, the arenas are full.

Speaker 4:          20:08          So it was an amazing experience. Um, and prior to that I actually in a past life I was in the Cirque de Solei. Um, and so it was weird to like kind of revisit the same arenas that we played. Um, but with Hans this time and it was just, yeah, I mean, I mean, what can I say? It's really, really, really awesome and there was good food I like, I like free catering it. Okay. What, wait, so you weren't certain display, what would you do? I well, I play the cello. I was kind of like this weird like you where like I look or bad. No, I'm not that flexible. No, I was like a weird cello alien and I was wearing this outfit. I was skinnier then. I mean, I know I'm not large now, but I had um, they put me on a diet and they're like, no, I was the largest person in the entire show.

Speaker 4:          20:47          Like all these, like, like acrobat girls with like eight packs and wait to Jesus Christ. So I would, I would actually paint on like fake abs. So try to like blend in. And I remember one time some, some someone I think, uh, waiting for us outside of the stage shore and they saw me like, oh, you're that jealous man, you are cut. I'm like, it's makeup cause from far away, like if you have really bad like makeup on it, it actually looks like you're super buff and I have a one pack of like nothing, you know, so, and the acrobats are looking at me, they were like working out all day and I'm just eating in catering and I like paint on my abs. Um, but yeah, I was wearing this outfit, it was all Swarovski crystal and it was the Michael Jackson, the immortal tour to slay. So it was actually half owned by the Jackson estate is, well this was after Michael passed. And so instead of, obviously he couldn't do the tour, so we had his vocals and then it was combined with the circus late to add in other elements. And now they have the Michael Jackson Jackson's show in Las Vegas and it's kind of like the smaller version, but the original one that opened was also an arena tour. Um, so yeah, I did that for two years. I was a gypsy.

Speaker 3:          21:46          Crazy. You've done everything and you're so young, you would done everything good for you. Um, so, uh, you have a new album coming out this year or you're working on this year right?

Speaker 4:          21:56          Fully. It'll come out this year. I've only, we won't, we're working on a song number two, so we'll see how it progresses. Okay.

Speaker 3:          22:01          Can you tell us about, can you give us a little bit of a preview for it or,

Speaker 4:          22:04          yeah, well I was like, I was telling during an earlier, like the idea for this album has already changed like five times, but that's part of the creative process. You know, you, you think you have a great idea and then you do it and you're like, wow, this is really horrible. And then you erase it and you start again. Um, so I think we have the general theme down. Um, we're taking, it's not really, I mean it's kind of a cover but not really a cover cause we want, I want it to do original material, but being that I don't sing and it's instrumental music, it is difficult to have something that grasp, you know, it's not radio friendly. So we thought, what if we took some classical pieces but not an entire cover where you just take a short segment like rappers, they sample stuff that's recognizable and then kind of like expand that, explode that into something original and different. Um, so that's what we're working on. So it's kind of, I guess you would call it like classically based cinematic mentally. Of course they'll be some metal elements. Yay. Just for you. Um, and yeah, that's what we're working on. I'm hoping it'll come out around the same time as wonder woman two. That's like our hold a goal for, for the timing.

Speaker 3:          23:04          Cool. Can you tell us anything about the wonder woman music or no, no spoilers. Contracts. I know. I got it. I got it. Um, okay. So, um, I wanted to ask about, um, you know, you perform with Han's, like are there collaborators that you work with that just was, you know, it was a very meaningful thing to you or, or is there somebody that you dream of working with in the future that you're like, oh, I would die if I work with, right,

Speaker 4:          23:25          yes. So I remember how I said that, that first music video that I made and I spent every penny that I had on at the time and I was like broke after, um, uh, this metal music video. I was hoping that Rammstein would see it. I still really would love to work with them. Um, but I don't want to read, my thing is I don't want to, I never reach out to people and say, Hey, like I would've worked with you because I tried to like, wait, like manifest it and like, hopefully eventually it'll somehow it'll just come or we'll have like mutual friends or something weird will happen. Um, so my dream is that one day I'll be able to play with Rammstein, um, hello rom sign,

Speaker 3:          23:57          but we'll send this to him. Um, and then, um, you were just a nom recently. Yes. Um, and for those of you that don't know you, if you could explain what that is, but also, um, did you have, um, Tina actually has an instrument line, like, cause she does everything. So can you talk a little bit about that as well?

Speaker 4:          24:15          Yes. So in addition to music, uh, I very actually very passionate about entrepreneurship and investing in, but that's a whole other thing that we won't go into today. But one of my, I guess it's side businesses, uh, is a line of instruments, uh, Bose and pickups for acoustic string instruments. Um, so I, I have a couple of different cello models, classical cello models. Um, we offer a Bose and both wood and carbon fiber and like custom colors. Uh, you could even get like the hair here. This is actually horse hair, but don't worry, no horses were harmed in the making of any of these bows. And we dye them like all kinds of different colors. Um, and so that's just something that I also do on the side.

Speaker 3:          24:52          What's the difference between, you know, horsehair and other things that are other types of hair that are used for both? Usually yes.

Speaker 4:          24:59          On the Bose that I played with the electric cello. I actually try not to go too crazy today because it's noon and a Monday, so I don't want to be too extra. But if I play really, really hard and I use a normal bau, I'll literally destroy like one bow every 15 minutes maybe. Because if you hit it really hard, all the hairs will break. And so for actually that cello, when I play, I usually use fishing wire because it's, it's like plastic, so it doesn't sound as good. But um, it's, it lasts a lot longer again, since the cost, like $80, usually about 80 per rehire hair. Uh, but for the classical cello, I do use the traditional horse hair on the Bose. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          25:32          And, um, I want to talk about the difference between when, you know, cause I actually grew up playing the cello, this one, how, you know, how did you transition to doing electric and, and what do you think is, you know, what were the challenges or what are the difference or what's better or worse between, between both instruments?

Speaker 4:          25:48          Right, right. Um, I always tell people the, um, if you compare it to a classical guitar and electric guitar, it's, that's exactly the same. So yeah, I mean you're, the frets are in the same place. Uh, but as far as, obviously when I play this cello, I'm sitting and when I play that at standing and it's actually more difficult to play the electric cello in tune because your whole body, as you can see, it's just one end pin. So it's kind of like a tripod situation where my legs are like this, right. And that, and you're kind of like trying to move with it so it doesn't fall over. Because when I started it took me about two years to figure out how to play it without looking super awkward. I'm sure. I still look awkward, but um, cause there's not, there's, there's some people, there's a lot of people who play electric violin. There's some people who play electric cello, but it's still not a super popular thing I guess. So I was really trying to figure out how to, how to do it, you know, and to be able to stand so he can be a little bit more mobile instead of just sitting all the time.

Speaker 3:          26:40          If you're trying to hit the right notes and you're playing like, you know, and you're moving around

Speaker 4:          26:44          like how'd, yeah. And there's the right now. Right, right, right. And there's no frets. It's muscle memory. So it genuinely, it took me like two years of nonstop practice on that one, just to not sound horrible. Yeah. So awesome.

Speaker 3:          26:56          Um, and so I mentioned I grew up playing the cello. I haven't played in years. So for somebody like me, no, definitely not, especially after she played. Um, so, uh, for somebody like me that is you or you know, somebody that's a beginner that's hoping to play or, you know, it like, for me, it seems very daunting to get back into this just because as you mentioned earlier, there's like, you know, it takes discipline and, and you know, what, what would, what advice would you give people like me and beginner musicians that, or what, what, you know, tips or what do you do to not get uninspired and keep playing? Right. I think

Speaker 4:          27:29          everything's just about consistency. And I'm not gonna lie and say, you know, you're always going to want to practice. I don't even want to practice sometimes, you know, but I have like the internal Asian tiger parents, like already in my brain. So even if I don't want to, I'm like, I have to, you know, like I have to. So, um, if you just force yourself to be a consistent, and I'm not saying eight hours a day, cause we all have lives, you know, and I don't do eight hours a day anymore. Um, but even if it's like a good 30 minutes, like really focus 30 minutes every day or an hour, um, whether you're learning cello or anything else, it does come pretty quickly, but it's mostly about consistency,

Speaker 3:          28:02          you know. Yeah. Okay. We'll suit, but thank you. Okay. Um, so, um, we actually only have time for one more question unfortunately. Uh, but um, and then Tina is going to perform one more song and uh, and then I think of some good questions cause we'll open up the floor to audience questions. Um, so, uh, I wanted to also ask about, um, you had a lot of partnerships with brands and that's interesting, you know, for a musician like a, can you, can you tell us about that? I think a, you work with Bentley last year, you're working with Ritz Carlton, like what's that like and how do those things happen? Like that's so cool.

Speaker 4:          28:35          Great. Thank you. Uh, definitely very grateful for that. Um, and again, I don't, I don't actually have, I don't reach out. Usually. Not usually. I never, I don't reach out to, to brands, you know, I don't have someone pursuing it for me, but, so these happen organically, which I think is the best way for things to happen. Um, and so the Bentley Partnership, actually the marketing director, Mike Sayer of Bentley in the UK, he came to one of my shows and then for some reason he liked Instagram messaged me. But you know what, Instagram, if we don't follow them, it goes to your archived messages. So I like didn't see his messages for months. Right. And I think finally he emailed me, he's like, oh, like I tried to message you but you ignored me. You know, I'm a messaging you do the wrong way. You should have given you a business card.

Speaker 4:          29:14          Like I did. No, he came to the show, but then he didn't come like in person, you know, he didn't leave a card like, like she did. Um, so anyway, we connected. Uh, and then last year I did four performances for Bentley. I actually wrote the music, I scored a commercial for them for the new Ben, take a hybrid, which was their SUV hybrid SUV, um, which works with idea of like, you know, taking something old and, uh, you know, the Bentleys turning a hundred years old this year. So it's a very old company. So taking something that's old, like this cello made an 1880 in Paris, France. Um, and transforming it and making it something modern electric with the, you know, with the hybrid SUV. Um, so we did that and that was a great partnership for a year. And then this year, uh, I am a brand partner with the Ritz Carlton.

Speaker 4:          29:57          Um, so I'll be visiting some of their different resorts. I know, awful job, uh, visiting the resorts and getting inspired by, you know, the locations, experiences, the food that we'll have there, um, and taking that and composing like a kind of a soundtrack, a theme song for each location. Um, and so, yeah, and then playing a little bit, a playing like a very short show at each one. So I don't know, I'm super excited about it. We have a meeting on Wednesday, you know, to, to plan the schedule for this year. Cool. Man, that sounds like a nice part of the job. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I love to travel. I love to eat. I love to play music. So cool. Oh, am I fancy? Rambo gets to come to yeah, yeah, yeah. Hopefully he doesn't get in trouble at work though. He's supposed to be at work right now. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi.

Speaker 5:          30:40          So first of all, thanks for coming out and you know, thanks for having us. Oh, of course. Thank you. That was wonderful. Um, yeah, I saw you're playing not just the cello, but also the air. Whew. Yes. Uh Huh. And I was just wondering if you had some thoughts like how they compare and contrast the spirit of the instrument.

Speaker 4:          30:57          Right. So the era, who was that? Um, you know, the tall, thin, Chinese thing, um, and it's made out of a rosewood and snake skin. Um, and I don't really know. I mean, there's a, there's a fingerboard if you know, so it's kind of similar to the cello, but the strings are actually suspended in the air. I wish I brought one to show you guys. So there's actually, you're not actually pressing against anything, so it's just a string. Um, and it's, I don't know. I don't really, I don't know even know if I play it properly. I'm self taught. So I, I, I bought one. Um, actually, wait, do we have time if I tell a really quick story about how I learned to play the air? Who, yes. I was doing this concert with the Golden State pops orchestra and they were doing a video game, music concert and I was already playing a g, I don't know if you guys played journey the no.

Speaker 4:          31:41          Yeah. So I, yeah, I asked him injury. So I did the original, uh, I play the Cello Solos for that game. And so we were playing journey. It's like, oh, Tina, since you're playing in the concert, you're going to be there already and you're Chinese. Do you play the Chinese air? Who, you know, cause all Chinese people played there. Who? Um, but I thought, oh, like what is it? They're like, yeah, we have this game and a features the air who, and I thought, wow, another opportunity to be featured on stage. Yeah, I want to do that. I could wear something Chinese. That'll be really fun. But I had, I never played the air who before? So I lied. I lied. I lied. I said, yeah, I could play the air. Who is just, if you could just send me the music ahead of time. So I get, and there was still like two weeks till the concert, which is not that much time.

Speaker 4:          32:18          Um, and so I got off the phone, got on Craig's list. So searching air, who ere, who? Nobody. There was no air hose for sale. So I finally found a store in Texas, in Austin, Texas. I had air who's with like overnight shipping, so I pay like $100 extra for shipping. It arrived. I practiced every night. I didn't sleep. I was like trying to learn. I was watching youtube videos, like how to play the air, who, um, and I, I think I kind of did. Okay. We use a lot of reverb, um, and the concert and it was, it was pretty simple. It wasn't a super complicated part thing, thankfully. Um, so that's how I play the air. Who, so when you asked me about the air, who I really am not educated on actually what it's supposed to sound like. I'm, it sounds very ethnic I guess cause the tonality is different. Um,

Speaker 6:          33:00          but it's still like continuous pitch and everything. So I guess you had faith in yourself because you knew like the principals

Speaker 4:          33:05          yes. The principles and you just kind of slide around. If you miss it. It's like I meant to do that as part of the, it's part of the Chinese ness of it, you know, it's like wow. Right. Um, and it's, it is, it is very forgiving them that way. Yeah. Cool. Next question.

Speaker 6:          33:22          Um, do you have anything else you can say about, uh, working on journey with Austin? Like, um, you know, what you think about, uh, having such like, evocative visuals to go with your music and those kinds of things?

Speaker 4:          33:32          Yeah. So when we started working on journey, I mean, it was so many years ago, I met Austin through USC, uh, at school. Um, and we had no idea it was gonna turn out to be such a success. You know, it was the first video game every ever nominated for best soundtrack for a grammy. Um, but when we did it, like he was still in his old studio, which was literally, it was just like a room and like, you know, we were both just slumming it and like trying to figure out what to do. And so I had, we both had no idea that would turn out to be such a big, um, I guess a successful game. Um, and yeah, I remember I just went to a studio a few times. We will lay trial, different ideas again, lots of reverb and I saw some of the early visuals, but it wasn't, it was much later that it was actually placed into the game. So yeah, it was fun. It was great. And I still work with Austin, so it's good. Yeah, he just wrote to me a Instagram messaged me right before I got up here. So you don't have him blocked? Fortunately we don't have him blocked. I don't, I don't have him black. No, no. Isn't it?

Speaker 7:          34:30          Okay.

Speaker 4:          34:31          Oh, right here. Cheery.

Speaker 7:          34:34          Okay.

Speaker 6:          34:34          Thanks. Uh, the effects of the wonder woman soundtrack. I mean, I love that. Oh. Um, made me think a little bit of like Les Claypool or Tom Real, like, I'm curious what it, what it's like to learn the classical style versus kind of try to push the envelope of what an instrument is capable of. Like is there any overlap with some of those artists or are you just out there on your own?

Speaker 4:          34:58          Yeah, definitely. I mean, when I started a, again, I, youtube was like my teachers. So when I first got my electric cello, I think it was about, yeah, about 11 years ago when I was in college, um, I bought an electric cello with a credit card, you know, from Yamaha. Uh, and then I was like, okay, how, what do I do with this? So I would just go on Youtube and watch guitar tutorials and try to like, cause the tone, the tonality again is very, very different from a classical instrument. Um, and then also being able to improvise because most of us classical musicians, um, are not taught to improvise. You play exactly what you're told to play and you play it the same way every time. Right? So it's a, it was, it was more of like a mental thing even rather than a physical cause once you wrap your head around, you can do you want, you know, you can express yourself to the music.

Speaker 4:          35:39          And then just learning some different scale pat like scalar patterns and passages, um, that you can use in like your solos or whatnot. Uh, and then just playing around with pedals. I actually went full digital very, very recently. This is from a line six, but I used to, I was like a big collector of pedal, so like analog pedals. Um, and I used to love those. But after a while there's some feedback issues, you know, and now with new technology, um, this unit right here, uh, it's, it's both the APP modeler. So instead of having like a giant amplifier, you know, being carried in here, um, I just, everything is processed through this little pedal board. So all the effects, all this amp sounds, everything is in there. So it's really, really convenient. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          36:15          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          36:17          Uh, going off of that, uh, is that basically you're like piece of equipment you can't live without or do you have something that you really, really love that you take everyday? This is, this is it now. Like before when I did shows, oh my gosh, I had to hire like a, you know, a company cause these amps are so heavy. And of course I like to be melodramatic. I have lots of like different amps. So they come in like with a big truck, unload everything, and then all my pedals and this or that. And now this little thing on the floor, you just put it in a backpack. Uh, you know, I don't carry it. My Fiance Rambo carries it, but still it's easier. It's easier for me. It's easier for him and he likes it too. Right. Okay. Good answer. Next question. Hi, thanks very much for coming.

Speaker 4:          36:55          You're music is amazing. Thank you. Um, I what you're talking about with what you've been doing with the electric cello reminds me a lot of, um, have you ever heard of Ronald Yankees? He's a keyboardist. Um, I've seen some of his videos on youtube. Um, but he has this one song that's called guitar sounds that he's using a keyboard. I actually thought the first time I heard it that it was just entirely electric guitar. Right. And I was so surprised when I learned that it was actually a keyboard. So it might be something interesting for you to look into because he's doing something similar. Is it with a keyboard that you do with the electric cello and, yeah, definitely. Yeah. We'll run. We'll junkies. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Maybe you can play with him and Ramstein one day. Yeah, that'd be really cool. Signs mine. I'm not sure how amazing concert opportunity, but I don't, I mean, you don't reach out to him, so he would have to find, you.

Speaker 4:          37:47          No, know I check other artists out and stuff, but it's usually for like people that like, you know, I don't know. I don't know what it is. I just feel like energetically is that, is that wrong? Should I be like, I just don't want to be one of those people like, oh, work with me please. I'll play cello for you. Balance. There's a balance. You know, I try to, it's more of like dangling the carrot. Like you could reach out to Ramstein is all I'm saying. Hmm. Yeah. But I'd be like heart, so embarrassing. Heartbroken if they said no, thank you. But then nine, but then they're not cool. Okay. That's fine. I'll give it five more years and then, okay, next question. So, uh, speaking of, um, metal, uh, what are you listening to? Recently?

Speaker 4:          38:25          Not a lot of metal recently. I have to be honest. So, uh, recently I've been obsessed with financial, a youtube videos. I have them on a playlist and I listened to them every, if I'm putting on makeup. Uh, but as far as like metal, obviously rom sign is like my big, uh, obsession, obsession. And I'm, I'm more into like when you mentioned earlier about my cello metal album, more of the classic, uh, old school metal. Like now I'm honestly, I haven't heard a lot of like new, new bands that I'm really, really into. Huh? White Chapel. Yeah, the white chapel is cool, you know, but I'm like old school stuff, black sabbath, Metallica and whatnot, but more, more industrial metal for sure. Yeah, it'd be so cool. Have you played with the, like there's these newer bands, I don't know if you were thinking about these, but like behemoth and like, like a, you know, sleep, like there's just like more, you know, newer bands that I think would love, I'm going to hook you guys up with them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's going to happen

Speaker 7:          39:20          next.

Speaker 8:          39:23          Hi. Hello. So I'm a pianist and a huge gamer. And I remember reading on the Bio intro that you also worked with League of legends. I'm kind of curious how that went.

Speaker 4:          39:32          Oh yeah. So I play, oh my gosh, I forgot what year was, I think it was three championships ago when it was in la at the staple center. Do you remember? I think it was a few years ago. Um, they just reached out and said, uh, would you want to play for the, for the championship? So we opened it, uh, it was myself, West Berlin from limp Bizkit. Um, and then the drummer from a combat Christ who just left the band and then crystal, crystal method and an orchestra. So it was like this big, like not a mess. So it was like organized mess of just stuff. Um, and yeah, it was a lot of fun.

Speaker 7:          40:06          Okay.

Speaker 4:          40:06          And my brother was really, my little brother, he's a huge league of legends player, Him and his wife. So they were like totally geeking out. And they, I remember they gave us a gift bag and there's just like stuffed animal thing from, and then they're like, oh my God, can I have it? I'm like, sure, you can have it. So they were happy about it. I think they were more excited than I was. You know, you also have a god of war music video coming out, right? Actually, yeah. It just, it came out I believe last month. Um, so yeah, I did a cover of the God, a god of war. I tried to play the game. I'm not very good at it, but it's good. But it's hard. Really hard. Oh my goodness. But yes, the, the video is out on youtube now. It's really cool. You guys check it out.

Speaker 7:          40:40          Thank you.

Speaker 4:          40:42          But time for one more question.

Speaker 7:          40:44          Okay.

Speaker 4:          40:45          This smells good in here as, yeah, there's that curry. Is that it? We good? Okay. Well thank you. Good. Well, you guys, uh, it, can you tell, can you tell people where they can find you on the internets? Yeah. So Tina, whoa. Gee, you, Oh, uh, if you just go to [inaudible] dot com that is my website and there's links to everything I'm on, you know, the usual Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube. I don't need to tell you guys. If you just Google it, you can write to me. Oh, Google her. Right? Yeah. But thank you so much for coming. That was so awesome. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          41:19          Yeah.
