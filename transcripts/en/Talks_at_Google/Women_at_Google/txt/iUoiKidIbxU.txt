Speaker 1:          00:02          Hi everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Katie Gray and I work at the uh, presentation design from Duarte were where these ladies lead and I actually used to work at Google so it's exciting to be back here and I'm honored to introduce them. Um, so Nancy Duarte, she's a CEO of Duarte. It's a firm that's created over a quarter of a million presentations over the past 28 years in Silicon Valley. And Nancy has written five best selling books about using visual storytelling in business communications, including resonate and slide ology. And the latest book aluminate, which she'll be talking about today. Her work has been featured in fortune wire, the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, many, many other places. And then Patti Sanchez is the chief strategy officer of Duarte. She has over 25 years of experience leading transformative marketing initiatives for global brands like Adobe, Cisco, Ericsson, Nike, Vm ware, Ge, and many more.

Speaker 1:          00:57          And her lifelong passion is helping communicators engage empathetically and authentically. So Nancy and Patty are going to speak to you about their new book, illuminate, ignite change through speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols. If any of you have tried to convince a group of people to go on a long, arduous journey somewhere, even though you knew it was worth it, but you had to convince them, then this book is for you. Uh, the book is a result of years of research into many, many business case studies from the likes of Steve Jobs or Mary Barra or Lou Gerstner, uh, at IBM. And it's very informative. Um, I think were very much enjoy it. And today you're going to hear about some key principles in that book to help you lead people to a vision. So with that, I'd like to welcome Nancy Duarte and Patti Sanchez.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Thanks Katie. Katie Gray. I love working with her and I also love talking, right? So she might know, I love talking about storytelling. As Katie said, we're big fans of visual storytelling at Duarte. And I assume that you're all fans of it to some degree, which is why you're here. And a lot of people recognize the power of storytelling as a communication tool, especially for marketers. A lot of brands use storytelling to create affection for their products and to get people to fall in love with their companies and the things that they offer. But what a lot of people maybe don't realize is that storytelling is actually a leadership tool. And so we're going to talk to you today about how leaders and people like you can use storytelling to inspire others to do big things. And really we think that the job of a leader is to create the future.

Speaker 1:          02:37          So what does that really mean? Well, first of all, I think it's the difference between a manager and a leader is that a manager is somebody who maintains what is, they just keep the current thing going. A leader is somebody who creates what could be, they make something new possible that didn't exist before and it's not an easy thing to do to create something new. And you may not even think of yourself as a leader, but if you're doing anything that makes a new future possible, then you are a leader. Your, your taking people into a territory that they've never been in before, which can be creating a new feature in launching it to the world. It can be building a process of some kind. It can be a hiring or training people. All of those things create a capability that didn't exist before to make something new.

Speaker 1:          03:25          The challenges that, that new future you're trying to bring into being actually represents change because you're envisioning something that didn't yet exist. You're going to have to get other people to agree that this new thing is a good idea and to get them to help you make it a reality. And that's not easy because most people don't like change. Uh, you know, some of you might actually be kind of comfortable with change, especially if you have an entrepreneurial kind of spirit. So then maybe the, the white space excites you that the average human being is frightened by that. They're frightened by the unknown because it requires them to do things, to learn things that they don't understand and that stretchy. And so whenever you introduce a new idea, you're effectively asking people to do something differently than what they've done before. And most people are going to resist that in some way.

Speaker 1:          04:17          And it may not even look like outright a revolt to you. It might just sound like doubt. They might say, how do we know that the best idea or how do we know it's better than the way things happen right now? Or maybe the way we used to do things was the right way to do things. And all of those are signs that they're going to resist this change. And so if you have an idea and you want to motivate people to help you make that idea reality, you actually have to have a plan for how you're going to lead them on what we call a venture of venture into the future. So venture is an interesting word because it has two meanings, especially in Silicon Valley. A lot of people think of a venture is sort of like a startup. You know, you're, it's a noun that means it's a new thing.

Speaker 1:          05:02          But adventure is also a verb. It's actually the act of going somewhere. And it's also sort of like metaphorically and adventure and expedition into a territory that people haven't been in before. So if you think about traveling to a place you've never been to before, what is helpful? It's often helpful to have a map some way to visually understand where you are and where you need to go and what the path might be between them. So what is a map of a venture into the future potentially look like what we think there's a common symbol in business that actually describes what this journey looks like and it's the s curve of innovation. And what it does is it describes the life cycle of a business or have an idea from its beginning to its end from it start to its growth to its maturity. And the challenge is that when that idea or the organization that's created that reaches maturity, then stagnation sets in.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Because as I said, people don't like change. So they're going to kind of like dig in their heels and say, let's just enjoy the way things are. Like now that we've got it working, let's just ride us. But if you don't evolve, if that idea doesn't continue to grow and evolve, then that stagnation can lead to decline or even death, this downward slide. So it's the job of a leader to imagine another future and lead another venture to go there and to do it again and to do it again. Because for organizations and even people to thrive, they have to constantly reinvent themselves. So what leaders have to do is figure out how to bring people along with them. And we've worked with all kinds of leaders in our years of consulting at Duarte and, and, and before that. And we've studied what the greatest leaders do to bring people along with them.

Speaker 1:          06:56          And we found that they're all great communicators, but they also use specific kinds of communication tools to bring people along with them. So we're going to talk a little bit about those. This is what we consider the toolkit that great leaders use to bring people along with them on that venture into the future. The first is telling stories. They also deliver speeches and they hold ceremonies. So stories are a great communication tool because they engage people, they make us feel something. If you watch a really interesting movie, you know that you get caught up in it and you have all the fields, you know the, the joy and the pain and the fear. And the same is true of stories that we tell in our lives. And that leaders can tell is a way to create an emotional connection with the people that they're talking to.

Speaker 1:          07:46          So they cause us to feel something. And actually when I'm telling you a story, uh, my brainwaves actually start to align with yours or yours align with mine because I'm feeling we're feeling the same thing together at the same time. And that same connection happens between the people who are all hearing the story together. So it's actually a way to unite groups of people around a common experience. Now, another reason why stories are really powerful tool for leading people is because stories are about change fundamentally at their heart. Any story is about a person who has to go through a journey of some kind and ultimately is transformed by it. And that's really what a definition of a story is. And there's a lot of confusion out there. A lot of people talking about story and saying that they're storytellers, uh, when we don't think they're necessarily true stories that they're communicating.

Speaker 1:          08:39          So this is the definition in its purest form of story. It goes all the way back to Aristotle and he said, a story has three parts. It has a beginning, a middle and enhance. In the beginning we meet the likable hero. This is the protagonist. This is the person who's just trying to do life. And then something happens and inciting incident, they call it, uh, that the rows, that hero's world off balance and usually, uh, actually causes them to leave that place, that home and go somewhere new. And in the process of traveling from what they know to this new territory, they encounter all kinds of roadblocks. In the middle of that story because it's all new territory. They might have to fight monsters or aliens and they even are challenged to their inner core and often end up questioning who they are and what they're capable of, but ultimately at the end of the story, through grit and determination, the overcome those obstacles and they come out the other side different transformed.

Speaker 1:          09:42          So that's why stories are actually a really powerful way to help people cope with change because they described the process of change itself. Now there's another tool that leaders use. Whoops. Before that, this is actually the shape of a story and what you can see here is that the middle of the story is where all the action happens. Literally action. The rising action increases tension and the falling action releases that tension and it's that increase of tension and the release of tension that keeps us engaged in the story. It creates contrast. Now, as I was about to say, there's another tool that leaders use to communicate, and you probably recognize this. You may do it yourself and not realize that you're giving a speech. But speeches are not just the big talks, like the vision thing. You know when when the leader stands up in front of the organization and says, this is where we're going this year, uh, speech is also a progress update.

Speaker 1:          10:39          You know, here's where we are in our project, here's what we're going to do next. A speech is also an announcement about good news or bad news. All of those are opportunities not to just, not just to inform people about what's happening and what's next, but also to inspire them and engage them. Now we've studied also storytelling principles and how they can be applied to speeches. And a few years ago, Nancy made an incredible discovery that there's a pattern to those speeches that the greatest communicators give and so she can do a better job of explaining it. So I'm going to send her up. So after spending about four years studying storytelling, I was wondering why some speeches have this cadence and a rhythm to it. It's like it builds tension and released it and it would build tension and release. It was just you were drawn in. So after doing a journey through story and then going through the hundred top best speeches of all time, I actually found what that pattern is and it is based in the tension and release of storytelling. And so I want to show you the shape that I discovered. This is a structural shape over time. I mean it has a beginning, a middle and an end. And that pulsing in the cadence is the building of tension and releasing it from storytelling.

Speaker 2:          11:54          Now this has a three act structure just like a great story does. So the beginning of any, I'm going to say presentations, but this works for any type of communication work from email. This could work for a blog post and helps me get my husband to do tours on the weekend. Like it works. It persuades. Um, so, uh, the beginning is you need to establish what is and what you're doing is you're basically, you're basically saying, what's our shared truth? This is what we all believe as true. This is the state of the union. This is the budget, this is where we're at financially. That's kind of what you do. And then what happens is you insert what could be, and this is like the inciting incident in a story. Suddenly your world is out of balance. And that gap between what is and what could be winds up being, what gets resolved through the rest of your talk.

Speaker 2:          12:38          The middle moves back and forth structurally between what is, what could be, what is and what could be. So the human brain is wired for contrast and we can actually see the gap. The audience can see, oh, if that's what currently is, but this is what could be suddenly what is isn't. It is an interesting and what could be is more appealing. So that's how it works as a structural tool. Um, the last vertical line is the call to action and every talk should have won, but you shouldn't end there. You should end with the new bliss. This is you describing this future state that's going to be amazing if everyone adopts your idea. It's the new bliss, the new norm. So once I had this shape, I've analyzed so many talks. I want to just show you some, I have, um, uh, I've done a ted talk that goes into detail, but I just want to show you some quickly, um, um, because we've analyzed a ton of them.

Speaker 2:          13:27          So we have a Margaret Thatcher in her iron lady speech. You can see she starts off with what is, she's pretty rapid. Um, when she talked to parliament, it was a kind of this one, one punch to punch. Like what is, what could be, what is what could be all the time. So you can see she starts off with what is and moves back and forth between what is and what could be ending high end to the right, stating the new bliss. Um, Richard Fineman, very famous caltech professor, um, he was a physics professor and kids would like run across campus to see his class, even if they didn't need to take it. He was known as the great explainer. He did a law of gravity speech and you could see it's a technical speech, yet it moves really rapidly between what is and what could be Steve Jobs, iPhone launch speech.

Speaker 2:          14:09          He has a heightened sense of what could be, um, in all of his speeches. But it does move back and forth between what is and what could be. And of course, Dr King's very famous. I have a dream speech also starts off with what is moves back and forth. And you can see the frequency. You get really tight, about two thirds in, um, that was his very famous, I have a dream sequence. I have a dream that one day I have a dream that one day. What's interesting is some of the most beloved parts of our most beloved speeches are the gap between what is and what could be at the phrase level as they move back and forth between. I have a dream that one day he did not call this the, I have a dream speech. He actually called it the fierce urgency of now that was the actual official title.

Speaker 2:          14:47          The people named at the, I have a dream speech because of this very beloved. I'm sequence right here. So those are pretty lofty people and you're like, but I just work at Google. I just had this thing I need to do. I'm not driving the civil rights movements. I'll bring it closer to home. Using an example of a female, and it's my 11 year old niece, she wrote a letter to a dad because she wanted a mouse now and then an 11 year old mind. This is the most important thing in her life right now. So she writes an impassioned plea that follows the form perfectly. She says, Dear Dad, we want a mouse. And you might say they're stinky, but they're not. If you put special drops in their water, you might say that they're mean, but you rarely find an aggressive mouse. If they do bite, it's usually just a curiosity.

Speaker 2:          15:29          Nebel I know you will not want to pay for it. Sophie and I have that covered. We've saved our birthday money so we can pay for the mouse and everything else and you will not have to pay a single cent. Also the mouse will be in Sophie's or my rooms. You will not have to see it all the time. And the new bliss is we will respect any decision you make. They got the mouse. So you can see what's interesting to me is it's almost like we are hardwired. She's not seeing my book's come to my workshop. I did not design this letter for her. She wanted it so bad. She used a persuasive story pattern with the tension and release of story. So it's amazing when you really need to give an impassioned plea how important that is. So one of the third story based concepts that we're introducing into the business vernacular is the idea of ceremonies and ceremonies.

Speaker 2:          16:19          Some of the oldest artifacts we can find are actually artifacts that were used in ritual because of a, a group of people felt they needed communal catharsis around their community. And so it's also based in the same three x structure. That story is. But the naming conventions are different. We looked at the rights of passage because that is the most common in society today. A marriage, a graduation, a bar Mitzvah. Um, but because we were both married to Hispanic men, we're going to use the Keaton Yada as an example. And what that is is, is when a young girl turns 15, she goes through a rights of passage, similar to a bar Mitzvah, but she comes in a little flat shoes and a drabby little dress and she's carrying a Dolly. So what she's doing is she's actually going to be separating from that version of her identity.

Speaker 2:          17:10          She goes through a ceremony and she transitions. The minute the ceremony is done, suddenly she's a woman. Okay? So she gets rid of her doll, she gets to wear high heels, puts on a little Tiara, and she's a woman. Now, all that happened was three minutes of time. She went from being a little girl and suddenly she's a woman just because of the ceremony of ceremonies. What they do is they mark endings and beginnings. This is over. I'm not a little girl. I've let go of my girlish things and I am a woman now, we'll corporations need to practice the concept of endings and beginnings because when you're trying to transform a collective consciousness of people, there are things that end and there are things that begin again, it's very important to understand endings and beginnings and the power that they hold. If people can let go of the old, they're more willing to embrace the new. And we have a case study in a minute about that. So this is the basic toolkit that communicators need as you're driving your own teams. And I'll bring a patty back up here again to talk about

Speaker 1:          18:12          how to do that. Yeah, she has, I lose my shoe. Well, that toolkit that Nancy, uh, recap just there is what we call a torch bearers toolkit. And the reason we use the word torchbearer is because it's the job of a leader to eliminate the path between the present and the future. You know, again, when you think about this metaphorically as an expedition to a place people have never been to before, into the unknown, uh, metaphorically, that unknown is sort of a dark and scary place to people. Or at least it's foggy. It's hard for them to visualize it and to understand it and feel safe going there. So through effective communication leaders of basically like that path so that people can see where they need to go and how to get there. And if leaders communicate really well, they create moments that move people, moments that make people feel bigger and more capable than they realize that they were the create the capacity for people to do things that they didn't realize they could do.

Speaker 1:          19:11          But the bigger your idea is, the more change you're going to ask people to make. And the more change you ask people to make, the more you're going to have to persuade them to actually go there. Which means you're going to have to communicate over and over and over because transformational change doesn't happen overnight, but it's going to take is actually a movement. And what is a movement anyway? You know, what movement is, is uh, a massive group of people going somewhere together, usually over a long period of time. It can be weeks, but often it's months or years or even decades. And we've had many leaders say to us, they wanted to create movements around their ideas. And that launched us on this quest to understand how movements actually happened and what they really look like. And so as we mapped the forms that communication can take the shape of a story, the shape of a speech, we wondered is there actually a shape to a movement too?

Speaker 1:          20:08          And we studied business movements like an open source. We studied social movements like civil rights and we looked at all the things that leaders did, all the communication that they gave and, and how that unfolded over time. And we discovered that they do actually follow a shape which is magically the s curve of innovation, which is basically mapping the path between what is the present state and what could be, which is the future. But we also discovered that those movements follow a story structure too. Just like the communication that you use to move people, and so this is that story structure of a movement which we call a venture escape. It's that landscape of the venture into the, so it has three acts, just like a story with five stages in the first act or the dream and leap stages, dream happens when you the leader, whoever's the advocate for an idea declares the vision.

Speaker 1:          20:59          You say, this is what I see, this is where I want us to go. Let's go there. But immediately as soon as you communicate that vision, people are faced with a choice about whether they're going to say, yes, I'm in, or whether they're going to say no, I'm out. So they have a choice to commit or resist. And how well you communicate directly affects how likely they are to say yes. And when they do say yes, when they leap into this venture with you, then the middle of the story starts to unfold in the middle. Just like in a great story that you might see in a movie is where all the action happens and translated in real life. That means where all the hard stuff happens because in the middle are the fight and climb stages. The fight is when you're, anybody is trying to bring that idea to reality.

Speaker 1:          21:47          The status quo rises up against it. Anybody who's defending the way things are and the fact that they should stay the same is going to put up resistance. And so people have to overcome those obstacles. They have to fight that internal inertia or the external criticism of this idea. But every time that you overcome one of those obstacles, they gain a little more ground. They climb a little closer, get a little closer to that end goal. And the middle is really the hard part. It's where people are tested. Just like in a story that hero comes to question whether they have the stuff to continue and how well you communicate will determine whether they think they can finish. And that's when the third act of the story comes to an end, which is the arrived stage. The arrived stage is where you achieve your goal or at least you conclude that effort and it could be a happy ending like in the movies, but most likely it won't be perfectly happy.

Speaker 1:          22:42          You might fall short of your goal a little bit. You might not achieve what you thought you would, it might change shape, but at that point in the journey, it's important to look back to say, what did we actually accomplish? Where did we fall short and how do we avoid those mistakes in the future? Also, you have to communicate frequently throughout this process and your communication has to take on a different flavor depending on the stage of the journey that you're in because people have different emotional needs at each stage. In the beginning of the journey, that first stage in dream, what they need is a moment of inspiration. They need to believe in that idea. They need to be able to imagine themselves in that future and long to go there. In the leap stage, what they really need is a moment of decision.

Speaker 1:          23:27          They need help choosing whether to say yes or whether to say no, and hopefully they'll say yes. The fight stage is a moment of bravery. That's when people need to be reminded that they're capable of overcoming those obstacles. To feel courageous, willing to risk anything to fight to make your idea a reality. The climb stage, which is kind of a misnomer because it can be a very long drawn out process of getting closer to the goal. And what people really need then is endurance. They need to be reminded that they have reserves deep inside of themselves that they can call upon so that they can overcome, keep going, and ultimately finish. And in the end, what people need is a moment of reflection. This is a time to stop, to catch your breath before you rush off to the next initiative, to, to tell the stories of what you just went through, to celebrate them or to more the endings before they start the next journey.

Speaker 1:          24:26          So I want to tell you about one leader that I think did this really well in his name, may not be familiar to you. Um, but it's, it's, uh, I have a lot of affection for him. His name is Ray Anderson, and he was the CEO and founder of a company called interface interface was founded in the 1970s when ray had this idea that it was kind of crazy at the time to create carpet tiles, basically take big rolls of carpet and cut them up into squares because he thought it was a good idea. And so he convinced a few investors to give him some money and he started this business and it turned out to be the right idea at the right time because the office environments we're changing. And so this modular carpeting was a really good concept. And so he grew that business like gangbusters for 20 years.

Speaker 1:          25:06          It became the world's largest supplier of carpet tiles and he was making money hand over fist, a self made millionaire. And everything was great until the 1990s when everybody started to wake up to the climate problem, the environmental problems that the, that we were all experiencing. And they were starting to, uh, criticize industrial businesses who they believed were causing the problems. And so customers even started asking, Ray, what are you doing for the environment? And he was really troubled by the question because he couldn't answer it is only answer was, I'm just trying to stay out of jail, which is not a good strategy. So coincidentally an employee sent them a copy of this book, the Ecology of Commerce by Paul Hawkin, one of the founders of Smith and Hawken. And so ray devoured this book looking for an answer to that question. And what he saw was this, you said he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth, which is a horrible thing to hear, especially for a founder.

Speaker 1:          26:02          He said, I built this company that is plundering the earth. And he said it hit him like a spear in the chest. He would tell people that story over and over about the epiphany that he had. And he was compelled to come up with a new dream for his company. And this is how he articulated it. He said, what if interface became the first industrial company in the world to achieve sustainability? And he used to story metaphorical journey of climbing a mountain taller than Everest to describe this vision. And he always drew this picture to depict it. And he would use that over and over in his communications to help people really understand and imagine themselves achieving that goal. He knew it was going to take a lot of work to make that happen. So he called all of his leaders together for an offsite in Maui, Hawaii, and he asked Paul Hawkin to actually give the keynote.

Speaker 1:          26:49          So Paul Hawkin stood up and he talked about all the problems that were affecting the planet, but also all the things that individuals can do this global village to turn things around and make a difference. And then ray got up and spoke and he asked every single one of his leaders to make a personal commitment to do something different, to put the environment back in balance. But he didn't just ask them, he asks them to demonstrate that commitment in front of everybody right then and there. So they all wrote pledges on cards that they pinned up next to photos of themselves on what they called a personal legacy wall. It was a ceremony, a pledging commitment to change. And after that ceremony, the leaders were galvanized. They raced forward and they kicked off all kinds of initiatives across the company to do things differently to transform the way they did business. And over the next 20 years they really changed everything, top to bottom in the company, everything about how they operated and they also transformed their industry.

Speaker 1:          27:47          So why do I tell you this story about Ray Anderson? A couple of reasons. One, because he's an entrepreneur, somebody who made something out of nothing. And I think that's really inspiring too because he put his entire business and service of a purpose greater than profit, which I also also think is really inspiring. But three, because he was a leader who understood the power of communication and storytelling and used it to motivate people to do really big things. He's not the only one. There are a lot of leaders who did this really well and so Nancy is going to tell you about one more. So I want to do a quick cut.

Speaker 2:          28:18          Hey, I'm about apple. As you guys know, I'm Steve. Jobs was kicked out of his own company, went away for 10 years and built a different company with a different operating system, but in the time that Mr jobs was gone from apple, apple had no strategy. They tried a few times to create an operating system and failed, so they had to go outside of apple, look to buy an operating system they bought next and with next came Mr. Jobs, the very first time Mr job spoke, even though it was a broad audience, it was not at a developers conference. If there were news was there, it was a Mac world. He spoke as if it was only talking to the developers in the room. He had 20 minutes in. He used the word developer 27 times because he knew the developers had to move from Mac os nine to Mac os 10 or the whole company would fail.

Speaker 2:          29:03          It was huge. Nope. Gilamelio spoke for three hours and he said the word developer three times. No wonder he wasn't the right guy to lead. Did you gotta realize apple wasn't a complete crisis at this time? Um, the developers were very, very skeptical cause they had been jerked around for a decade. They do a build in the next year they find out everything was wasted. They do another build and it was wasted. So very skeptical. In fact, Mr Jobs did a talk actually called Apple's hierarchy of skepticism. We went through all the steps of skepticism and where the developers were in the spectrum because they were that skeptical. So what happened is 2001 a lot of the developers still were not moving. They were still not migrating and he did a ceremony. He stood up and he made a vow. He unfurled and oversized piece of parchment paper and he made a verbal vow that I will stick with one operating system strategy.

Speaker 2:          29:53          Some of the developers hadn't moved because they thought that they were going to keep jerking them around. What happened that was kind of interesting is in the middle of the climb, a lot of times at the s curves overlap. That's the time you need to already be dreaming again. So the developers are still moving. A lot of them had come, but some pretty big ones had decided to resist and decided not to come. In the meantime, Mr Jobs had a new dream he was already on, but the real dream, he'd had this New Vision that the whole world of connected devices would connect to Mac os 10 it was called this digital hub strategy. If you go and you look at this speech, he'd basically prophesied their entire hardware strategy for the next decade. It was a big speech, so it was a dream. So of course he's losing his patients.

Speaker 2:          30:35          He's like, get on to 10 get on to 10 but he keeps telling me, get on to 10 I've got this new dream. Oh my God, you're not gonna believe what the world is going to look like. So he decides, you know what, we need to bury the old OSTP. We need to bury macro s nine and he did exactly that. He actually had a coffin and smoke come up out of the stage, stained glass up on the wall. Erie music played. He came out with an oversized a Macalester nine you can see there to the right, put it in the coffin, closed the lid, put a red bows on it, and he said a eulogy from [inaudible]. He said, we are here today to mourn the passing of macro s nine he is now in that great big luck it in the sky. No doubt looking down upon us with that same smile he displayed every time he booted.

Speaker 2:          31:13          Mr Jobs never mentioned Mac os nine again. After this day it was done in the developers that they're there. Like you could actually hear it in the audio. They're like, Whoa, like your response to laugh or when they'll never forget it was over. It was done. So this is a ceremony of endings and beginnings. Move on. He said language like the train has left the station. People are going to buy another brand. Then your brand. He pushed them out. Endings and beginnings. He pushed them forward. Some got pushed out maybe, but it is fun to be a leader myself. Some of you might be like, well, I'm not really a leader, but I've had the privilege of being able to kind of prophetically imagine my own organization's future and then had kind of the power and the autonomy to move it into this new alternate future and one things consistent is change itself.

Speaker 2:          31:59          I'm sure you've heard that, but my own organization is 28 years old. We are on our eighth reinvention. That means we've reinvented ourselves every four years, which I think is fascinating because the u s board of Labor and Statistics states that small businesses die between four and five years, so it's almost like the life cycle of just my own little unit of 120 people actually needs to be rejuvenated in about four year increments. Now Google does that at a scale that this isn't even messy enough to show you guys have hundreds of venture scapes, hundreds of them going on all the time, which means every single one of you in this room are either leading a venture scape or you being impacted by someone else that's leading a venture scape. That means that there's a lot of other travelers that need to come along with you. You have other people.

Speaker 2:          32:47          These ideas are not going to be realized if you can't get others to come along with you and make that dream a reality. It's why learning to communicate well is so critical and you're gonna have moments all the time, all along the way where there's a speech of story, of ceremony, Bam, Bam, Bam. Every day a speech, oh, I need to tell a story too. I need to do a ceremony today. You may have a one on one with one of your direct reports who's encountered a roadblock and you're like, oh, I remember in when I did this. Here's the story of how I overcame that same roadblock. A speech. You've got the vision meetings, you've got the all hands meetings, you've got your staff meeting speeches all the time. And then there's ceremonies. Oh my gosh, we just launched this initiative. Let's all sign the great poster that was just made and make a commitment that we're going to make this reality.

Speaker 2:          33:28          Those happen all day long. But there's these other moments that happen when the team may be missed it. The team needs to heal. The team needs to be galvanized, they need to be rallied. It's a bigger moment along all those other moments where you need to create collective effervescence, this moment where the people are bound to each other and bound to you and recommitted to what you're asking them to do. And those stand out among the rest. And that's when you need to combine the stories, the ceremonies, and the speeches into a moment that people will never forget because this is when they actually recommit. They're so exhausted, so beat up. Sometimes they need a moment to decide, is this worth it? Can I keep going and do I want to keep doing that? So moving people is really hard. Um, just because maybe I have this skill for seeing the future doesn't mean I've always been really good at getting people to go there.

Speaker 2:          34:23          In fact, I used to just at the vision meeting every year at my company, I would just make this epic declaration of what needed to happen and then I would check in with myself at the end of the year and be disappointed sometimes, mostly in my travelers if they didn't make my dream come true that I told them once, you know, and it's so weird to see how hard it is to move people, but I had to finally own, like I thought it was like, well, why? Why don't they want to do this? Why are we not working together to make this happen? And I had to realize, well, maybe it's partly that the sacrifice is huge. I'm asking him to do. I had not honored the fact that maybe they had to spend more time, they had to learn new skills, the sacrifice they were going to have to make to make this dream come true, but also was I portraying it in a way that made the risks seem worth the reward to them?

Speaker 2:          35:11          Was the risk worth the reward? Did I really think for a minute that they're encountering these obstacles that might be just too hard for them and moving them is really, really hard and it's empathy that unlocks something inside of them. So I don't, I don't and haven't had that much empathy in my career. I had to learn it. And if you look at these two models we showed you today, they're actually models for empathy so the leader can actually think through and see things from someone else's perspective. And I was actually raised by a narcissist and a narcissist doesn't have the empathy gene. It's actually a mental illness where the empathy gene is just vacant. That means I didn't have empathy modeled for me as a kid. My mom never showed me what that means to think and consider someone else's perspective. So my body of work is actually my own personal journey at calling this thing called empathy that was evasive to me.

Speaker 2:          36:02          It was gone and I couldn't really grasp it or find it. So I had to create models so I could see things from other people's perspective. And I have to confess, I have opened my own book that I wrote myself with Patty and I've had to look at the model to do a couple of talks in my own shop so that it works to consider how somebody else may be perceiving what you're asking them to do and then communicate through that and from that place. And you know, what does storytelling that binds us together. Everything you learned today, all the models are based in storytelling. And I can tell you that if you adopt the concepts and principles of story, your career will never be the same. It is the very thing that will move you from simply a manager to being a leader is how you choose to communicate the actions you're wanting others to take.

Speaker 2:          36:46          On. That's the sole difference. Like Tati was saying, it's, it's a tool. It's hardwired into our brains to bind the teller to the heroes, to the listener. It binds us to each other. Storytelling also connects you with each other. When you've experienced an amazing story, you feel connected to each other and it really changes the trajectory of where you're going and how quickly you can get there. So if you think about the concept of story being about transforming, it creates longing. If people are trying to change and get somewhere, the journey's hard and its story, that's the coping mechanism. It's story that helps them recommit it's story that makes them want to continue to build the future you're portraying that needs to be built. Stories create a longing. I'm like anything else in, in any sort of communication. So I want to end with a quote and then we'll take questions from you guys.

Speaker 2:          37:41          If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people together to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. If Google in principle and conceptually would embrace the power of storytelling, you guys are already great and unstoppable. Yeah. I can't even imagine what could be calm because you guys actually do change the entire world. And so we would love to take questions. We also have a gift as you leave today. We brought the actual insert from the book, the communication tool kit, which has, um, speeches, stories and ceremonies, and it has the dream leap, fight, climb. I love arrive. We have warnings, speeches, and motivating speeches, warning stories, motivating stories, morning ceremonies, Morgan, easterners with this out. Use it as your map and change the world like crazy.

Speaker 3:          38:31          Thank you so much for your time. Thank you.
