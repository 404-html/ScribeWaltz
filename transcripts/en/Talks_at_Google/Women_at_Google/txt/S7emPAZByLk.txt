Speaker 1:          00:00:06       A former dancer, Mary studied structural integration with Ida Rolf. She has taught movement in bodywork classes since 1994 and was chair of the Movement Faculty of the Rolf Institute of structural integration in Boulder, Colorado. The new rules of posture is the second of three books. Mary has published along with numerous articles in magazines including massage shape, men's fitness, somatics journey journal and massage and bodywork. Her newest book, your Bali Body Mount. Our posture as a path to presence is coming out at the end of the year. You can look at it, look for it on her website or on Amazon. Uh, she has videos, a blog, and much more on her website, which is www. Heal your posture.com. Ladies and gentlemen, Merry Bond.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Thank you all so much for coming. I know we had an eclipse and there were other exciting things going on today and here you are. So sitting, standing and moving in the modern world is not always comfortable, but we get used to it. A lot of times we don't notice our discomfort until it becomes full blown pain. So you folks are Google, you're known for innovation. And what I hope to do today is to inspire you to help redesign the way the world works so it could be more body friendly. So, um, because I want you to feel what I'm talking about in your bodies. I'm going to ask you to stand up and do things every so often. So now is one of those times, if you would just stand up, it would be great. Okay? So bring your arms way high, make fists, tighten your elbows, tighten your knees, push down in the floor, stretch your spine as high as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       And then go side to side. Just a little. So notice your stretching, but you're contracting at the same time. That's important. Really stretch, really reach. Okay, now open your hand. Scrunch up your eyes. Open your mouth like you're yawning. A more stretch, more and more. Okay. Now you could let go and feel your body right now. Something a little something, a little energy moving through it. Yeah. So what you just did is Pandic. Culation and most mammals do this many times a day, sometimes up to 50 times. But humans feel a little sheepish doing it in public. Nonetheless, you felt there was an effect, I think nod your head. Yeah, there was an effect. So what might be news is that that affect matters. It's important. So we'll talk a little more about Penn [inaudible] as we go forward. This is cover art for the book you just picked up.

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       And the gist of that book is that posture isn't a position. It's not what you do with your shoulders or your head or your gut posture is your response to this moment and the next moment and the next, every succeeding moment requires you to respond. We don't, we're not aware of it and we get habits about doing it. But basically posture is how you feel stable and safe in a pretty unstable world. And so changing, transforming your posture amounts to creating different strategies for how you feel safe inside to meet the world. So it's in involves body awareness, self awareness. It's not a quick fix. So this book is not something you're going to, um, benefit from tomorrow. It takes a little patience. So how do we sit, stand and move in this crazy modern world in a world that increasingly ignores what the body is made to do, which is to move.

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       Um, all organisms move in order to survive. We know that there's a doctor Scholls ad on television right now. It says, born to move. So we have this in our consciousness and yet we don't really embody it in our being. So how many of you have standing desks? Yeah. Do you stand at them? They will. That help? It's helpful. Sometimes you do sometimes. Yeah. So standing desks and Ergonomic chairs are good ideas. Um, but they're external fixes to the problem of our ancient bodies in this modern world. So I want to dig a little deeper into the nature of your bodies. I want to talk about what you're made of the ground substance of your body and how to take care of that. I want to talk about the architectural principle that holds you together and about perception and what perception has to do with posture.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       And then I'll give you some advice about sitting since you're insist on doing that. And we'll talk about in the end, uh, exercise and movement and the future of the human body. So that's my plan for this little talk. And I wanted to share with you a little about where I'm coming from. This is my teacher, her name was Ida Rolf and she was a biochemist, but her passionate interest was in human structures. So she developed a manual therapy. She called structural integration. And so her students and her clients nicknamed it Raul thing. She didn't much like that. But now most of you have heard of Raul thing. Yes. Okay. So this therapy looks at the body as living architecture, which has been distorted and diminished by accidents and compensations and poor use, like sitting all day without moving. She viewed pain as the product, mostly the product of imbalance structure.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       She had to kind of revolutionary ideas for the sixties this expresses one of them. It's her logo. And she thought that the body, she taught that the body is organized by gravity, just like this building is organized by gravity. So if the body could be balanced, then gravity wouldn't tear the body down, but would in fact actually contribute to health. So that was her first idea. Or second idea is that the body's connective tissue is plastic. It's able to change. So through manipulation, she found that she could restore balance to structures that had become distorted and twisted. She was the first to recognize the importance of connective tissue, what we now call Fascia. And she died in 1979. Uh, but the first research conference about Fascia, the Fascia congress wasn't held until 2006. Uh, it happened at Harvard, which was exciting for us body workers. But it was also attended by many researchers from around the world who had become interested in this aspect of the body that had mostly been ignored.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       So this is a simple metaphor to share with you. How fascia pervades your body. The rind of the orange is like, um, an all over body suit just under your skin. If we peeled off all the skin, we would see a fascicle layer. It's, it's literally a body suit. It contains everything else. And underneath that are these, the segments of the orange, um, represent the various organs and muscles and larger structures that each have a containing membrane as, as, um, blood vessels and nerves and bones all have a wrapping of Fascia around them. And all of this Fascia is continuous and the little orange bits inside the segments, you know how your fingers get sticky when you eat an orange. So those little bits represent cells. So each cell in your body has its own fashional membrane. So it's been suggested that if you took out everything else from the body except the Fascia, you'd still have a recognizable human shape. This is an 18th century painting of a dissection. It hangs in the Wellcome library in London. So until recently, anatomists stripped away the Fascia and discarded it so they could look at the interesting thing. So the liver and the brain and the circulatory system and so on. And that was good. We needed that. But what it did was perpetuate the idea that your body is made up of an assemblage of parts. Rather than that it becomes, develops out of wholeness, which I'll talk about a little more later.

Speaker 3:          00:10:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:15       This photo is an endoscopic image of living Fascia. It's magnified 130 times and it's the work of a man named John Claude. Gene Bartow. He's a French micro surgeon. He uses endoscopy in his work. So this means putting little cameras and lights and micros scopes inside the living tissue. So he has been so odd by what he saw that he's developed a collection of these images. And I can give you his website after the talk. Appreciate these geometric forms.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       Uh, immune system. Uh, sorry. The fascist system is now being studied at the same way that the immune system and the circulatory system and all the other systems are being studied. So there are three main constituents of Fascia. One is Collagen. It's like protein fibers, which when they're woven tightly together have the strength of steel. There are also elastic fibers that you could stretch to 100% of their capacity and then they could relax back without deforming their shape. And the third constituent is a watery matrix, something like egg white, uh, kind of mucousy stuff. And there's swimming in cells like immune cells and fat cells and nerve cells. So this was very interesting to us in the bodywork world that there were nerve cells in Fascia. We we knew from doing doctor Rovs work that there was some kind of communication through the Fascia, but we had all kinds of other ideas about what, what, what was doing it. And they're actually sensory nerve fibers in the fashion. In fact, six times estimated six times as many nerve fascists, neuro fibers in Fascia as in muscle. So when you think you're moving through the, your neuromuscular system, it's actually the fashion system that is allowing that to come into full expression.

Speaker 3:          00:12:45       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       A lot of these nerves, sensors in the fascia are called intro sectors. That means they tell you what's going on inside your body. So when you feel bloated or you have a tickle or an itch or you have sexual arousal or air hunger, all of these kinds of sensations in your body are because of the intro sectors in your Fascia. So you might think that, uh, interoception is a way, you know that you have a body.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       Lot of different textures. Fascia can assume it can have the transparency of glass. So your corneas are Fascia, your breasts are Fascia full of lots of fat cells. Um, there's um, when you, when you have a scar that's the Collagen fibers woven tightly together to protect the wound. Um, it's also very fluid gelatin like slidey slippery slidey. So when we watch our most beautiful athletes and dancers, what we're seeing is not just their superb neuromuscular system, but also the health of their fashion system. Note, the last point, stress and immobility dehydrates your Fascia and makes it stiff and makes you stiff. So stress in a mobility are the characteristics of the modern workplace. The powerful leaping of a kangaroo is do not just to its powerful leg muscles, but to the high percentage of Fascia in its body. So when those elastic fibers stretch through movement, uh, the, its stores, kinetic energy, which is then released and the kangaroo rebounds. Interesting thing here is that our bodies, human bodies have the same high percentage of fashion in them as the kangaroo. So if you think about that, it's clear that we're made for leaping and running and not for sitting. This is a video, one of gene bertos videos of living Fascia. You'll see, um, the yellow fat cells along the bottom, tendonous material, the collagen across the middle of the slide and the blood cell blood vessel. You might be able to see moving.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       So where that's happening is just below your elbow on your forearms. So find that place on yourself. I'm going to play the video again, but um, if you make just a pinch of skin with your finger pads, just a gentle pinch of skin and pull up on it. And when the video starts, you could slowly let down on the pinch and then draw up again as the video goes up. Now it's coming down, you're letting go of your pinch, and then you're pulling up. Images are so amazing. Yeah. So that kind of shape shifting is going on inside your body with every movement that you make while you're breathing. While you're brushing your teeth while you're rolling over in bed.

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       this is another one of gene Bertos, um, videos and it takes place in the same place, but it's a little different. It's magnified 10 times. The other one was magnified 20 times. And this one is also a deeper place in the forearm. So take the palm of one hand and press it lightly against the skin just below your elbow as if those two layers of skin where move or adhered to each other. And then what you do is just a gentle pulling down of this skin toward your wrist. And you might be able to feel that you're not just pulling on skin, but other layers are moving underneath and then draw up toward your elbow with that same thing. So that's what's going on here. The bubbles that you see are because of the difference in pressure between what's going on, the incision and the air outside pressure differential. Notice that changing direction of these microfibers, how they keep reorienting themselves, changing their polarities. It's like a crystal and kaleidoscope inside you.

Speaker 2:          00:18:25       So you keep your fascia healthy by moving. And the important thing is movement in many directions. So multidirectional movement, not forward movement that's repetitive. So if you had the choice between going to a dance jam or working out on an exercycle for the benefit of your Fascia, you need to go dancing probably for other reasons to whole body stretches are good for the fascist. So that Pandic culation that we did before, as long as it's a whole body stretch and not just, you know, this kind of stretch of isolated muscles that people do, that's a different thing. Gentle bouncing movements. So if you went folk dancing, that would be good for your Fascia. Not Big leaps, but just gentle bouncing a micro movements. We'll be doing some micro movements in a few minutes. These are small movements that you can barely, barely see. Certainly you can feel the massage can help. Uh, all of these suggestions don't cover strength training or aerobic training. You need that too. Of course, this is fascist specific. This image of an Mbr embryo is a development about four to five weeks. But fascia emerges in embryonic development earlier than this and about two weeks. So fascia. Researchers suggest that muscles, bones, organs, in fact, all other living tissue may in fact be specializations within the unified medium of Fascia. So that's a very different way of thinking about how we evolve. Then the idea that we're just a bunch of parts stuck together.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       Everything in the fashion system is interconnected and fluid and you can feel this when you breathe. So let's try. So if you would just be comfortable and if you feel like closing your eyes, sometimes that helps you feel your body more readily. It's just go inside and feel the sort of swelling and settling of your chest as you inhale and exhale, just a little expansion and then diminishment and you could feel it probably also in your belly, a little puffing up and letting go and then turn your attention to your shoulder blades and see if you can feel them sliding maybe apart from each other, maybe up a little bit. As you inhale and resting down, shoulder blades move apart so the rib cage can expand and then drop your awareness down into your forearms. There are two bones in your forearms and he in each forearm and there's a membrane in between. So imagine that membrane swelling and settling as you breathe in and out,

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       and then

Speaker 2:          00:22:06       come down into your lower legs. See if you can go that far down and feel your fascia moving as you breathe in between the lower leg bones. It's interesting that the place where you feel a sensation in your brain is the same place that you imagine a sensation. It's a sensory cortex, so it doesn't matter if you think you're only imagining it, it's good enough. Drop down into your souls. See if you can feel that when you inhale, there's the slightest pressure down into your shoes.

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       and let yourself imagine that tensile matrix that we saw earlier. Imagine it throughout your whole body, all those little fibers changing their orientation. Thank you. You can open your eyes. Could you feel a bit? Imagine you felt, but it will be a while before our culture learns to see the body as continuous and connected. We think of the body and bits and pieces. When we have a pain, we blame it. On an isolated part. We exercise isolated separate muscles. We do lat pulls, an Ab crunches.

Speaker 3:          00:23:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       And when we want to portray images of power, we just add more and stiffer parts.

Speaker 3:          00:24:02       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:24:02       This model suggests a way of conceiving how the body is held together. So it is you seeing struts held in place by a network of tension.

Speaker 3:          00:24:16       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       In terms of the body, the elastic lines are your soft tissues and the struts are your bones. Ideally, your bones are floating in a network of soft tissue. This architectural principle is called tensional tensional integrity, or as Buckminster Fuller called it 10 Segretti. And you can see that if you change the tension in just one of those strings, the whole structure would change its shape, change its orientation a little bit, and that's true inside us. That's how we work too. Even the vertebrae, the Individual Vertebra in your spine can float and respond inside this network of tension, but we don't think of it that way. We talk about the spine as a column. On the right, you see a 10 Segretti tower. It's a sculpture by a man named Kenneth Snelson. It's in the Washington National Mall in Washington, and you can see that it's more similar in quality to the spine. Then the Washington monument is,

Speaker 3:          00:25:37       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       so how do we learn to behave more like bio 10 secretaries and less like stacks of bricks? Well, it's helpful to think or imagine back to prehistoric times how the body might have functioned in those days.

Speaker 2:          00:26:00       So our prehistoric ancestors had to move their bodies in order to survive. So you could imagine what kind of movements they might've had to do to kill their breakfast or heard their cattle. So they'd be crouching or throwing or digging or lifting, carrying stuff. And none of that would be predictable or repetitive, constantly changing movement, large body movements. Also, they would be traveling in bare feet or skins, uh, on uneven terrain, which had a pebbles and foreigns in it. So their, their feet had to be extremely mobile to navigate the ground and that mobility and the feet would play up through the whole fascist system. So every joint in the body would have to respond to the movements of the feet. So that's an example of micro movement. In a sense, and these movements, large and small, must have kept their fashion. I healthy, I like to think that anyway. And they had to have a panoramic view of their surroundings. They had to have 360 degree awareness through their all their senses, through hearing sight. All the factory 10th, uh, sent felt feeling sense and it's as if they had eyes in the backs of their heads. But with us, we're always looking forward just this way, this way forward. So let's practice something. Uh, I want to see if you can feel the benefit of having a more broad peripheral awareness. So you need to stand up again so you could [inaudible] it's a good idea.

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       There's certain noises that go with [inaudible]. Yeah, it could be louder. Okay. So find a detail somewhere around you. Not a person, but something you could look at. Could be the screen or it could be exit sign or a Thermostat, some detail that you could gaze that with. A lot of intensity of vision that you have to write a report about this thing and it's due tomorrow and your job depends on it. So really look, look hard. Keep that. Keep that intensity. And notice your breathing. Notice where it's located in your body. Notice the relationship between your torso and your neck and jaw and head. Notice the sensation in your eyes. Notice where your weight is on your feet

Speaker 2:          00:29:15       and how big you feel in general. Okay, so relax that. Just shake it out. Yeah, just we want to neutralize ourselves so we can do something else. Thank you. So now put your fingers out like this. Wiggle your fingers and you can see peripherally without still looking at me. You can still see what's beyond your fingers. You could put your hands down now and just keep looking so that you have a sense of the periphery of the room. And you also notice something about what's above your head. You can feel it. And because you walked in here, you know what's behind you. You have a kinesthetic memory of what's behind you. So you have a broad perceptual awareness. Yeah. So I want you to see if you can keep that and then turn and look at your same object that you looked at before. And I'd like to suggest some things that may or may not be different. There are different when I teach this to different people. So I think it's possible that your breathing lower in your rib cage, not so high in your upper chest. Uh, I think your eyes feel softer and that you feel less merged with that object. There's more of a sense of you being here and it being over there.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       Also, it's possible that you see the object in its context. So your report is going to be more interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:31:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       So great. Thank you very much. I like to think of this as 10 Segretti of perception. So what I mean by that is by having these little feelers out in all directions, you establish a virtual network in the space, a virtual network of potential directions of movement through the space that actually helps support your body. And I think you felt that you had better posture the second time. Yes, you will. You are bigger. Yeah. And so this awareness of our surroundings helps our bodies open up on the inside as well as on the outside. So we have better posture. We actually have more strength, which if you stay for the little class afterwards, I can show you that. So picture the movements you make to get to work, to get up, get your breakfast, go to work, and the movements that you make while you're at work.

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       I might be different at Google than it is other places, but generally in offices your movements are curtailed. You don't have a lot of movement. Most of it is in the forward plane and your perceptions are narrowed. So I think it's important for us humans to acknowledge that the amazing conveniences that were living with in this time may be diminishing our body's natural capacity for movement and perception. So we want to change that. I think what can we do about sitting and standing and moving in the workplace now? So an expensive ergonomic chair is not the answer because it's doesn't guarantee that you're going to sit in a, in a balanced way. This chair, like many has a dip towards the back of the seat. So that dip tends to roll the pelvis back and invite your spine to lean against the backrest. Most modern chairs are like this. You slide back, car seats are the worst. Those buckets, seats are designed to prevent movement. Um, if human spines don't need back support when we're standing up, why would we need them when we're seated? While we don't, as long as the pelvis is sitting at the right inclination. So that inclination involves having a 45 degree, a greater than 45 degree angle between the hip and the thigh.

Speaker 3:          00:34:05       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       So this is Charles and you can see that he's sitting more upright and on the left and his weight, some of his weight is being born through his feet and his legs, about maybe 40% of his weight is born through legs and feet. And so he has a broader base of support and when his thighs are slanting down hill that way, and that forward inclination of the pelvis creates an automatic lift through the spine. In the other picture where he's in sitting in a lower chair that invites his pelvis to roll back. Like I was describing, modern chairs are inviting you to do in these chairs right here. And so he's sitting on his tailbone, on his buttocks, flesh. His whole torso is compressed. He looks Duller, his head is poking forward, you know? So let's practice this. So unfortunately these chairs don't raise and lower, but we can make, do I think you can feel something if you don't mind sitting more forward on them. So imagine that's a bench or a stool, not a chair with a back. Yeah, already. That's better. See, you can do it. All right. So on purpose, I'd like you to roll back this role, this of your anatomy back like Charles is doing in the right hand picture. And notice what happened to your spine and torso. You compress these stay there. I want you to really feel it. So you're sitting on your buttocks flash, right? Maybe on your tailbone. Take a nice full easy breath.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       Yeah. So it's like really not easy to do that, you know? But we get used to this.

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       We drank a lot of coffee because we're not getting enough oxygen. All right, stay there one more time. One more thing. I'd like you to notice how creative you feel in that position. And then just from there, roll your pelvis forward. So you can think of it different ways you can think of having your pubic bone farther from your belly button. You can think of having, uh, your tail moving more in back behind you. And you're sitting now on the flesh of your thighs rather than the flesh of your buttocks. So it make sense and you feel there's more weight on your feet so you have more support. Yeah. So I'd like to take this a little bit farther. If you don't mind reaching underneath yourself. Find your left sit bone. It's just in front of the gluteal flesh. And you're right. Sit Bone.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:37:12       And while you're back there, find your coxix. Just touch it so you really, really know where it is. Okay. So now stay seated on your thighs and look down inside yourself. You'll see that those three points make a triangle. So that makes sense. You feel that? Nod your head. It's, these lights are glaring. I can't see. All right, so that triangle is called the post steer or triangle of your pelvic floor or the anal triangle of the pelvic floor. And notice. Now, if you roll back and sit more towards the buttocks, that that anal triangle got smaller, more compressed. So that area is at the bottom of your gut tube that connects all the way up to your throat. So how well can you can digest your lunch when you're in that compressed position?

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       Let's, uh, roll forward now once more. And going to take this still a little bit farther. This is a female pelvic floor, but the anatomy of the muscular apparatus is pretty much the same for all genders. And you notice that triangle I outlined, the anal triangle. And notice at the bottom, the Anal Cox, a GL ligament. That's a little tiny slip of Fascia between your anal sphincter and your coxix. So we're going to experiment with a micro movement of that. So you need to be sitting comfortably upright on your thighs, not leaning back on this backrest and see if you can draw your coxix just a few millimeters closer to your anal sphincter without disturbing anything else. That's good. You're doing it. All right. So,

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       let's undo it. So go back the other way. See if you can just imagine that ligament lengthening your coxix link lengthening back. Okay, so I wish you could see yourselves because there's this, you're all sitting with nice posture, but there's this diminishing. Maybe you could feel it inside yourself deep inside your anybody. Let's do it again. You might, you might feel it. So be open and big and on your thighs, on your feet. Just move the coccsyx forward towards the anal sphincter and there's just a slight shriveling up inside. And then reverse it and go the other way.

Speaker 3:          00:40:23       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:40:25       so

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       there's a difference in the and what happens inside your body when there's tension around this area. Most of us have fallen on our coxix or had some kind of injury to the pelvic floor sometime in our life and yet we don't speak of it except jokes on late night TV. You know, it's important to think about it. The intro sectors in your Fascia help you feel that subtle change in your posture that happens because of your tail space. So I can't resist talking about this. It's in the news, right? This thing I've been teaching sitting for a long time, and I've wondered why it is that it's harder for men to comfortably be seated upright in the pelvis, harder for men and women. So I've been asking around and what people have told me is that there can be an uncomfortable friction between the skin of the scrotum, the underwear, and the genes.

Speaker 2:          00:41:44       So all of that kind of rubs together like layers of Fascia. So in order to sit upright, it would require a manual adjustment you're not going to make in public, right? So I've also, men have also told me that underwear that supports the genital sooner, more forward position makes it easier to sit upright in the pelvis. So I'm not gonna tell you what kind of underwear to wear it guys, I'm really not. But I will tell you that the orientation of your pelvis makes a huge difference to the decompression of your spine and to your posture going forward. So take a look at old men walking down the street and notice they have no tail space. I promise you they don't. Okay. So here, if you can see there's a blue cushion that Melanie is about to sit down on. It's a desk about this big and you blow it up with air, but not very much so it's not bouncy. It's more like sitting on a water bed. So when she sits on it, there can be a subtle reverberation. You might see a subtle reverberation of her spine as her pelvis just sort of floats on that cushion.

Speaker 2:          00:43:23       So that's actually helping to pump fluids into those micro fibers. It's qualifies as a micro movement and micro movements are good for your Fascia. There are new articles every day about the kind of exercise that you can do to maintain your heart health, your brain health, your longevity. I'm talking about your fashion health and sitting as particularly detrimental for Fascia. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint like this and that's great for movement is terrible for stability. So when you sit with your legs at that angle for long, long hours, without much movement, the Fascia around your hip and down through your legs and thighs gets tighter and matted and, and you know, more uncomfortable. So

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       it would be great if when you take a break, no, it's recommended that, uh, people who sit go five minutes every hour moving. Do you have you, have you heard that every hour you're supposed to get up and move for five minutes? I think it's probably hard to do, but if you did it, it would be better to do this right, to do this, than to just walk around because it's nondirectional movement. It's innovative movement. So think about what if people did this around Google. It would be just like taking a coffee break, you know, it's not shameful to move your body. It's not embarrassing to do what your body needs. You just simply have to recognize that your body needs it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       And I think you need to take perception breaks because looking at I'm focused object for a long time induces us sort of a hypnotic trance and you know that you work. And Work and you think, well, just one more thing and then I'll get up, right? Just have to keep going. So you need to purposefully break the trance every so often. One way is to put attention into the soles of your feet. So you could do that right now. Just drop your attention down there. Feel the skin of your feet inside your shoes. You could even feel your feet breathing like you did before. You could feel the little cleavages in between your toes. Feel your toenails, but you're still listening to me, right? But you're also present in the lower part of your body. I think what happens with computers and technology so, so often is that the energy of the being gets drawn up into this part, upper body. I also recommend using urgency as a trigger to widen your perceptual field. So you know how you develop that broad perceptual field earlier. Okay? So let's, let's try something. If you just take out your phone right now, just reach it down and get your phone.

Speaker 2:          00:47:06       Okay? So notice your state the minute you have the phone in your hand. All right? Can you feel what I'm talking about? It's like you go there, it's like you disappear into the phone. So the phone could be a queue. A device could be a queue. So keep the phone in your hand, but take a moment to widen your perceptual field. So however you do that, especially think of the space behind your body that really helps and keep that space and then check Twitter. You can do it.

Speaker 3:          00:47:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:49       It might slow you down a nanosecond. I don't think that's bad, but it's a way of being present with your device rather than present inside your device. So when you're not at work, or maybe even when you are, because you're here, you could sit on the floor and the benefit of that is it opens up those hip joints that have been compressed and restricted by sitting on too many chairs. You could have lunch sitting on the floor, you could watch a movie, and unless you override the impulse, you Pandic you late every morning when you wake up, it primes your body and primes your Fascia for the day ahead. So it's good. Don't override it. If we're going to persist doing sedentary work, we need to become less self conscious about our need to move. So here, see if you can see the way the movement translates through her legs and hips up into her spine. All of them, the burdens on their heads help decompress the spine. So spinal movement is more accessible, but notice the harmony in the rhythm of these people. And there's us.

Speaker 2:          00:49:51       I think we need to create a culture, environments and designs that are kinder to the human body than the hard flat surfaces and square rooms that we've boxed ourselves into. Google is known for innovation. So I'd like to leave you with a challenge. I hope you can use your design thinking, your engineering to help redesign the way the world works so that people might have to move more in to do their work. I don't know how this could happen, but I think you do. And if you move more, two things will happen. It generates creative ideas and it improves your posture. So the last screen is just, uh, some websites. For more information you can learn about fashion fitness. I just briefly glossed over it. The man's name, Robert Slide, this one of, he's a Rolfer in Germany. He's also one of the foremost Fascia researchers. So he's developed a program. Then there's junk call gene Bartos, a website in case you're interested in those images. The International Association of structural integrators lists about 17 different schools, which teach the legacy of Ida Rolf. She could learn more about that and my website will tell you when my new book is happening and I have a newsletter but it, I don't send it out very often so you don't get inundated by stuff by me. So thank you so much.

Speaker 3:          00:51:42       Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:51:47       Oh, there's a question. That's great. So you know when you said sit forward, you know I did that and I feel good and it's up, but I get tired and then when I leaned back I feel like I'm resting again. So how do I not feel like I'm using all my muscles or something to sit?

Speaker 2:          00:52:03       Right? Well, you all, you will be using muscles that you don't use because you're leaning back habitually and you know, I don't know how long you've been leaning back many decades, but a decade or two, right? Yeah. And so you need to work through that little by little, I think of titration, you know, when you just go drop by drop to make a change rather than expecting yourself to sit upright all the time. But it really will help. Help, help to open up that tail space and to get a broad uh, support.

Speaker 4:          00:52:37       I should just practice a little bit to do it a little. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       bet. And sit back. Maybe you could associate sitting upright with certain tasks and leaning back with other kinds of tasks.

Speaker 4:          00:52:48       Okay. And then try and buy us myself more towards sitting up

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       of course. Okay. And exercise. Go dancing.

Speaker 4:          00:52:56       All right. Can I have a prescription for that?

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       Yeah, I'm glad you felt it. You know, and it does take a little bit of, of a sincere desire to make that change. And also in movie theaters you have to just lean back because otherwise no one can see around you. Yeah. There's one,

Speaker 4:          00:53:21       one trend behind, I still use the ball. It's just curious what you think about that. Sitting on a ball.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       Yeah. Well that cushion I showed you that cushion that's available, you know, you search for it, you'll find it. So that was my solution because the problem with the sitting on a ball is it makes you sit like this. Right? So I think it's, it's better for the hip joints not to be stuck in that wide position. And also the ball tends to roll back a little too much. So I really like that Christian idea cause it's almost like sitting on a ball. What's the, yeah. Uh, it's called disc. Oh sit. And it's on Amazon disco said. Yeah, it's a disk on which you sit. You are talking about having peripheral vision and as a glasses where I wonder if you have any thoughts or insights on contacts versus glasses being like I've definitely find my awareness is much more like when this is all blurry.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       Um, so I wonder if you had feelings on that. For sure. I wear glasses too, but I noticed that and this thing that I taught you is one of the most important things I ever teach anybody is this awareness of the space, especially the space behind you. There's something magical about that that makes you feel supported. And it has, uh, I don't think it matters whether you wear glasses or not. I mean, the fact the glasses do focus our attention towards that a forward gaze. But that doesn't mean we can't be aware when you felt the effect. Right? Yeah, yeah. There's an effect. That's what matters. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Lots of question. I'm going to go over here first.

Speaker 3:          00:55:14       All right.

Speaker 5:          00:55:14       So I heard over the year it's sort of to a competing notions of posture and, and you touched on one very nicely, which is this tensegrity idea that the body is a dynamic system supported by the last density and by structure. And then a second one that talks about, you know, this kind of rootedness where your stacks of blocks stacking your bones and trying to make sure that you're, you're well supported through your skeleton or there's actually contradictory, or is there if there was some underlying principle behind them? Both.

Speaker 3:          00:55:52       I don't,

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       I like to think that they're both work. But if you could have a stack of blocks that was floating in a 10 sea grill apparatus, wouldn't that be better than just compression block upon block upon block? So I think I to Ralph's idea was stacks of blocks that you saw it in her logo. And she also talked a lot about Buckminster fuller and tensegrity. So she had both things happening when she taught us. And I think she just had it both ways and hadn't integrated them. And I think that's still true. And I know that there are times when I'm a stack of blocks and I can't help it, you know. But if you, if you just move more towards the conception that you're a 10 Segretti I think already that makes a change in how you embody this flush. And maybe I'm being too poetic. I think this is hard and I've wrestled with it myself. So yeah, so both and is what I'd say. But go towards the 10 Segretti side as much as you can. And you, did you understand what I said about the awareness of space being a way of perceiving 10 seg? Really? Does that make sense to you?

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       I can't see you very well. You're nodding your heads. Okay, great. Thanks. So you've made me feel a little hostile towards my desk chair. Could is just adding a cushion sufficient if it's tipped back like that or, or what else should I get? Well I like those cushions. It doesn't work for everybody, but I've tried every kind of little chair thing you could find cause I write books, you know, and I found that having that, that cushion that moves a little bit, uh, is beneficial. There are chairs that move, they're very expensive. They are later on like a spring and you can find them. You know what else you should do is

Speaker 2:          00:58:15       bring your headphones and jam for five minutes once an hour. I'm serious. Like, look, look for a chair that's flat or, well, the chair should be at a height. If I can pantomime this, that your hips are higher than your knees and the more high the better. So the more you perch rather than sit the better because that invites your pelvis to roll forward, which gives you a lift through your lumbar spine and on up through the rest of you. You could email me, you know, send me a picture of your chair and I answer emails. So if you're struggling and you've, you say, should I buy this chair? You know? Thanks. Yeah. Uh, so it's just standing all day at your desk. A healthier than sitting at your desk all day with no motion. You're going to move more if standing, I think,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       hmm, maybe not.

Speaker 2:          00:59:26       You know what I have at my kitchen sink, which is the place where I stand the most if I'm, and also I have a staff, I have a platform for my computer that's on a shelf. So it's like a standing desk. And both of those places I've put a pebble bath, a doormat. Have you seen those doormat? Made of pebbles. So that allows your feed a little sensory experience, gives you a little movement there. More and more things coming through the internet of standing desks with different kinds of wobble boards. And there's one that looks like a skateboard. So you're like going like this. I don't know how it would be. You have to tell me

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       thanks.

Speaker 5:          01:00:12       Um, having, uh, stood extensively as well as using miniatures, um, uh, the chair is keeping you from your normal fidgeting effectively. Yeah. And I think that's why standing work so well because so many of us tend to shift from one leg to another lean one way and then the other and the chair largely prevents that movement while standing allows it just stand

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       otherwise, you know? Yeah. So fidget away. Thank you. That's really true about fidgeting,

Speaker 5:          01:00:44       um, about those last two videos you showed. Yeah. What I observed most distinctively between them is the earlier video, the developing world video with the women carrying things on their head. Um, besides the fact that they may have been functioning more efficiently just because they had to because of the weights on their heads. They were walking in, in what you might call, you know, Caribbean time. They there, they were walking at the rate that was comfortable for their body. So their body resonated naturally. The, the people in the urban video, we're rushing but not jogging. So they were accelerating a normal walk beyond the, the natural speed of a normal walk, at which point the bodies, um, resonant frequency doesn't match it anymore. We are embarrassed to jog because people will get upset. They will think that something is wrong. Yet we feel the need to get somewhere faster because we're on the clock. That is what I, I feel like his is what drives that though? Some of the people clearly had health problems.

Speaker 2:          01:01:49       Well sure. Well sure. But I showed the difference because just so you see that, you know, quality of experience, your mirror neurons pickup on the movement that you look at. [inaudible] so first about the first video, I have a hunch that it was slowed down slightly. It was a little bit in slow motion, so it wasn't quite accurate. Um, and the other one, if any of those people jog do, they would be jogging on hard surfaces. So there's no rebound, no gift from the earth. So it would be jarring to the spine and the whole body, you know? So I'm all for it, for more of us running to do things, but we've paved paradise, you know? So I don't know the answer, but I'm suggesting that you do collectively.

Speaker 3:          01:02:46       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       Thank you so much for those questions.

Speaker 3:          01:02:53       Great.
