Speaker 1:          00:04          Thank you very much. It's loved. It's a real pleasure to be here. So thank you for giving up your lunch hour, I believe, uh, to come and hear me talk about my book. And My name is Helen Scales. I'm a marine biologist. Um, and just in case any of you are wondering, that is my real name scales fish. Yes. Um, uh, and this is my book spirals and time, the secret life of curious afterlife of seashells. And I want to tell you a little bit about how, why I wrote the book and tell you a few of the stories that go into it. Um, starting off, um, all really the title files and time, the, the secret life of curious afterlife of seashells. And in the review, I, uh, I got in the Guardian newspaper a few months ago. Uh, I made the mistake of reading below the line on the website version and looking at some of the comments people had written and one person felt necessary to comment on the subtitle.

Speaker 1:          00:59          The secret life of curious afterlife was clearly a clever, clever title, uh, provided by the publisher in forced on this kind of popular science book. It's the sort of tightly have to have, um, luckily, uh, somebody else commented also what it, it just kind of tells you what the book's about. That's fine. Um, but actually it wasn't my publishers. It was my mom who came up with the title and subtitle and I'm really pleased he did because, um, it means she kind of got what the book was about. It's like she, um, from me talking about it for ages and, uh, and also making a read bits of it as it was going wrong. She clearly kind of got what it was I was trying to do, even perhaps before I really realized. Um, so yes, there's really two things I'm doing in book. One is telling the story of the lives of the shell.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Michael's the animals that make seashells and we all know those beautiful objective find on a beach. Um, Martin pick them up and taking them home, but what did they come from? How they made what happens in the lives of the creatures and that left these shells behind. So I wanted to tell Polly, uh, the story about the wonderful creatures, the mollusks that makes the shells. Um, mollusks are really one of the most strange, smart, tough, um, ancient and successful groups of animals on the planet. Um, we're talking about familiar creatures, mollusks range from slugs and snails and squid and octopus to slightly stranger things. You might not have heard of things like argonauts and see what supplies and Chitins and weird little things called Selena gastros that limit the bottom of the sea. And frankly just looked like worms. But they are still modest because, um, they are one of the most diverse groups of animals on the planet.

Speaker 1:          02:46          I'm really, they were really beaten by the arthropods. Um, another phylum, these are phyla that we're talking about to kind of bleeping within the animal kingdom. And the arthropods secured all the insects. Um, so they definitely weren't in terms of the, the, the largest number of species within a filer does over a million species of insect alone. Most of them a beetles. But mollusks come in like a good second place frankly. And, and they are an incredibly strange bunch of animals that live all sorts of different lives. Um, it's thought I could be about 50 to a hundred thousand species of Mollusk alive today that we've described already. Um, um, do you have know for sure cause there's no, up until now there hasn't been a central catalog to list all the names of all the monitors that had been described scientifically. We are now doing that. So hopefully we will get a bit more of a grasp on just how diversity is Amazon.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Um, but uh, it's thought by some of the leading thinkers and scientists who work on mollusks that actually there could be more like 200,000 species including ones we haven't discovered yet, including creatures like these guys. Um, so these are all micro cause they would just gave a found in Papua New Guinea just last summer. They are all under five millimeters in size about size of your little fingernail. And none of these have been described scientifically yet. They've just been found. They were found during an expedition led by guy called Phillip, you shade from the Natural History Museum in Paris and he basically spends his life going around the world leading expeditions, trying to find as many mamas, cause it's possible people do this kind of thing. Scientists focus on a group and you know, really try and figure out what's going on. Um, these were all found around coral reefs. Um, and they just, just incredible creatures.

Speaker 1:          04:31          I mean these are types of Melissa snails and clams that no one's ever seen before. I mean, that was a clown with pink tentacles. Begin the sake and, and transparent shells and you can see it as the skin underneath is brightly colors. Um, but these particular animals and plenty more that they find on these expeditions, uh, remain kind of on a, on a museum shelf. Undescribed they're called orphan species because we lack the expertise to actually have people sit down and name individual species but just don't know enough about this kind of diversity. Um, so there's all this headon, this hidden side to the lives of mollusks. That was partly what I wanted to talk about in the book was all the things that we don't yet know about. This incredible group of animals, including the species that we haven't yet found. And um, and Phillipe, I spoke to him and he's one of the people who really thinks they could be 200,000 species of mollusks and a, and he should know he's looking for them.

Speaker 1:          05:26          He's finding more and more all the time, even if all he's really doing is doing a headcount and this is something different. We don't know what it is yet and we don't know what it might contain. We don't know how it lives, what interesting things that these animals might be doing. And one of the things I really kind of amazed me while I was writing the book, um, right up until the point where by publishers were like, no, you have to stop now. You cannot put any more signs into this book. There's so many new discoveries are coming out of the mollusk worlds that pretty much every week I'd be like, oh, there's another cool story I want to put in the book. Like the fact that, um, thin pits have the toughest teeth made out of the toughest known biological material. They've knocked spider silk off the perch.

Speaker 1:          06:05          And they figured that actually because these are the snails that kept themselves to rock and spend their lives scraping the rock with their teeth, they've evolved this incredibly strong material in their teeth. So it's like that has to go in the book somewhere. We have to get it in. And then I think actually just the last thing I did manage to get in the book, the last story was, um, about how cone snails, these are poisonous sees now that live in the tropics and they are kind of notorious for having incredibly diverse and complex toxins that they used to hunt all sorts of animals, including fish. And there are a few species that if they sting a human, they will actually kill them. A bit of an overkill, but there's reasons why we think they're such powerful computers so that they can actually a tiny snail that slowly slides along the seabed has the ability to eat fast moving fish, which is kind of incredible.

Speaker 1:          06:54          And a new discovery just came out a few months before the book came out. Um, that they in fact use insulin as part of their weaponry so that the only animal we know that's kind of evolved this hormone. So that essentially knocked out its prey by giving it a dent, a dose of insulin so that their blood sugar levels drop and they faint and they can then eat these fish. And that's just really cool. So there were lots of incredible, cool, um, amazing mind blowing discoveries coming out of the vonner squirrelled. Um, and that was a really big part of what I wanted to do with the book was to capture this excitement of what we're discovering and the applications of a lot with this. This sciences is kind of exciting to the cone snail veterans that have been used to develop medicines that have been used in biomedical research.

Speaker 1:          07:39          Um, the fact that razor clams, I don't know if you've ever seen a long thing, um, shells you might see on a beach. They borrow themselves in the sand, but they're much more efficient to doing it then, then just their muscles. And the shape of this, the strength of their shell would suggest. Um, and um, researchers have figured out that they actually have this clever technique of creating little pools of quicksand around one mistake, dig down and it's incredibly efficient way of Berry of borrowing. And um, this could lead to the next generation of, of underwater robots that can now fix things to the seabed even and sort of undersea cables for the Internet. It could be being fixed down by these dog robots inspired by razor clams. So there's tons of cool stuff about Valascus that I was trying to talk about in the book.

Speaker 1:          08:24          And um, and some of the, what I wanted to capture too with some of the big discoveries and some of the big questions that scientists have thought about when it comes to shells and mollusks, um, over the years. And one of the big ones is the shape of their shells. How is it that Shell's on made? They've got these, many of them are beautiful spirals. I called my book spirals in time. I guess cause I wanted to earlier to the idea that these things have been around for a long time and spiraling around these carbonate spirals have been, I've been around for probably for half a billion years. We think mollusks first evolved in the oceans about 500 million years ago. Um, how do they make their shells and why are there so many different shapes? And then lots of great thinkers have put their mind to trying to work out what is the mathematics that light behind shells and shall making, um, one of the simplest parts of a shell of a mollusk aspiring to them is the logarithmic spiral and spiral that expands at a constant rate.

Speaker 1:          09:24          Um, it was when I Descartes who came up with this idea of a log spiral. And if you cut through a chambered Nautilus, which is this shell here, and you get a pretty good approximation to that, that logarithmic spiral into dimensions. And if you look at lots of different mollusks, uh, lots of, many of the guests reports with the spiraling shells, the snails as well as these, the Nautilus is and various other, the bivalves two clans and so on, they do, they do still have spirals in their shells. We'll come to that. Um, what about in three dimensions? That was the next big question. That's that scientists were thinking about mathematicians and philosophers wanted to figure out how could you make a three dimensional shouts all very well to say you've got these two dimensions. The locks viral is really important actually because, um, the matter how big or small it is, it's the same shape.

Speaker 1:          10:11          And that is a key rule to making shells. Is that that tiny or if they're huge, they um, because they, uh, they will stay the same shape. So mosques keep their shells that whole lives unlike crustacean the crabs and lobsters which shed their shells and brought new ones mollusks keep the same ones and just growing bigger and bigger, but they stay the same. Um, they stayed the same shape. People if they're tiny or huge. Um, but how about three dimensions? Um, so it was, um, if turn of the 20th century, there was a guy called Darcy went with Thompson who wrote a book called on growth and formed and, and he was really thinking about shapes in nature and how can mathematics described the shapes of a splash or a dia is Adler or indeed the shape of a three dimensional inspiring Chubb. And he came with the idea that perhaps, um, you create these three d shales by spinning a two dimensional shape in three dimensions.

Speaker 1:          11:05          Um, so essentially what he's looking at is having like a central axis, okay. That pictures, um, around which may be a circle, a flat circle spins around and it can either do so in the same plane or it can drop down that, that access. It can, um, the wiles of the show can overlap each other or not. And perhaps it would only take three m this is running away, um, three or four simple rules to actually make all the different channels that you see in nature. So he came up with this idea, just a theoretical idea. He couldn't test it. All he had was paper and Pencil. Could you make all of the shelves we see in nature with three simple rules of this single circle spinning through three dimensions, how tall it gets along the access, and how, how much those worlds overlap each other.

Speaker 1:          11:54          These ideas we'll pick top or 40 years later by a paleontologist called David route. Um, who did something unusual for a paleontologist. Um, certainly at the time he used a computer and he took these equations from Thompson and he plugged them into a mainframe. Ibm 1790 computer. There's sort of thing that was at the time, this was an in the 60s, 50s and 60s was intended to be used for designing aircraft and nuclear reactors, but I think he managed to get some time downtime. Um, he was at Johns Hopkins, University of Maryland, um, and he used this computer to, to build shells and to see if these, um, these simple rules that Thomson had come up with, whether you really could make all the different styles that you see in three dimensions. And, um, and he did, I mean the output he had from his computer work where it was all kind of two d plots, which would then realize by an artist in three dimensions.

Speaker 1:          12:48          But we can now have a look at kind of a, a mock up of what the output of his model would have looked like. And I'm to let that run. I think it's incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing. So what we're doing here is just changing these parameters, the heights, the expansion, the rate at which the shelf flares open as well. And just by changing these three parameters, you do actually get an incredible diversity of shells emerging from those simple rules. That's incredible. Yeah. This, the diversity of shells can be explained through fairly simple mathematic. You get the clan from a spiraling Shelly, you wouldn't expect that, but it kind of pops up. And, and what route did was he created? What's come to be known as the Museum of all possible shells and populated by these shells created from this is lower than that, these, these equations.

Speaker 1:          13:38          And, um, and what seem to be all these different endless forms that you see in nature. But the really surprising thing he found was that the museum of all possible shells actually isn't full of real shells. If you look at the shells that have actually evolved, um, in the past through fossils and through, um, uh, what's it like today? There are lots of parts of this space if you think about it as being this actual space with those three parameters on each song. The next one is that access. There are large parts of this space that aren't occupied and those shells have evolved and it's very, it's raised this question about, um, uh, this is a theory called, um, sort of theoretical morpho space. The possibilities of what organisms could be and what shapes they can be and what they actually are and why there's a difference between the two.

Speaker 1:          14:29          So evolution hasn't taken mollis cause shells to all the possibilities that the, um, the simple rules could, could lead to some of these shelves just haven't existed, not pointed out to some of them. Once he made in his computer, wouldn't have worked there or clams that wouldn't open. There are some that would just be kind of flimsy and they wouldn't be competitive, um, out there in the wild, in the wild ocean and in places where molluscs live. But there are plenty of shuttles that seemed to be perfectly good and there seems no reason why they haven't evolved and there's people have expanded this idea out now and we've built museums of possible possible, um, fish and plants and all different types of organisms that you can look at them or follow it and see what could be, what potential shapes they could be and then compare that to what we actually see.

Speaker 1:          15:16          And again, and again, you see this limit of what is creators, what evolution has thrown up and, and what potentially could occur and, and discussions are going on. Like there is this division between some people who think that ultimately, yes, all these shelves could and would evolve if the situation arose. That's that shell would be well adapted to a particular condition. And there are others who think that actually maybe no, then that's the evolution. Genetically there isn't the material that would ever evolve these shelves. I just wouldn't ever happen. Um, and the discussions go on. So that's one of the big questions or look into in a bit more detail in the book of, of how shells evolve, why they're different shapes and why we don't actually see all the potential shells that mathematics suggest could exist in the world. So that's the life part of the subtitle.

Speaker 1:          16:05          Um, there's also the afterlife and um, this isn't the bit of the book where I talk about snail ghosts or any kind of belief in the afterlife. It's really just my desire to talk about, uh, how humans have used shells. So after the animals inside that made them died in long gone and they've left behind these empty shells. Um, we do all sorts of things with them and there's incredible long history, pretty much to the dawn of humanity that people have seen shells. They found them and put them to all sorts of uses, practical and incredibly deep symbolism and meaning and seashells. Um, I was really amazed researching the book, just how broad and how universal these beliefs in shells are there. Symbols of sex and death and birth and, and power and money and cultures all over the world and even far, far from the ocean and have these incredibly strong beliefs.

Speaker 1:          17:00          And Charles, so I'm going to tell some of those stories and I partly wanted to try and reinstate some of the grander and some of the, um, the wander and magnificence of shells in human hives because today I think shells have kind of got more of a reputation for being fairly kind of bad, cheap, throwaway trinkets, their emblems of the ocean that we can buy, you know, buy from a seaside stall or perhaps we can find them ourselves. We don't maybe pay them that much attention and people make things like, um, there we go. That's the kind of thing people use salesforce these days. Um, and we make things like this. And also this, which is true, this was on site, found this on sale on Ebay. She's got lovely, lovely headdress on the her all day running around. Um, so I basically just wanted to, I what I wanted to do is, was tell stories of how people have used shells in the past in ways that it far more magnificent. So this guy here is about 7,000 years old.

Speaker 2:          18:01          I don't know why does this morning star, I'm going to just hang on a second. Let us do this a different way so it just stops, stops going too quickly.

Speaker 1:          18:11          Um, so yeah, I wanted to tell stories of how people have used towels not to make comedy frogs. So next. Um, so this is, uh, this is a great founder in Bulgaria. Um, and uh, about 7,000 years old time of old, you didn't, it's cool. They're called the old Europeans. Then you wonder why it's doing that auto advance on it doesn't matter. I want to tell you what I can do, what I can put up the pdf and use the pdf. Yeah, thanks. Sorry.

Speaker 2:          18:52          Okay, excellent.

Speaker 1:          19:04          Sorry. Um, yes. Stories of shows been using human lives that's um, this, this incredibly rich history of, of, of the beliefs and the symbolism of shale. So this, this, um, chat is the leader of the Wianno community. These guys lived in Europe for about 7,000 years ago up until this point when this was discovered in the 1970s, this grave in a, in a city of the dead, um, in Bulgaria. It was still that the Europeans were quite in the gutter Terrian group and that they were mostly just, um, nomadic farmers. That was their sign up until that point, have any elites who are kind of in charge and that society was fairly even an equal. And then they find a grave with a guy covered in gold and, uh, with all sorts of jewelry, uh, including some very beautiful shall jewelry. And that's why I want to talk about this particular case.

Speaker 1:          19:56          Um, around this guy's upper arm. You can see on one side he's got bangles and commuting a white one. And that's made from a shell called spawn diagnose. It comes from a long way from this part. It wasn't coming from the Black Sea, but from the Mediterranean. And, um, and there was this long distance trade in the shells, correspond spondylitis that were carved into beautiful objects, um, all the way across Europe to Paris. And I know from what was done with them was they were carved into bangles at people wore. Um, and it, there's even been studies to show you that, um, some of these bangles are put onto people's arms when they were children and then they, they drew into them and can take them off again. Um, this particular one there was just really intriguing. So it was carved from this big shell, these big spot in apple spiny oysters.

Speaker 1:          20:39          It's another name for these shelves. Then in life, they're covered in spines, but cut them through and they've got this beautiful bright white home show and coughed into a bangle roquette's kits and then fixed it with gold plates. Um, and that's what this guy's wearing and we don't know why they did that. Spurious others, this is very solid. The remains that seem to have been deliberately broken of these shows, um, left in graves. So there's some significance behind this particular, this particular show was always the same species that was being used and then it just disappeared. And they stopped being used at this about 6,000. He's got, and that's it. No more spondylitis. Um, there was a parallel trade in spawn of shells in the Americans with the Aztecs, the Mayans, they were using spawn dollar sales, fall decorations and money. Um, they were carving statuettes of humans, giving them to children and taking them to the tops of the highest mountains and leaving them there as human sacrifices.

Speaker 1:          21:31          So there were all these incredible significant stories about shells. So I tell some of those stories in the book, um, and hopefully kind of try to William State some of the, the sense of mystery and wonder about what watch hell's are. And I think one of the reasons people value them so much is because they come from this doc, uh, deep ocean where, you know, full of sea monsters and things we can't see. But these beautiful objects washed up on beaches and people have always wondered why they come from and how they're made and holding them. Great three meeting. So, uh

Speaker 2:          22:03          Oh no, I'm breaking the time.

Speaker 1:          22:06          Sorry.

Speaker 2:          22:13          That's fine.

Speaker 1:          22:14          And so it wasn't, uh, the beliefs and the kind of symbolism and mysteries of shells have an all just died out in the past. There's plenty of, of modern thank you very much. Security. Um, there are still some, some one stories in modern of of shelves fitting that role of, of some mysterious objects surrounded by sort of significant beliefs and ideas. And, and I followed the story of one of them in the modern world today. If this stuff could see silk silk from the seat. And lots of ancient stories have been told about this stuff called [inaudible], which comes from a shell called the noble Penn Shell. It was crazy in the Caribbean, in the Mediterranean, they can go talk to a meter tall. They look like giant muscles, just like a muscle that you would eat. They stand really tall and this stuff called CSO, it comes from the threads that they make to anchor themselves to the seabed.

Speaker 1:          23:09          If you've ever eaten muscles or had cooked them a breathing muscles, you will probably have to bid them and put young cows the a fibers. That's that. They have same stuff. I mean these shells have really big ones cause they been bigger and they have to use that there. And biceps threads, which I'll come back to, to, to, to anchor themselves solidly into the, don't get swept away. Anyway. So there's lots of stories told about Cecil also known as basis. Um, there are stories told of the ancient Egyptians varied there, pharaohs and wrapped in cloth made of see, Soak. Henry the eighth had a picnic for the king of France with his men all dressed in golden. See soap. And the stories go on and on the stories in the Bible of [inaudible]. Um, and, and a lot of people do still believe that the, you know, this has a very ancient origin.

Speaker 1:          23:57          Maybe thousands of years ago. And I went to, uh, to southern, yeah. To find and to meet the lady who calls herself the last Maestro Fci. So can, she says she's the only person left in the world. He knows how to weave fabric and threads from this, this fiber lady called Chiara Vigo. Um, there was a story in the BBC couple of days ago about her. Um, it might seen it on the BBC website, check it out. That gives one side of the story, which is interesting, um, about what she goes up to. And she has a museum of business advisors museum and a tiny island of Sardinia called some kind of yoga where she does she practices. We even, she shows people how this is done. And, um, we tells all these stories about isis and see sort of going back into the Bible and beyond thousands years ago. Um, but as I was researching and working on the book, I met and spent a lot of time with, um, a few people who actually study.

Speaker 1:          24:52          Cecil can look at them. Um, the, the academic side of it. And scholars have tried, have traced records of sea salt back in, back in the literature back into the past and discovered that there's a big problem with this story that Cecil silk is such an ancient stuff. Um, and, and really it comes down to a spelling mistake about, um, well in the 15th century, a lot of talk about sea salt goes back to Aristotle's book on the history of animals and he talks about Penn shells and, um, how, uh, they have these, these, these fibers coming out to them called [inaudible]. And therefore sea salt comes from Penn shells and it's, uh, it's connected to this work basis. Um, but actually what the truth of it is, is that word basis was never connected to Penn shells. When Aristotle originally wrote those books, it was a translation much later that miss translated a word that means deep and depth.

Speaker 1:          25:49          The word that leads us to things like, um, at this, um, and um, bathysphere so word for deep, what he was originally saying was that these shells grown the deep water. And, um, and that was that, that's why he used the word biceps. And a translation came along, um, in Latin later on in the 15th century, shifted an accent from one word of, I think it actually from the Greek, from one letter to another and changed it from meaning deeper too, meaning fine cloth. And from then on by Isis was associated with fine cloths and there is a word by isis that means linens and cottons and all sorts of fine fabrics but not specifically. But once that translation kicked in and it was a really popular translation of that book by Aristotle, everyone thought that by Isis, whenever it was mentioned back in, in all of the old texts refers to CSUMB and it doesn't, it just means fine, plump.

Speaker 1:          26:40          So unfortunately all this talk about Cecil being this ancient stuff, it doesn't really have any foundation, but no one really is listening to these scholars who were saying, have you actually looked and seen that there is this mistake and we're, we're actually telling stories that aren't true. But that doesn't stop. Um, a certain lady continuing to show people this and that's fine. I went to see her, she was very pleasant and she showed me what she was doing. But when I was in Santiago, I also met, Uhm, okay, that's a lump of law by service before it's been processed as it's been pulled off the shelf, it's got little bits of seashell in it. And that freeness shop is a piece of process by Isis. The Cecil before she leaves it, um, I met these ladies who also, so we've see so soon. Chiara is not the only one.

Speaker 1:          27:24          She claims to be the maestro. But there are some other people who still do it. And these lovely ladies show me the same process, how, how they card the fibers, how they spin them and then use them to, we've um, uh, embroideries I guess. And the problem, one of the problems is that the pen shells and are protected. There are protective species cause for various reasons they're not doing very well. They live in sea grass beds, um, which just suffering from things like climate change and habitat destruction. So they've been protected and you're not allowed to actually take them. It's illegal to take these shells. What harm limit any way. Kiarra claims that she has found a a way of sustainably harvesting CSUMB from Shell's, uh, by taking them up and snip threads and then putting them back. Um, the problem is that she's so surrounded in secrecy and what she does that no one is allowed to go with her while she's doing this.

Speaker 1:          28:14          Um, and so I can't comment as to whether she's actually doing this sustainably or if she's up to something else because she absolutely refused for me to go with her and see what she was up to. Um, the other ladies, this is the picture of these two groups, these guys, these guys just subpoena and Asam, Tina Pez, we're very open and said to me, you know, we can't get hold of many more fibers. We can't do this new anymore. They had a little collection of it that their grandmother had given them and they use it to show people like me who wants to just want to see how it's done. Mostly that mostly they just use other fibers these days and carry on with their traditional weavings, but not with CSOS. And occasionally a fisherman will find a dead shell and give it to them and they have a bit more to use.

Speaker 1:          28:56          But then like, you know, it's a thing of the past. We want to remember how it's done, but we can't pretend that we can still do it because these shells just aren't available. Um, and I just got this very, I felt like when I was reporting on the story, this was not what I was expecting at all. I was just expected to tell a simple story of this strange old fiber that's been here since the Bible and kind of found I was getting sucked into the stranger story than I expected of, of things not being quite as they should see. So it was really fun. So how are we doing for time? Excellent. A question. I often get asked by people, mostly kids, but then they always asked the best questions. And when I'm talking about Cheryl's and molluscs and my book is what's my favorite shell and what's my favorite mollusk um, so I tell them, that's a really hard question.

Speaker 1:          29:44          You do know that there might be 200,000 species. Um, but okay, if you make me, I will tell you that my favorite is the argonaut. I even have it on my teachers that's helping with, um, and uh, there's a couple of reasons why I do genuinely think that organoids are brilliant, brilliant. Mollusks. Um, firstly, all they are the only octopus that have shells. So up to pursue the other mollusks that generally have, um, evolved. Like for that Michelle, they'd have a soft life. They're very, have evolved other mechanisms to survive and to do kind of be well without having an external shell. But argonauts still have shells. I can just about make out. So this is, it's, they also go paper Nautilus. They're not related to the chambered nautilus and you look a little bit like it and they have this paper, Rochelle, um, and then the octopus slips and sunlight and they're very beautiful creatures.

Speaker 1:          30:34          I've never seen one myself. Um, they live in the open ocean and they're really hard to find them. You have to really just find the shells washed up. But I'm no living creature inside. And for a long time, the big question was there were these kind of sort of gentlemanly arguments and debates among the scientists, certainly the Victorian Times about the true, the truth behind [inaudible] and whether or not they make their own towns or whether they steal them from some other animal that we haven't yet discovered. Um, this was the likes of Richard Oh, in the guy who set up the natural history museum. Um, he was really keen to figure out whether argonauts where, what shall makers or basically pirates that stock shelves, Monica creatures. And they were just really a story is told and all sorts of, I think Aristotle told stories about this and um, about argonauts, um, I think he started it all off actually by claiming to have seen, um, argonauts using their shells as little boats.

Speaker 1:          31:32          So I haven't got one to tell you, but Tom, they are quite hollow and lights and you can imagine that they would float along the surface of the sea. And he told stories of seeing these little octopus sitting inside there, but in their shells, um, and sticking to have their tentacles, which one of them you can see here, they do spread out into this white men range. We'll come back to, but he recommend they put them in the air as sales and they caught the breeze. They drifted around in their little boats or boats or other scientists claimed to have seen argonauts using their arms as Rohan to run solve along again on the steps of the seat with that all boats. So, um, and the story gets told them, told if you read 20,000 leagues under the sea by Joe Van, he tells the story about how Professor Eran acts at one point pops up onto the nautilus.

Speaker 1:          32:16          Haha. There's the nautilus, there's a name again. Actually. It's quite sweet. The, um, uh, and he sees, uh, they see, uh, a raft of, of argonauts drifting past. It seems to go from a five minutes. Um, and um, uh, and yeah, with the is the is which the sales supposedly drifting along. Um, and it's his butler. At one point you pointed out, I don't know if you know the story of 20,000 Leagues under the sea and how it's Captain Nemo, who's this kind of crazy, um, um, Marriner who kidnaps the scientists and takes him around the world, um, in the nautilus, which is just suffering. Um, and there's, uh, there is some scientific truth, a lot of the stuff that he writes about us. What was the science at the time we knew about, um, that's your van was, it was really a marine biology book, but kind of with a story, which is quite nice.

Speaker 1:          33:05          And, um, professor Aaron Acts, the Marine Biologists assistant actually says, well, why didn't captain Nimo call his ship the Arbonne naught? Because, um, argonauts the optimists can actually come all the way out of the shell. Unlike an autonomous, which is like a snail, you can take it out. It would immediately not be very, well if you tried to put us near like Michelle, but the optimists can leave their shells, but they just choose not to. Um, and Captain Nemo was kind of the same. He could leave his, um, he could leave his submarine be, chooses not to. He lives forever beneath the waves, kind of an exile from humanity. So I thought that was quite nice. There was a point about, it's like you should have called it the up the arm and or not Nautilus. Um, so yeah, so this debate went on about our do argonauts make their shells or do they steal them?

Speaker 1:          33:53          And the other reason why really wanting to tell the story of I'm not some why they're brilliant is because of this lady who finally cracked this question of the truth about argonauts. Um, her name's John John. We've her power and she was French and married, um, a Sicilian Sicilian. He, she went to, lived in Sicily, um, as a lady of leisure. She started off life as a poor, um, in a little village in France, but ended up meeting this guy and get married and spent the rest of her life, um, as a scientist, like basically it's a lady of leisure that she decided that she wanted to go out and just explore the world. She explores this lady. She did lots of studies of the animals of the island. She sounds a bit like a, a latter day. Gerald Durrell, she brought things to live in a house with her.

Speaker 1:          34:40          There were pine Martins running around and, but, but one of the things she did, and she actually isn't very well remembered for and why I want to write about her story is that she, she pioneered some Incredibles marine biological studies, um, and invented it, um, an aquarium tank for research. And she built this thing, um, which kind of was just made of words. It was an open box with wooden slats that let's see water come through. And she would anchor it at the edge of the sea and she would take argonauts that fishermen would catch for her and she would occasionally catch herself. And she placed him in these, in these observation chambers. And she conducted some really quite elaborate experiments on them to figure out, okay, do they make shells or do they borrow them from something else or do they parasitize and other animal.

Speaker 1:          35:24          And, um, and I give the details of experiments in the book and there's a really brilliant idea. Some of them are a bit cruel, you know, you have to do things like brake, Argonaute shells and see if they can fix them, take their shells away. And she slowly built up this picture that really did convincing each show that Arbonne awesome. Yes, they do make their own entails. And in fact it's the females that do. Um, and the males are just were nowhere to be seen, but it was always the females she found when making these shelves. And in fact this, um, the membrane that you see on the, um, on the outside of start, that's what makes the show. It's really different to the other molluscs which have this thing called a mantle, which covers all of their body and that's what makes the shell, whereas they have a modified the end of two tentacles and they, it looks kind of silvery when you see them alive and they, um, they can fix up patches in a shelf.

Speaker 1:          36:10          It's broken. And they also make the show initially they only have to make one shell, like the rest of the mollusks. Uh, so if they, if they, if they're parted from that Shell, um, they don't survive, which I guess is what I think always hang on to them. Um, so she started having ideas. Um, we are pro power did have ideas about why were the males that she didn't quite get to the bottom of it. The females make these shells, they lay their eggs inside the shells and use them as a brood chamber, um, but wearing pants and it wasn't till much later it was discovered that the males are tiny, tiny, small, um, and basically kind of parasitize the female. Um, and they have one tentacle with a packet of sperm on the end of which they looked at her and it sticks to her body and she can collect a few of them and put them inside her shell and carry them around until she's ready to fertilize her eggs.

Speaker 1:          36:56          Um, so the males kind of having mother different problems in life and the female, um, and still things we're finding out new things about argonauts recently, one guy in Australia found some live ones and discovered that, um, they actually use their chamber, their shelves as a buoyancy aid, but like chambered nautilus is they have air inside their shows, which they use to keep them floating on the water. So it's a bit easier for them to swim. And, um, nautilus is do argonauts to a similar thing. He saw them basically if we emptied all the air out of their shells, they all would swim straight back to the surface gulp in some air into their shell and then spin back down until they were neutrally buoyant at the depth they wanted to live. So it kind of reduces their costs of swimming by having a bubble of air inside.

Speaker 1:          37:39          It's like kind of underwater blimp, which is really cool. And leads me to my final thing I wanted to talk to you about, which, um, takes me back to the title of the book. And also I want to tell you a little bit about, um, the artwork, which I absolutely love. And, um, really just so pleased with the way the book has come out and how it looks. And it all comes down to this picture of an [inaudible]. Um, it was around the time I was writing the Argonaute chapter that I'm, my publishers. I published [inaudible] said that I really had to decide what I was going to call the book, uh, cause we had to come up with another title, which early on we decided we didn't like what's going to call it snails, tears and fund the stones. Um, and then everyone said the don't know what's under stones are and what's this thing about snails death.

Speaker 1:          38:26          I think spectator if you want. But anyway, we decided that was no good, but I was so obsessed with argonauts and I was writing this chapter with all of the great stuff that she discovered. And um, this all the city's stories, um, all I can see where I'm going on. So that was my kind of five year in life. So I wanted to call the book flight of the Argonauts, um, especially with this discovery of how they use air to help them swim underwater. Um, and so, and I was hunting around a line for pitchers of argonauts and I found this one, um, and spine, um, an industry to call Tara and John Gregory had liberty's websites and not only did he sell tee shirts with these island, which was really cool. Um, it turns out that he's in a band called giant squid. Um, we got into it, he lives in San Francisco and we got in touch and he'd just been on holiday to one of the islands off of California and he'd found an organ or shell on the beach.

Speaker 1:          39:15          We'd have to have this guy, he's a marine biologist by training and was retreat, has just finished retraining as a fine artist. So he was, as Geeky is as Geeky as I am about all the marine creatures. It's like we have to have him to do the front cover artwork because we were also looking for, for who we wanted to work with on that as well as the title of the book at this time. So we got in touch with him and I'm really pleased that he agreed to kind of immediately to work with us, which is fantastic. Um, and I don't think he quite knew what he's letting himself in for because we were still undecided about the title and I was still pushing for flight to the argonauts, so we were like, go and do some argonauts. So he does some sketches. I'm going to show you some of the sketches that he gave centers, um, an unseen before, since it's very exciting, but anyone apart from me and my public.

Speaker 1:          39:59          So, um, so first of all, he gave us some sort of tentatively, I'm on the naughty ones and I think they're great. And I was really just so keen to have flights to the arms of knots on the front cover. But no, we decided that no one would think that it wasn't all, it wasn't a book about argonauts this just a bit of it. So we had to return, think of it, a different title and it was literally coming down to the last minute of like, can we just have another day to decide what the title's going to be? And I kept on coming up with ideas that we're working. Um, and then I went on holiday to Devin and spend a few days mocking around on the seashore and finding shells and having a nice time. And then spirals and time just popped up and I thought about the, and everyone else seemed to like it.

Speaker 1:          40:38          So we stopped with spirals and time. Um, and that actually meant for the cover that we then had a whole free rein of what we can put on the front cover of the book. Um, I should say that I really am, I really appreciated having a chance to be involved in the sign in the front cover cause I don't think authors don't always have that opportunity. If my first book I was just told, here's your cover, whereas bloom spirit, we're keen to have me involved and I really, it's been really fun to have to sort of be, be a part of the way it looks as well as the worst and side. Um, so I told Erin, so the two things I wanted to have on the front cover where lots of different species of Mollusk, um, I wanted to try and capture this idea of them being this incredibly diverse group and also want them to be alive.

Speaker 1:          41:19          One thing again that I really want to do with the book is to show people that Shell's aren't just these boring dead things that, you know, sit around doing nothing. They come from these incredible living creatures that live extraordinary lives. So I wanted living diverse mosques all over the cover. So the first sketchy came up with was this, um, uh, which we'd like to, that you can just make that out and was moved to the laser mollusks uh, but Jim Martin way the term is like, nope, too many mollusks cut it down to confusing. How about a spiral of bollocks. The Tajness Byron at times we could have a spiral. Brilliant idea. So we said go dose a spiral. So Aaron did this, a couple of spirals get to is do you want it download page or do you want to coming out as happier? Of course I wanted to coming out at me.

Speaker 1:          42:04          Um, we then sort of said that's really pale, but be basically said, yeah, I'm a big spiral going across both covers he um, pen, pencil, sketch. He then, this is really interesting because, um, I didn't know how art is done these days, but apparently what he did was he painted these in with ink and a paintbrush by hand and then he called in on a computer. So he used a tablet to do with coloring in afterwards. I after scanning in the inks and then came up with some color options and we decided to which one we it. And ultimately that was wonderful. And I just love it. I think it's brilliant. Um, some of the other things he did didn't, he did it, this administration at the beginning of each chapter. So I just want to quickly show you those. So he would give us, I would say, okay, the chapter about cone snails.

Speaker 1:          42:50          We want a nice active cone now and catching a fish. And then he thinks those things as well. Um, tucked her about see butterflies, these beautiful sea snails, that microscopic animals that fly through the open ocean whole chapter about those. So he did us a beautiful wedding image, should have a seat butterflies and then um, oh, I'm an [inaudible] but actually that's the top two with the argonauts. And they talk also about the ancient extinct mollusks. And this is power pursues the are the biggest ammonite that we did like three meters across. And the little shock there is to give you scale. Um, so did some beautiful images. And then finally, I'm really pleased that the book can you get the hard, but if you do grab a coffee, um, the any plates side once this from my first book, but they said no, but I really wanted to have beautiful sails on the beginning and the end. So I said we wanted went will trap snails because they've got these incredible complex shells. So Aaron did a little skit and then that's what it looks like. So if you do have a private copy hard back, you have snails about life size calling over the front and back, copied her back cover. So they do. Thank you very much.

Speaker 3:          43:59          [inaudible].
