Speaker 1:          00:06          Please welcome Lizz Winstead Lizz Winstead is the cocreator and former head writer of the daily show and cofounder of Air America radio. She's the author of live free or die and her latest project is lady parts Justice League. Liz, thank you for joining us for having me. I'm so, I had made a note to myself when I was coming up with what to talk about before we dive into everything. I'll just ask, look, a nice opening question, maybe something based on the news of the day. And then I was like, that's a terrible idea. That doesn't sound like a pleasant way to, well, the news of the day. It's like the news of the moment. So I don't know when this goes up. Yeah. I haven't looked at other things that we'll be tackling. Matt. Yeah. Basically just say garbage, fire and Lavonne. Yeah. All right. So with that out of the way, garbage, fire, garbage partner now, um, what is lady parts? Justice League? Well, uh, it is, we're a, we're a nonprofit,

Speaker 2:          01:09          but that is made up of Comedians, writers, graphic designers, shooters, editors, and it's a bunch of people that decided there's so much horrible news happening in the landscape of reproductive rights and justice. And when you turn on your television or you talk to other friends who care about this, oftentimes they think they know and they don't know, uh, they know about one third of what's actually happening. And so we wanted to do two things. We wanted to make videos that expose the politicians and the laws and just the Cretins in general who are assaulting the access to reproductive healthcare. And then the other cool thing we do, which is sort of my favorite thing that we do, is we are a Bam. That is a combination of kind of like, let's call it a USO show and habitats for humanity. So actually today we are launching, we're doing a 16 week tour that we're just announcing today.

Speaker 2:          02:07          Um, we're going to eight for eight weeks. We're going to 16 cities starting June 2nd in the deep south and the Midwest. We'll do it. We'll do a comedy music show and then we're going to do outreach to clinics. We're going to like help build fences, um, do gardening for them, bring them like food, take them up or drinks anything to sort of normalize their work and to sort of do a emotional reset on what it means to be a provider. Because I think I had, I started this, um, in 2012 I just did my own little comedy tour of clinics and when I talked to providers and maybe the receptionist or even like a nurse, they would say to me, thank you for coming here. No one ever comes. And that just struck a chord with me so profoundly than I thought. I don't really have to adjust my life at all.

Speaker 2:          02:56          I'm basically just still doing shows making, but I'm horning in on a subject that I care deeply about that I feel like doesn't get enough attention. So that's what it is. It's what we do. That's pretty awesome. Thanks. One of the things you mentioned is gardening, and I actually hadn't heard about this before. Can you talk a little bit about like, we know what a fence at an abortion clinic would help. Do you, can you talk about your daughter when a garden at an abortion clinic does? Well, let me tell you, because it does many things and it's more than that. I don't bury the fetuses. They are contrary to the news from Breitbart and alternative facts. Um, so a lot of times when we, cause we contact the clinics in advance to see what they need and they always say things like, it's like an orphanage.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Sometimes it's like just, you know, if you had cupcakes or if he could just come by, you know, it's like, no, seriously. So we bring cupcakes or lunch and then we sort of assessed what's happening. And so a good example of what we do is we went to North Carolina, um, because there's an organization that was called 40 days for life that was trying to plan a sneak attack on this clinic. Well, we do some infiltrating of websites and places and found out about this. So we decided to go down there and preempt this massive bus that came. And so protestors, oftentimes we'll stand on property anywhere they can and the clinic doesn't even see like a whole that could be filled. So we looked at where the protestors were standing and realize, you know, if we just planted a gigantic Holly Bush and if you know anything about Holly, it's really prickly that's tall enough, that is just one space that a protest or can't stand and scream into the clinic.

Speaker 2:          04:37          So we do that. Um, sometimes it's like when you build a fence, you just have to do some gardening around it. So it can be strategic planting or it can be, you know what, this is a place people go to the doctor. It should look nice and it should feel normal. And so our big thing is to bust stigma. You know, get rid of the shame. Let doctors feel like they can live in the light and have had to have the, have the staff and people and p patients that go feel like they're doing what they are doing, which is accessing one of a panoply of medical services that somebody might need in their lifetime. So making it normal, making abortion. Great. Again. What we do. Um, let's, I'd love to back up and just look at how you got here. So we back all the way up.

Speaker 2:          05:24          Um, it's my understanding that you grew up in a Catholic home in the Midwest, so everyone super psyched about my choices in life. Yeah. So I did you, was there some like grand feminist awakening? There was a couple grand feminist awakening. One was that much to the luck of me, I'm the youngest of five kids and my family and my parents are Super Catholic. Like not like this Pope Catholic like, cause a couple pumps that go catholic will popsicle Catholic. This poll is sort of awesome, right? I mean, he's kind of like, I look at this pope and I think he's kind of like, uh, a guy who was in a crappy band, but when I was having an amazing solo career, so it's like, and then when they play the old hits, you're like, shut up with the old days. It's ain't nobody got time for your old heads.

Speaker 2:          06:12          Um, so it was, uh, it was one of those things where there was a couple things. One, I had never been in, this is going to just sound horrible in the context of what we talked about already. I was never driven to have kids. It's just never been my thing. Right. And so even as a little kid, like I am the person that loved Barbie. And so it because Barbie had a boyfriend and she had her own house and a car and like I didn't care what the boobs or even that she couldn't stand. The fact of the matter is, she was like independent, put her in the car. There she goes, you know. So I really liked that in a doll. And I, and even my mom said, you know, you never play with the things I give you. And it was like, well you gave me like a baby doll and then you gave me an iron and then you gave me an ironing board and then he gave me a stove.

Speaker 2:          06:57          And it's like basically everything that you saw at night over you gave to me as like a toy. It's like, where's the inflatable drunk? Have a husband toy cars, why don't we just round this whole life out? Um, and so I needed to make money as a kid, you know, for candy and lip gloss or whatever we were raising money for at that time. And I saw all the boys being ultra boys, right. And I was like, well that's a way to make money. They were like raking it in serving at weddings and funerals, you know, apparently you didn't get paid for like the, the Sunday mass thing. So when I went to the priest and I said, I want to be an ultra boy, the priest freaked out and said, pulled out of his ass. Literally. He goes, well, you can't because, and I could see, you know how adults going like this when they're like done having to say like, it was like doing that.

Speaker 2:          07:44          And he was like, well, you know, it's called alter boy. So obviously I was like, well, and I wasn't trying to be a jerk. I was just trying to get to make money at the weddings. That's what I wanted to do. So I said, well, you know, you could call me an altar girl. And then he was like, well, uh, you know, you should, you should write the archbishop just passing the buck. Right? So I got a petition and I wrote the archbishop. And like not long after I wrote the Archbishop, unfortunately, uh, during length, archbishop had too much to drink and deploy out into the wall of a seven 11. So the archbishop had his own problems to deal with and wasn't concerned about letting me be an ultra by. But at that point I just was like, I had this little case of like, I don't get it.

Speaker 2:          08:31          I don't get why I'm a girl and I can't be an altar boy. This is dumb. And so there was just instances in, in life in general where if there was a clear explanation like don't climb a tree barefoot cause that's gonna cut your feet. I'm like oh that seems like good advice from an adult. But if there was no real explanation, I was just mad. And because I was a curious kid and so there was just a series of that shit that started happening. And then somebody said, you know, I haven't got cynical and then I would be a little snarky. And then somebody said he should try stand up. When I was in college and I thought, and this was a part that really got me and I looked at the landscape of standups and two, there was women doing it. There was like Joan Rivers and there was like Phyllis Diller.

Speaker 2:          09:16          But I didn't see myself. I was like a punk rock, 23 year old kid. And I didn't see, I didn't see my world coming out of anybody's mouths. And then I saw George Carlin. And so it took a dude to convince me that I could do stand up, which was a problem, like the bag that I did not see myself. And now it's so cool to see all of these really amazing women doing it. But yeah, so I started out, you know, just doing it and I would do like, I wasn't particularly political at the time, you know, I would have jokes like, um, if you ever play monopoly with bald guys, they always pick the hat, you know, stupid that took, doesn't even deserve that much laughter. But I'm not even kidding. That was really nice of you to do that. You know, I saw and then I would talk about gender and equity or you know, dating.

Speaker 2:          10:10          But um, he really wasn't, if I cared about politics, I was very, I like, I read about it and I knew about it, but I didn't put, bring into stage. Um, and then I guess if there was like true comedy, how did it change everything? It would have to be, oh my God, I can swear here. Right. And stuff. You have been, oh, I, I should have asked my 10 minutes ago. Um, I had moved to New York in 1991 and somebody sent me up on a blind date. Um, do you remember those? There was, it happened like they don't exist now cause you just hook up with people you regret later on your phone. Um, but there was a thing and it was like, it never was, I've got a person for you. Actually you don't. But I would go cause I'm from the Midwest and when someone says, you know, I have a person very, you're like, all right, well that's nice. I'll go to that. Cause you mean, right. So the guy shows up at my house and, and you know, like what's the plan? I'm like, well maybe do you want to go see La Dolce Vita? I've never seen it on a big screen. And he looks at me and he's like, it was the Lou in black and white, you know, like, oh man.

Speaker 2:          11:26          And if that wasn't bad enough, he is wearing a Yankees hat and a Yankee satin jacket. And I have a theory about guys that were more than one piece of sports clothing at the same time. And that is that they won't go down on you. I believe this is a proven thing. So I'm like, this is like a double whammy of, but I'm going to do it cause I'm from the Midwest and I'm nice. So we go to the movie and then the guy, this is going somewhere, people the story, I swear to God and I feel like she is probably not. Um, and the guy keeps falling asleep and then the rubbing his satin jacket up and down my arm and I'm just like eating my popcorn and like getting more and more rageful to the point where I was like, like fighting internally. My like I'm real nice and I fucking hate this guy.

Speaker 2:          12:26          So finally I just took my greasy hands and I just like purposely hit his jacket to wake him up. And then I felt horribly. I just felt horrible that I actually wrecked his jacket on purpose. And then, so I had to make up for it by saying, wake up, let's go have a drink, continuing this new. So we go to a bar that he knew about because he watched sports there. Um, but on this night there was no sports on because it was the night of the first Gulf War and if you'll remember you won't cause you probably weren't born. But um, it was the first time that America watched a war, like unfold in their living rooms live and they had replaced like the regular anchors on CNN with like handsome people. And there was that green light and people were very long ball. I'm Dirk sturdy on the roof and the bombs.

Speaker 2:          13:21          And it was like, I just watched it and I wasn't trying to wax philosophical. I was just taking it in thinking are they reporting on a war or trying to sell me a war? And about two minutes later the date was like, this is really awesome. And I was like, this is a fucking problem. And so I just sort of started from that moment on like paying more attention to the media, seeing the information that like I was getting, seeing what kind of like are they just reporting the press releases from the White House? Like what can I talk about? What can I not, you know? And so my comedy acts or to changing dramatically. Talking a lot about, um, not only America's role in the world, politics in general, but also the media's role in how all that played out. And when I realized as we started getting ourselves into these big manipulative wars that the media was as complicit as any, I mean literally when, when your network is reporting on the news and doing reports about the negotiations of whether or not we're going to go to war.

Speaker 2:          14:27          And then when they go to commercial, there's a giant graphic that says countdown to the war. You're like, um, I'm going to go shit. Or do you know something? I don't know. Because you are literally have a theme song and a graphic that says we're counting down to the war, not work. Negotiating to see if we're going to go to war. So I did a couple of one woman shows and then, um, I was like trying to figure out what I was going to do next and will, I worked on Jon Stewart's first talk show as a producer and when that got canceled, um, a small group of that team was asked by our executives who had moved over to comedy central if we wanted to launch a show that responded to the world. And I was like, oh my God, are you kidding me? I am like a person who can barely type and I've never run any show and all I do is spout off my mouth. But yes, it's kind of my dream. And so the daily show was born, um, and created by a whole bunch of people who had a lot of passion for, um, exposing hypocrisy and being funny and well, you know, fair. It is. I'm here for 20 years. It did good. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:42          Um, some of the, I'm curious about in your work before the daily show, the daily show and after it's, you know, you said that they, they wanted you guys to create a show that was responding to the news, the news. Yeah. And so you use comedy to talk about politics and world events, but in the daily show, in your other work, it's also using politics and world events as the fodder for comedy.

Speaker 2:          16:08          Yeah. And also as a potter for the media, you know, I can, it can't be stressed enough how much the media has played a role through all of this. You know, how much cable news and as it bloated out more, um, has been complicit in all of it. So yes. Um, I think the problem that I faced is, you know, after we launched the daily show, um, and then I left and I went on to do some other smaller shows. I did one on oxygen that was like actually a really funny show that was six episodes. That was like the daily show meets cold bear mates. Um, Kathy, Liam, who, whatever those women are living here. It was like that kind of format. Um, and then we launched Air America radio. Yeah. And, um, and even that, as, as I'm out there as it was, or as much freedom as we had, should I say, it was still a part of an entity that was a corporate entity.

Speaker 2:          17:04          And, and the bottom line is, and all of these projects, I say this a lot, but it's true. I felt a lot like an anger fluffer. Like I've just got people riled up, but it wasn't my job to have a call to action so that can be funny and give people information and they're like, what do I do? Not? And I'm like, no, I'm just a comedian. I'm just the writer. I wanted to be able to give people a place to channel the energy. And so that's why, um, I wrote a book and then after I wrote the book, um, I decided that I really wanted to take all of the things I care about, comedy, social justice, making a difference through comedy and actually then hitting the ground and doing tangible work. Um, and the only way to do that was to start a thing. That's how I started this thing.

Speaker 1:          17:50          And so that brings us to this, this thing is perfect thing here. Yeah. Cause something I wonder about with the, the lack of call to actions is, you know, you'll see on Twitter and social media nowadays, like people saying like, look at this, this is happening. This is not normal. Don't be complacent. And I'm like, I'm not, what do I, what do I do? So what sort of, how are you moving from just raising people's awareness of what's going on to actually giving them tools or helping them figure out what they can do? Well, I think one of the things that's important for me is a figuring out how,

Speaker 2:          18:26          when, when you sign up to volunteer for us, for example, uh, we ask you how much time you have to give, what your skill set is. Um, and then we can make that work. Also. Like for example, in the women's March, it's, we had, we had an activist fair that we sponsored where we had 15 tables. It was right off the march path. At a hotel called the UN hotel. We did it here in New York cause I thought like, I don't want to go to DC. I want to stay here because a lot of the policies that people are going to be affected by those people live here. You know, we have strong immigrant population, strong undocumented population, women, you know, all of it. Um, and so we had 15 different organizations representing 15 different, um, ways that you could participate, whether it was environmental and racial justice, you know, whatever it was.

Speaker 2:          19:14          Um, and sort of our rule was your group has to be able to let people like get in there and do some work, you know, not just sign up and not just give us money. Like, because I think that's important. And so what we, what we do is, for example, if you wanted to volunteer with us, there's a myriad of things you could do. You can, um, we signed, we send postcards to clinics, um, throughout the year. And then we have four times a year. We have orchestrated postcode programs where I'm sending them love really makes all the difference in the world. So, you know, that's a simple thing we can do. We help legislative do like everybody else does where you can sign this petition. Um, for example, a, this is crazy. So we've worked with a clinic in Ohio. We went to Ohio to help out during the Republican convention because um, part of the activities for the RNC was to go protest to clinic.

Speaker 2:          20:04          They had, I mean, insane. So this clinic that we have befriended and now work with, someone stole their fence. A psychotic person had been like chipping away at the fence and just stole their fence. They came to work in their fence was gone. So we were able to, um, do a Facebook live event where we went on and we said, this clinic had their fence stolen. They need $10,000 to do it. Here's the origin story. We put the origin story out, we tell the thing, and the clinics said, you guys just raised us to mine offense in five hours. So, um, we're, when we pay attention to the needs of each of these places, uh, we can specifically tailor, uh, if, if we need graphic design work, if a clinic graphic design work for something they're doing. Um, if you want to help us with meals, I mean, this tour that we're going on, we're launching this tour today, you know, it's like weird launching a fundraiser with it because we need a van.

Speaker 2:          20:58          We're taking 11 bodies to go and grow community in 16 different cities where our clinic is desperately needing support that will last long after we show up. So, um, one of the things that's really kind of cool is we created a system where we'll do a comedy music shown a town. We have a talk back with the provider and maybe somebody who runs an escort program or somebody who runs that abortion fund in that state. Um, after they laugh and hear music, they'll hear a Q and a that's like this. They'll be the last questions and they can sign up to help the clinic out. So does that mean you bring cupcakes four times a year? Does that mean you help them with hot breakfast on the Saturday morning when there's a lot of clinics, does that mean you sign up to escort yourself? Does that mean that you get together and then you can reach out to us?

Speaker 2:          21:51          Um, and say we're trying to figure out a creative action. Can you help us? And we're like, sure. You know, we've helped people with like every other hospital gowns and go sit here and state legislatures office and just wait for your pap smear and then just sit there and wait and when they come out and see what he's doing and we're like, well we're her for pap smears since you absolutely know how my body works, I'd like you to actually give me a pap smear. Um, and so, you know, helping people get creative with their local actions is really great. And so we are constantly looking for, um, you know, people who can fill our creative pots so that, you know, cause a lot of plates are spinning at once. So if we're trying to help out Indiana, somebody says I'm creative and like, great, there's a thing in Ohio, you know, you can really help us do this thing or whatever it is. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:37          Yeah. The, the specificity in the concrete action there is amazing. Before I move on to my next question, we're going to be opening it up for audience questions in a minute. So if you want to ask a question, just go line up behind one of those microphones so that we know that you have a question. We'll get to that in one second. Um, but, but first, in addition to these very specific local on the ground efforts, you're also doing a lot online through social media, through video. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah. And maybe we should show one of our videos. So what a fantastic segue. What a fantastic segway. So we, um, one of the greatest joys is to dispel myths in a way that

Speaker 2:          23:19          people really latch onto. One of the greatest myths in reproductive health care is that plan B, an Iud or abortions. There was a supreme court case called Hobby Lobby where this Christian Craft store, I don't even know what that means. Um, decided that um, they didn't want to disperse birth control if the birth control was promoting abortion and they listed plan beyond their list and it's like plan B does not only does not perform or more promote abortion, it stops an egg from actually leaving the egg holder scientific term, um, in the first place. So in order to like lay the shit down ones all, we were like, let's make a video. So we decided to make a cartoon and we got led to Loria from orange is the new black to be the voice of Plan B and we'll just roll the, we'll roll the video, you'll learn a little something.

Speaker 3:          24:36          Sorry man. I have to get another cashier to sell you plan B. Why? Because Plan B causes abortion and I don't have to sell it to you because of abortion goes against my religious beliefs. Wait, it's not an abortion and double wait. A cashier can demand the birthday. You are correct ma'am. That is actually the law and I don't like it. Listen Up, Mr. Cashier, just out of birth control pill, no matter what they say on Capitol Hill, well his wrong, wrong stowaway then strong, strong lot do is blog where I can see which day Liz, what scientists say. So at the end of the day you can chew, drop some fans, tale world hobble feel dosh pill preventing unwanted pregnancy seems so helpful. How'd you get so many family? Well a lot of folks like this fella got together and decided that I caused some portions but I don't. I stopped population for happening. Preventing verbalization and pregnancy are nice. Egg isn't a pregnancy APP or an egg is fertilize. It takes 72 whole hours for the egg to make its way to the uterus and Plensa. That is a pregnancy. My job is to stop the aid for ever traveling to below via town, preventing that pregnancy. So life doesn't begin at conception when life begins. Is it opinion when pregnancy begins is a scientific back? Are you getting it yet?

Speaker 3:          26:18          Well think of it like a football game. The quarterback drops back and tosses to the receiver at the 20 yard line, happens a second to the receiver, catches the ball. Now we all know the rules. The fertilized eggs still needs to make it an event before it's a touchdown bought. If there is no ball to catch, there can never be, say, say pregnancy doesn't happen until their touchdown. So my job is the block back such down rope happening.

Speaker 3:          26:53          Wow. When be you're like the Deion Sanders isn't preventing pregnancy. Actually Deion Sanders wishes he was the plan via football. Well, I hope that cleared things up, but just in case it fits the bill. A helpful birth control pill no matter what their sale. Gamble a little hill. So now you know my truth. I'm all about prevention. If you condoms break Johnny, take a stand a day. Hope that you will drop some fans the world bill. Wow. Science is fun. You prevent more abortions than anyone I know. I'd be happy to sell you to customers. That's right. Prevention's My jab by now. Wait pill I ever seen again. Well let me put it to you this way, kid. I'm always here if you need me and I'm really safe. So you don't even need a prescription, even if you're a teenager. Yes. Even if you're a teenager. Oh, and just one more thing. I know I'm awesome, but please always use a condom. Join me and take the stand PJ on shuts down the big bats around birth control and abortion every damn day. Join us and not spread the truth.

Speaker 2:          28:35          Did you learn something? It was really important for us to make that video, especially with Neil Gorsuch who is as you know, um, uh, in line to possibly be the next Supreme Court justice and he's somebody who ruled in the lower court, um, for hobby lobby agreeing with the fake science that, you know, so we put it out and it's also for me really important, um, the line about teenagers, you know, it's good to make videos sometimes that kids can pass around to their friends and they can know that I can go get that if I'm a teen and, and my condom broke that I, I can, I can go test that out. Cause I think a lot of times we don't let our teens, we deny sexuality of teens and especially teen girls so much. And I think it's important to um, be living in the world where there's not abstinence and Unicorns in the one where there's actually sex and sometimes um, unintended pregnancy. And so let's like be real and help people out. So yeah. Yeah. And I think one of the, the great things about that video is the football shooting as from the penis.

Speaker 1:          29:42          Really good. One of the other great things in addition, because there are many bids, but that's actually my point that like it has that information for teens where it's like, hey teens, you can go get this over the counter. And it also has information for people who are already thinking and arguing about this. Like the something I haven't heard before is the distinction between when does life begin versus pregnancy begin because anyone can say, well, I think life starts here. I think it starts there, right?

Speaker 2:          30:11          That's life. Is that a person? You know what I mean? Like when, when life begins, literally is this subjective and life begins at conception. That is not a scientific term. It's a Ma. I mean that is, that's a religious term. No fertilization is conception. And so it still needs that, you know, and as we show this video, if you just figured that out now don't worry. Most people are like, I had no idea. It's like, it's okay. A lot of people didn't. In fact we thought plan B stopped an implantation from happening, but it turns out that's not what it does. So there's like misnomers around that, um, as well. So we wanted to make sure that people knew that it stops the egg from actually leaving the Fallopian tube in the first place. So, um, it was approved because they thought it might have stopped implantation. And here's what's crazy. The website of Plan B's says that and it's not right. So we consulted with a team of physicians to actually make sure it was right. So I'm like, so the football thing, is it cool? It's like it gets shot out of the thing and they're like, yeah, it's fine. So it was having them write, help us write it into plain, into medical texts and then having us translated into Fallopian tonal, southern ship. Um, it was kinda fun. Yeah. Well, cause in a lot of them

Speaker 1:          31:22          ways, the antiabortion movement has really controlled the rhetoric of how we talk, talk

Speaker 2:          31:27          about 310% and that can be incredibly damaging, incredibly shaming. And you know, it's like things that are very good friends we'll say are sometimes like I'm in the larger scale. It can make people wonder when they say like, well no one's for abortion. You know what, except for people who need an abortion, you know, like I say, often there aren't a good abortions thrown about abortion. So it's just the abortion that you need. And I think that we need to bear that in mind as somebody who's going through that choice to, to, uh, to terminate a pregnancy that, um, lobbing judgment or saying things like, um, that I'm pro choice. I'm not pro abortion. Um, well, you know, why is it that you say that? Um, by saying that it sounds like abortion is a dirty thing that has to happen when if one in three women statistically will have an abortion in her reproductive lifetime.

Speaker 2:          32:20          It sounds to me like that's a piece of medical care that a lot of people are going to meet. And so for us to put a caveat or a shaming space on that, um, based on the assault of disinformation medically, um, we need to examine that as people are advocates for, um, you know, full autonomy and if you believe that women's rights are human rights, um, one of the first rights that we should all be defending is how and if and when, um, you want to have kids and make sure you have full autonomy over your body. I believe I just entirely lost my train of thought because you're thinking about that penis shooting off that football and very distracting. I know. That's true. Um,

Speaker 1:          33:13          one, one question. What's something that's been in the news lately among all the many garbage fires? Yeah. And especially in the aftermath of the election is the question of whether

Speaker 2:          33:23          abortion rights and reproductive freedom should be, um, a non negotiable issue in the Democratic Party. The left if it's, if you can be, you know, on the left and not

Speaker 1:          33:40          pro choice. I, I mean I'm going to ask what are your thoughts on that? I think I know what your thoughts, I'd love to hear you talking about

Speaker 2:          33:47          wrote a massive piece. There was an article in the New York Times, um, uh, that just was in the New York Times where a woman wrote that there was Ailey, it was alienating in the women's movement. If you are not an abortion rights advocate. And what I say to that is simple, uh, you can totally be, uh, somebody who has personal feelings about abortion. The bottom line is we live in a secular society where abortion is safer than having your teeth pulled. And if you are going to advocate against a procedure that is going to literally clear a path for someone to pursue their own destiny, the no, that is problematic for me. And that is problematic for a movement as a whole. If you say you are a woman's right advocate or personal, the uterus advocate, that means that you have to actually put your feelings aside because your feelings are your personal feelings. And when you search your soul nor searching your soul for yourself, I do not. You need you to search your soul and tell me you've come up with a solution medically for what I need to do. That is wrong. And that is not being a feminist and that's not part of the feminist moment. This shouldn't be. Yeah. So that's how I feel about. Do you, do you think that you're right in the comments now, do you think that um,

Speaker 1:          35:06          opposition to abortion primarily comes from a religious place or is there something else cultural or psychological because people will give politicians and people who were antiabortion we'll give lots of reasons. It's usually

Speaker 2:          35:20          religious, I think. Well, I think when you hear things like life begins at conception, um, again, that's a religious thing. Yeah. I mean, almost all the time it's religious. And the thing that is, is it goes back to what you said of the people who are antiabortion, who has driven the narrative to places where, um, we just let things go. Junk science, there's like abortion causes breast cancer proven it doesn't by every medical establishment that you can find that it causes, um, mental illness, again, not proven in any way, shape or form. Um, sterility, no people have multiple abortions, therefore not true. So, um, those things just lay there. And on top of that, we have states where Indiana prime example, when Mike Pence was governor, he defunded planned parenthood on a state level. Those planned parenthood's went under. He gave that $4 million every year that went to planned parenthood to something called crisis pregnancy centers.

Speaker 2:          36:18          If you're not aware of what they are, they're unregulated clinics opened up by religious people who um, anybody can wander in as somebody dressed up in a lab coat who could probably just work at the Macy's, Lancome counter to, um, gives people this information, we'll give them an ultrasound that is, um, they might fudge how long, how far along they are. They may say, yeah, we'll help you with diapers and cribs. Just keep coming back. And then when they're past the age of being, uh, the gestational age to have an abortion, all of a sudden they disappear. They won't give the person anything. They're horrible. And so in the, in the course of funding those unregulated centers, um, people are being denied care. And also in the case of Indiana, they had this outbreak of HIV, 87 cases of HIV in this county in Indiana.

Speaker 2:          37:12          And the planned parenthood clinic used to be somebody that would treat sanction sexually transmitted diseases, how I'm help people with HIV. And there was no planned parenthood. So they actually had to do pop up clinics when they had a system in place just because of this. So, um, I think that those things are, for the most part, we see it's a religious argument because the medical, every single piece of medicine around the issue of abortion bears out to it being one of the safest things, one of the [inaudible] not preventing you from choosing to have a family in the future. So when they start placing these caveats, especially when it's waiting periods and things like that, and they say it's all for the woman's, um, you know, just to make sure, um, when you start laying things down, like we need women to wait, um, because we're not sure she's made the right decision.

Speaker 2:          38:04          When that becomes part of the norm in our society that w if anybody's ever had the fear of being pregnant and didn't want to be, or actually ha has been, you know, from the second you might think that you're pregnant, you're thinking about it constantly. Everything about what that pregnancy means to your life is thought through over and over again. So to require extra time is society saying we're not really sure we trust women would make decisions and that goes out of the abortion rema and goes into spring, really trust women to run our company. You know, should we really trust women to be president? You know, I mean, so I think those things are really telling and um, things that we should fight against. While they might seem like it's for the women, it's not, it's for the control. Yeah. Um, last call for questions from the audience, but in,

Speaker 1:          39:03          in lieu of that, something I want to ask is, um, on the lady parts Justice League website, you have a video page with a video for every state in the country.

Speaker 2:          39:15          A little and lady parts justice page. Not The league page. We have two organizations. One is political, political, political. Yeah. Gotcha. Um, it's sort of like planned parenthood and planned parenthood action. Yes. One deals with healthcare outreach, education, still swearing and being fun. That pill video was outreach education. And then we have lady parts justice, which is yes. Has a video for every state and you can go there and learn about the Po. We call up politicians by nature. Oh okay. So that different things. Political yes. One, yes. Informational. Educational. Yes. Yes. So our big tour is through the Lady Parts Justice League. Gotcha. Cause we can hit the road, do outreach, roll up her sleeves, do it. Yeah. Go to the lay purchased league website. Yes. Donate to the tour. It's awesome.

Speaker 1:          40:02          Let's see where we are. Come visit us. We're at 16 cities. You probably live in one of them. Something I wanted to ask for the people in the audience here who are in New York, we usually think of in New York we've got things pretty good, nice blue state. But what the challenge both, what should people be aware of here in New York state? Funnily enough, we have not yet

Speaker 2:          40:24          changed our abortion laws since 1970. We have pre Roe v Wade abortion laws in our state and while it feels like it's blue and it's great here and in the city, um, abortion access is pretty, uh, accessible. Uh, if you live in another place around, if you live in rural New York, it's really hard for you to access any kind of care. Um, it's uh, abortion laws were set in the criminal code. So if, uh, if you have an a, if you have a fetal anomaly that oftentimes when you hear about those big scary, they try to scare you with like, um, late term abortion and why people have them. And in 99% of those are because things don't happen gestationally in pregnancy, sometimes until the final trimester of that pregnancy. And so really horrible life threatening to the woman. The fetus won't live outside of the womb.

Speaker 2:          41:15          A lot of bad stuff happens. And so, um, sometimes you won't even know those things, right? In New York, if you hit 24 weeks and discover that, um, the fetus will, could cause you, death could die itself. Um, you can't an abortion. There is no life of the mother life of the fetus exception. After 24 weeks, you have to leave the state. So yeah. So that's like a lot of the talent that's in place now and they're fighting for, they're fighting to change that law right now. Um, but we have, uh, a kind of conservative, um, you know, a lot of conservatives in Albany, some of them are Democrats who were anti choice. Um, so they won't update these simple, simple, um, laws that could be fixed and, you know, add logical exceptions so people don't die. Seems smarter, just not dying, not dying. Seems like living seems like a good alternative to not dying. I don't know. Um, for that part. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, Liz, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. It was really great. Thanks for having me. Thank you.
