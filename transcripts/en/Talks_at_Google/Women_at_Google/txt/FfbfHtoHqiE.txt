Speaker 1:          00:08          You want to start by telling you something about yourself that you may have forgotten. Is that okay? All right. So here it is. Ready?

Speaker 2:          00:17          You are wonderful. And now we'd like you to amplify that by pointing to the person next to you. Make eye contact point to them with your finger. This finger pointing. Okay. And we're gonna all do it at the same time. All right, pick the partner, look at them and I point and let's go. You are wonderful. And now point to yourself and say hi am wonderful and now point to all of us and say we are wonderful. And that's the truth. Say it. That's the truth. And we do this exercise. It's a great warmup exercise, right?

Speaker 1:          00:57          But it's also the truth that when all of us were little, we lived in a technicolor world and life was wonderful and we had the capacity for amazement, but something happened and we lost that. And how I learn, I believe that that what was lost was the experience. So full, a liveliness and the, that's what we're looking for. We wanted again. So our view is that we live in an interconnecting, interactive universe in which everything there is in the universe has connecting. And that's the core word that we use. And we've been studying for decades now. How come people don't feel connected and connecting? And what we discovered is there's a fundamental thing that happens that all human beings, we've picked us up in the, in the clinic and we also find it's true in all the ecosystems we've worked at. There is an objection to difference.

Speaker 1:          01:52          And the objection to difference has something to do with the fact that we're not connecting. So there's a paradox there and you can't get to connecting by objecting to difference so that you have to do something else. So objecting to difference, um, producers or polarization and when, what we would like to do is produce, connecting. And Helen's going to talk about, uh, this in just a moment, but our primary discovery was about talking. We thought it was about helping people solve problems. What we discovered, it's about talking and the talking is the most dangerous thing most people do listening. It's the scariest thing. And the most infrequent because if you're listening, you may hear something that, uh, dissipate your own view of how the universe works. But most people can't talk about their difference or about their needs without going into polarization.

Speaker 3:          02:43          So we are excited to share with others the fact that there's a new relational science and new technology that has never existed in the world before. Marriage therapy has been very murky in past. Uh, and people have long to get along, but they just don't know how something breaks down. But, um, in this new relational science, we emphasize that conflict isn't a bad thing in the relationship. We phrase it conflict is growth trying to happen. If you hold the conflict right, you'll both discover something new and transformative about each other and the relationship. Um, and the problem with conflict is that people wait too long. John Gottman, anyone heard of him? Top marriage researcher in the country. A lot of you raised your hands. He says if you have a pain in your chest, the average time it takes to pick up the phone and call nine one one is four hours.

Speaker 3:          03:52          If you have a pain in your relationship and your heart's breaking, the average time it takes up to pick up the phone and call the doctor is seven years. People wait too long and some of that reason and then the problem's so big, it's harder to deal with the, um, the reason people wait probably is they don't know that there was something that can really help. And now we're so glad to share that fact. It's so good now that we work with someone who says we could end all divorce on the planet. And um, his thought is that boyfriend a couple applies for a marriage license. Shouldn't it be like a driver's license? I mean, shouldn't you have to like read a manual and take a test and maybe show a little proficiency before you get your license and make the most important decision of your life?

Speaker 3:          04:44          So, and also the, it's so simple. This stuff can be taught in grade school now and is beginning to be taught in grade school and ref. If we're raised learning this, um, this technology of relationship, we would really have a transformed, you know, family, workplace, place, world. So, um, basically, um, Harville and I were dating and, um, uh, I was divorced. He was divorced and I said, Harvel, if you could wave a magic wand, what would you like to do with your life? And he said, ah, I just, I'm so curious, why do couples fight? And he began to share some of his thoughts. I said, tell me what are your thoughts, but are they, as they came out after dating for awhile, I proposed and he agreed to marry me. And this book got written and when it came out in the first, um, two months when it came out, I thought, who's going to buy a book by a man named horrible?

Speaker 3:          05:55          I was really worried about that. But apparently Oprah read it. And then she, they, a studio called and said, um, we liked him on the show. So she took his show and submitted it to the emic committee and that, oh, that show one, Oprah, her first Emmy. So she had him on, um, about 15 times and pretty soon the book was in 60 languages. And, uh, it's a system, a therapy system called a Margo. And there are 2,500 a Maga therapist who've gotten training in 37 countries. So we know this stuff works. Uh, we just, um, we're talking with some of the other relationships scientist and we co, cause we were all saying this stuff is you shouldn't have to pay for therapy. It's gotten so simple. So we, uh, we'll tell you a little bit later about the fact that, uh, these therapists had tried to do this in one city and we're doing, um, we're disseminating this information in Dallas and if it works in Dallas, it's going to go global. So it'll tell you about that in a minute. But we're now going to ask, we're going to show you the technology of safe conversation and then we're gonna ask you to sit next to someone and do what we do and learn. Learn this, practice

Speaker 1:          07:19          Europe with the person with whom you exchanged. Wonder. So, um, when Helen and I were dating, she mentioned that early in our relationship we discovered that we were both very intense people, positively and negatively. And one day we're having a, uh, one of our negative intensities in her living room and Helen said, uh, stop this one of us talk and the other one listen. And so that was sort of broke the cycle and we did. And one of the other illicit. And we found that it regulated us in a way that was surprising. And I was in the clinic at that time and began to couples learn to talk in a different way, um, and sort of as a result of that and began to study talking and that most people talk in monologues or parallel monologues. I talked, I talked to you talk, I talked to you and talk.

Speaker 1:          08:16          We, we don't talk, we don't interface. And what we wanted to do is change. That's a vertical way of talking wound to change that vertical to a lateral. And we developed this process called a dialogue, which we rebrand and Dallas called safe conversation. We want to show you briefly, uh, what the structure of that looks like and to see that what we discovered is that conversations that have a structure and a process tend to produce safety and connecting conversations that are random and don't have a process tend to sometimes produce safety and connecting generally produce polarization in chaos. So there's a simple, some simple processes can transform conversations and we can get back a sense of connecting, which we think is so in indigenous to our nature, that's what we really want. So safe conversation is the foundational tool and it's guests got a steers.

Speaker 1:          09:18          The structure I was talking about fundamentally is to learn the practice of mirroring. And let me see if I got it. As you can see, we put in some sentence stems. Let me see if I got what you said. Then the second thing that's important is accuracy, accuracy, check. Uh, in research on listening, there's a seven, a 13% accuracy rate than what most people here, 87% distortion rate. So it's really important that you say to somebody who's talking to you. Let me mirror that back. Let me see if I got that. Did I get it? And then, uh, the other thing that most people don't do is say, is there more about that? They usually say, well, you'd done and now it's my turn to talk. Then we go through validation, which is to see the sense that they're making and to empathy to reflect back the feelings.

Speaker 1:          10:04          Now that's a structured conversation. You can do it with just a mirror. Wayne, you can do validation or empathy. Helen and I want to, uh, we're going to do a, like a five minute demo of that and then we're going to ask you to do that. One of the things that we discovered in great conversations is nuance that it has very little to do with what is big but has to do with small. And one of those is icontact. Um, many people walk around with hard eyeballs and their pupils are small and that's what we call the glare. And you remember, have you seen glares around? Uh, you can look at somebody's face and you, cause that person has clothes, pupils are small. You can read that. So what we help people do is identify the hardness of the and the smallness of the pupil hardness of the eyes and switch it to the gaze.

Speaker 1:          10:56          This is the kind of face you want to look at while you're talking where there's receptivity, where the pupils are large and you know that what you're saying is being received. And so we also help people regulate the flow. That is somebody who's talking to you and you stop listening and you know you're being flooded to how to sing. He's just raise your hands. Say God, can you hold on a minute, let me mirror back what I'm hearing so far. Just regulate your own input instead of getting over flooded and saying, I can't listen to anymore, are reacting to it. So here's what the bureau of an appreciation and looks like as a conversation and this is what Helen, I are going to do. So now we are, we've decided that we're guests going to do a one way because of the constraints on time here. And the one way, um, we'll be that Helen is going to send me some information and I'm going to respond on the receiver side. She'll be the sender and I'm going to be, uh, the receiver

Speaker 3:          11:57          and we're teaching the technology, uh, that, uh, my expressing an appreciation. But uh, this is the technology can you, you can use when you have a frustration with someone yup. And you can, uh, then it will make any conversation go better. So, um,

Speaker 1:          12:15          yeah. And one other thing is we think of it as a vehicle, like a truck. It's like thinking of it as a drug. And this is the way the truck works. You can put any cargo on the trunk and it will go to any market. If the truck doesn't work, you can't get the car go to market. So this is the truck

Speaker 3:          12:31          and you've got the sentence stems in your seat. So you'll be using this patient can do it with darn, or if you want to turn in your ma in your handout, you can see a mirroring and appreciation is the title of the extra credit that's up on the slide. So dope. So horrible. Is this a good time when I could give you an appreciation? Yes. Now's a good time. Thank you. Well, um, when we practice this in the taxi coming over, w what popped out in my mind was your tie. I just loved that you've ordered that tie this morning. I haven't seen it for years. And um, I just really thought that was a cool tie to wear.

Speaker 1:          13:12          So if I'm getting this, the appreciation you have is the tie I'm wearing that you, uh, you looked at it and you hadn't seen it in years and uh, and you're really appreciating the time. Did I get that? Yes, I've got that. So is there more about it?

Speaker 3:          13:27          Um, well that, that tie just in the taxi, it just made me feel exuberant and joyful for Nice thought.

Speaker 1:          13:35          So the tie made you feel exuberant and joyful? Am I getting that? Yeah, yeah. So is there more about that,

Speaker 3:          13:42          about the failing? Um, uh, well I that point I feel that way. It did remind me of my uncle Jimmy because uncle chimney, my favorite uncle would always wear shirts that were real lively and sort of head little critters from the farm on them. He would, he'd be, he lives in Idabel, Oklahoma and it was like fun trees and flowers and um, so it sort of warmed my heart. Sing that.

Speaker 1:          14:14          So when you had that feeling, it reminded you of uncle Jimmy on the farm. You've got all these critters and who was fun? Uh, did we read that around? So you were a manager of a very warm experience and very pleasant experience. So by getting that, they get it. They get all of that. So is there more about that?

Speaker 3:          14:31          Well, yeah, and uncle Jimmy would play with us. They may go visit. Okay. But my father, it was a real contrast and my father who always wore the business suit and never played with me or any of the kids.

Speaker 1:          14:46          So it reminded you that, um, of your father, his son is very different. He didn't play with Dewey wore business suits, more severe clothing and didn't play. And you don't have those warm memories with him. Am I, am I getting that right? So is there more about that? So let me see if I've got all of it. Um, if I could summarize it. You want to give me an appreciation and the appreciation is of my tie, which you notice this morning and when you saw my Thai, you had a strong feeling of exuberance and joy and when you had that feeling it triggered a memory of your uncle Jimmy, uh, with who had colorful clothes and had all these animals and looked on her farm and you know, really warm memories of him. And you don't have those memories of your father who was, didn't play in which ward more severe clothing.

Speaker 1:          15:44          Did I get all of that? Yes. Well thank you for sharing that. Thank you for listening. They're welcome. And we also make some sort of physical contact and couples hug usually for a minute. If you're not a couple, we have some sort of physical contact because the neurochemistry and neurochemical is released. When you make physical contact with somebody you're talking to, it could be either cortisol or endorphins, but you want to be sure it's correct that it's endorphins instead of cortisol. So you'll notice that it starts with an appointment. Does now good time to talk. That's what the center does. People's boundaries. And just because someone's ready to talk doesn't mean you're ready to listen. And when you don't cross a boundary, you're being, you ask if you can, uh Oh, somebody can open themselves, then you regulate and create more safety, then you make eye contact.

Speaker 1:          16:43          And eye contact is a really very important thing to do. When you start a conversation, then you start sending the message, mirroring it, and then summarizing it. So what we'd like to do now is ask you if we could turn on a little light so we, you all can see each other and we can see you. If you would practice this and pick a person that's sitting next to you, um, and a desk, just do it quickly. The two and then two, and to all of you all are already paired over there. There's two, four, six people here to four is that two, four, six. And maybe you could pair with the one on the end there and then to four and you pair with the first one on the end over there. And uh, are you all want to be, why don't y'all figure it out?

Speaker 1:          17:33          You're smart. You're it, you're a Google pair up with somebody awkward. It's like, could you learn to ski slope or a little bit, but then if you, it's a very powerful tool to use this and all your relationships. So pretty soon you can go down the double black diamonds swishing and then if you can, uh, as going to be hard, I think in turn the chairs all the way. Usually we have people face to face to face, but turn as much toward the person you're working with as possible. Also decide who's going to start first. And we want this years to go both ways and we're going to get you started. Okay? If you don't have a partner, okay, here's someone without a partner. Okay. Is there any other person in the room without a partner? Yeah. Okay. So you're going to partner with you. All right.

Speaker 2:          18:27          So now, now we're all part good. So we'd like, I like to get you started at the same time. So turn and look at the person and you all decide quickly, uh, who's gonna go first? And I'll, let me just make that easier by saying the one on the left goes first and you usually, it's a different thing. If you're a couple's, it'd be who does, who talks a lease. And they go first and who talks the most? They go second. Decide who's gonna go first and then make eye contact. So he got got, who's going first? Okay, I'm sorry, I don't make eye contact. Make the appointment is now a good time. So say to that birth is now a good time to share and appreciation with you? And you'll be looking at this person and you'll pick out something about that person. You appreciate it. Now a good time and you'll say, oh, of course. Yes. Then make eye contact. Just pause, just make a pause and then go into and follow the follow either the screen or the thing in your lap on mirroring out appreciation. All right. Get started. Go. And we're going to give you five minutes each to do this.

Speaker 3:          19:41          Okay, great. Okay. And keep going if you're finishing up, but we're just going to have two or three of you if you'd like to just share what that was like. Yeah. Anything about

Speaker 1:          19:55          just your, what, what happened during while I was doing this, not a question, but a comment. Any sensations that you had or thoughts?

Speaker 3:          20:04          Yeah, so even though, what's that?

Speaker 4:          20:08          Oh Gosh. Hello. Um, as you said, it was a little awkward and structured, but at the same time I did feel extremely connected to my partner when we were having the conversations.

Speaker 3:          20:17          Great. Thank you. So it felt a little awkward because of all the structure, but the result was you felt really connected using that. Thank you. Anyone else want it anymore? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          20:31          we ended up going farther off script, but it led very naturally into stories about where we came from and and these little prompts ended up becoming a a whole very natural conversation.

Speaker 3:          20:43          Yes. So, um, you went off script a little and shared stories, but then it became a real wonderful conversation. Great, thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          20:58          Normally when I'm having a conversation with someone when they're talking, I'm not necessarily thinking I'm thinking of my next response or then you go along with it. But in this thing, and this, in this scenario, all I was thinking was how am I going to repeat back what they said and make sure I absolutely understood it. I'm thinking Alex.

Speaker 3:          21:13          Okay, Alex. And then there's one more hand and that'll be it for now because there's time at the end. But Alex, thank you for being really vulnerable that you noticed that you were going to have to mirror, but then when your partner was talking, you were aware that instead of marrying, you'd really like to also tell him what you think or edited or like you were ready to engage with your thoughts instead of taking the time to mirror. And so that, that was a real deliberate thing you had to do. Did I get that? Thank you. Identical observational. Pardon me? Same observation. Same. Same. Uh, so Harvard said statistic, he read about listening that we get 17% accuracy, accuracy, accuracy of listening. We think we hear and that's why it's really important to mirror and say, is that what you said? Because um, we do this for CEOs of corporations all the time that they don't know how to mirror or here, but the other people were saying too

Speaker 1:          22:17          and so interesting to see the, Oh my God, I got 13% or what usually is that? The other thing we want to say is that the structure is awkward, but it moves into interacting with your cortex. And so that you actually integrate your brain from feeling when you go into memories, you go into feelings and thoughts, feelings, thoughts, feelings, thoughts. So that when you engage in a structured conversation that moves back and forth between information, that emotion, you strengthened the neural pathways in the brain toward non reactivity and cohesion. So it's an interesting structure. So Helen's going to talk more about that.

Speaker 3:          22:56          So the other thing we said in the taxi this morning, we're going to look up the definition of relationship because um, cause I think most people think, and so it would be more official that the definition of a relationship is two people and horrible. And I say the definition of a relationship is two people and the space between them and the focus of the relationship should not be on either person, but on the space between and how successful you are in your relationships all depend on how safe this space between is. And so, um, um, sorry. So there you are. This is, this is really the important thing. Um, and so we, um, prescribed for people call a zero negativity process. It's really hard not to end up negative around people around you. Just, you know, just to look in your eye or the tone of your voice, much less what you say is often making someone next to you feeling uncomfortable.

Speaker 3:          24:01          Um, and we emphasized with the zero negativity process, it's not what you say, it's how you say it. You can talk about anything, uh, with Pr, you know, with people. But if you make an appointment, you may I, and yeah, I'd like to share this is now a good time. And then there's a way to talk about anything, but it does in a way that isn't received so negatively because if it's received negatively by that person, they're not going to want to do it. So this is a way to get you what you want. Also taking the time to affirm, uh, being positive energy into the space between. So we think that mental health is focused on the physics of the within. And, um, I love being the number two to Harvel the number one physicist who is really mapping out the science of relationship in the physics of the between.

Speaker 3:          24:52          So all of this horrible also woke up one day and said to me, the couple is the upstream prevention that can prevent all the down river cleanup. If we clean up the relationship at home, then the kids don't get teen pregnancy, chemical dependency, street gangs, and, and then they do better in school. And then there isn't the breakdown of the economics in the families and in the community. So if we can just bring this technology really anywhere, all of this as we're wanting to unleash it, is going to help we believe, create a more relational culture. We have a culture that just, I think you all are so rewarded. And me too and horrible. If we got the best grade in the class, if we won, if we'd got to the top of the ladder, that's how we're rewarded. Our parents just love us when we do that. Uh, the job, our bosses love us. They give us a reward if we're the best. And we have a world that's all about competition, that that can lead to domination to winner take all to all sorts of things that really aren't healthy for the world, the human family. And so we think sharing this relational technology is really going to help teach something we all want, which is collaboration, cooperation, the creating of win-wins. So, um, we're really sort of about a relationship revolution.

Speaker 1:          26:17          Oh, the thing that we're focusing on is to discover the problem in working with couples as conversation. So we had to help them learn how to talk and then when they learn to talk, uh, they did not have many problems. In fact, the problems were because they couldn't talk. Does that make sense? It's kind of a paradox. And so given that that worked, we knew that then that a human problem, not just a couple of problems. And so we want to, uh, decided that we would spend the rest of our lives, uh, taking a very small thing called safe conversation, which you just practice, uh, in multiple forms and distribute safe conversations globally. And we started with Dallas and we are working on a citywide project in Dallas. We have probably impacted now about 5,000 families and on Google a youtube. Uh, last year we did a global, uh, but did a big project and, and um, I did a multimedia in about 40,000 people, watched the workshop on Google, 15,000 at any time on Facebook.

Speaker 1:          27:23          And we had about a 20 million numbers for our media footprint. So started with Dallas. But we now see it going globally. And what we see ourselves doing is doing something that has not been done much in our culture. That culture is focused on individual competency, on being the best you can be, own all and winning. And we're shifting the focus to relational competency, which we think paradoxically again, that when you're into relational competency, you actually function better as an individual because neurochemical things happen, muscular things happen and your immune system works differently when you feel safe in context and rather than a feeling challenged and dangerous. So here's basically what this does and this is the first piece of it. We don't have time to do validation. And empathy, but fundamentally we want to move from having a safe conversation, which is fine. Anytime anybody wants to talk and needs to talk for 215 or 20 minutes about a topic, but to take the things that make that structured conversation were and distributed into all conversations so that we move from making, having a safe conversation to making all conversations safe.

Speaker 1:          28:44          Then what we do is regulate, uh, anxiety. We create safety and we optimize then the human family and re-experience our true nature, which we think is the felt experience of connecting and the full of liveliness that comes with that and the wonder of full of likeness. So honoring boundaries, very important. Anytime we encourage, anytime you talk to is now a good time to talk about that instead of just walking in and taking over their cognitive space, it's not a good time to talk about it. Then the mirror says, well, let's see it. They said, yes. Well let me see if I got it. The new mirror accurately, you don't interpret change are in, in any way modify the sin. Accuracy check. Very important. Did I get that? I get with just that. And if you did then say, well, is there more about it? So to move to curiosity rather than usually at that point we replaced the other person with ourselves.

Speaker 1:          29:39          We say, you know, uh, so did I get that? Well let me, let me tell you what I think. No, go to the next step, take a pause and say, is there more about that? And what you'll find is that it's so unusual for that question to be asked that many people will say, well, no, uh, but if you sit with that then took one, just check in and see new things will bubble up and then the really rich things will start happening. I think people put things into words that before had just been feelings or thoughts. And then how were they getting through? Do a quick summary. So it was if I got all that. So you said, hey, and then you, yeah, it was, you appreciated this and you felt about that and that reminds you of something. And what we found is that whether it's a negative or positive interaction, there's always a memory connected to it.

Speaker 1:          30:27          That somehow our past is always present in our present. And whether it's a pleasant thing or an unpleasant thing, there's a memory that that experience gets attached to. And if you know that, then your life makes sense. If you don't know that, then you wonder why the hell are you behaving that way? It's because something in the past is intruding into the president. So that's basically what we wanted to say. And we now turn it over to you to see what you want to say back to us in terms of thoughts, expressions, questions, and if you have any questions we'll make up an answer.

Speaker 6:          31:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:06          And I think we have now, how long? About 15 minutes.

Speaker 6:          31:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:13          So this works for appreciations. What if you have a complex, is the conversation structure the same? It's a, it's structured. Oh. And the content becomes a, this frustration I have with you is, and then you have to mirror that back and then there's, they're more about that. And then, uh, check with the feeling about the frustration. I feel real like I want to kill you. You know, you're a terrible person and I feel angry and hurt and so forth. So you mirror back the feeling and then, um, then you say, and you know, at this frustration, all frustrations are also rooted in memory. And this reminds me of my father who did extra, my mother who did. Why there's still the person mirrors that back and there's a more complicated thing. If a behavior actually needs to be changed, there's a that that would take a little longer to teach.

Speaker 1:          32:05          But there is a process of identifying what new do you need from me that would regulate that frustration for you. So what we encourage people, Helen, Helen is very good at this saying, astro what you want. Every frustration is a wish in disguise. And most of us don't pay attention to the wish. We pay attention to the frustration. Like you were late. You never do that. You've always done that. And if you ever hear or frustration and just listen to it, you'll hear the wish. I wish you were doing on time. I wish you would call me, you know, before seven, I wish there's a desire. So we could say, Oh boy, I've got this thing going on. I want to really, I'm really frustrated. What do I want? And then extract from that and go bring that to the person instead of what you don't like. Then that creates more safety, more cohesion and more connecting. So and so, but that's a long process.

Speaker 3:          32:59          It's just the dialogue that we did can address a frustration, but sometimes there is another more structured conversation around, uh, it's called a behavior change request. Is there more?

Speaker 1:          33:15          Well, yeah, I guess that was, that was the question. Like it doesn't necessarily have to be something someone's doing wrong. Maybe you're picking like the color of your wall, just one person wants. Right? And One person wants blue. So you ask someone to explain their feelings for red and you say, okay, well I understand your feelings for red. Right? But that what,

Speaker 3:          33:37          so what happens when you do the relational, something like safe conversations. If you're in your lower brain, the reptilian brain. Do, have you studied any brain science? No. No, no. Okay. Three parts of Reptilian rule. We can even say there's a reptilian brain and um, the near Cortex and the reptilian brain is fight or flight or freeze. But the NEOCORTEX kick create, win wins and just using, um, you know, I really liked the bedroom to be blue because I, that is the, that's what I'll really sleep well in and what I really want red because I want to wake up and feel that. And if you just go at it without a structured conversation, you're going to end up in your lower brain and just saying the sentence stems, uh, put you in the upper brain, like in a mirror wing. It puts you up here instead of your, and you know, the intense down here and you can better solve a problem around purple. Yes. That's got a little blue. It's got a letter read. Yes. Yeah. It'll be more easy to find that kind of compromise.

Speaker 1:          34:53          And what, what we discovered happens is if you hear me and listened to me and can get, my view is that I like blue and you really get it. So would it make sense that you're like blue, I don't have to have blue anymore, but if you say bluets sucks, I have to tell blue. And I, we learned this, uh, actually, uh, there's a story about we didn't know when we have six children, so one of them, we were walking to school one morning and, um, no, no, it was about bedtime. I don't want to go to bed. I couldn't go to bed. So we just mirror. So you really don't want to go to bed. You don't want to go back. Say it. Say more about that. I don't want to go bad because they're always putting me to bed and just mirrored everything and took him by his hand and walked him down the hallway to his bedroom and sat down and hugged him and said, good night. He said, thank you dad for listening and went to sleep. So I'm here with him and his objection, uh, dissolved. He just simply wanted to be heard. And we find that's basically what's true. Once we heard, then we can collaborate and cooperate. If we're not hurt, will polarize. Alright. Thank you. And God made us that way. I don't blame me. Thanks for laughing at my jokes. And you didn't like the guy when I have to point them out everywhere. Anything else we've got it looks like 10 more minutes. Yes.

Speaker 3:          36:14          So, um, it's easy to imagine that you guys have this like really perfect relationship because you're experts in communication and most of us aren't. I'm just curious if there's, we do save that. Let me see. We do mirror that back. What I hear you say is you expect that we can talk about communication real comfortably because we're real compatible and we have a good relationship to, we can put it out there. Did I get there? Yeah. And I, and I'm very [inaudible], I'm curious to know if there's still issues these guys are still working on and what does that look like? Right? So if you have issues, what does it look like? Well. Um, we actually were condensing an an 18 hour workshop, $850. If any of you want to come to our workshop. No, we'll competent to interview at Google the justice route. We're not going to do anyway.

Speaker 3:          37:02          And at that workshop, Harvell has given me the permission to tell the story that I'm about 20 years ago. Yeah. Almost 20 years ago, our marriage was so bad. We both had so wanted the book to get promoted and, and, but we forgot to do it and we were, it was so horrible and horrible would come home when I lift up the book cover. Hello mister marriage. And so we find it, I finally got him to go to a therapist. Thank goodness, aren't you great therapists in New York? Well we kept firing our therapist and they'll end, the last therapist fired us and called us the couple from hell. So we went to the doors lawyer and we told our kids we were getting a divorce and we told all of these and Margaret therapists were getting a divorce. So it was really horrible. And, and that's when we brought in zero negativity. And every night before we go to bed, we have a calendar now that we sell to others or give to others. And did I do anything negative? And he will point. And I did. I did. And so we do it next year and the kids to be checked and we've transformed our relationship with them. So yeah, we're if, if we, if we could do what you any relationship and turn it around.

Speaker 1:          38:16          So I think it, I think we need to give the formula for a great relationship and you will, and, and a, and a winner proceeded with the fact that the relationship has a process. It's not, it is not a destination. It's a journey is what matters is how do you take the journey and how you help each other along the, we are partners in the project, not opponents in the project, in our marriage. Same thing would happen in any ecosystem. But here's the kind of of three pieces that we find indispensable for safe, thriving relationships where there's a couple of families, corporations, congregations of schools you have to talk without polarizing. And so the structure that we have developed and took us about 20 years too, it may look simple but took about 20 years to put together the pieces that would actually work. Of those of you who are engineers, no, it doesn't fall in place.

Speaker 1:          39:17          You have to mess with it for awhile. So the structured conversation that we demoed, and there's more than that, two more pieces to that and Helen just mentioned zero negativity. What we discovered is you really have to pay attention to the tendency we have to do put downs and that's what we call negativities. Like what? Where'd you get a stupid idea like that? Where did that come from? I can't believe you would say that. Nobody in their right mind would ever say anything like that. You all heard those probably all your life and none of you have ever engaged in anything like that. I'm sure the Google is too enlightening to engage in that. But that's what most of us do. Those are called put downs, put downs, trigger a rupture connection. The trigger anxiety activates cortisol, no endorphins there. So now you go into your defenses.

Speaker 1:          40:10          Then the only thing you can do is strategic and be tactical. So if you were just decide, no put downs and have a culture, wouldn't it be great if Google had a culture of zero negativity culture here at Google? You may have one and people are working on that. And then the thing other thing Helen said, just to emphasize, it is affirming of the person you're talking with. Like thank you very much enjoyed being with you today. Uh, I really liked being your partner. It was great to have this time with you. I just can't believe I'm working with somebody. So smart. Just sentences like that. And remember you're creating safety and if you do negative, you create polarization. One, it creates safety. Then you have integration and then you have creativity that doesn't have a defense built into it. Then that experience produces connecting and that produces full of likeness and that's what you want and you can have it with your partner, you can have it in the workplace, you can have it with anybody with whom you have a reliably safe and predictable relationship through a conversational process. So that's all I in any, any other questions? I know we have look at go few more minutes. Did you want to add anything to add? Just a quick question question you have. I wrote about

Speaker 7:          41:34          um, different attachment styles and you have like the anxious and the avoidant. I'm curious if you have like an anxious and avoidant, right? Um, and the first question is, is now a good time to talk? And the person keeps saying, no, it's never a good time. There's too much going on. And obviously the anxious attachments, I was like, I want this resolved now. Like right now or I can't do anything else. Um, not that I speak from experience, but I'm curious, I'm curious how, how do you put this into practice?

Speaker 3:          42:03          Yeah, we've rushed through the process. Um, are you available now for an appreciation? Horrible. Could've said, actually, I'm in the middle of something, but if he says that he has to save weird, he is available. And then at that time come and get me. So we, yes.

Speaker 1:          42:27          So it becomes a culture of agreement that in this culture, in this marriage and this corporate culture, uh, we can, uh, we can, you can say no, but if you'll say no, you have to save when and when you say, when you have to show up then, because if you don't, you reactivate childhood wounds that are suddenly done by all families, which is mommy, mommy, Mommy, let me tell you about the elephant walking down the street. Mommy says, I can't do that right now. Later and later never comes. So the kid comes back, mommy and Mama can't talk to you. Now. Later after a while, the kid will go away and not, and not asking anymore. Or The kid will escalate until mommy has to talk. And whichever one she responds to, the kid will habituate as, that's what you have to do to get attention around here.

Speaker 1:          43:21          So in order to change it, they have to be agreements that we are all partners in the project of being together. And therefore if now's not a good time to talk, that's fine. And tell me what, because I need predictability. If you're telling me when, then I'll say fine tomorrow, that's great. I just know we will talk tomorrow, tomorrow at 10 o'clock. You show up. I don't have to come get you. You show up. So you promise you're predictable and reliable. So it has to become a cultural process. So in couplehood where there's committed partnership, we invite people to consciously, uh, commit to a conscious relationship and you can also do that in a non intimate settings. Am I answering your question?

Speaker 6:          44:05          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          44:10          Any, is there more? Is there any last comment or two?

Speaker 1:          44:16          Does that Oh man mean we're done.

Speaker 3:          44:18          Oh, do you know flat? Uh, I will say then in closing, we were talking to a room full of people in Dallas and they said, uh, uh, who, who are quote, it's an advocate's committee. It was our first meeting of the advocates committee. And one guy stood up and he said, you all need to find a really big tech company because, uh, and he's in this business world, but he said tech companies promised that this technology would strengthen relationships. And in many cases the opposite has happened and you all should partner with a tech company and get and say, I'm the tech company that's going to fulfill the promise that we're going to really strengthen relationships in the world. So if y'all know of a tech company that might be interested in talking to us, let us know. I thought that was, wasn't that a good idea? Yeah. If we're wanting to get it out. Isn't that smart?

Speaker 1:          45:12          Okay. So if I got that you're saying, yeah.

Speaker 2:          45:17          Anyway, so

Speaker 1:          45:20          could I give you an appreciation? Okay. I just want to appreciate what a stunning appearance you have today and what clarity of thought in this presentation. Thank you. I've had a good coach. You've had a good conversation. I appreciate working with you because you make me

Speaker 2:          45:38          Oh look good. And now we're going to close up with who are we? We are wonderful. I am wonderful point. To the person. You are wonderful. And that is the truth.

Speaker 3:          45:56          I the wait. That changed your neurochemistry the first five minutes you were in the room, sir. That puts you into another part of your brain. And as Helen Fisher fit, you listened to her. A whole other set of neurochemicals started flooding through your system instead of cortisol. You had norepinephrine, all sorts of other goodies. So thank you for

Speaker 2:          46:17          you are an amazing thank you very much.
