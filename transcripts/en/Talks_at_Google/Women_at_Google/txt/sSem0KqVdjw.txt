Speaker 1:          00:00          I ladies and gentlemen, Garfunkel ourself doing Tom am I saying here? That was clearly not from the special that was from last season of another period. If you haven't seen it, it takes place in 1902. It's like a reality show. 70 need to know too. And that's all real stuff. It's based on all real stuff. That finger contraption is real from the turn of the century. It's, yeah, those are all afraid techniques except for the bicycle. We're like, we have to add something to it. Yes, we had to. Yes. And so we have the bike.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Oh Ricky, you are really a renaissance woman. You are a actress, a comedian, a musician. You created another period. You were right or another period. The show runner. Now we have new special uh, coming this week. It was great. Yeah. Well thank you for making time and coming here to Google.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I like tried to tell my parents what I do all day. I'm just like, I don't know everything. I don't know. Just everything in there like, well what do you like? It's always different. It's always, no, no, no. I got to go and yeah, that's basically their understanding of my job.

Speaker 2:          01:00          And you were here today without your cohort. You were here without oats today

Speaker 1:          01:05          in La Doing Conan today.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Oh, I know. Here we are. You drew the short Straw, I'm sure. Um, so Garfield's one notes. Let's just start with what people need to know. Why Garfunkel?

Speaker 1:          01:20          Well, I was at a a hall and Oates concert at the Hollywood bowl and I really bad seats. I was, it was like I was waitressing, I was in the back and so basically you can only watch it on the monitors and the camera had a close up of Darryl that he kind of had like a wind machine kind of situation. It was the close of Daryl and then it was like, oh, it's in the band. So oats was only in the wide shot or like the moving right past him. And there was no two shot. It was just Daryl and then everyone else. And for some reason that just made me laugh and I was like, who set that up? Like how does it feel to be oats? And then, yeah, we kind of went from there, but we didn't realize about two years ago someone sent us this like Simpsons thing where they had almost the same joke. You're like, ah, they have something called like it was like Nash Oats and Garfunkel or something, but it was close enough where we were like, well okay. Oh well I mean too late now. That's her name.

Speaker 2:          02:12          So, uh, of course, uh, Kate is oats. You were Garfunkel? Yes. How did you guys get together?

Speaker 1:          02:18          We were both auditioning for commercials and neither of us were working cause it was all kind of like maxim girls, like that Doritos girl, if you guys remember. It was all like that kind of look. And then all of a sudden they just started casting girls with big eyes. And so she and I just got called back for everything. I've nowhere, like I got dropped by, I like I just shouldn't for like a couple of years got dropped by my commercial agent, never booked anything. And then out of nowhere, like Kate and I were just in all the commercials were like, what is happening? It didn't last that long, but we just kept seeing each other at callbacks and then she came up and introduced me, introduce yourself to me at UCB and then went from there.

Speaker 2:          02:51          And how did the uh, have the musician, uh, kind of blind get into it? How did it

Speaker 1:          02:56          became like these weird soulmate friends, I don't even know how to explain it. Like Kate's boyfriend who was with her when we met, like on the way home, he was like, you like her more than you like me. And Kate says she remembers going like, yeah. So yeah. And then we found out that we both wrote comedy songs on our own, nice to play them in college and Kate was kind of playing these comedy songs around town and I would play at parties, like we'd been doing it on our own in an unofficial capacity for like 10 years. And so then we're just like, oh, let's just do this together. When was your first Gig together? Um, Gosh, when I think it's been like eight years maybe. It's been a long time. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think it was 2008 is we made this short that like Kate was my imaginary friend and it was a musical and we wrote the songs for it and just made it. Yeah. Very cool. And kind of since then, yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:46          Uh, what is your song process like? I know the old creative process question, but

Speaker 1:          03:51          basically it's evolved because we've kind of like sound out like our, what we're good at and how to do it. So basically we'll have a topic and then we just brainstorm on it for ever. And this is only the songs that make it, like the songs that don't, I don't even know, they just like we just throw them in the garbage, but basically we brainstorm forever. Well it's like a 20 page document of anything we've ever thought about this topic. And then she gives it to me and I sort of like narrow it down and come up with a title. And then after I had the title, I go and do a first pass of the lyrics, give it to Kate, she does a first pass at the melody. And then we get together and sort of, you know, make it together. But she just has these like catchy melodies that are always in her head. So

Speaker 2:          04:28          what did you guys ever go on? Like a specific bitch of like you want to like hit a joke and then a song comes around that or

Speaker 1:          04:36          sometimes we'll get a title if we, but like if you cause this, there's not enough to sustain a joke for like three minutes and we don't do it. Cause like some things are good as one line, but then like what do you say after that? You know, it's just like I've got nothing left. So a lot of most things ended up in the garbage because they don't, we can't like blow them out to a whole song.

Speaker 2:          04:55          Now this leads to the very first special trying to be special. Yes. And of course a spoiler alert. I have seen it. So I'll try and keep it, uh, keep it close. But uh, the specialist about trying to make a special,

Speaker 1:          05:06          yes, it is. It's very meta. It's basically Kate and I are like in a hotel room and we had this gig that you think went really badly and we're just like, this sucks. That is, we're so tired. We're on the, and I'm like, do you think we should do something different? She's like, I don't know. And I'm like, well, we're, we're 36 years old. We have no husbands, no real jobs, no kids. Like our lives are amazing. And she's like, yeah, totally. Like the only Nigga can make it better as a comedy special. And so we're like, oh, we don't have money to make a comedy special. So we do a fundraiser concert in order to make money to be able to put it on the special. So, and then you see, you see the fundraiser concert. So yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:46          And this, uh, this comes out this coming week on Cinco de Mayo, May 5th. It's a available on Vimeo. Yeah. So going the digital route.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Yeah. We decided to do something different because the meal, it's like they have the best player. Like they just do like businesses use it, they're the best player. And you can just download it and have it on your computer forever. I'm like, that's just, I don't know. It seemed like, and they don't give notes, they have full your full 100% creative control. So we were like, that kind of feels the same budget as everyone else. Kind of like oh no notes and yeah, let's do that. So that's what we decided to go with.

Speaker 2:          06:21          Um, one thing in the special that we were talking about prior is just the quirkiness of your guys' characters and it makes everything seemed so just spur of the moment.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Right. And some of it is, some of it is like a lot we don't, when we go on tour, we don't know what we're going to talk about when we walk out, unless we like, unless something really weird happened right before then we're like, okay, we're going to talk about that. But usually we just walk out and like begin and sometimes it goes better than other times.

Speaker 2:          06:49          You actually said that you and Kay had s uh, she stuff like UCB Improv background?

Speaker 1:          06:55          No, we were there seeing a friend's show, what we were seeing, a dead Benson show and yeah, we were both friends with him. I made friends with him on Friendster. That's real as real. He saw some play that I was in. It was like, your plate is funny. And I was like, I just saw you do comedy. And then we were like loose acquaintances and he's like, well come to my next show. That's where I met Kate.

Speaker 2:          07:13          It's actually funny. I was first exposed to you guys from Doug Benson's podcast.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Really? He's been so nice to us since day one. He always has us on there. He's just like been a good friend to us. Fair enough. Yeah. He opened first, last time we were in la just to be nice, like didn't want any money. He just like opened for us. It was, yeah, it was cool.

Speaker 2:          07:31          All right, so just shifting over since we saw the another period clip to start. Um, so another period has created and written by you and Natasha Gara and you did say it's a, it's like a reality show based in 1902.

Speaker 1:          07:42          Yeah. We save. It's like, it's like a family, like the Kardashians moved into Downton Abbey. So this is it set in America. It's a Newport, Rhode Island. These people are not class either new money and they just, they have unlimited money but it's brand new and our dad has a magnate magnate. He owns all the badness in the world I guess. And then we just are like pieces of garbage that have no problems but complain all day long. So

Speaker 2:          08:09          on comedy central, a season two comes out in June, June 15th, June 15th, comedy central. How did that come about with you and Natasha? Was that just a conversation?

Speaker 1:          08:20          Natasha and I, we went to, um, do, we went on like a charity trip to Senegal for malaria, no more it, which is actually an incredible organization like you have to, they're like actually curing malaria. Like they're actually doing stuff. It's so crazy. But I love that company. And we went to Senegal and it was just like, we just bonded. It's so hot. And we were just, we didn't know we were doing and it was, it was intense. And so we just became friends and then kind of when we were flying back, Natasha was like, I looked at your imdv and I'm like, yeah, like, okay. She's like, no, I just, you have like 80 credits on there and how many of those things if you've been in that are actually funny. And I was like, I was like, that's a good question. I was like, I don't know too.

Speaker 1:          09:05          And she's like, I have zero, I've like 50 things and zero things are funny. And she's like, I feel like that's weird. She was like, I think like we needed to write stuff and make funny stuff cause why is everything not funny? And I'm like, all right, good point. And so we started trying to come up with an idea and then we were like kind of stuck. And then if, so we went out and drank a bunch of wine and then came up with the idea as you do when you're like, fuck it, let's get wasted. And they're like, I know the idea. Like it's a terrible creative process, but it totally works.

Speaker 2:          09:33          So, uh, speaking of volume to be, actually I found myself watching million dollar baby recently. I was totally blind side and I was like, oh my God, that's an intense, I'm a renaissance woman as,

Speaker 1:          09:44          yeah, no, that was my first movie. It was so crazy. I just thought it was going up from there. No, I was like, my first movie has ever been won. The Oscar like sky's the limit. And then I like still didn't get an agent for like another two or three years. I was like, okay, so it's going to be slower. Yeah. But it was really awesome. It was crazy. Do you have to make my first name? It was the Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank and Margo Martindale did I ever did and I'm like, okay, it's fine. I'm fine. I totally deserve to be here. I just, you know.

Speaker 2:          10:11          Well congratulations. Thanks. Picture. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. It really changed my life. I'll just, you guys know we will be taking questions from the audience. There are microphones in both the aisles. If you want to just go up there, I'll call on you and do it like school. I feel like

Speaker 1:          10:25          my back and you clap the hardest so you have to ask me a question and get the ball rolling. I just, I, I sense you're like, I just, I like your whole energy and it made me feel good at, as I was walking out here. So not to put you on the spot, but you have to think of something to ask me. You can wait. Okay. So you think about it and we'll get back to you. Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:46          Uh, if I was in the audience and I wasn't lucky enough to be moderating this, I would ask you a very important question. What does it like dating Fozzie bear?

Speaker 1:          10:54          It's pretty sexy. It's like, yeah, he's, he's pretty smooth. He's, yeah, no, I actually loved, I loved being on the methods. I wasn't big methods fan. I know that people are like always sat there. Like I always loved the flash and it's like, no you didn't. No you didn't. You didn't love that growing up. But I actually did love the muppets. I would have Mrs. Miss, miss piggy, miss piggy birthday cakes and you know, I just, I loved it. So it was pretty cool. I didn't know how it worked. I didn't know there was so many people controlling a up or there's like monitors everywhere and you're on just like raised platform and it's pretty, you know, what is the process of like doing a scene with Fozzy? It's, there's just so many people involved. There's so many actors like making this thing come to life. There's like one guy that does the left arm and when they're all working in this, like they just know each other so well and they, they have like these things on their heads where they can see through the mud. Like it's just a whole technical process that they find very easy. And the guy who played Fonzie also does the voice of piggy and animal. That's like his talent basically unlimited. He does all three of those. Yeah. What do you got?

Speaker 2:          11:59          [inaudible] I guess first of all, thank you so much for coming. Um, huge fan and have been for years. I like to feel that your song, I don't know who you are, is my own personal anthem. I know, right? I'm terrible with names and faces and it's really your fault.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Yeah. For people that don't know what this is, we have a song about, it's called, I don't know who you are, which you can figure out what that is, but as people who have come up to you and they know who you are but you don't know who they are and they get mad and we have this hypothesis that it's like their fault because they're not interesting enough. They would have like a thing and so they kind of blend and then it's not our fault. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:35          Oh, so that's amazing. So thank you so much for opening up my life. Um, so, uh, I discovered you guys are amazing Garfunkel notes. There's another, uh, comedy folk duo, I'm sure you've heard of called flight of the Conchords. Yes. And it seems such an odd thing to me that there were two comedy photos that were so hysterically funny, had really successful songwriting careers and then made specials where they incorporated those songs. You guys inspired by each other? Do you collaborate? Do you guys all hang out in some really cool bar somewhere?

Speaker 1:          13:06          I've never met Brett, but I know Jermaine and Jermaine is actually on the upcoming season of another period. He's doing two episodes a season, which is so cool. He flew in from New Zealand just to do the show and he plays a priest. It's like, it's like every single thing he says is funny. So we were very, very excited. But you mean I actually became friends on Twitter. Like he just sent me a DM one day being like, hey, there's like eight people in the world to do what we do. What's up? And I was like, I know, it's so crazy. Right? And he was like, how weird is it, what we're doing? We're in comedy folk. Like who does that? So I'm like, I don't know. And then we just lived in like Twitter acquaintances since then. And then he agreed to do the show, which was so cool.

Speaker 2:          13:43          So no plans for some grand mega band or something.

Speaker 1:          13:46          I mean, I would be so down quartet. I mean I wish, I hope I'm going to put up, I don't know Brett, but I would love to just putting it out and now it's out in the world. Yeah, it's in the universe now. It's going to happen. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. [inaudible] I don't know who you are song. It was really weird because everyone like takes your point of view, which is like, I don't remember people either, you know you put yourself in the hero position but then one person came up to us after a show and I'm like, that's all he is so mean. And I was like, wait, why? Like what? He goes, people always forget me and I was like, Oh God. And he put it, he put himself in the other like split yourself in like the hero shoes. Like you hear a bit about other people being annoying. But like I am a note. Like you don't put your, I don't know. I thought that was so strange and I didn't know what to say. I was like, I think you should not, you should like, like change your perspective on this. Like do you forget people? And he's like, no, really sorry man. I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          14:41          But speaking of that, another one of your songs seems like it may come across as aggressive to people. Pregnant women are smug. Have you ever had any of

Speaker 1:          14:47          for that? I mean, yeah, but not any of that. Like you care about. I don't know. What are you going? Oh, you know, like I don't like that. I'm like, okay. Right. Like it doesn't, it doesn't ever hurt my feelings ever. But like so many more people had been like, like Amanda Palmer is pregnant, she sees saying pregnant women are smug and her whole tour, like she's like took it on. And a lot of people, like we got these onesies made that say my mommy's smug and they just like sold out people. Just people that just buy them. So I think probably for gag gifts for baby showers, but I think, I dunno, most people own it. I feel like if you're pregnant and acting like that, like you know it and like you can, like, you're allowed to, there's no, yeah, you're just allowed to do that. But I think you know it, the woman card, the woman card, I know the pregnant woman card that's, that's more powerful than the woman card I think. Cause like, cause no one can say that you're not going through whatever you're saying you're going through. Like they're like, no, my, my ankles hurt. And you're like, okay. Like you can't, you can't be like, no they don't. You know, you have no idea.

Speaker 2:          15:54          I'll speak your songs. I want to, uh, I am dating a 31 year old woman who loves 29 31. Oh cool. So, uh, thank you for that. From her. She feels like there's no one left and that's why she's dating him. Maybe I'm telling you, I mean, that's exactly what I said when she was like, Oh man, that's so cool. And I was just like, wait a second. Just got really real.

Speaker 1:          16:15          We'll take that. Like some people have taken it is here. Like I was at a baseball game the other day and this girl turns out, she's like, are you the girl from the 29 31 video? And I was like, yeah, yeah. And she didn't think we wrote it. She thought we were like acting in this video and she's like, I relate to that song still match. I'm 30 and I know my life is about to get really bad. And I was like, no, it's just a joke. It's not even like, it's not real. Like it's not necessarily that, it's just like a joke. It was about like basically me and kids kind of perspective on love and we weren't even 29 31 at the time. We just thought those were funny numbers. We were like 31 and 33 but we're like, no, it's not. It's funny. Um, yeah, but she's like, I just know everything's going to get bad and I got to meet someone soon and she was so pretty and like I was, I'm like, okay. I'm like, sorry, maybe you shouldn't watch that video. It's like just a joke.

Speaker 2:          17:01          Oh that's it. Out of all of the songs, you and Kate, if put together, what is like your go to like which of which is your favorite baby basically? What's your favorite thing? My favorite

Speaker 1:          17:09          song is one that we've actually never played on. It's just an an album, but it is on our TV show. It's called such a loser. And it's this anthem for people who are trying, cause like we like just like, I mean you guys are all on the Internet. You understand? Like when you put something out there, you just get all this criticism and, and it kind of feels like there's like this hierarchy where it's like winners, like people who just don't do anything but like comment on it and then losers. But like we just feel like those should be switched. Like winners are just like they want and you got it like they did. But like the people who try and the people who comment on it, it should be like a different hierarchy so that the commenters should just be like whatever. And so we wrote a song about in praise of people who are trying and because if you're failing, not much, you're trying that much. So it's, it's not a funny song. It's totally sentimental, but I think it's the best thing we've ever written. So yeah, look it up. It was like a cartoon made of it. People play it for their kids.

Speaker 2:          18:03          Uh, with the, with your song writing process, you seem to then also go into video. Uh, so what is that like? Do you ever like get kind of bogged down and like, oh, this would look great visually so we should enter the song or is that well after that,

Speaker 1:          18:16          nope, we don't have that kind of forethought when he's like, oh, I don't know. I guess we just film some stuff. Yeah, we don't really ever think about that part of the song. And like for such a loser, we had an animated by these people in Boston who are so incredible and they just sent us this thing and Kate and I, we always have a million notes were always were so nitpicky, it takes us forever and do anything. And they sent it and we just started crying, both of us and we're like,

Speaker 2:          18:36          this is perfect. And they were like, well we have like four rounds of notes built in. And we're like, so sometimes it's like that easy. That was going to say, so for you to know it's a really a bad,

Speaker 1:          18:47          oh no, no, no, no. I always have so many notes, but this one, it was just like, it was perfect and so you don't want to, if it's perfect, it's perfect. Yeah. You know, so, but yeah, I'm pretty, I'm like pretty hands on with everything. Okay. I like to be in every moment of everything like Natasha or editing another period right now and we're in the editing room from like 10 to eight every single day. We just get her nails done in there. I mean like, yeah, we're hands on. Great. Um, okay.

Speaker 2:          19:15          In another period, um, uh, uh, in another period coming up, what can we look forward to? You mentioned that Jermaine was going to be on me

Speaker 1:          19:24          and Andrew Reynolds is on this new season playing like a dashing prince type person. We have, um, Harriet Tubman is in our premiere and which is so crazy that now she's on money, well about to be on money. Um, because we have her as a, she's a branding expert. We have her as like this Oprah type person. And she's basically like, how do you think I'm the only name associated with this entire movement? She's like, I did that shit.

Speaker 2:          19:48          Like on our show. People are going to have mixed reactions to it. They really are. And we're prepared for that. But it is

Speaker 1:          19:54          funny if you watch it, it's just like it's, you know, cause you think about your like how did one person, how did that happen? Like there was so many people, but yes. So you just think through history. Yeah. And now she's going to be on money. So I guess it worked

Speaker 2:          20:06          in that vein. Uh, you mentioned earlier than a lot of things are from 1902 and then you, yes.

Speaker 1:          20:12          Yes. I'm so much stuff is true though. Some people think we make up this stuff and it's like, like we have like cocaine, wine.
