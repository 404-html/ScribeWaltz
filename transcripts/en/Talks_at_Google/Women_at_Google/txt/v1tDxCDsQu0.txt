Speaker 1:          00:09          My name is Nathan. I'm just want to thank everyone for showing up and your patients today. Oh, we got this awesome little event. Go on today on it is my pleasure and honor to introduce Jessica Lay Mayfield. She had time on her tour to come stop by and talk with us for a little bit so we can learn about her past and what kind of brought her here today and we'll end up like a little set. Hopefully have some beautiful songs and maybe some Q and a but as we go. But um, yeah. Hello. How are you doing today?

Speaker 2:          00:33          Yay.

Speaker 3:          00:39          Yeah, I am. I am doing well. Thanks for having me here. Is this, are we under like a giant guitar?

Speaker 1:          00:49          I think so, yeah. We're hoping that you'll, the finale will be somehow incorporated into that guitar, but we'll get there. We'll get there. Yeah. Excellent. Well, um, you have such a long kind of career, even though you're kind of like, it's a short career. Like you started in a family band and like I was like a child, like this seems kind of like a very interesting opportunity and kind of a way to kind of adapt and kind of guide your musical career. Would you mind telling us a little bit about that?

Speaker 3:          01:16          Oh, okay. Well yeah, I've been doing this for a really long time, so I started doing music with my parents when I was eight years old and we lived on a old tour bus that was owned by a bunch of popular bluegrass and country musicians at one point and basically just travel around like hippies. And so I've been touring since I can remember basically.

Speaker 1:          01:51          That's amazing. Like I can only imagine just kind of being on the road one, but let's put the family to dynamic. Like that could be very interesting kind of relationship to kind of roll was born with. And then also just kind of take that musical experience as a positive and keep moving with.

Speaker 3:          02:05          I think it just Kinda, it definitely made, um, really, it just kind of made everyone feel like they're, there weren't really family roles. It was just like, okay, we're all on the same level here are doing the same thing. Sort of, you know, I'm real, I'm just traveling around trying to make money and you know, so it's just really interesting to feel like you were on a team with your relatives are awesome idea. You guys take you and your brother take that street corner and your mom and I'll go over here and let's all play for tips and come back and see what we got and it's interesting. So definitely an interesting,

Speaker 1:          02:45          awesome, wait, was there like a favorite song or like kind of like a goto track that you guys had it together or maybe it was like the one you guys enjoy doing the most?

Speaker 3:          02:53          Usually. I mean we pick kind of one song, whatever song seemed to be trying to remember right now. I was, a lot of times it would be requests so people would want to hear stuff like amazing grace. It didn't feel like okay, I was just like a little girl. I'm like wow. Right.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Awesome. Awesome. Well you know obviously in your musical career denied in there. I've kept moving. And then 2006 about if my memory serves, that's when I'm white lies came out. That is kind of when I was first introduced to you and your music while you were a tournament, the Everett brothers and that was a beautiful summer of Oh seven I was very happy to meet you there. But that was kind of the legend goes that that was the album that kind of got a particular artist, that tension. And if I have a right, the gentlemen from Black Keys, Dan, our buck. And then what happened? What snowballed from there?

Speaker 3:          03:44          Well, he's from Akron, Ohio and I'm from Kent, Ohio. When I had recorded that album at home in a bedroom, it ended up getting over to him somehow. And then from there we started recording just me and I've a couple of times a week and recording, not really knowing what it was going to be. And then I ended up making my first record with him and then I made my second record with him as well.

Speaker 1:          04:13          How will that, cause at that time he could have been what a teenager, I would one would guess it'd could be a very kind of unique kind of guiding experience for like a young artist to meet someone and kind of, you know, that's a big name, you know, like an adult coming to you and wanting to produce and push your music. That seems like pretty magical.

Speaker 3:          04:30          I know it was definitely interesting to kind of, I had a lot of friends at the time who, who knew who they were, who the black keys were, and I was just kind of, I got hip to it around the time that I met him and that was around the time that they were really starting to get more popular. So I thought, you know, okay, I'll go hang out with the sky, I guess in work in his studio and then it'll be whatever. But it definitely ended up, uh, you know, I still to this day I meet a lot of people who, the first album they heard is the first one that I did really with dance. So I think that there's still people that are going back and finding out about me now throw it out. And that came out over 10 years ago. Right. Almost the sense

Speaker 1:          05:21          that's crazy. I kind of did the reverse. Like I heard that you were doing backup vocals on like some kind of like sloppy Jamey like blues band. I was like, oh, I should check it out. And then that's when I find that you did the backup vocals for um, things aren't like they used to be, right? Yeah. And that was kind of out of the reverse kind of interaction with the black. He was like, oh, like who is she playing with? Oh, okay. Right on this, this week. These guys are good. Yeah. Awesome. Well then from there we'll, so the next time when we came out with them with blossoming was so heartfelt. That was kind of like our first kind of major produced album. Not you and your brother kind of slow for frilliest produced. Like, how was that kind of new experience from like family jam band panell stuff, you know, like on your own to kind of like this more kind of potentially like dynamic or a specific process? You know,

Speaker 3:          06:06          it's funny, I definitely um, with blast for me it was kind of piece together over a period of time where Dan had this rental space and he would get in different gear and Kennan call me over 10 to Guinea pig and try stuff out. And then stuff from the became that album, which is, it's funny because then by the time I did my next album with him, it was real studio vibes. But that first thing was just kinda like, uh, all right, one of us has to like reach over and turn this machine on and then get back to whoever's closer to it and, and who isn't starting the song first. So it was very still kind of, I feel like with blasphemy. So has those bedroom me vibes of just like, hey, we're using nicer stuff. But it's just like very small group of people that we can't even really say group

Speaker 1:          07:08          was there. Like any kind of like intimidation level with it. Like obviously you've been around music and performers as like a young kid. So like what's it, it's just like another day at the office there. Was there kind of like a an all moment and involved in it at all?

Speaker 3:          07:19          Um, I mean not, not really. I don't get it. That's interesting though. I don't really get too nervous around people. Good for you. It was great power. More like single people? No, like a large group of people maybe. I don't know. That sounds bad.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Awesome. Awesome. Well kind of brought up favorite brothers earlier and like definitely have seen you guys tour. Like anytime you guys go harmony, it's the most beautiful thing ever. Well Scotty, so much. And so you guys have this awesome Elliot Smith tribute album that's just beautiful and gorgeous and I can see obvious that Elliot Smith as a potential enemies, the ones are on you, but kind of curious what, what led you to this specific project and also with Scott? David. Oh it was with that. Seth, I'll stop.

Speaker 3:          08:07          Sorry. Pardon me. That's okay. They were actually people that would come to the show and still think that was Scott, which I don't get, I think people confuse them just a little bit part of my nerves. No, that's okay. Whatever. Um, uh, we, uh, south, I realized that we were both big Elliot Smith fans and that was just something we would end up talking about almost every time we saw each other until one point we were on tour together and we both walk into the screen room and it had a piano. And when he started playing an Elliot Smith Song and I started singing it and from there we were like, we should do something like this. And we just kept sending each other the voice memos of Elliot Smith songs until we had an more than enough ideas.

Speaker 1:          09:08          That's very cool. And slowly out of them. I was always trying to put my finger on like a way to kind of describe it and I kind of stumbled upon a review that kind of just said it so well too where like it wasn't like you guys trying to reinvent or like change the songs and make it your own. It was more just kind of like an honest homage to Elliot Smith. Like does kind of like put it all into like a wonderful nutshell for me when I was like thinking of that album, like how you guys put it together. Huh?

Speaker 3:          09:29          Well thank you. It's, it was kind of stressful because especially as huge Elliot Smith Fans, I think we understood that, you know, you're, you're attempting to mess with something that's pretty delicate and s and I had to put myself in the shoes of, if someone else did that would I be like, what are you doing anyway? You can't sing Elliot Smith songs. Like, no, there's only he can do that. You know, he's the best of that. So right. There's definitely that line to draw of wanting to do a good enough job to do it justice without making it too different or you know, ruining it somehow. I think we just didn't want to ruin it.

Speaker 1:          10:11          Well, whatever level you found, it was wonderful. And thank you for that version of fun. We're a fun for all of her friends is just, it gets me, it's very beautiful.

Speaker 3:          10:20          Thank you. Yeah. All right. What else do I have to harass you with? Anyone? Compliments.

Speaker 1:          10:26          That's what the last pages. I just have a list of things I like about Shia so we'll get there. Don't worry. Yeah. Yeah. Um, well we have your newest album. I'm sorry. It was gone. Um, it's very interesting album for me. It felt like there was a lot more, like, just seems like there's so much happening though, but it flows together really well. Like it, no, I do like that, but this is why I'm bringing it up. But I'm like, just like this kind of rawness to it within it. Like it's not like it's scattered. It flows for me, but it does have like a different depth for me. And then when I saw the title of sorry, it was gone. I was wondering if that was kind of like kind of reflection of the steps that you were trying to like kind of create or maybe project with it because it's such a kind of simple sings a little, let's just, sorry it's was gone, but it seems like there's kind of a lot behind it potentially.

Speaker 3:          11:13          Well, I mean I think this album, it came together without me really realizing what if any theme there was going to be. And I realized that a lot of the songs were all working together for the theme of being, uh, not afraid to be yourself, I guess, which is all these things sound cheesy and funny, but it's, I don't know, you shouldn't be embarrassed to talk about them.

Speaker 1:          11:44          Yeah. And that's one of beautiful and I think that's kind of this variation of style. And I kind of comes in is producing this all one kind of reflects what you're just saying. I'm just like that genuine self, which funnel is really awesome. I was just curious about the title and like maybe how it played with it. Okay, sweet. Yeah. Alrighty. Well I have some more kind of just like a silly question is for you if we may and we can lighten the mood a little bit before we hear some of your banks and your music

Speaker 3:          12:07          ask away.

Speaker 1:          12:08          So like I feel like there was always someone at shows we just kind of want to scream and I'm like song or request at you. Okay. So like is there like any in particular that have stood out over the years that kind of made me cracked a smile or maybe or even like indulged?

Speaker 3:          12:20          Hmm. See I don't think I've ever had anyone like requests unless it's my song and they requested that I might play it, but it's like one thing, people will go back with my songs and I'll go really, really far to the very, very first album. And what lives don't want to hear something that's more than 10 years old or that I wrote when I was like 15, I'm thinking, I don't remember that there was this one show where I had played and then came back up for the encore and we were all getting ready to play our hearts around. This drunk woman comes up and she goes, no, stop. And she's like, where? She's like, you're going to play this song. And it was like some really slow, weird, sad song off of white lies. And I'm like, no, this is the last song of the night. It has to be something fun. And like she got really mad and stormed out. That's probably a more interesting thing. I think people get really emotional. If I don't do that, they ask me,

Speaker 1:          13:25          well you, you're there for them, right?

Speaker 3:          13:26          Yeah. Like I'm sorry, like I have a plan, like a list of songs to do. The band learned

Speaker 1:          13:37          and I promise this one wasn't like, you know, like, uh, a temperamental question. I, I didn't bring it up like on the spot, but I was wearing if over the years of touring, I'm sure you kind of come across a lot of interesting to silly to like comical, like interactions or obstacles. I'm wondering if you have like maybe like one that comes to mind that like brings the biggest smiles or last as you look back, obstacles, just silly things, you know, like travel and every day on the road cars, you know, there, there could be always trouble out there. Right?

Speaker 3:          14:08          Oh, there's always trouble out there. Like booking a hotel in the wrong city and then driving to the right city and realizing it later. I'm trying to think of what kind of goofy snafu that happened. I don't know. It's actually kind of boring honestly. I mean it's just kinda like hotel, like sitting in a hotel, eating that sounds nice. Eating in bed, uh, playing a rock show, eating in bed. Maybe if I'm lucky, I can like lay in bed before the show too if I have, this is where it gets really exciting. Um, just any basically just like eating and sleeping and it's people things driving. Awesome. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:03          Well, can I get up kind of like on the same level, like is there like a, a group or an artist that you've enjoyed and it was kind of touring or it's been kind of like a special or fun experience?

Speaker 3:          15:13          Well, it's funny you mentioned it's the ava brothers. I kind of look back on that is that was some of the first touring that I did. It was with them and with the black keys and I was really young and that was the first time I ever did any west coast touring was with the avid brothers. So there's definitely a lot of first time tour things with them that I always think about. So that's, that's fine because I'll go somewhere to be like, oh yeah, I've been here a million times now. But I remember the first time I came here. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:50          Sweet. Very cool. Yeah. And then how about like what are you listening to these days? And if there was like, if you're, you know, trying to like sit in a bed and eat some food in a hotel room, like what do you put on?

Speaker 3:          16:01          Okay, well let's see. Put on, I don't really watch much TV

Speaker 1:          16:07          music. Is that what you listen to it? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          16:09          Um, and music wise it's always, it's funny, I don't really branch out very much. I keep it till like the same group of artists. So it's always like Elliot Smith and um, Saligoe Soundgarden, just a nineties, nineties classics heavy, a lot of heavy music. Awesome. Um, I've been trying to listen to some books on tape, but it's hard to say a week, so it's not a good thing to do while driving, but I still try to do it anyways. And then if you fall asleep, I get listening today in bed and you're, you don't retain any of it. So still trying to figure out books on tape.

Speaker 1:          16:49          It'll be there for you. There'll be waiting.

Speaker 3:          16:51          How that, how that works.

Speaker 1:          16:54          Awesome. Well, you know, I just wanted to kind of spend some time to kind of like share your pass and you hear where you're coming from. I'm like, why you're here today. Like maybe now it'll be a good time to treat everyone with their patients. Will see a few tracks and then maybe a little Q and a at the end if that's all right by you. Yeah. Beautiful. Hold on. I'm going to receive from the stage. Oh yes. Believe me. I'll sit here if you'd like. Yeah. It will be your room. I can be the water. Yeah. Well I'm gonna sit here and be the water boy. You're welcome to sing along. Oh God, I might on that accident.

Speaker 5:          24:37          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          24:56          Oh, the sky. So you miss me.

Speaker 5:          25:31          No.

Speaker 4:          27:21          Say the same thing. Ah, Yay. Nay say close to fun. Oh,

Speaker 2:          28:50          thank you for keeping that in my head for the next week or two.

Speaker 1:          28:55          What do you think? She was a little break for us in the Q and. A. You want to keep it? You want me to play more? Do you have more questions? I kind of ran through my questions. Maybe we can do a little Q and a then it some more songs. Yeah, totally beautiful. I could play a song. Why you asked me a question? Yeah, let's do it. This just started asking me, come up with something. There was a microphone in the back of the room for those of us who would like to ask Jessica some questions. Okay. Now Watch me awkwardly dancing around the stage. Hi. Hello. Well you sound great. I wanted to ask, uh, what you find most gratifying about your, your career? Is it making music and touring or is it putting an album out or meeting super fans? Like anything.

Speaker 3:          29:51          Those are all great points. I think there's something too about it can be, it's, it's interesting to, I really liked the personal process of writing songs and then I feel like the process of sharing them almost goes against what it is because it's definitely a really private, uh, collection of feelings and then I go out and share them with everyone. So there's kind of those two different aspects, which I, I like getting, you know, to have to have the contrast.

Speaker 6:          30:27          Wow.

Speaker 3:          30:28          Thank you. Yeah. Did you share them? Whites worst. Ooh. Um, I'm kind of weird like that. So if I'm gonna work on it with someone, then I would play it for them. Otherwise, if I'm just working on something, I might just play it at a show and see what happens. And I try it once and if I don't like it then I'm just never play it again. Otherwise, if I liked something about it, then it might make it's way into something eventually. Yeah. Red. Thank you. Hi, mixed. No, I'm just kidding. On A,

Speaker 6:          31:12          we'll waive its subject of have a new groups here for songwriters, producers and musicians. And a topic that frequently comes up is the difficulties of the songwriting process and finishing what you start. Uh, I'm wondering what you can share with us about your own process and difficulties you might even still have. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          31:40          I think that it's, um, it's easier, it's easy to realize that something might not be that great of an idea if you're having a really hard time finishing it. So I think the, the thing about that is to make sure you were excited enough by the idea to follow through. And that's something I've learned is if that's not how you feel, then make yourself feel that way if you, cause if I, if I'm not wanting to follow through on an idea, I have to ask myself, why am I procrastinating on it? And just like, oh, because I'm not that passionate about it. So I think for me that's his main thing is to just keep finding ways to stay excited about what you're working on. Thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you. That's like a weird city hall. It's just big on actually no, we are building the road. I am building the shooting range next to the playground. I'm just kidding. All right. Hi.

Speaker 6:          32:46          So on that same topic, I'm wondering, do you write your lyrics first and the music or vice versa?

Speaker 3:          32:52          That changes, you know, something I go through phases. She usually lyrics first and sometimes I'll come up with a melody that I really like and I'll hate the lyrics and then I'll put lyrics that I wrote previously to that. But it's definitely two different things. I'll write something and either I'll really like the lyrics or the melody and then work from there. Decide what is it about that that I liked? Was it the, the way I was it, was it the word service of the way that I was saying the words

Speaker 6:          33:26          you have someone who you collaborate with, how do we get a little bit?

Speaker 3:          33:30          MMM,

Speaker 2:          33:32          yeah.

Speaker 3:          33:32          No, I mean I don't collaborate that, that often as far as, I'm kind of bad about that with song writing and if I do, I just have to, um, a lot of times it's give a song to someone else and leave them alone with it. I definitely can't watch while someone else tears it apart. It's hard to be open minded to, you have to, once you hear someone else's idea, it's hard to immediately not just be like, I hate it. It's not my idea. You have to actually try to see what, what could be good about it, you know, just because it's someone else's idea. Yeah. You're welcome.

Speaker 6:          34:15          These are good for thanks again for a performance this afternoon.

Speaker 3:          34:19          Thank you.

Speaker 6:          34:20          You mentioned you've, uh, you've had like a whole life and career in the music industry and uh, you started out the corners shows and mean back to the family. You've seen a lot of the music industry change over the years as well. Um, and I'm wondering if you could share, if you have any chronic sort of like gripes with where the music industry is today, where you might see improvements in the future, kind of what you'd like to see in the future for the music industry.

Speaker 3:          34:48          Interesting. Yeah. It's weird.

Speaker 3:          34:52          It's Kinda like, I don't really have unnecessary like an idea to fix it, but you can see what's happening and it's been happening for most of my life. I mean, I can look back to music being free when I was 10, 11, 12 and in remembering like Napster and all this stuff and seeing that even as we're kind of watching that happen and watching people that you said to make money, doing something that having people not really want to invest in it anymore. And I guess that's something that I'm, I've kind of seen, seemed the way things have changed. It's just not, I dunno, but I didn't really see the way things were at the same time too. So it's an interesting, um, I'm really curious to see where it goes, but I have no idea how I could even imagine that because who knows what's going to keep changing. Yeah. Yeah. You're welcome. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          36:06          I was looking for advice on how not to lose this. So specifically that was when you were in love. Okay. And when you read a lot of solid and it's a great song and then you break up, what do you do with that love song that reminds you of that person to lose it? Right. Do you have a way of taking it back and the two years ago?

Speaker 3:          36:23          Oh yeah. You just, you keep singing it and new definitely. Um, apply it to something else. I don't know. It's try, I mean give it some time if you have too, but I mean if you, especially if you really liked the song and just be like, hey, you know what, the one cool thing I got out of this was this red sung, you know, we got it that way. Like just kind of instead of thinking about her or whatever, whoever it is

Speaker 6:          36:59          like,

Speaker 3:          37:00          yeah, definitely. I mean, I, I'm kind of a relationship writer too, so it's, I definitely write about every relationship that I've been in. And then eventually it goes back to when I was a teenager. So there's a lot of teenage breakup set I still ended up singing about, and I think that's ridiculous as this is part of my life and career, but it's, you know, it's like, hey, at least they got the part of my life and career out of this relationship. So cool.
