Speaker 1:          00:07          Thanks so much. I'm just, after I started work on this book, I went to see one of the greatest scholars of the 17th century and he'd written some of the finest pages about Salem and I wanted some advice. Well, I left him that day. We're standing on the front porch of his house. Um, he added another little piece of advice pretty much as an afterthought. Um, he said, I should probably warn you that when you write about witchcraft, really strange things happen to you. Um, and I kind of forgot about that. Like the comment disappeared in the air and I went on to research the book, write the book. I finished it more or less on schedule, kind of more or less, maybe sort of approximately on schedule at the publisher was really happy with it and they were even happier when they learned that publisher's weekly was going to do a profile of me this summer, um, with which they would run a full bleed full page picture.

Speaker 1:          00:58          And indeed they did. And here's what it looked like. So as you may notice that Stacey Schiff is not, I, um, thanks to Twitter. It took me about 90 seconds to figure out that it's Amy Stewart, a novelist too. I've never met. She does have a book out this fall about which I'm thinking maybe I could cross promote and when I asked my publisher to send me this page so I could show people what strange things happen to you when you work on witchcraft. I also asked them to send me the table of contents. Um, and here it is. I don't know if you can read it, but, um, essentially I was rather surprised to learn that after four years in the archives unearthing and deciphering and squinting at documents, corralling my imagination, the hiring fact checkers, I had written a novel, um, saw strange things obviously do happen to you when you work on witchcraft.

Speaker 1:          01:46          This is not a book of fiction. Um, instead it's a temp, an attempt to grapple with exactly what happened in eastern Massachusetts in 1692 among the loop iest really certifiably strangest moments in American history. Um, seller may qualify as the best known, at least understood chapter in our past, partly because it seems so improbable and partly because it comes to us through Hawthorn and through Arthur Miller who were in fact writing fiction. Here we are halfway between Plymouth Rock and Paul revere and suddenly everything just goes screamingly off the rails. Um, allows them as well also make clear in the course of nine months. Um, we go from one very deep one kind of story to a very different kind of story is a tragedy to which we go back regularly. A few corners of American history have been so often explore it. And if you don't believe me, take a look at this.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Here's my local libraries, um, stack of 17th century American history. So you can imagine me crawling my way from eating my way from one end to the other. Um, this, the other side is my office shelf. When I finished writing the book, you can see there at the very top there, those little low classical library of volumes. Those were leftovers from the Cleopatra Years. And I'm just, I've always wanted to, what Cicero thought about being a wedged between the puritans on both side of him. There Salem is a little bit our national campfire tail. It's one of the rare moments in our history when the candles are knocked out and everyone seems to be groping around in the dark. That's where all good stories begin in the dark. We imagined most vividly and we believe most fervently it's in the dark and we contemplate our mistakes and wrestle with our fears.

Speaker 1:          03:25          In the dark goes the Italian proverb, every cat is a leopard and if you read the court papers at 17th Century Essex County, which I spent a lot of time doing, you begin to notice that the new Englander lived very much, very attentively and very apprehensively in the dark. Women tend to stumble into their beds to find strange men sleeping there. Men trip home through the night to discover that familiar landmarks have moved and then people get lost in their own backyards. Young men report that they're weak kneed at the thought of riding home in the night to their families after sundown. And when the devil offers to accompany them, they accept his offer. I read every 17th century account of the New England merch of the wolves howling in the distance and the lurking native Americans. But it took me a really long time to figure out how dark dark truly could be.

Speaker 1:          04:15          And in truth, it took me until this, this is midtown Manhattan in 2012, um, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, I was driving some friends home to their home downtown. We were up town and we had electricity and suddenly all those accounts of the New England wilderness made sense. I mean, you couldn't see anything. You could truly become disoriented, um, in your own yard. And hence the line in chapter one of the book, The Sky Over New England was crow Black Pitch Black Bible black, so black. It could be difficult at night to keep to the path so black that a line of trees might freely migrate to another location or that you might find yourself pursued after nightfall by a rabid black hog, leaving you to crawl home bloody and disoriented on all fours. That's by the way, from the court testimony, the basic facts of Salem are simple. In early 60, 92 over a particularly cold winter, a nine and an 11 year old girl began to shutter and scream.

Speaker 1:          05:09          They happened to have been the niece and daughter of the Salem Village Minister Samuel Parris. Here he is, um, he would have been in his late thirties. At the time. The cousins complained that something bitten choked them. Their bodies twisted. They would attempt to fly through the air and climbed down wells. We have lots of descriptions of the, of the afflicted girls, the bewitched girl's symptoms. Um, but we obviously have no image. And here's the closest that we can really come. This is a 19th century French text on the phases of hysteria on the emotional trauma and what its physical manifestations would've looked like. Remember that no one in the 17th century distinguished between an overtaxed nervous system and be Wichman. The first question anyone asked in the face of these kinds of symptoms wasn't for some time would remain MIB witched. Um, it was understood that any kind of prolonged fit had been sent by the devil.

Speaker 1:          06:04          And indeed within, within a matter of weeks to other village, girls begin to exhibit the same symptoms. Everyone's soon learned from their parents or from local authorities are from Reverend Paris that they were bewitched. And with that was the diagnosis. You can very well imagine what came next. The girls symptoms seriously deteriorated soon enough. All four of them could reveal who'd be which thumb. We don't know why they named the names they did. But when you think about it for a second to the question, who irritates? Who annoys you? Who unsettles you? Who wish, who wishes you ill? Every one of us has an answer. And so did the girls at the answer to that question. And 60, 92 was clear. It turned out that there were not one but three witches flying around. Salem warrants went out. At the end of February for their arrests. The suspects came immediately before the authorities.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Justice was very swift in the 17th century, and they were interrogated in the manner of the day, which meant that a local beggar woman, the first woman to be deposed, was asked by the justices when she had signed a contract with the devil, why she hurt the girls, what creatures she had dispatched to do. So those questions came to her from very well dressed, important men who own significant businesses who spoke with weight and authority. The contest was asymmetric. And I should say that this is a story that has something for everyone. And here you can see it begins to mutate because it turns from, it begins as a kind of fairy tale. Once upon a time, a wicked witch cast a spell on a little girl and it turns very quickly into a courtroom drama. Let me talk for just a few minutes about how witchcraft worked. Um, what exactly, uh, which was, um, not every 17th century new Englander was clear on the subject, but those who were, were exceedingly clear to the early American, which existed as plainly as did heat or light at the early American, which I should add, did not look like this.

Speaker 1:          07:59          Um, although there is a certain wizard of Oz theme running through the Salem story, and I'll talk about that in a minute. And nor did a 17th century, which looked like this. This is by the way, the original, if you can believe it, the original wicked witch of the West from the, um, from the book that wizard of Oz. I particularly like those, um, that flying pig tail on the spats, which are kind of unexpected for a which, um, this is an early American Halloween, which you can see that which is came very late to, to Halloween. Um, and they didn't dress and basic black until after Margaret Hamilton and the 1939 wizard of Oz, the witches, a 17th century new Englander knew her with someone who could perform unnatural feats because if the compact that she had signed with the devil, and from that pact, she drew her power to transform herself into cats, wolves, rapids, and of course rabid black hawks, which could be a man or a woman the more often she was female.

Speaker 1:          08:54          And she maintained them, maintained a menagerie of imps or familiars who could do her bidding. And those mascots could be turtles are weasels, um, cats, dogs and toads are very prevalent. As you can see here. This is a 17th century, which who is feeding blood to her diabolical toads. Um, this is a woman who has her diabolical familiars with her. It's her. You can see her black cat, of which there are a great number and her demon familiar and Sheila's straight to 1621 English witchcraft case. But, but this woman actually was acquitted, um, at her trial. Here's some more diabolical familiars. Um, you see that they range from the sort of standard issue, barnyard pig to rather gargoyle like, um, fantastical creatures, black cats, um, particular favorites. They seem to have been the arch enemy of man from the very beginning and they turn up regularly throughout the Salem testimony.

Speaker 1:          09:51          They said they've enjoyed an association but the devil for a long time. Black dogs turned up a lot too, but historically English, which is, um, tended to prefer feline to canine form. This by the way, is not a, which is familiar. This is our family cat moose, but I hope she's looking sort of vaguely demonic here. Um, but which signed her pact with the devil and blood and she enchanted with effigies and ointments. She could be a muttering, contentious malcontent or she or he could be simply strong or unaccountably smart, both kinds of, which is what turnoff in 1692 as would wealthy merchant, as would wealthy merchants who are, which is sea captains, who are witches ministers and homeless five year old girls who were witches. While her power was supernatural, the witches crime was a religious one in New England. Her target was the soul rather than the body and her connection to the convulsing Salem girls.

Speaker 1:          10:45          According to the legal guide on many Salem desks in which was about to land on Samuel Parris, his desk, this is the volume by William Perkins. Witchcraft when it manifests, it showed up as senseless trances, paralyzed limbs, convulsions, jaws, clamped, shot, frothing, gnashing, and violent shaking. In other words, the symptoms of the girls in the parsonage to a tee. When Massachusetts established a legal code, the first capital crime was a dollar tree. The second was witchcraft. In the years since those laws had been codified, New England had indicted about 100, which is a quarter of whom were men. They had hanged. Massachusetts, however, had hanged only six aside, the mystery of the girls symptoms in Salem is a greater mystery. Why in 1692, the hasty and the merciless prosecution, the charges were very familiar from earlier witchcraft cases. Casting spells on livestock was a fairly common one in Salem, which is cast spells on cattle.

Speaker 1:          11:42          On Hay, out of wagons. I must get some fireplaces. They sent dishes, sailing through the air. Um, why you might ask her these women riding on a pig. Um, this is from an early English witchcraft trial they had been at keeps women, had been accused of be witching the pig, um, New England, which is do not do a great deal of flying down chimneys. And they do do Kirito flying down chimneys and through apple trees. And ultimately they will fly to a satanic Sabbath. But I should say the traditionally the English which did not fly, um, continent continental witches, however we'll fly and that will give us a clue as to what's about to happen in Salem. And also, um, there had been, there were ghosts in 1692 who tend to flit in and out of the Salem courtroom most, but not all of them are women who have come back to then judge themselves on abusive husbands.

Speaker 1:          12:33          Those two can hook, do confess to witchcraft. And there are quite a number will confess to having flown either on the devil's shoulders or on Poles or on branches are on sticks. No New England, whichever flies on a broom, I'm sorry to say. Um, these are some English flyers. Um, there seem to be recruiting the woman on the ground here. This is an 18th century woodcut. However, as far as broomsticks go, this one is my favorite. Leave it to a French woman to be able to fly gracefully. This is a 14th, 15th century French set of witches. The accepted phenomenon on witchcraft basically went like this, which has existed everywhere in the world, in every culture and how is it possible that imagination, which is so varied and so unpredictable could deliver the same idea across all cultures in all times? In other words, witchcraft was so preposterous, so improbable.

Speaker 1:          13:25          It had to be true. You just couldn't make this stuff up. The first arrests in Salem surprise nobody. The suspect's counted among the likeliest people to be voted off the island. And let me talk just for a minute about the next person accused the fourth accused witch for a few reasons. I think part of what fascinates us about 1692 is the random, the seeming randomness of the accusations. What if the next knock landed on your door? In the case of Martha Corey, a very pious, stiff spine farm woman in her sixties. We know what happened with that. When the knock landed on her door, it was mid afternoon on March 12th. Um, she'd been named by a 12 year old village girl and it surprised everyone because she was a full church member and very devout because she was the church deacon and another man went to pay a call as a courtesy on her.

Speaker 1:          14:16          And first they stopped off to see the little girl who had accused her. They asked if she could possibly be mistaken and could she describe what Martha Corey had been wearing when she afflicted this girl? I think the child's did. She couldn't because the, which had blinded her that morning, but she would be back that evening to torture her some more. The men rode off. They found Martha Corey alone at her house. She welcomed them with a smile, but she also anticipated their question. I know what you are come for. She said, you are come to talk with me about being a witch. She was not a witch and she couldn't stop people from gossiping. How do we know all this? By the way, this is the deposition against her, um, which the two men will write out after they've visited her with that day and they tell her that the girl has, um, has deemed her the first question Martha Corey asks is, but does she tell you what clothes I have on?

Speaker 1:          15:08          They were flabbergasted by that question because of course it was precisely what they had themselves asked. And they seem to think that she had some supernatural knowledge. Um, she was sure that there was no cause for concern. She had nothing to do with witchcraft as everyone knew. She was a very devout woman. She wasn't surprised though. She said if the devil had recruited the first three women, in her estimation, they were malicious, slothful people. And interesting thing about Salem is that even those who insist on their innocence, who believe in their innocence, think that the others are witches. Martha Corey, that afternoon promised that she would open the eyes of the magistrates and the ministers so they might find the real witches. Another comment that would backfire within the week, not only her 12 year old accuser, but that girl's mother was also afflicted a spectral. Cory nearly tore the older woman to shreds, offering her a diabolical pact to sign the warrant for Martha.

Speaker 1:          16:02          Cory's arrest went out immediately. This is it. She was accused of having committed sundry acts of witchcraft on a grown woman and on for youngsters. One of them Reverend Parris, his 12 year old niece. That note that you can see in the bottom and the different ink is the Salem constables confirmation that he's arrested her and that she's in custody. And this document is dated March 21st, but because the sabbath was the next day, she in fact couldn't be arrested until Monday, which left her time on Sunday to go to church along with her accusers. So before the pulpit that Sunday, you have five spellbound girls and women and one which suspect, um, all of them in close proximity in a tiny building. Um, this is a reconstruction of the village meeting house. It measured 34 by 28 feet, and you can see how dark it would have been inside.

Speaker 1:          16:52          Um, it wasn't always possible during the hearings that were held here to identify the suspects indoors. They often had to be taken out into the daylight. And when the minister began the service, um, the march service, he was interrupted by the afflicted girls in the pews. One pointed to the ceiling. She claimed she could see Martha Corey sitting not in her seat, but up in the beams nursing a diabolical canary. The next day, Martha Corey returned to the same room to defend herself. It was thronged with spectators. There was a palpable terror in the room. A visiting minister said that he could nearly make out the hammering hearts. The raised hairs on the backs of the neck. Martha Corey insisted on her innocence. One asked one of the justices asked the question that not on every mind, how had she known that she would be asked about her clothing. She tried to explain, but she was interrupted.

Speaker 1:          17:42          Generally 17th century courtrooms were not orderly places. The girls frantically pointed about the room. They could see, they said the devil whispering and Martha Cory's ear. What did he say to you? Asked the justice she had neither seen nor heard of thing. We must not believe all that these distracted children's say she replied to which they refresh agonists. Did she understand the meaning of distracted us? The justice? Because by definition, distraction was fleeting and the girls were utterly, utterly consistent. Everyone he reminded her, understood them to be bewitched. He urged her repeatedly to confess she would not. One of the interesting things about Salem I should point out is that those who refuse to confess, we'll hang. Um, which is to say that the most principle, the most noble, the most steadfast people will end up faring the least. Well, Cory was pelted with questions, none of which she could answer.

Speaker 1:          18:36          Instead, she posed a particularly plaintiff query herself. Can an innocent person, she asked be guilty? I don't know if you can see it, but this is the document of that hearing. And the first question here is, um, you are now in the hands of authority. Tell me now why you hurt these persons. And she actually asks if she can pray a request. Just start asking several times to request, which has repeatedly denied. She insisted she had nothing to do with witchcraft. Um, a statement that incents the crowd. The girls began to yell and to snap into Maka replies when she bit her lip with nervousness, teeth marks bloomed on the arms of the girls. If she clapped her hands together, the girls were began to shutter. She leaned forward. They would crumple over an agony. It seemed as if she were working witchcraft in the courtroom itself.

Speaker 1:          19:22          By this time, two adult women are bewitched and the course of the testimony, one of them or 40 year old woman starts to howl in pain. And she says that it's Martha Corey who's attacking her. So the woman takes off her muff from our hands and throws it across the courtroom. At Corey, it fails to hit her. So the woman then leans over and takes off a shoe and lobster shoe at Martha Corey and hits her squarely in the head. A pin that she had stuck in one of her victims also turns up that day in the hearing room. Um, pins will tend to turn up often in Salem Pearson cans. By the way, the Puberty Essex is collection. These were taken over the next weeks or purportedly. So, um, from the girls' hands and legs, um, one girl turns up with a pin puncturing her lips so she can't testify.

Speaker 1:          20:06          Blood will trickle from another girl's mouth and a red stain will appear across her bonnet in the courtroom. How do we know all of this from two sources? Um, a former village minister was on hand that day and published his account of the trials and April, this is the title page. You can imagine that the account of what was happening did nothing to alleviate the symptoms. And we have a lot of the paperwork to from this particular hearing. Um, this is the deposition of one of Cory's accusers, a 17 year old girl named Elizabeth Hubbard. It seemed that Martha Correa had urged her to sign a pact with the devil. She bitten and choked and pinched her and the girl had the bruises to prove it. I believe in my heart, she testifies here than Martha. Corey is a dreadful, which, and as you can see that some of this was added later.

Speaker 1:          20:55          The court testimony is interesting because it's not infrequently edited, edited, or expanded on after the fact. This is in the hand of Reverend Paris. Um, it's the local innkeepers deposition against Martha Corey for having tortured the girls at the hearing. And you can see on that second and third line, he seems to have written out the account before he asked his neighbor to a fixed his name to it. And a third line, Martha Corey that day went to jail. She would spend the next six months in prison, in chains and in prison awaiting her trial. Six days after the hearing, um, Paris will deliver this sermon in the, in the meeting house. Um, you can see it's titled Christ knows how many devils there are. Um, and when I mentioned documentation, by the way, this is as good as it gets. Paris was a very meticulous, very diligent man and this is the finest of 17th century penmanship.

Speaker 1:          21:45          So I want you all to feel sorry for me. Um, it's a finger pointing sermon after this. It's basically you're either with us or you are against us. And the community really divides between accusers and accused. People begin to remember things that they can't explain often decades old things that they can't explain. Men Begin to see their neighbors flying through the streets. Um, the evening after the first hearing to villagers will meet an unnatural beast on the ground which dissolves in the moonlight. Two or three women they testify, materialized in its place and fly away shortly thereafter behind locked doors. One of them sits up in bed when a great gleam and a big fat cat appears in his room. Um, if this has happened to any of you recently, please let me know afterwards. Um, all of this testimony was store sworn on oath. It's all full of tall tales unless you happen to believe as woman.

Speaker 1:          22:36          One woman reported after having bout to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth that she flew on a stick with her church deacon and two others to a satanic baptism and that the previous Monday she carried her minister in spectral form through the air along with her along with her having previously conferred with her in her orchard with a satanic cap again and again what working on the book. I kept thinking of Dumbledore in the seventh Harry Potter book. Of course it's happening inside your head herring, but why on earth should that mean that it's not real? The first case came to trial in June. The first suspect hang do week later protesting her innocence to the end events to moved quickly, arrests and afflictions multiplied. It was a plague that involved a hundred witches and number that grew to 307 and later to 500 and here's where the courtroom drama will mutate again now into a horror horror story, not only for those who spent months roasting and that starving and airless fedded prisons.

Speaker 1:          23:37          Some suspects would die there and others in chains would give birth there. By late July, the authorities begin to piece a tale of a diabolical sabbath, which, which flew to from as far away as Connecticut by various conveyances, all of them to land in Salem village and all of them part of a conspiracy not only to subvert the church, but to subvert the state. And according to Parris his daughter, by the way, Martha Corey also will attend that meeting. Again, you can reconstruct that meeting, um, and these rituals from at least 50 core confessions, but we unfortunately have no image of the diabolical Sabbath. Here's the closest we can come. This is a 17th century German engraving of a, which is Sabbath. Um, it's a more decadent production than a new England one, but certain themes are familiar. They'll remember that I said there'd been no flying in Massachusetts before 1692.

Speaker 1:          24:28          Well, suddenly by the summer, everyone in Essex County seems to be a loft. Um, here's an earlier illustration from a Swedish witchcraft epidemic. And from the book you'll see why Sweden is hugely important here. But notice that this woman is flying with her children. Um, in Massachusetts in 1692 girls of eight or nine are accusing their mothers of coercing them into signing packs with the devil by late summer that didn't see denunciations are flying in every direction. Daughters accused mothers, brothers accused, sisters and parishioners will accuse their ministers in Andover. Nearly one in 10 people was accused, including never. Nearly every female member of the town's senior minister servants accused mistresses. Although mistresses did not accuse servants, no one ever suffered from witchcraft without also being able to name a witch. Martha Corey went to her death and September 22nd and what would be the last hanging before she hangs?

Speaker 1:          25:24          She's visited in prison by Reverend Paris who will excommunicate her and this is his account of the excommunication. He's irritated that the prisoner who was a very religious woman, refuses to pray with him in the 17th century. A prisoner also by the way, paid for her his or her jail charges for the blankets and the provisions. This is the jailer is accounting and you can perhaps see that. The third item here was for Martha, Corey and her husband. Um, by September the colony had executed 14 women, five men and two dogs for witchcraft. Somewhere between 140 and 180 had been accused. And then as broadly as it had begun, the which panic was over, the questions that Salem elicits or those of our nightmares can an industry innocent person, Martha Corey asked to be guilty. Might I be a witch and not know it? Another suspect asked, could anyone wondered a group of men late in the summer, think himself safe.

Speaker 1:          26:22          A Brash widow in our fifties came before the justices in April. She was not a witch. She refused. She could not even say what one one which was, she had the bad luck to be appearing before a final magician. How can you know that you are not a witch and yet, no, not no, and yet not know what a, which is as the justice. So obviously what we have on our hands, not entirely a fairy tale or a courtroom drama or a horror story, but a thriller, presumably that line of trees did not move from one side of the field to the other. Presumably there were no flies through the air killer cats. There was no satanic celebration with a long banquet table in the Salem meadow. How then did these things happen? When you begin to pry the whole episode of part, you see that it makes uncanny and eminently modern sense and no, I'm not going to tell you how that came to pass the clues as to what drives Salem forward and what will result in an unprecedented 100% conviction rate.

Speaker 1:          27:18          The only for the only witchcraft panic in our history, our woven a strand at a time into each chapter of the book and it's meant to read like a thriller so that you, you get the, the idea that only at the end it's meant to unspool with the logic of a dream and the lucidity of the supernatural, the unlikeliest of heroes will emerge in the end. Um, no, I'm not going to tell you who they were either because that would make my publisher on happy. We go back to Salem again and again for the same reason that it came to pass in the first place. The irksome lack of closure. We share the villagers need for resolution. We go back to the trials for another reason too though, as crack ups go, this one council among the more sensational in our history to which so many later missteps would be compared, that is less on account of the scale than unaccounted the circumstances.

Speaker 1:          28:09          The court in 1692 consisted of the best and the brightest. They lived in the finest homes in their respective communities. In 60 92 it's the state, the broad light of day, and the name of God led by the ablest men and the colony who sent innocence to their deaths. When friends and acquaintances came before them, those authorities doubted not the girls but their own friends. This is a portrait of Chief Justice William Stoughton who sat at the head of the Witchcraft Corp, and I will give you a hint and tell you that he is not the hero of the story. He was nearly as starchy as he looks here. He's the most eminent New England legal authority at the time, and he will die at home nine years after the trials without a word of regret or apology. He was the goto person for all legal matters and 17th century Massachusetts.

Speaker 1:          28:55          No one was better versed in, in legal code, which points up something else crucial about the panic are you addition plays much more of a role in this story then does ignorance. Um, arguably the bay colony qualifies as the best educated community in the history of the world. Until that time, the New England ministers here increase in cotton Mather, the father and son, to whom any number of civic authorities would appeal for guidance had delve deeply into the literature. They had devoured libraries on the subject of witchcraft. If anything, they may have read too much today. Of course the trials endure as a sort of moral guardrail. This is where Salem mutates, yet again to become a cautionary tale. They stop us when we overreact or over correct to me. When fear tends to overpower reason, they make the experts seem less expert. They remind us of the risk of thinking ourselves.

Speaker 1:          29:47          Exceptional. Satan's appearance in Massachusetts seem to the New England administry like a badge of honor, further proof that new Englanders with a chosen people. That statement resonates in troubled times. We naturally look for terrorists, some traders, a secret agents because they hate us for our freedoms. I just want to add that CLM feels deeply and eerily familiar in an age of crowdsource stories as well. I'm an oral culture bearers are remarkable similarity to an internet one both feet on indelible rumor, neither has much use for truth and the Internet turns out to be a brilliant tool for sewing conspiracy theory. Things went viral in the 17th century two and today we couldn't be two places and two people at once as well. Just as Martha Corey could simultaneously be at home, minding her own business and at the parsonage pummeling and choking the children at Salem is hard.

Speaker 1:          30:39          There's a sort of fairy tale or are these rippling sexual undercurrents and a lot of terror. It's really about what we see when we close our eyes. Um, and about how those images can turn for one thing and to another. It touches on what's unreal, but by no means on true for all concerned. It's a story about, um, everyone's agendas and everyone's secret agendas. The girls, the justices, the ministers, everyone's trying to accomplish something here, which is not what he states, what he states that he has accomplished his goal. Um, there would truly unsettle us those agendas just as they unsettle the 17th century new Englander who met with the Goblin or the rabid pig and out of reasons the early American turned to witchcraft for an explanation out of reasons. You are of course supposed to turn to a book, which I hope you will enjoy. Thank you. I told you may have questions or comments or corrections for me.

Speaker 2:          31:40          Hi, my name is Laura. Um, I had seen something once PBS, maybe, I can't remember where, talking about one of the theories for what happened in Salem, um, being not just the hysteria of the girls but also potentially a fungus that may have affected the mentally curious as to what your thoughts are on that. I love, yeah,

Speaker 1:          31:59          there's a, there's a theory that the rye supply had been poisoned and that a holistic agenda that a fungus that causes hallucinate, Jay Hallucinations had grown and it was a great and incredibly elegant theory, but it, which has been largely discredited for two or three reasons. The two foremost ones being that the girls are strangely terribly afflicted at sometimes and perfectly normal at other times and they tend to be the convenient times like when they're asked to do housework or where they need to testify in court. And other times they seem to sleep like babies and be perfectly normal. So that doesn't entirely hold up. Also, if the, if the, if the grain supply had in some way been contaminated, certain members of the household, uh, everyone would've been affected. In this case, you often have like has family, there are three unaffected children and then there are two girls who were convulsing. Um, one of them is then sent away, but it doesn't affect the household. You're gonna universally and also apparently was the wrong season for such a fungus to have grown. But, but I love that theory because it would have put a bit been so neat.

Speaker 3:          32:55          Excellent. I have a couple of questions and you can actually refer me to the book if that's better. But first, what became of the girls who were the original accusers here in second of all, historically sort of how much time did it pass before people, uh, properly came around on this and said, you know, the witchcraft stuff is something in our imagination. How long was that before that was generally accepted in society?

Speaker 1:          33:19          That's great though to read questions. Let me start with the second one. What's really interesting about the end of the trials is that the accepted wisdom seems to be that they have indeed murdered innocence, but they also let guilty people go free. In other words, the belief in witchcraft survived 1692 the belief in it, perfect prosecution does not. So the inpatients here is with the way this has been prosecuted. It's not what the concept of witchcraft and it will take years still for everyone to give up the belief in witchcraft in 1693 cotton Mather less his well-documented heart is taking clinical notes on two more witchcraft cases. Two more girls who invest in Boston, um, claim to be clear are basically experiencing the same symptoms and he knows enough in 1693 to take those notes and to document the cases, but he says it's too vulnerable for him to publish these things now because everyone is still so because the handover has been, um, has Salem and Andover had been such a terrific wipe out and there was so much puddling guilt and shame over the, over the issue.

Speaker 1:          34:22          Nobody will talk about Salem for quite awhile. But that belief that there is that that belief in witchcraft persists. The girls themselves, um, it's a difficult book to write because of course I'm no 17th century girl kept a diary. So we have the girls' voices in the way in, in, in how they converse with the devil, which is interesting. We place where they express themselves the best when I, the devil will bargain with them and they'll speak back to the devil. Those accounts of course come to us from the male reporters in the courtroom, so we have nothing that's actually written in the girls own hand except some testimony. We have no diaries and we have very little about what happens to them after 1692 one of the apparently does continue to be in some way in from, and it's very unspecific about what continues to toward mentor.

Speaker 1:          35:08          The others go on to lead perfectly normal wives and as I think I said in the last chapter, they go on to get married and have children, have families, not necessarily in that order. There's a strange amount of having children out of wedlock among the cohort of girls who had been a flipped in 1692 but most of them do seem to go on to lead normal lives. It's interesting because there had been a case of possession of serious diabolical possession 20 years before Salem, and that girl who was done a grown woman would have been alive at the time of the, and the bother of a large family. And I always wondered, you know, what did she think of what was happening? Because it could so easily have happened in her case years earlier, but the minister who had dealt with her affliction had really been very careful about con about containing the crisis in that case.

Speaker 2:          35:54          Can you talk a little bit about the research, how long it took and where are you did it, and just what the process was like?

Speaker 1:          36:00          Um, it took approximately 120 years. Um, it took, the research, took him three years completely. It took me about three years to research entirely and then a year and a half to write during which I was still researching a little bit because of course once you start writing, you realize that you forgot to research something or that you would need to know more or you had just haven't gotten to the bottom of something or you're just obsessive and you need to keep researching because it's better than writing always. Um, so about, it breaks down about that way. But Dot. The trial documents, these illegible beauties that you saw or most of them at the Puberty Essex in Salem and you know, it's just astonishing because you know, you're holding these papers that would say so and so is, you know, has been maliciously and feloniously and wickedly practicing witchcraft in a sentence to hang.

Speaker 1:          36:44          I mean, they just sent chills down the spine. Um, they have a great collection. Danvers has a terrific collection because they have the church record book, which I'm speaking to holes in the narrative leapfrogs over the entire summer as does a lot of the documentation are huge holes in the documentation. So great. Was the regret and the shame in the wake of Salem, Massachusetts, torical society has terrific stuff. Um, so does, is it the new England historical genealogical or s geological historic, whatever it's called, has great contextual stuff. And the American antiquarian society has a lot of the Mather material and essentially what I filled in with other 17th century diaries and the quarterly court records of the years proceeding Salem, which are really into giving you a sense of what New England life was like, what people's garages and antipathies were, who was suing everyone by the way, is suing everybody.

Speaker 1:          37:35          This is the most litigious society you can imagine. And, and we're talking about litigation that can last decades and slights that reappear, you know, years later. Um, it's just, it gives you such a sense of what people's obsessions were, what the hot spots were that trespass and drunkenness and fornication with the big sellers. Um, there's a lot of witchcraft. There are number of witchcraft accusations that go nowhere. Um, it's really, it's, it's just, it's fascinating in terms of giving you a flavor of New England life, which obviously came in handy when you're trying to explain the strains on either a young girl or on a civil authority in terms of adjudicating something like this. Another question. Um,

Speaker 2:          38:14          so I think one of the most frustrating aspects of this stories, this concept that there's no way to really prove your innocence. Um, I was curious if there, and if there's, if it's a spoiler you don't have to share, but if there's any record of someone actually rationalizing their way out of being accused outside of just being executed, confessing or pointing the finger at

Speaker 1:          38:37          somebody else. Um, you put your finger, I think on the thing that kept me awake most nights, which is that you're in a locked room and you can't get out. And once you're accused, basically you're convinced the answer is no, no one manages to get out of once accused. Nobody manages to shirk the accusation. There are two ways out. One, and this was a very class, plays a huge role in this story. The wealthy managed to escape. And they, most of them will escape to New York, which the relations between Massachusetts and New York at this point are, are very hostile in New York. Very happily. Takes them in. And I kept thinking they were going to be great papers in New York saying, you know, those crazy puritans look what they're doing to each other. I never found them, but most of the, most of the fortunate people who escaped to go to New York.

Speaker 1:          39:17          And the other way to get out of it was to confess. And that's, you know, it does beer have some, without spoiling anything, it does have some bearing on why you have these unbelievably specific and colorful confessions. Because the more you confessed, the happier the justices were, the more useful you were in the prosecution, the better you fleshed out this. And Caribbean, you know, it's crazy story. Um, and the confessors go back to prison, but no confessor hangs. So after a certain point, it does become clear that it's better to accuse than to be accused. And it's best to confess. So

Speaker 2:          39:50          they've told me an old Sturbridge village that, um, there weren't forests for the most part, everything had been clear cut to be used for buildings and heating and such. What was it like around the setting, um, uh, 150 or whatever years earlier? Was it foresty because all the public media presentations of I thought I saw something, hey, where did that person come from? Or in a forest and sort of environment, particularly when you have a low light, when you have shadow we light, it becomes a very easy to imagine things. The demons in your mind basically become, become more tangible. Was it like that then?

Speaker 1:          40:28          That's, that's also a great question and here's where the court papers came in handy and as did some of the captivity narratives of which there are quite a few very unforced did. They were, had been a remarkable, but basically the puritans arrived and cut down all the trees. There's the long and short of it and it sounds familiar, right? And today it's much greener and Lusher, um, in Essex county than it would have been. Ben. And I kept having to remind myself of that with the help of the dam versus story and Richard tracks because I would say, well, you can't see from this household to the parsonage. And he would say, but you could have in 1692 these trees are a hundred years old. Um, and you can see in the, in the court records how much obsession there was with timber because of course without timber they can't build it without what, they can't hit their homes.

Speaker 1:          41:12          And with, again, without spoiling anything, the Paris household is under particular. It is a particular danger that winter because it's up to the parishioners to bring their minister firewood or they don't like him and they're not bringing him ward. And it's a very cold winter and he's shivering and he's talking about this from the pulpit and he's basically saying, how can you leave me without, without good. I can't pray without pray. I live, you know, when I will, you will dispatch me to the other world. And you'll have this on your conscience is you know, it's a pretty contentious relationship. So yes, the wood is a huge flash point as he, as the trespass on other people's yards to cut down. Would that maybe isn't yours or the carting away of other people's homes that you know, that you could use for the word and there was a second part of your question.

Speaker 1:          41:52          Oh, if you were a lot about swamps. Sorry, what I was going to say when you read the captivity narratives and when you read about um, spectral presences at this moment in Gloucester, there are a lot of sightings of a spectral band of Frenchmen and Indians and the local militia is terrified because they can hear these men, they see these men, they can't find these men and they're clearly just seeing things, but they always arise from the swamps. There's a lot of talk about the swampiness of, of the landscape. Very little about the trees. Um, thanks. This has been [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          42:22          fascinating. I'm looking forward to reading your book and I was just curious, do you have any thoughts yet on the topic of your next book? If you're willing to share.

Speaker 1:          42:29          I was hoping you all were going to bring that to me, isn't that I thought that was the transaction here. Um, no, I, it's interesting this material is, it does get under the skin in a way and I have not entirely been able to emerge from it. I keep servicing angles that I wish I could play with a little bit more. Um, and I'm not sure if that's the fault of the material or of the tired and um, Ondor downtrodden author. But at the moment, no.

Speaker 4:          42:53          Um, it sounding like the possible explanation of sort of a combination of external stresses and internal just quarrelsome notice that seemed to exist. You know, it may be a good candidate for explaining all this, but I'm wondering, um, and you've talked about some of the possible external stresses. I'm just wondering, have people been able to develop any personal motives in any of this? In other words, worse, did some of the accusers have grudges or particular quarrels or property issues or anything like that against the people that they were accusing? I think in your book, I think you say that there was a lot of just, you know, even people within the same family accusing each other, which would argue against that. But I'm sure people have done probably you have done investigation about just the more obvious motives that might have existed and what, what, what's the story on that?

Speaker 1:          43:49          It was a wonderful book. Some of you may know which essentially argued that this had been a property, the whole thing had been a property scam and that if you accuse the right person, your estate would therefore, um, flourish and it, and it had a wonderful set of maps which proved that the accusers were on one side of town and the accused on the other side of town and how this is how all of the properties, uh, joined that too. Unfortunately, it doesn't really hold up. And it's also doesn't explain why you have the intro family accusations or why someone like Rebecca nurse who has this extremely pious older woman who's actually never been in court, which was unusual in New England, gets accused. It's possible that the fact people thought the family had too much land. It's possible that it's because all her children lived and most people lost children as possible.

Speaker 1:          44:33          That the family was simply to functional and other people were jealous and we just, we do not know. And so many cases why the finger is pointed where they pointed the property thing. The only person who makes that well, it terms of confiscating properties is the local sheriff who was an extremely tireless figure and managers to be confiscating things the minute anyone is put in prison. But he doesn't, he seems to have done it in a, in a somewhat under the radar way and he doesn't share his proceeds with the authority. So it doesn't, it doesn't really hold up in terms of some kind of conspiracy in that way. Um, it is a number of forces to my mind. It's a number of forces come together. And I guess the one that I would talk about without it being a spoiler alert is the political scene, which is that this is a colony that's completely for three years, has been living without government, has a new government in place. The strains of the chaos of the last years are still very apparent and the importance of establishing rule of law in 16 in the summer of 60 92 was huge. So for these men, for the justices all of whom have helped to topple a royal governor three years earlier and are in disfavor of London to prove that they are competent and law abiding and law enforcing officials plays an enormous role here.

Speaker 2:          45:48          Uh, I'm just curious like your research process, like the start to finish, if you could maybe touch on like how you kind of like the first thing you do when you're starting to research a book or like how that sort of evolves as you're further into researching the book and stuff.

Speaker 1:          46:03          Yeah. I'm, I'm really unscientific. Um, which is to say if I'm working on a biography, which until now I had more living person, I usually started with interviews because I knew I had limited amount of time, often with a particular demographic, obviously with a book like Cleopatra, this, that didn't apply. So I tend to go first to the primary materials, which is possibly the wrong thing to do because you're coming to them without the context. And then I circled back to them in the end. So I started, I went immediately to the Peabody Essex and read through the witchcraft testimony. I didn't know what to make of some of it because I hadn't read everything else yet. Um, I tend to confine myself to primary materials wherever possible because there's just such, I mean, you saw those shelves and you could be reading in those shells for 15 years and never get to the end.

Speaker 1:          46:47          Um, so my feeling is as little as like to use the secondary materials as little as possible. Um, things like the pure at the sermons, any 17th century direct could get my hands on him. I don't think there's one that I missed. Anything that is 17th century new Englander would have known or read at anything he wrote I needed to read. Um, and I don't do that in a particularly scientific way, partly because you don't really know what you're looking for. You haven't articulated your questions. Yeah. And then that ultimately of course means that I end up going back to some of those things once or twice again. And you know, the court testimony is a perfect example of this. I read it once in the original, most of it is published, 90% of his published, at least I went back to it again. It is published form over and over again.

Speaker 1:          47:31          And then often, not until two years later is that I actually noticed that, you know, when a particular person's testimony, um, she doesn't really give the authorities what they're looking for. She's just agreeing with them and collaborating with whatever w and agree with whatever they've said. She's not adding anything to their questions, you know, it's a kind of thing that doesn't jump out at you until you've read it several times. Um, so I guess the answer to your question is it's a kind of full immersion process for me, but it doesn't necessarily follow a linear line. And with people like Stoughton or the matters, I, I can't read everything that math, no one can read everything about others right? Road. So I would read secondary sources and I can find myself. So that's actually a frustration. But somebody like, like cotton Mather who writes, I think 92 books and the 69 he's alone. You have to really limit yourself in terms of what you're going to read. Um, and those texts are really crucial because you begin to compare different accounts he gives or how he accounts for witchcraft at different moments and how his thinking of all. So I tend to go back to the same things over and over and read them more closely rather than necessarily spreading myself more broadly.

Speaker 1:          48:40          Thank you all.

Speaker 5:          48:45          Okay.
