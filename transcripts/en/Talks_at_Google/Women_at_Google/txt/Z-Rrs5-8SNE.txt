Speaker 1:          00:06          So tell us about your journey. How did you know you want it to be a doctor and this, this whole path was really your calling? You know, I always say it was an accidental journey. I don't think anything was super intentional until maybe more recently, but the whole point or path of being a doctor really began when I was a child and we took a trip to India. My parents are Indian and we went to Calcutta, which is a very busy bustling sitting, bustling city in India. And I just remember being stunned and I remember literally getting up from the airport all the way into the city, just looking around. It was my first trip there that I could remember and just being shocked, stunned, the poverty, the people, the noise, the colors, the smells. It was just, it was just overwhelming. And there's so many things I remember from that trip, you know, from meeting my family for the first time or extended family too, you know, trying to speak in the, and the most terrible way you can possibly imagine and all this other stuff. But the thing that's stuck for years later was just people on the street that were hurt. They looked like they needed care and something in me at that age, I was 10 and it was just like, I want to, I want to help people, I want to do something. So it's very naive. Everyone walks around saying they want to help people and they want to do something.

Speaker 2:          01:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Stuck as I went through high school and then as I got into college and that's in college, I had doubts and I had moments where I'm like, I'm not sure if medicine is for me. I love science, I love chemistry. I love thinking through all of that. But I also love writing and I love speaking and I was thinking maybe more journalism. Maybe that's the way to go. And at the end of the day I chose medicine and embarked on that path and that journey, which consumed me quite honestly and left journalism behind, left riding behind and read a book and write and do anything for years. And it's just funny how life works out. Journalism found me again. So that that was sort of the path to becoming a doctor and to entering this field. Absolutely. That's so interesting. And not only are you a doctor but you really, um, in a profound way combined western medicine, eastern medicine.

Speaker 1:          02:09          So can you talk a little bit about what Skype did? You too, not just, you know, do the traditional medical route, but you know, explore this whole other world that, you know, may not be as familiar to most people. Yeah. So that also is an accidental journey. I never intended to jump into the world of eastern medicine or integrative medicine. I was a hardcore Dr. Quite honestly, I loved procedures. I love adrenaline. I want it to be an ICU doctor. I interviewed across the country for Icu fellowships and the only reason I detoured from that was there was a lot of stuff going on in our family back in Atlanta. And I was like, I really need to be home for a year or to settle all that stuff down. Let me go back to Atlanta. And I took a job in urgent care. And so from urgent care I got recruited into the emergency room and the emergency room again is high adrenaline, right?

Speaker 1:          02:58          You're everything, you're seeing everything you were doing procedures and you know, you see everything under the sun and you meet every type of person under the sun. So I liked it. I actually really loved it. So that's the type of doctor I was. But unfortunately the years of medical school, the years of your work or taking a toll, and I didn't even realize it. I wasn't even conscious or aware of it. I was completely, you know, disconnected from what was happening with me. I was more interested in kind of what I was accomplishing or what I was doing. And the kind of silent was first that I always talk about. Like you don't feel quite right. Your joints are hurting a little bit, you're starting to gain weight and you can't really explain it. You know, everything that was kind of just very silent, kind of murmuring under the surface for years started to crescendo to the point where I was losing hair.

Speaker 1:          03:44          It was noticeable. I was gaining a significant amount of weight. I had terrible acne. I didn't feel good. I would get dressed in the dark because I was just so embarrassed to like try to put myself together. And then I still didn't connect. I still didn't connect that something was wrong and I needed to do something. It's just I was so in my head most of the time. And it was finally a couple of things. It was my mom, he was really proud of my original Indian hair cause I have the best hair in the family. And it was absolutely devastated. But now like half of it was gone and it was my now husband who we were dating at the time. It was just like, something's wrong with you. You need to get checked out, you know, I, you know, he goes, I don't care.

Speaker 1:          04:20          But like I feel like something's wrong. And it was my patients, you know, because the Er at some point is still primary care nowadays. Right. So there are patients that would come in and had seen me for a few years and they were staring up at my scalp. They weren't really looking at me or paying attention to me. And so it was kind of those three things that motivated me to start this journey of trying to understand what was happening, what was happening with my health, what did I need to do. And that began my journey for finding answers. And that journey didn't go really well. It, you know, it was so frustrating and you know, not to jump ahead, but I've been, you know, to deal with my leather and long right now who has a new diagnosis of cancer. I'm back in that conventional medicine world and that journey hasn't changed for people.

Speaker 1:          05:02          It's just as hellish as I remember it being. And I went from doctor to doctor trying to get answers, trying to get solutions, solutions and didn't really get anywhere. Went to the quote unquote best doctors in the city, you know, it was willing to travel to get answers, nothing. And then finally got put on a medication that one of the side effects of the medication was that it dropped my blood pressure. Now I'm telling the story not just to tell you what happened to me, but also that explain how disconnected I was and I was a physician, right? So I'm put on this medication, I'm following what I was told to do. I'm not paying attention or digging into the fact that, you know, this might drop my blood pressure, my blood pressure is already low. Shame on me for that. Right? I already have this knowledge.

Speaker 1:          05:41          So anyhow, I dropped my blood pressure dropped dramatically one day while I was driving. And so I got into a wreck. I could have hit somebody else, I could have hit another car, I could have died. And so that was sort of just the jolt of like, you know, like what am I doing? You know? And so that began a search for answers that began going home that day and being like, I've got to figure something else out and I've got to do it on my own. There's really nobody else who's going to do this for me. There's no prints coming in. There's no magic solution. There's no one pill. So I just started studying, I studied everything I could get my hands on and it began with a weekend course and holistic medicine. And then that became, you know, wanting to be certified in nutrition and that became wanting to learn Chinese medicine.

Speaker 1:          06:22          So I flew to San Francisco and became a licensed acupuncturist and study Chinese herbal medicine. I learned about Iyer Veda, which was a little bit in my roots and got reintroduced to that. And then finally did the integrative medicine fellowship with Dr while which has an Arizona. And so spent two years going through that program and that kind of finally I finished that program, I think it was 2008 that gave me the confidence to put like all these little pieces I had back together in terms of maybe taking care of somebody else. Now, all the information I had gathered up until that point I had fixed myself. It took me a good two years, but I had fixed myself. But then, you know, it was everybody else asking questions like, what'd you do? Well, how did that happen? What was the solution there? You know, what or would you take it?

Speaker 1:          07:01          What do you do acupuncture for this. So all those questions and then finishing the fellowship, that was sort of, you know, the kind of the moment where like, Hey, I might, I might have something here. I might be able, might be able to help a few people. So, so that got me into the world of eastern medicine, integrative medicine, functional medicine, nutrition, all these different fields that you hear about today. But that was my entry into it. Absolutely. No really interesting journey. I think wellness is such a buzzword as everywhere and it's kind of just the new fad. So how do you define wellness and how do you break down some of those stereotypes or misconceptions that are out in the media and you know, in our everyday lives today? Yeah, I feel like wellness is such a, a used term now, right? Everybody's talking about wellness in our vernacular, which I think is great.

Speaker 1:          07:50          I mean, I think it's fantastic that we've shifted from, you know, disease management to wellness. I think that's a huge, huge accomplishment culturally. So that's fantastic. But wellness means different things to different people. Right? And it depends on who you're talking to. I remember him coming from this vantage point in this perspective of having all this different types of training kind of under my belt, including conventional medical training. And so when I sit back and I think about what does wellness mean to me and what does it mean for my patients or from my center or for anyone that I touch, it's really cumulative. It's additive. There's not one factor that defines wellness. And so it's really the accumulation of a number of different things. And I would start with energy, like where's your energy? If you have good energy, your emotional landscape. I mean, I think the further I get along, it's funny.

Speaker 1:          08:36          It's like I know so much chemistry and I know someone's physiology and I'm sure we'll talk about all of that. But the further I get along, it's like I'm understanding how powerful our emotions are, how powerful our sense of connection is. That's a part of wellness too. I think it is chemistry. It's your nutrition, it's your biologies, your physiology, what's your gut doing? Do you have inflammation? It's all of those things as well, and then it is about community and family and support and spirituality. All of those things define wellness when that is the reason I think that so many people send my exam rooms or my offices or talk to me when I'm out and they're like, well, I don't understand. I ate this way. I did this, I did that. Why did I get x, Y, and z? It's because again, it's cumulative, it's additive, and it can feel overwhelming to try to tackle all of that, but unless we start to sit back and understand that it's all influencing each other.

Speaker 1:          09:26          You know, I had an expert tell me recently that a hamburger on vacation is metabolized completely differently than a hamburger when you're stressed out or you might be eating it right now. So, I mean, again, it's like it's so cumulative and so additive and we have to understand how all those pieces come together. And the beauty of eastern systems of medicine is that they stress that from the get go. It wasn't just, you know, take this herb. It was like, well, what's the rest of your life doing? And then trying to understand how to put all that together. I love it. I love it. Um, so you know, obviously western medicine hat then what would be like a hack or something that, you know, um, you know, is a general tip that you could give to some of our viewers or audiences? I know that, you know, our worlds are so crazy, but if you could do one thing today, what would you suggest doing?

Speaker 1:          10:13          Am I god? Besides buying super woman? Right. Well I think the first thing I was stressed, you know, and it's funny cause I think my answer's changed over the years, but I think the very first thing I would stress is the importance of being connected to yourself. I think that's the most important thing you can do to not ignore yourself. I think most people and most women in particular ignore the soft and silent whispers that we here on any given day, they'll ignore the fact that I'm tired more days out of, out of, you know, out of the week, then I'm not, you know, or that something's hurting or that my hair's falling or this joints bothering me or why am I gaining weight or losing weight either direction, you know, um, more so than I ever have in the past. Or Why am I suddenly getting more anxiety or depression?

Speaker 1:          10:55          I think we collectively ignore those things. And I think the most important thing before you start any health or wellness journey is to understand how to get connected back to you. I would say that's the first thing and there's so many different ways to do that. I mean, that's a really big blanket statement, right? But it's everything from just adopt one habit that you could do everyday. Maybe you journal every morning, maybe you pray everyday, maybe you meditate, you know, maybe you go for a walk in nature. You know, but whatever it is, have that conversation with yourself in whatever format you want to because I will bring you back to yourself. So that would be my first kind of foundational starting point. Then we can keep building from there if you want. No, it's great. I mean, you know, Googlers are often high achieving individuals, um, are constantly, you know, plugged in, dealing with many different levels of stress.

Speaker 1:          11:43          So what do you do to unplug or any suggestions for when you feel like you're on that brink of burnout or you feel something coming along, you know, besides getting in touch with yourself, what some things that maybe you like to do? I think, you know, it's so easy to get burned out when you're a high achiever because you want to accomplish a lot. I still want to accomplish a lot. I'm far from done, but you have to watch your energy and you have to watch kind of your boundaries. And I think it's so hard to do because there's always that goal or that next milestone that you're, you're trying to get to, are trying to accomplish. So again, I think one of the things in your schedule, put the breaks in. I think you need to put in breaks throughout the day, especially for you guys, right?

Speaker 1:          12:19          Cause you guys are on technology a lot. And I think that in itself is very draining. We're learning more and more about the effects of that as we get further along. But I think putting those breaks in, I would take three 10 minute breaks throughout your workday. You know, where you are forced to get up, get away from computers, cell phones, iPads, all that other stuff. You know, maybe walk outside the building for just a little bit. Get fresh air. It's amazing how just fresh air and sunlight can shift your energy very quickly. So that's just a quick, easy hack that you can do anywhere. So you know, those three, 10 minute breaks, I would also strongly advise, you know, this is so easy to do too, but really put in your schedule a block, maybe an hour to two hours a week to do something that lowers cortisol.

Speaker 1:          12:57          So that means you know, you're not running necessarily, but you're walking or you're going for a swim or you're doing yoga or maybe you're just a nature for a period of time or go ahead and schedule that massage or acupuncture or something along those lines. Those are ways to recharge because the biggest problem with high achievers, and I'd be so curious to see what everybody a Google test out as in the power type plan. But the biggest problem with high achievers is that they never take time out to de stress. You're in high adrenaline mode all the time. And the problem with high adrenaline is yes you get stuff done, but at some point you're going to crash and burn. And that crash and burn comes as maybe mild symptoms. I'm just tired. It's hard to get to work in the morning to things that are so severe.

Speaker 1:          13:37          Like I can't move I, you know, I'm depressed or things like that. So you never want to get to that place. So putting those natural breaks in, you know, 10 minutes throughout the day, two to three hours a week, you know, where you're doing something that's very different from your job, but you're also doing something that's forcing you to lower cortisol cause that's the hormone that you guys are at the most risk for. And that could be any of the modalities that do that, whether it's walking, doing yoga, swimming, you know, doing acupuncture or doing massage, you know, any of those things that force you to relax. So those are probably my strongest tips for that. Awesome. Love it. And I know you said a really important piece of this wellness journey is knowing yourself. Yes. And you've actually developed a really interesting way to know yourself a little bit more through this idea of power types.

Speaker 1:          14:24          So could you talk to us a little bit about the different power types and how you thought of this whole methodology? Yes, definitely. So again, you know, I have all this different types of training under my belt, eastern medicine, Chinese Ayurvedic Nutrition, you know, and then at the same time I'm doing conventional Western medicine labs. And our office. So I'm looking at hormone levels, I'm looking at nutrient levels, I'm getting real data, you know, to match kind of what I'm seeing with the other diagnostic systems. And one of the things I learned, you know, I've, I continue as I sit with women in particular, even men, there's probably a book for then coming soon. But, but even, but what I've noticed is, again, this, this loss of what to do, they don't have a roadmap, they don't have a plan. And that was the question I get asked over and over again.

Speaker 1:          15:08          Like, you know, it's classic go bring a bag of supplements or they'll bring five books or whatever. Like I don't know what to do, please tell me what to do. And so we're all different, right? We're all unique, we're all individual. But as I was talking to women and I'm about 12,000 women in over the last decade of seeing patients and you listen to them and you're hearing their stories and then you're interpreting data, the pattern started the lineup, you know, and so somebody who have this medical condition and this hormone imbalance was also this ayurvedic type, this Chinese medicine Meridian imbalance, this nutritional deficiency over here. And I could start to see him at a certain point in the practice. And then I started to track them and I started to write them down. And when you start to write them down and track them, then you're like, oh my gosh, there's something here.

Speaker 1:          15:49          We would have this powerful prescriptive formula for empowerment really to help us all feel amazing if we use the tools of both and merge them together and we'd be able to understand, I think this is why I do this. This is why I need to eat this way. So that's how the whole concept of power typing began. So it started with a bunch of spreadsheets. Uh, probably Google spreadsheet is lots of Google spreadsheets and entered a lot of data just to track what, what was happening. And then as I developed the five types of, these are five power types and they each have a distinct way that they need to eat, they need to move their personalities tie into it. Their emotional tendencies tie into that as well. There are know supplements that they might need their hormone imbalances. And so as I develop them, then the next step was to name them.

Speaker 1:          16:32          And so the names, again I've stolen literally from eastern systems of medicine. So the five power types, just to review them real quickly. The first one is the Gypsy girl and the Gypsies. My creative super creative. Some of you may be Gypsies, but have that Vata energy from Ayurvedic Medicine, you know, have that sort of adrenal issue where they're more likely to go into adrenal fatigue, have anxiety, those types of things. So there's a whole set of issues that are both pros and cons that are, that come with being a gypsy. And the second one is the boss lady. And that's your high achiever. That's your go getter. You're commander. The boss lady is amazing. We have a lot of boss ladies we know and apparently there are a lot of boss ladies you know that are very high achieving women in at work, but they're the biggest problem there is an IRS data.

Speaker 1:          17:17          They're more pitta and they hold all their stress and their digestive system. So the first thing to go for a boss lady is usually something with their gut. So Ibs, constipation, reflux, you name it. But then that goes on. And this is where modern science, Intersex, we know that all inflammation today begins in the gut. We know that in science we're seeing that when we do research on the microbiome and all that other good stuff. Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine had already talked about that. So again, if you knew this ahead of time, if you knew you're a boss lady and you know that you're going to hold your stress in your digestive system, that all the more important to be on the right diet for you to protect against inflammation, to protect against those autoimmune diseases and things like that. Uh, the next one is a blend.

Speaker 1:          17:57          And that's what both of us are, we're both savvy chicks and that's a blend of the Gypsy and the boss lady. So part creative part go getter. So at times we're probably lost somewhere in space and at other times we're like, go, go, go. Right. So, so it's the blend, but then you have the medical issues of both in the hormone patterns of both and the nutritional needs of both. Um, I think after that it was the earth Mama and the Earth Mama is the nurture. I will say as the person that's like the center of a home in the center of a family. You guys probably know in Earth, mama around you or, or within your own families. But they are the worst about establishing boundaries and really attending to their own needs. They're usually worried about everybody else and they defined themselves really through everybody else.

Speaker 1:          18:40          But there's a medical consequence to that. And that's what we find with Earth Mamas. They often have issues with insulin resistance, with diabetes, with hypertension, more cardio metabolic type issues. They're the ones the most likely to get depressed because again, they don't have their own like foundation and so forth. So that's the Earth Mama. And then the last one is the Nightingale and the Nightingale is that mission oriented service focused person who just is about a higher calling and a higher cost. But again to the point that they sacrifice themselves. And so they may be your friend that's on mission trips constantly and then it turns around that they're getting like pneumonia and bronchitis and like all these different illnesses over and over again. It typically taxes their immune system, you know, that's the first thing that goes for them. So you know, for them, I've had a lot of Nightingale's and practice as well and it's always reminding them that the mission is important, but the mission is only as good as they are, right?

Speaker 1:          19:36          So they've got to take the time to rebuild their immune system. And again, there's a diet that matches that. Their supplements that match that there's a certain way they should move. They should not be running and doing marathons and all that other stuff when they're in that Nightingale phase. So you know, it's fascinating to help women understand who they are, see them, do the plan, and then see them make changes. And then the other important thing though is as women in particular, at any given time, we may be any one of those power types. We're going to shift. We're hormonal creature, so we're going to shift. We may have a phase of our lives where we're full on boss ladies, right? But then we may switch and have a phase where we're the earth Mama or have a later phase where we're the Nightingale. All of that's irrelevant, right?

Speaker 1:          20:15          It's more important for you just to connect to who you are at any given phase so that you understand how to take care of yourself and that face. There's so many people. When I first came out with this was, well, what's better? Which is the best one? Which is like the best one to be. I'm like, they're all good. Every single one is good. It's just the, the point of this was to understand who you are and really put some thought into, hey, this is who I am and therefore this is my roadmap. And then once you have that roadmap for me, what I really wanted in writing this particular book and the power type formula is I wanted anyone who touched it and picked it up to begin that conversation with themselves to begin to understand themselves. You know, I'm not saying I have all the answers in there for every aspect of their health, but I sure do have a way for them to at least begin that that road and that journey so that you don't waste five or six years.

Speaker 1:          21:06          Like I did like feeling bad about yourself, not like going for it, are doing everything you're supposed to do. You know, you really are just full fledged ahead being the super woman you're supposed to be. I didn't and I firmly believe that. Yeah, I love it. And you got the superwoman title from your daughter, right? Yeah. So this was a fun story. So, you know, we were, I had this concept already in my head of types of women and you know, it was tracking and doing all that other stuff. And I think it was a, we were on a car ride with my daughter. We had just come from an event where a lot of women that come up to me that we know and has been making comments and she was with me and we get in the car and we're driving and she's like, mom you need to write a book for women.

Speaker 1:          21:44          And I'm like, I do. And she's like, yeah, you need to write a book. I go, well what would you write? What would you call it? You know, and she says a old soul, but she's like, you need to write a book called Super Woman Cause you're a super woman. I feel like every woman I meet is all talking about how you're a super woman. So maybe you need to help everybody else be a super woman. Cause I just see you as mom, you know. So anyhow, so she actually came up with a title. I'm like, you're right. That's a really great ideas. So we call the book the Super Women Rx, and I dedicated the book to her because it is her idea and her title. And she helped me actually to with the power type names as well. And she took the test. She was only eight I think when I started the concept.

Speaker 1:          22:23          She was a nine almost 10 when the book was published. But she still goes in and takes the test. I'm like, half these questions aren't relevant to you. She's like, it's okay. I already figured it out. I'm a gypsy is hilarious. She's a cutie. I love it. I love it. So we're at Google, right? We're all about technology and the digital world. How do you think about digital technology and how it integrates with medicine today? Or even the things that you do on a daily basis or your practice or how you help women? How much time do you have? Well, no, so you know, I am the biggest technological idiot you've ever met in your life. So my tech support when I was like 21 was my nine year old sister. So I never thought I'd have to spend as much time thinking about technology, but it is a reality of today and it has absolutely impacted our business, is impacted the practice as impacting patient care quite honestly.

Speaker 1:          23:17          So technology is a must and I have forcefully had to immerse myself in that world and try to understand, you know, how this piece of of the equation fits in into what I'm doing. And here's what I think. I think that technology is amazing. We need technology to track that, to track our data, to track our numbers, to help remind us of habits and behaviors and to help with resources. We absolutely need technology for that. And I think one of the limitations that even I'm experiencing with this type of medicine that we're doing is, uh, you know, there's not a central place to get this information right. It's not coming out. So a lot of it is having to come out of my mouth or something that I write. It would be amazing to have this stuff available in real time for women, so they understand, okay, I just told you you're a gypsy girl.

Speaker 1:          24:03          And they'll go figure out your, all the other resources you need, you know, and we continually updated. So I know that there's a need for that type of technology that is resourceful data tracking, motivating, educational. There's that from a practice standpoint, what we have noticed, and we're actually developing our own platform because it's such an issue, is that to do the medicine that I'm doing, there's not the technology out there. So it slows me down from a practice standpoint and it prevents my growth. So for medicine to really move forward, we've got to have systems that integrate all the information, right, that put all the information together, you know, and, and really help patients with the full picture of their health. I, I define wellness for you earlier. Well that technology needs to match that definition, you know, and it needs to be able to show people this is the cumulative additive properties of your health, this is what your wellness looks like.

Speaker 1:          24:53          And it's taking all of that into account. And then from a operational standpoint, with the practice and with the, with the business, it needs to mirror that as well. Right? So that's where we are. We're trying to develop a platform so that we can then take this medicine, make it more efficient, make it scalable, and then allow it to grow beyond just Atlanta, the few centers that we have in Atlanta and be able to grow beyond so that women everywhere it can have access to it. And then same thing with, you know, the super women theory. We want technology there so that women can continue to grow in that process of having that conversation with themselves and understanding who they are. Because, you know, I love the books, I love writing, but not that many people read anymore. Right? They want like, they want quicker information, they want to download it faster.

Speaker 1:          25:37          So the book is a great foundational step, but the next step is probably technology slowly. Super interesting. And I know you mentioned this idea of expansion. So what's next for you for the center? What are you most excited about in the next six to 12 months? Maybe in your personal life at centers space, but also in the medical world, what excites you and gets you out of bed every morning? Oh my gosh. Um, there's so much. I think that in the medical world it's fascinating to continue to watch the intersection of genetics, new food and nutrition and all these other data points that we've been talking about for years. How they intersect and are really redefining what prevention is and redefining what healthy is. You know, so the conventional world needs some time to catch up. But what's super exciting is seeing the integrator worlds and the functional medicine world really start to gain their spot.

Speaker 1:          26:29          You know, it really start to come into the forefront and lead some of these conversations on what prevention really means. What does healthy really mean, you know? And that for the longest time there was just a one line or flat definition of that. I think the other thing that me out of bed in the morning, just from a medical standpoint is I'm a huge believer and family wellness. I've lived in a situation where the family was not well and the center of that family all was the woman, you know? So that's why I decided to start with women. You know, because when the woman is not healthy, it reverberates out into her children, her husband, her extended family, her community, her, you know, her city. And so I think it's so important to shift culture. We have to create strong families and we have to create really unified, healthy families.

Speaker 1:          27:14          And it starts with a woman. So what gets me excited, and the challenge quite honestly, is understanding that when it comes to women's health, there are miles and miles and miles of work to do journeys to travel. Because we historically have gas lit, women's health issues, women's health issues were always brushed to the side because it was a male dominated field when western medicine was born. So to really change what's happening within a family, I've got to change what's happening with women, right? And if I can change what's happening with women than I can turn around an impact that family. So that's what gets me out of bed in the morning is knowing that that's sort of the framework from which I'm functioning and I love it. And to this day, there's not a day that I walk into my practice and I don't learn something or I speak and I don't learn something from somebody I meet.

Speaker 1:          27:58          And it's just such a fascinating journey as far as the practice goes. And as far as I go, I mean we're just going to continue to grow and scale and expand. We're trying to again, use technology to make this old way of doing things better and more efficient. Right? Cause we're now in a culture that, you know, we can't sit and talk for two hours about something. So how do we create, this takes the old system of medicine integrated with the newer modern medicine, but then it's at the same time preserve the character of the flavor but also make it efficient and run the way it's supposed to run. So that's our challenge. So that keeps me going in the center and technology is a big part of that conversation. So six to 12 months from now, I hope that we have our technology rad.

Speaker 1:          28:40          I hope that we are opening in launching maybe here in New York and La and other places around the country. And as far as I go, I hope I continue to do the work that needs to be done to get this message out louder and louder. Well that's amazing. What a great mission and we're here to help and support. Um, so we'll open up the floor for questions. You know, as you're, as you're talking, it makes me think a lot about the obesity epidemic in this country. Um, and how, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, where does that all connect in here and how do you think about bringing that to folks who probably need it? That's such a great word than maybe some of us or some others. Definitely. I mean, I think the obesity epidemic has happened for a number of different reasons.

Speaker 1:          29:30          Probably the number one reason is honestly our food sourcing and the production of our food. The more and more we dig into obesity, we're understanding that a lot of what was used over the last 30 40 years between additives and fillers and preservatives and things like that have been hormone disruptors and have contributed to that conversation. So when it comes to obesity, again, if we can educate a family on the right way to eat in a way that's not, you know, everyone has a sort of preconceived notion that eating healthy is expensive, right? So if we can help families learn to navigate that terrain so they understand how to make healthy choices. And again, it usually starts with a woman, right? Because the woman's doing the cooking, the shopping, the buying. So the more empowered you can make the woman of the family, typically it'll go out into the, into the children and into the other adults with the family to help with the obesity crisis.

Speaker 1:          30:19          Um, we just are also a culture of over consumption, quite honestly. You know, we're eating way more than we need to eat and that goes to our children and it goes to us as adults as well. So helping people understand what normal consumption is, I think is a big part of it. And that's where the whole conversation on food waste also comes up, right? Because we waste so much food too. So the obesity conversation, I know there's been a huge spotlight with movement and activity. Uh, I'm going to push back on that and say it's honestly 80% food and it's only 20% activity. And I think that's where maybe we have the conversation wrong to a certain extent. You know, I do also think that technology is an issue for obesity in the future. You know, how are we going to take this tool, this amazing tool that we have of being connected to anyone anywhere in the world and get information at any given moment, but at the same time create some boundaries and parameters so that people are using it in a way that is productive and proactive and not working against them.

Speaker 1:          31:15          So the biggest thing I've seen in pediatrics, you know, which is another, it's another one of my medical love so to speak, but is that children don't have the boundaries to navigate technology. And adults don't have the education to help them navigate those boundaries. And again, as much as I know I've had, I've struggled with that with my two children, you know, and what's, what's normal, what's not normal, what's, okay. So I think technology, I think food first. I think our food is the biggest problem. I think, uh, looking at technology and looking at how children are trapped in rooms, a lot of the times they're not outside. I think the overscheduling of families as an issue too. I mean, all of these things are factors that play into obesity for sure. And then, you know, when it comes to different socioeconomic groups, you know, helping them with food deserts in areas that aren't getting high quality food.

Speaker 1:          32:04          I mean, there's so many. I could talk forever on this and I'll probably need to stop, but, but, um, but there's so many great studies, like if you give a young child any socioeconomic status, if you give them salads and healthy vegetables and all that other stuff, they will continue to choose that. But the minute you introduce like a high salt, high fat food, their palate changes. You know? And when they did a study comparing lower socioeconomic kids and their parents and giving them food choices, the kids actually chose the healthier foods. The parents had been so acclimated to a certain tastes that they chose the the junky or foods, you know, so a lot of how it training is happening, you know, there's a lot that needs to take place there. So I think it's education. Again, I think it's change, it's got to be changed in our industry and our food processing and then creating environments where children can thrive and adults can thrive as well.

Speaker 1:          32:54          That's super interesting. Yeah. What's your view on sugar? That's another hot topic. So sugar is probably maybe the number one culprit and he had to as sugar and salt. I think those are the two things and and all the different forms of it, right? Yeah. High Fructose Corn Syrup, you know, all the different sweeteners and fillers and Splenda and all that other stuff is probably the number one thing there is sugar and everything. So sugar is probably one of the biggest culprits for the obesity crisis, I think. And when you go back and look at food manufacturing and you look at what changed, there are a couple of things that changed, you know, 30 to 40 years ago, the amount of sugar and sweet nurses, one of them, the amount of additives and salt is another. The third is the use of a certain pesticides and chemicals in our food manufacturing.

Speaker 1:          33:38          Those are probably your three biggest changes, you know? And I, you know, I go into a grocery store and sometimes I'm like, I don't, should I get organic? Should I not get organic? Should I get this tape set? What are your tips? Or what do you do when you go food shopping? So what we do, I mean we're majority organic, but I know that that's hard to sustain and it's hard to maintain, but I think it's again, the dirtiest foods, right? The dirty dozen. And that's on the EWG, the environmental working group's list. If you want to familiarize yourself, those are worth buying organic. But here's the challenge. You know, even even people that are eating organic and buying organic, there's so much cross contamination that you're still getting exposed to different chemicals, different pesticides, different things. So again, that's why being proactive and being in the sort of integrative, functional space I think is so critical because it's hard to control your environment even when you're being so conscious and so careful and so deliberate about your choices.

Speaker 1:          34:32          Sometimes it's very difficult just to control the environment and our needs are different than what they were. We had an infectious disease problem maybe 50 years ago, you know, we had, we had different medical issues. The medical issues of tomorrow are going to be environmentally induced. They're going to be toxicity issues, you know, they're going to be diseases of inflammation. Those are the diseases of today and tomorrow. That's why cancer's on the rise. That's why autoimmune diseases on the rise, so it's just so hard to navigate the space that I think that the more you know what your body chemistry is doing and you're being as proactive as you can to support it, you're going to have a better, better sort of outcome. All the way through. Yeah. Oh absolutely. Super, super interesting. I think we had a question. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.

Speaker 1:          35:19          I read the book and loved it and what I really would love to say, you made it so accessible for someone who doesn't have a medical background. And I would love to hear any tips or recommendations you have given. There's just so much information out there on health and wellness and medicine and you even mentioned with, you know, being a doctor, having the medical background, being disconnected from some of that. So any recommendations you have, just like navigating the noise and knowing what's a credible source and where we should spend our time. Definitely. I mean, I think that's probably the hardest part, right? So it was trying to find the information that you can rely on. I think your first step is to find a medical provider that you can have these conversations with. Quite honestly, you know, I think there are a lot, there's a lot of noise in the wellness space, you know?

Speaker 1:          36:03          So again, turning at that, I'm trying to, you know, uh, toot our own horns, but turning to the integrative and functional community where there's so many great providers coming along and they have worked really hard at getting the conventional training, but also getting the training on the other side, so to speak, and understanding how were those worlds intersect. I think that's probably your most efficient way of going about it. Because after that, if you're trying to navigate like, well, I read this article over here and it said to take those, and I did this over here and it said to take that, it's really difficult. It's why I wrote the Super Women Rx, honestly, because I'm over, they're not integrative and functional medicine providers everywhere, but at least that's a start, you know, like at least if you can understand, and even in the book, remember their labs for you to check, you know, there, there's all that information for you to advocate for yourself.

Speaker 1:          36:50          You know when you walk into the doctor's office. But I still firmly believe and you know as many different types of providers as there are in the health and wellness space, I still really believe that the physician has to sit at that table and it has to help direct those decisions because the physician ultimately has the breadth and depth of understanding of how one decision will play into another and what sort of all of that relationship is. So I think finding a strong provider who can help you navigate information will be helpful. And then once you get the main ideas, this is you, you understand, you then do your digging and your research and, and anything else you want to do and read other books to gain inflammation under that main idea. You know, it's almost like writing a chapter, right? And like come out with that main thesis about yourself.

Speaker 1:          37:32          And then underneath that you can develop things out more. Cause you may then find things at that particular provider or doctor didn't know. And that's okay. You know, it's just digging deeper. But the confusion comes when you know, well, do I need to eat for my adrenals or do I need to eat for insulin or do I need to like a Paleo or Vegan or gluten free? You know, that's where the confusion starts and gets so frustrating to navigate. Yeah. Great question. Yes. Um, this is kind of following up to that, but I think you're in the unique position of having both western and eastern medical background and training. What do you see as the future of sort of scaling these eastern medical practices across western medicine across the country when so many people are, it's not widely accepted as you said, and it's kind of, it might not be as easy for, it might not be easy for everyone or as accessible to find someone who's trained in both eastern and medical.

Speaker 1:          38:20          And if someone isn't sure where to start with their own, like eastern medical research and how to apply it to Western, like what do you see as the future of the best way to go about it? That they're the future of the industry for asking about that. First of merging eastern and Western medicine is passion. I've really feel like it's my purpose. Like how do we, how do we get this out there? How do we get it in the hands of more people? And there are different ways to do that and there are different ways to bring it into medicine and change the medical model. So there are many of us, I'm not the only one, but there are many of us who want to change the medical model and want to see it like more accessible to more folks, you know? So I think that is a definite goal.

Speaker 1:          38:57          And something that you asked me earlier, what gets me out of bed in the morning. I mean, I think that's something that sort of motivates me for you, that it's worthless, right? Because you're like a great, great, you're going to, you're going to work on this for the next 20 years. So, um, meanwhile I have to live the next 20 years. So for, so for you, you know, I think it's again put pooling together as many different resources from the two systems or finding providers like me. There are others like me that you know, do, do console, sometimes you don't have to be necessarily here in the city, they're remote or things like that that help provide you at least foundational framework for doing that. And again, you know the book, the intention of the book was to do that for you to help you begin that conversation.

Speaker 1:          39:34          And then again underneath that, you know, once you understand who you are and what your needs are, go ahead and get the opinions from a Chinese medicine practitioner if from an ayurvedic practitioner, from your doctor and merge that information together. But ultimately you want to find someone to guide you through that process because it can get very overwhelming and confusing to get information from so many different places. So I think it's, you know, read, read the book and see if that helps you. I would say, you know, try to find a practitioner that is well versed in both to give you some guidance and direction and then begin your journey of exploring different aspects of your health so that you can, you can start to put some of that information together for you. Hi, thank you so much for being here. Um, I had a quick question about how you approach the conversation with older generations.

Speaker 1:          40:18          I think with parents and grandparents, sometimes it can be harder to have these types of conversations and the education background and they're not as, um, I guess open to changing habits or lifestyle. Have you had older clients or can talk through experiences where you've approached it with parents or grandparents, um, that have been successful or any tips for that? Yeah, what a great gosh, and I've experienced this one personally for sure. We do have older patients that come to the practice, but they're are typically more engaged, right? They've already like done a little bit of digging and research or they're a little bit more open now and within our own family, you know, my dad doesn't listen to anything I say. Um, he'll say, okay sweetheart, I'll do that. And I'm sure he doesn't do any of it. So they're tougher because they come from the generation of the doctor was right.

Speaker 1:          41:06          I'm going to do what the doctor said and Pharmas best. That's their generation, right? So they believe in their medicine is transactional. You know, you go to the doctor, you get a script in your hand, that visit is now complete. If you did not get a script in your hand, there was no point to the visit. So that's the generation that they came from. So it's much more challenging. So the best way to start is two or three things I've noticed. Like, hey, why don't you just try doing these two things and not give them too much information? I've actually seen the reverse where it's like somebody our age or younger, they want the information, they want to understand how everything connects. They want to be empowered in an advocate. The older generation doesn't want all that they don't under, they don't care about the connection and the big words like inflammation and oxidative stress, they're not interested in any of that.

Speaker 1:          41:50          All they want to know is almost that same transactional language. You know, your joints hurt, tried this, and then you give them two things to do and then you follow back up maybe after give them two weeks and see if after two weeks they were able to put those two things into effect. You know? So I would think, you know, transactional is the only word that comes to my mind. But simple commands, you know, this hurts, do this, that's not working. Try this, do those. I've noticed that anytime I sit with my mother in law and my mom or my dad, any of them, and they're all so different in their personalities, but essentially the conversation always goes the same way. Anytime I try to connect the dots, put the pieces of their health together, explain all of this, I lose them. You know? So don't do that.

Speaker 1:          42:33          Just to just be very simple and be very direct and see if they feel better. And oftentimes we'll get results and then that motivates them to move on to step two or step three. I'd try that. Come in for you grandma. Have crowd. Yeah, go for it. I have a question on, uh, technology again. Um, so there are like so many apps now to like can track your steps or your workouts or calories or a turndown you're the blue light on your screen after a certain time, right? There's all these friends writings. So I guess do you have any advice to new people in this room who may be designing apps like to use? Um, or for the rest of us who we use all of these things like, um, how to navigate it, how to design better, you know, how to incorporate like a holistic thing because I think it right now it gives like almost a false sense of connection role.

Speaker 1:          43:25          Yeah. Like, oh well, like my phone told me to stand up today, so like I'm great. Like I'm dying on the fitness journey. That's such a great question. And I have seen that, you know, people rely on their data. I, they come in the room and they were like, well let me show you. I know I'm getting rem sleep cause my sleep tracker set up getting rem sleep. I'm like, why is your sleep tracker in your room? But anyway, but you know, I see that all the time. It does. It's, it's good and bad. It's not all, it's not all either direction. It's good because you're getting data, you're getting information, you're getting sort of an initial look at what you're doing, you know? But it's bad because it's not the whole picture. Right. That's the bad part. So I think anyone who's designing anytime they can design, and I challenge myself with those two, anytime you can design to where you're trying to bring in the whole picture in some form or fashion, if you're designing a sleep tracker, well maybe ask a few more questions around sleep.

Speaker 1:          44:12          You know, just because they checked off on they got this many hours of rem sleep does not necessarily mean that they're healthy or that all that sleep quality was good. You know? So maybe you know, working with somebody who has sort of this well rounded approach who can bring more of the whole picture into any of these and then take p taking some of these folks were using data and using apps through workflows that if this is happening, then you may want to consider this, this and this. Not Turning into a doctor's office necessarily, but hey, have a conversation with your doctor. You might want to get your labs checked, you know, or you may need to eat, drink more water, you know, whatever it is. But having that more well rounded approach where rather than just fixating on one or two day data points is going to help the patient on the other end of that be more successful in the long run.

Speaker 1:          44:56          Yeah. So I don't know if that was helpful. No, it is interesting because there are so many dare so many right now. Just because you hit your stacks doesn't mean that you're healthy. It's a great way to check in with yourself, but it's not accomplishing like, who am I? What are my main needs? You know, what do I need to build under that main idea? And I know you went over it in the book, but you know, if I was going to go get a blood test tomorrow, what would be the two or three top you know, signals that I should be looking for. So I mean I can answer that very easily. I think the number one thing we're not checking for routinely, which every doctor should be checking every patient for our inflammation markers. They're easy to do. They're covered by insurance, but checking like a CRP, Esr, which is a set rate, uh, look into homocysteine.

Speaker 1:          45:44          Those three things you should be doing every six months. Cause to me those are the earliest warnings that something is wrong with your body and something's not quite right. And then the investigative work can come after that. So that's one for women, I think it's so critical to look at your hormone levels. I talk about this all throughout the book looking at estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, the derivatives of those hormones because then it tells us what your body's doing with them and you want to do them periodically. Cause you want to track it. Speaking of data, you know you want to be able to track it because it was normal for you is not normal for me. So you know, you might feel really good at a Tsh of two but I feel good at a Tsh of one. You know, so when five years from now you have a baby or something happens in your Tsa shifts and you're quote unquote normal by the conventional range but you feel like crap, then we can go look back and say, oh no, no, no, that's not where your TSH needs to be for you. So I think, you know, tracking this data, tracking these labs, that's the beauty of technology is tracking it over the course of your lifespan and knowing where you felt great, where you didn't feel so good. And it also helps you later when you guys enter sort of the anti aging or kind of the more prevention conversation because then we know where to correct you back too as well, you know? Totally. I love it. Well thank you so much. You are coming. I know. We're all really excited. So given them

Speaker 2:          46:59          [inaudible].
