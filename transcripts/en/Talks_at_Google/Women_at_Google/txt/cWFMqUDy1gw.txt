Speaker 1:          00:00:16       Thank you. Thank you. No, thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Well, Secretary Clinton, welcome back to Google. It's great to be here. Eric, thank you. Grown a little bit since I've been here. Last

Speaker 3:          00:00:36       just a little, are you talking about my weight? I knew I gained some pounds here. No, the company is much larger and even more successful. And thank you for your first visit. We're here to talk about your book, um, which you know, I've actually read. Thank you. I did want to present you, I did want to present you with my book and I won. It's entitled how Google Works and I want you to notice something that's different between your book and my book. Now your book, your book is 600 pages in very, uh, lots of, lots of words. My book is 37 pages and it uses big type and my book has black and white photos and yours has color photos. So on a pound for pound basis, my book is more valuable.

Speaker 2:          00:01:24       Well, but there are many things you can do with my book that you can't do with this book such as well you can work out. So you know, you can work out with my book, you can work out with your boss, a lovely and, and if you get two copies you'll be balanced while you're working out. You can use it as a doorstop. This would just wipe under the door. Imagine using that as a doorstop. So I don't know. I think it's kind of

Speaker 3:          00:01:47       a Justin draw, don't you think? Well at some point we're going to be talking about book, but I want you to notice that my book, my book is so short, you can read it during this interview.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       Well I have to say there is a particularly attractive picture of you on page 31 wearing some kind of ridiculous hat, um, with some model of an airplane and a picture of Bill Gates in the back. Let's get to work.

Speaker 3:          00:02:16       So Secretary Clinton, your book is entitled hard choices. And what we're going to do is when I have some questions, Jimmy, we have some dory questions that is submitted from the audience and we have some live questions as well. And, um, the first one is want to ask you is that you and I had a very dear friend, Richard Holbrook who died unexpectedly of a heart attack and you had appointed him to do the negotiation and Afghanistan. Do you think that his death affected the outcome and Afghanistan as a brilliant negotiator? Did we miss him that much? Did we end up in roughly the right place in Afghanistan at the end of it all?

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       There's two parts to that question. Let me address. Um, our friend Richard Holbrooke. First he was in my view, uh, the premier diplomat of our generation. He was dramatic when called for, he was persistent, he was tough minded, but he believed passionately that you couldn't end a war if you didn't talk to the people on the other side. Now that may sound simplistic, but indeed, that's a huge obstacle for many in diplomacy, politics, governments to get over. How do you end a war? Uh, if you talk to the people you despise, who you view as the troublemakers, the instigators and Richard came at a, the assignment I asked him to take on behalf of the president and myself, uh, with that strong conviction born out of as many years of experience. And in particular his ending of the wars in the Balkans. When my husband was president, he spent a lot of time with Milosevic, a most unsavory character.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       He drank with him. He yelled at him, he bullied him, he listened to him and eventually was able to get to the date and peace accords, which ended the war even though it didn't end all of the political and ethnic and other problems that are unfortunately, I'm still prevalent. When I asked him to take on the task in Afghanistan and Pakistan, he went at it with his same level of commitment, even relish. Uh, and as I write in the book, we were beginning a process of, uh, reaching out to and responding to outreach from the Taliban. And I gave a speech that tried to make the case that that might be distasteful. It certainly was to me for many reasons as to how they treat people in general and women in particular. But there had to be a political negotiation in order to try to end the conflict.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       And literally the day he died, uh, in, uh, was he ha he suffered a terrible, um, attack in my office. We were talking about the first meeting that we had engineered between a, an American diplomat, one of Richard's lieutenants, uh, and, uh, a representative of Moolah Omar. I guess the short answer, Eric, is that Richard would never take no for an answer. We had a lot of difficulties both with President Karzai because he didn't want us talking to the Taliban and we had problems with the Taliban because they didn't want to talk to President Karzai. So we were playing a kind of multilevel chess game and trying to move the parties closer to talking to each other. Uh, and unfortunately, uh, with Richard's death, we kept up the initiative, but we didn't have that same overpowering presence that he brought to it now where we are with Afghanistan and Pakistan because we looked at them, uh, very much as presenting similar challenges, uh, to a lasting, uh, and to threats first of all to the region.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       And even beyond, uh, is, uh, a, an election that was held, uh, that has been criticized for irregularities that now finally, and I give an secretary Kerry credit for going there, there's no substitute for going to these places and staying and trying to engineer some kind of solution that there will now be a total audit of all the votes in Afghanistan to determine who the next president is. And things are kind of on hold until we know that. Uh, what I think of as the three biggest challenges is number one, getting a new president in who could keep Afghanistan unified. Uh, despite all of the problems that many of us had with President Karzai, that was his primary goal, to try to keep the country unified and not fly off, uh, in different ethnic directions. Um, and we need to support whoever that next president is and do our best to give him the authority that he needs to try to keep the country unified.

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       Secondly, continuing to work with the Afghan security forces, uh, they have proven to be much more dependable, effective, uh, fighters, uh, taking the fight to the Taliban because the Taliban is very clear that they intend to reoccupied territory. They lost to a coalition troops in the last several years following the surge that President Obama ordered a, so continuing to work and support the Afghan security forces and then finally being well aware that so many of the problems in Afghanistan are incubated in Pakistan and the Pakistani government is now facing some of the most serious threats that it historically has. Because as I say in the book, they had an idea that was never going to be workable for the longterm, which is you can keep poisonous snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors. And the Pakistani military and intelligence establishment have unfortunately over years, uh, worked with supported, uh, lots of the terrorist groups, extremist groups for their own purposes, some of which was to keep Afghanistan, uh, kind of off kilter.

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       So there has to be a lot of, uh, effort made to work with the Pakistanis, as difficult as that is. And that's something that I spent some time on in the book because I worked very hard to try to have as I'm effective, a relationship as we could. But at the end of the day, the Pakistanis have to stand up to the threat from within, which is also a threat to, uh, Afghanistan. And by the way, a continuing threat to India. So it's a, we've made progress, but not nearly enough. I was in fact seen a little bit after you were an I sounded incredibly confusing to figure out is that while I was there, the President I met with was

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       gotten rid of by the supreme court over something involving financial and this child and his child. Um, in the book you spent a fair amount of time on, I think one of the significant foreign policy achievements during your tenure involving the pivot to Asia. Right? And when I lay it out, right, we've got the Pec San problems. You were the first person to really open up Burma, Myanmar met with an sung g, g, et cetera. Um, but you start looking at like the is an example of the, that the Spratly islands and this line called line nine, nine, I in Japan and the others, it's getting more confusing to an outsider. You talk about the pivot. Do you think that we understand how to navigate now between these, each of these countries is becoming more nationalistic as it becomes stronger?

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       Right. Well, that is a trend that, um, uh, I saw really beginning to take off and it has a number of implications both for the region, uh, but also for us and the rest of the world. Um, as China has gotten much more economically powerful, it's understandable that they, um, want to project their power, uh, but it's, uh, quite a threatening to the rest of the region. And what I saw as a, uh, a growing threat was the increasing a budgetary resources going to the People's Liberation Army, uh, to build up their naval capacity so that they could project power, uh, on the seas. Now the United States, uh, primarily has kept the peace, uh, in, uh, Asia on in navigable waters, uh, for the protection of commerce. And our navy has been a very positive force, but it's clear to me that the Chinese intend to challenge a American naval superiority.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       That's their perfect right to do. So. There they are a sovereign country. They get to make those decisions. But the problems that Eric alluded to are having a rebound effect around the region so that if you see China developing its first aircraft carrier with plans for a number of more carriers, and you see China being quite aggressive on territorial claims, not that they're willing to arbitrate those claims, but they're merely asserting them against the Philippines and Vietnam and Japan primarily. Now, um, and you see that this could lead to increasing tension and maybe even conflict in the region. Then we have, uh, an opportunity but also a responsibility to work closely with number one, our allies because we have neutral defense treaties with five nations in the region. Obviously Japan and South Korea and the Philippines, Australia, but also Thailand. So we our treaty bound to work with and if necessary, protect our allies.

Speaker 2:          00:12:02       Nobody wants to see any kind of conflict that erupts. Uh, but when you look at what's happening between China and Vietnam and China and Japan and China and the Philippines, this is going to take some very careful management. And so it's takes a combination of America continuing to assert itself as a Pacific power but intensive diplomacy to try to send the message to China. Why would you want to disrupt 40% of global trade? Why would you want to skirt the edges of potential conflict? And you see what it's happening in Japan. Japan is getting much more nationalistic and aggressive in response to that. So this is going to be a primary obligation and area of concern for the United States going forward. It's very important that China is ultimately does not become China. And the people who are opposed to China, yes, you could set up for another hundred years, some sort of, uh, uh, of a, of a real contest.

Speaker 2:          00:13:05       Well, you know, one of the things, and I, and I write about this because I became aware, you know, China had, when I became secretary of state to issues that they repeatedly stressed as their core interests, Tibet and Taiwan. I mean, that was every time you met with a Chinese official what you would hear in addition to everything else. And you know, they were confused. Um, by our support for the Tibetans are openness to the Dalai Lama. I had a, uh, a really vigorous disagreement with Jiang men who was present at the end of the nineties over Tibet because I kept saying, China's a great country. I mean, you're growing at 10 plus percent at though in those years. Why are you so obsessed with Tibet? And he said, why are you so obsessed with Tibet? And we had this big back and forth, and I said, my goodness, somebody meets with the Dalai Lama and you want to write them out of the, you know, the global order practically.

Speaker 2:          00:14:02       But it's very deeply felt by the Chinese and on Taiwan, obviously, you all know starting in 2010 I'm in one of these very long meetings that are made longer because you have to have consecutive translation in many of them. Some of you have done business on behalf of Google in China, you know that. And all of a sudden it was Tibet, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. And I just sat up straight and I thought, what do you mean the South China Sea? So I began to engage with my counterparts. I heard you mentioned the south China Sea. What did you mean? Oh, what? Well, what we meant was of course that we claim the south China Sea. I said all of it. I mean, this enormous body of water. Absolutely it is China's. And then, you know, they began telling me why it was China as they found pottery shards on this or this a toll or this rocky reef that went back to the Ming Dynasty, therefore was China.

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       I said, really? Now let me, let me say this, the United States. And I asked him, I actually had a map drawn up where the United States claimed the entire Pacific. And I said, look, you know, you are our ally, but you couldn't have beaten the Japanese back and, and you couldn't have had the kind of economic rise without American power. And we have, you know, we have camp old cans of food everywhere. You may have pottery shards, but we've left our debris too. And so we're claiming the entire Pacific. I said, this is an absurd argument. Oh No. Very serious. And not only that, we're climbing the east China Sea and we're going after this and Kakuma, which the Japanese have a claimed that we're going after the territorial waters of Vietnam because obviously they want to drill to see what might be off their coast. This was a very well thought out introduction of a third core interest. And therefore we have to take it very seriously. And what I've argued, and I made this very clear to our Chinese friends, the United States doesn't take positions on these islands and who should govern them or who they belong to, but where there are disputes, we have dispute resolution mechanisms that China as a great nation should be part of taking advantage of. And so this is going to be an ongoing debate between us and within the region. So

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       is it to show you how good this book is, there's a lengthy conversation about the origins of this and um, the secretary talks about the original hide and bide strategy that a Dung Dung Dung chicken had and how much has changed. Do you also spend a fair amount of time talking about a genuine hero in the world, uh, Ang century cheap, right? And you describe her as there was a quiet dignity about her, the coiled intensity of a vibrant mind inside of a long imprisoned to body, right? They sort of glimpses of the way you started, I found absolutely fascinating. I'd like to move to an area where you know, you, you say hard choices. I personally see no choices and that's Syria and you're famously known for having been, or at least allegedly being in favor of earlier intervention. And I just want to review where we are now.

Speaker 3:          00:17:23       Um, 170,000 deaths, a 11 and a half million internally dislocated people, 3 million refugees, one out of six people in Lebanon, one out of five people in Jordan are now refugees. Imagine if that happened from Canada and Mexico to the United States. The impact on the economy. Uh, and if that's not bad enough, it's the biggest humanitarian conflict in the world today. There's obvious groups to support fi it's a proxy war involving Russia, Iran, Syria, et cetera. And now the latest is of course this isis group, which should manage to get to some number of miles to Baghdad. Um, it's not, not clear what to do, you know, do you do a no fly zone? Well, who do you protect, right? If you're an arm, somebody who are going to arm. When you think about it, had we followed what you wanted to do, what would we have done and what should we do now or what can we do now? You talk about this in the book, but obviously you don't talk about the current isis situation. It's uh, it's, I think it's the biggest current problem in the world in terms of just mass death and problems.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       Well, Eric, I label that, um, chapter a wicked problem, uh, which is, uh, yeah, futurist concept, uh, because there really weren't any, uh, clear, uh, decisions with a straight line to consequences. Even if you made account for unintended consequences, it was always going to be a hard choice. What I argued back at the beginning of the conflict was that in, uh, looking at Assad's crackdown and his alliances with Iran, uh, Russia and Iran is proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon. There would be a very serious, uh, issue. Uh, somebody needs some help back there. Can we, can we help? How about some water? There's somebody pass out. Yeah. Okay. I think we're fine. We got somebody back there to help. Okay, let's, let's continue. Okay. Um, if you looked at the, the, um, level of violence that Assad was willing to use and I was pretty sure from the beginning he would do whatever it took to beat back the demonstrators and to hold on to territory.

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       His father had done it before him. Some of you might recall, um, in leveling the city of Hama, which had been a hotbed of opposition and a particular home for Muslim Brotherhood opponents to the prior regime. So I had no doubt, in fact, one of the stories I tell in the book, I asked the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, so Al Faisal, who had been in that position for many years, um, whether he thought there was any way to change the calculation of a Assad and have him either, uh, began to tamp down the violence or look for a political settlement and no sewed, said no because his mother would never let him. Uh, and that I thought was very telling that there was this family obligation in forced by his mother who would say to him every day, here's what your father would have done. So given that lineup of character's history in the, like, I believe that if we had gone in to identify and properly vet members of the original opposition, which were not al Qaeda, we're not isis, they may have been a pharmacists or doctors or lawyers or students before the opposition, a rose up against Assad's brutal crackdown that we would get to know who the likely hard men on the other side were.

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       And perhaps we could help to build from that a viable opposition force that could hold ground against Assad. And at the same time, uh, be the anchor for developing a more effective political arm. You know, I could sit here today and say I was right, but I can't say that because we don't know what would have happened had we followed that particular approach. There were very good arguments on the other side. But what I know now is that what I worried about has happened that Assad has not moderated his behavior. The only good thing that has come out of the last two years is the removal of at least the known stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, which I do think was a, an important, uh, accomplishment. But we know that territory is being taken by extremist groups. Isis being the most audacious, uh, with their claim of a caliphate that crosses the border between Syria and Iraq.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       And I think we have a pretty good idea what that would mean, what that would mean for the region, uh, where you could possibly have a very extreme, uh, organized territory. Uh, that was a safe haven and a launching ground. We saw this in Afghanistan. I mean, that's what happened in the border areas when al Qaeda decided to ally itself with the Taliban and set up shop there. And it doesn't necessarily mean just misery for Sunni's, uh, who are not of their extreme nature and others within Iraq. And the same within Syria. It can lead to problems in Europe where we think at least 2000, uh, Europeans, uh, with passports have gone to fight, uh, with extremist groups. And it certainly can mean a more threats to us. So what to do now? I think part of what we have to do is, uh, what we're trying to do and that is to restabilize Iraq.

Speaker 2:          00:23:36       And the reason it's so difficult is that Prime Minister Maliki basically reneged on every commitment he made to the United States as well as his own people. Uh, when, uh, he was legitimately elected, um, he was able to form a government the first time he was just reelected. And the problem is that he began governing in an exclusive sectarian way, cutting the Sunni's out of power, refusing to pay the Sunni fighters that the United States had recruited to get rid of al Qaeda in Iraq, which was one of our major achievements on behalf of the Rockies before we left. And refusing to have a fair deal over oil revenues with the Kurds, the Kurds, and a lot of the Sunni tribal leaders are basically of the mind that you can't trust Maliki. You can't, uh, work with him and we're not going to support him as he tries to take back territory.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       So it's a political negotiation that we and others are engaged in because unless you can get the local Sunni leaders once again to throw their lot in on behalf of a unified Iraq, you cannot drive isis out of Mosul and other places that it has seized. This is very dangerous. Well, they're, they're, they're very dangerous. There kind of a, a, a follow on to the original al Qaeda, but not as, um, uh, based in, uh, the leadership of a bin Ladin Ans hour hearing. It's now younger people, they're more violent, they're more aggressive. They're trying to do what has been the dream of, uh, extremist Sunni's, uh, caught up in terrorism, uh, for a number of years now. And that is to establish, or in their mind, reestablish Kayla, uh, Kayla fate and put one of their own in charge. So, yeah, they're very dangerous and they will not be satisfied in just governing territory. They will believe it's their, both their religious duty and their desire for greater power that they have to take this further a field. So,

Speaker 3:          00:25:47       um, what I do is ask you a little bit about the Israeli Palestinian situation. I'd like to talk to you a little bit about what you've been working on since leaving office and, uh, and then we'll go to questions and we have thousands of questions. Uh, it, it in Google. So, um, in the book you talk at some length about negotiating and getting to know Bibi Netanyahu, um, charismatic leader by, by any standard and the challenges he's faced from the terrorism and of the book. You talk a lot about Hezbollah and the Lebanon war and those sorts of things. Israel is today confronting, um, the Gaza, the Gaza rockets, Hamas and so forth. Looking at it, I was just there who has a big presence there. Um, it's to some degree in Hamas has interest to have this cycle continue. They get money, they get resources, they're getting rockets out of Syria, et cetera.

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       Um, and the rockets can now reach the entire country. And I was thinking about it, if you think about, uh, our, our good friends in Canada, right? So Imagine Canada was different and somehow was raining rockets on us or Mexico or whatever, people here would go crazy. Right? Right, right. And so you can really understand, in fact, the Israelis have built this thing called Iron Dome, which actually has intercepted 80 or 90% of the rockets, which is a remarkable technical achievement and good for them. Do you have a reading of what's going to happen next because it doesn't seem to be getting better?

Speaker 2:          00:27:14       Well, you know, you might've seen the president, um, doing a, a live press statement, uh, this morning from the White House and he's asked a secretary Kerry to go to the region to try to reestablish the November, 2012 cease fire that I negotiated back at the time when rockets were raining, uh, on Israel. And, uh, I went from Cambodia to Israel to negotiate what the Israelis would accept and then to go to Cairo to negotiate with then president Morsi, um, and we were able to reach, uh, a cease fire that held until this month. And I'd make three points. One Hamas really does have its back against the wall and that's always dangerous. You know, they were basically driven out of Damascus because that's where they had taken up their headquarters for years. But when Assad consolidated the Alawite a minority to go after the majority of the population, which are Sunni's, it became impossible for Hamas to maintain its headquarters there.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       They moved to Cairo, uh, because at the time, you know, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate Morsi was the president. There was a lot of sympathy there. Um, and they began to try to, uh, maneuver to control splinter groups within gossip because it's not just Tomas, there are some even harder core extremist groups, uh, within Gaza. So you have a couple of different groups led by Hamas gathering up more sophisticated weaponry. So when I negotiated the cease fire with Morsi, he had never done anything like that, but he did have a relationship, uh, with Hamas. So we were able to come up with a written agreement where Israel made certain commitments, Hamas made certain commitments. And thankfully it was before there was an invasion. We were about 48 hours from an invasion. So what has happened since, well Morrissey's gone, um, LCC is the president. He basically has declared the Muslim Brotherhood and everyone associated with them, which would include Hamas, are threats to the Egyptian state.

Speaker 2:          00:29:39       So ammas no longer has a, in Cairo, uh, the, uh, Westbank has remained fairly secure and stable and part because of the attitudes still in the West Bank that they'd rather have a negotiation then go back to resistance. So Hamas and it's, um, allies who have really brought about the importation of more long range rockets, um, has for whatever combination of calculations decided that it's in their interest, as Eric said, to once again attack Israel. Uh, maybe because they believe they will get more support, they will get more financial resources. Uh, maybe they think that they will cause an uprising in the West Bank that would join with them. They have a number of different reasons why they might do this. So once they began firing the rockets and the rockets have longer range and there's somewhat more accurate, but the iron dome, which the United States funded but which is Israeli technology has worked surprisingly well and intercepting 80, 90% of the rockets.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       But there was also the increasing threat from tunnels. You know, it used to be that Hamas had tunnels going into the Sinai and those were both for smuggling weapons, but also smuggling goods, uh, that would escape the Israeli embargo. The Egyptians have done a much more thorough job of shutting those tunnels down, but, uh, Hamas has been busy building tunnels into Israel with the primary purpose of attacking Israelis and trying to spark a, a very violent response. I can't believe that the current Hamas leadership did not know that if they kept up their attacks, Netanyahu would be forced to respond. Uh, as I said, when I got to Jerusalem for the first part of the negotiations, they were already sending out notices, uh, for, uh, reserve soldiers to begin mustering up and that they were going to have to invade. So I believe that Hamas wanted to provoke this reaction.

Speaker 2:          00:31:51       Uh, and I believe that Netanyahu, at the end of the day, uh, the Canadian Mexican example is, you know, not so far fetched. I mean, any country, your first obligation is to protect your citizens. And I believe Netanyahu, um, knew that he had to take action and he has an Israel has the right to self defense. So now we're into a not only a very unfortunate, um, clash, but a propaganda war. Uh, you know, the terrible, horrible pictures of children, uh, who are, uh, the victims of Israeli military action, uh, which is re Israel is right to say is in large measure, not completely, but in large measure because of the way Hamas has cited it's rockets and set up. It's operating centers in neighborhoods surrounded by civilians in houses. Uh, the tunnels where there was a firefight with Hamas, a fighters coming out of one of the tunnels and Israeli soldiers to Americans do, you know, dual citizens to young American men serving in the IDF, uh, killed. So we have to try, if we can, to negotiate another ceasefire. I've Egypt declared a ceasefire. Israel accepted it. Hamas rejected it in part because I do think they want to provoke what we're now seeing and it's deeply distressing. But unfortunately, unless there's a mutual cease fire, I think Israel will continue with their military objectives, which are defined and destroy the tunnels, find and destroy as many of the rockets as they can. Uh, and there will continue to be a terrible loss of life.

Speaker 3:          00:33:38       I agree. And it's very sad. The, let's make a context switch. Um, since you left office, you've spent a great deal of time on empowerment, entrepreneurship, the role of women and children. Uh, Google has partnered with you a little bit on that. Um, and I think people will be interested in what do you think needs to be done? You've given a series of speeches about this, the role of women and so forth. Uh, you're obviously committed to a tech. Take us through your thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       Well, I, I do want to thank Google and being one of our partners in this effort. Uh, when I got out of the State Department, I joined my husband and my daughter at the Clinton Foundation. My husband had started it and I'm very proud of what he built. I had nothing to do with it. I was in the Senate and in the State Department for those 12 years, but he came up with the OnApproach that I think is fairly called entrepreneurial philanthropy, where you bring people together, uh, through the foundation and through the Clinton Global Initiative, uh, to partner to solve problems. And we have very clear metrics. Are you making progress or not? And if you're not, then we're not going to keep doing what doesn't work. And we're going to do more of what does work. And we think we're all in this together. So both internationally and domestically, uh, there's a, a number of really important projects.

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       Bill has just left a Borneo where we're doing one of our climate initiatives, trying to save the rain forest in Indonesia, partnering with a number of other governments and businesses. So when I got out, in addition to wanting to work on the foundation priorities and CGI priorities, I added three. I added something we call too small to fail. And that is um, a programmed, aimed at persuading a families to read, talk and sing to their babies. Because what we know is if you come, if you're our daughter, uh, Chelsea or our new grandchild, you are going to be talked to and read two and sung to until probably you just want us to go away. Um, and we're doing it both because it's great to build relationships and connection, but we now know from brain research, it builds brains. And when a child from a family, like one of ours goes to kindergarten, that child will have already heard 30 million more words than a child from a poor family.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       Now, that does not mean the child from the poor family is any less loved, any less treasured, but there's not the time or understanding often so that parents know they can be their child's first teachers. So we are partnering with, uh, the next generation foundation in San Francisco and a number of other groups like sesame street to get this message out. Secondly, we rolled out at the Clinton Global Initiative America meeting in Denver, uh, last month, a program that is aimed at trying to work with companies like Google. We'd love to talk to you about this, but, uh, to create ladders of opportunity for unemployed young people, we have 6 million young people in America between the ages of 18 and 24 who are neither in school nor at work. And that's terrible for them and it's terrible for us in our economy. And then finally I took with me my commitment to women and girls, their empowerment, uh, their full participation.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       And my jumping off point is the speech that I gave in 1995 in Beijing, uh, which was intended to make it very clear, a statement of the global priority that a human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights. But accompanying that was a platform for action signed by 189 countries about what they would do to move toward full participation of women and girls. And we've made progress but not nearly enough. So we started a program called no ceilings and it's got three purposes. Number one, we want to be able with Google's help and others to get the best data possible so that we understand where the gaps are. We know, for example, we've made tremendous progress in getting girls into primary education, not so good in secondary education. So what are the gaps? How do we describe that and how do we visualize it?

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       So people who may not the experts or advocates in this field can look and see what the remaining business is. I have a chapter called unfinished business and it's really about what more we need to do. Now there are big differences between the developing world and the developed world and developing world. You know, we still have some very clear obstacles to overcome. We still have countries that don't even give birth certificates to girl babies because they're just not important enough to register. So when we say to ourselves, well, how many girls are in school and you know, a significant percentage don't even have birth certificates and there's not a good census, how do we measure that? Or when we look at Asia, there are 3 million fewer girls and women than there are boys and men because they just don't, they're not born or they don't live to their fifth birthday or they are victims of violence and neglect.

Speaker 2:          00:39:08       And we have this huge gap. And I think one of the problems that China and India are facing and will face even more is the big gap between marriageable men and marriageable women. And some of the violence against women is a result of what is a very big imbalance. Now in the so called developed world, um, we've changed our laws, but what we have left our cultural problems. And so in addition to getting the data, where are the gaps, we want to look at what are the solutions and they will vary from country to country, region to region. One of the efforts I made in the State Department was to do an began to do with the IMF, the World Bank and others, an economic analysis of what it means for girls and women, uh, to be left out of economies. Now we know girls and women are in the informal economy, but that's not counted in GDP.

Speaker 2:          00:40:06       I remember going to Africa in the 90s and all I saw were women working. They were carrying water, they were carrying firewood, they were tending fields, they were, you know, in the marketplaces. And I asked an economist, I said, how do you take account of all this economic activity? And they said, we don't get this in the informal economy. So what I wanted was an analysis about what difference it would make if we had girls and women in the formal economy. And it makes a huge GDP difference. And the person in the, in the world who has jumped on this more than anybody is Prime Minister Abi of Japan because when he took office, he took office on the promise. He was going to get the economy going and he looked at trade barriers. He looked at the lack of immigration, but one of the biggest problems was educated Japanese women were not in the economy and that in fact, if they had greater participation, the projection was the Japanese economy could go up to GDP.

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       [inaudible] economy is to use the talents you already have, the talent you have

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       and raise the talent base of women and girls in places where they're not educated and take advantage of those talents in places where they are.

Speaker 3:          00:41:15       It seems so obvious. Why don't we just do it? Ah, yeah. I want to try to figure out and with Google's help we get the best analysis to make the recommendation. I really agree with. I want to finish up with a book with the last, the last paragraph. You talk about the memorial service for your mom passed recently and you said, I looked at Chelsea and I thought how much, how proud mom, your mom was of her mom, measured her own life by how much she was able to help us and serve others. I knew that if she was still with us, she would be urging us to do the same. Never rest on your laurels. Never quit. Never stopped working to make the world a better place. That's our unfinished business. Is that why you work so hard?

Speaker 2:          00:41:59       It really is. Um, I don't want to get all of psychobabble Lee, but, um, it's okay. Uh, you know, uh, I so admire my mother, um, because she had a miserable childhood. I mean, just horrible, abused, neglected, abandoned, um, sent by herself at the age of, you know, seven, eight in charge of her younger sister who was about six, pulled on a train by themselves in Chicago, sent to California to live with her paternal grandparents who did not want her. And, um, just a terrible experience. And finally having to leave that home at the age of 13 to get a job, uh, working in another family's home, taking care of their children and return for room and board and the opportunity if she could get her chores done in the morning to go to school, if she could get back, uh, in the afternoon. So, I mean, when I was a child, I didn't know any of this about my mother.

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       I just knew that she was a great mom and she was fun and she, you know, took wonderful care of us. But as I learned more about her life, uh, upon becoming a teenager and a young adult, I was just astonished because I thought, you know, so many things could have gone wrong. I mean, she could've given up. She could've been embittered. She could, could've, even if she'd gotten married and have children, she could have been as mean spirited or neglectful as her mother and her grandmother were to her. But instead, she works so hard to be a better person and she never got to go to college. But she was always studying and trying to learn and believed passionately in education. And I think it did have a lot to do with my sense of service, uh, because you know, I remember going to Babysit for the children of migrant farm workers, um, who in Chicago, you know, they would come up from Mexico and they'd pick crops, they'd go through Illinois that go into Michigan.

Speaker 2:          00:44:01       And our church had a babysitting program for the youngest children on Saturday morning so that the school age children who went to school with us would be able to go out into the fields. And so I remember babysitting these adorable little kids and my mother, um, learning that one of the little girls was going to have her first communion. And of course I didn't have money for a dress and my mother took the mother of the little girl and you know, bought a dress. And My mother was always trying to think of ways that just through her own efforts she could help somebody else and encouraging me to do the same. So there's no doubt in my mind that she was my biggest inspiration. And her example, uh, was a, a great, uh, continuing reminder of what can happen because I'd end with this. I asked her once, I said, with all of your really suffering, what made the difference, how did you turn out the way you did?

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       And she said to me at so many points along the way, somebody was kind to me. It wasn't my family, but it was somebody else. And she told me about, uh, literally when she was like four years old and her parents were teenagers, totally irresponsible. They'd leave her for days, they give her, you know, a little bit of money and she'd have to get herself down the stairs of the tenement they lived in and go next door to a restaurant and ask for food, uh, with a little bit of money. And she said, looking back to that, I know they gave me more food than I could pay for or when she was in school and she would never have any lunch and never had any money to buy lunch. And the teacher noticed it. So the teacher without embarrassing her, uh, would bring an extra piece of fruit, would bring an extra carton of milk and would say, oh, I brought too much food.

Speaker 2:          00:45:45       Dorothy, would you like something? Because I just can't eat all this. Again, not humiliating her, but making it possible for her to receive that kindness. And the family that she moved in to work for was the first time she was ever in an intact family that loved each other and cared about each other and had plans for the future. And she could see all of that. So it was just a great reminder when you don't have to go into full time philanthropy or charitable work or faith based work or politics, but there's always something you can do that helps somebody. And if you do it in a way that preserves their dignity and gives them the feeling that it was kindness as opposed to arrogance, it can make a huge difference. So I think that, uh, left a great impression.

Speaker 3:          00:46:37       There isn't very nice picture of, of you and your mom, Chelsea and mark in the book. Yeah. We have questions from the audience. Let's get some folks lined up here. Uh, but, uh, the overwhelming, there's a ranking system that we use of questioning and the overwhelming ranking throughout the company. And this is being watched all around the world. And Google, um, he has a question about the NSA and as you know, Google is quite opposed along with the other tech companies to what we see is overreach by the NSA. Right. And we all think, for example, that bugging Angela Merkel's phone is, you know, pretty stupid if I can be blunt. Um, what is your opinion of NSA's spying surveillance, the domestic violence, but this occurred I think after you were there, right? You have an opinion about this number one question from Google.

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       Yeah. I mean, don't do stupid things. Um, and that doesn't mean we don't need to have a system of surveillance because we do, I mean, I think that has to be accepted, but how we do it and how we explain it and what we tell our partners is incredibly important. I was just in Berlin on my book tour in Europe, and of course that was the number one issue. And I, I said, look, Angle Merkel is a friend of mine and I apologize to her. It was wrong. It shouldn't have been

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       Washington. You know, I had dinner with her and she looked at me, he said, what are they doing? Listening to my conversations with my mother. Yeah, I mean people will remember that.

Speaker 2:          00:47:59       Absolutely. And look, I think we were, we were beginning to take a hard look at what we did post nine 11. Um, and that was happening. The president had actually given a speech before, um, the Snowden disclosures about the need to take a hard look at the legislation and how it was being implemented. Um, so we had to do that because I voted for things and then I voted against things trying to figure out how to get the right balance in a security and liberty, the age old question. And we have to do, we have to do a much better job and we have to do it in a way that doesn't affect our great companies like Google because clearly that would be unfortunate for us.

Speaker 3:          00:48:43       Let's go, uh, here, go ahead for your first question and then we'll go over here.

Speaker 4:          00:48:46       Sorry Clinton. Thank you for joining us today. Um, I want it to get your take on the state of Congress and internal politics within the US. It seems like things are getting increasingly polarized to the point of dysfunction. You know, I think that the kick, the can economic policies that we're building is really hurting our country. So I'm wondering what you think needs to be done to fix it and who the right people are to lead that effort.

Speaker 2:          00:49:11       Well, I think your question is exactly on point. Um, I think we have two crises right now in our country. We have an economic crisis that has to do with both growth and inequality. Uh, you may not feel it here at Google, but it's real in the lives of, of many Americans. And we need to get back to doing smarter things in terms of economic policies. And we have a political crisis. I would even argue it's a crisis of our democracy because it's not functioning. And I would make three quick points. First, um, having been in and around politics for a long time. Um, please don't get indifferent or disgusted and walk away from it because truly the best way of changing what's going on is through voting. I mean, that may sound simplistic, but I've been there, I've seen it. I know it can work and I would have just a few pieces of advice.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       Don't vote for anyone who says he or she will never compromise. Um, and, and does it proudly, you know, they, they have all the answers. They may even have a direct channel to the divine so they know what should be done. Uh, and therefore they're going to Washington or they're going to Sacramento wherever they're going. And they will never compromise. That is death to a democracy. I don't know if any of you saw the Great Steven Spielberg movie about Lincoln and trying to get the 13th amendment passed. There was just a great a movie I made a great play in New York called all the way about Lbj trying to get civil rights past. You've got to compromise if you're going to make progress. And so don't vote for people. Don't give them money, don't encourage them. Uh, you can be conservative, but find people who understand the meeting of conservative.

Speaker 2:          00:50:58       It's not radicalism. It's a conserving a and trying to build on, uh, institutions that work. And then finally to go to your, you're the final part of your question. It's not only what citizens should do in terms of voting and contributing and trying to pick people who will be better partners in solving our problems, but it's what leaders themselves have to do. Uh, and Washington is now set up for dysfunction. People are elected often with the best intentions and then they get there and they spend all their money, their time raising money so that they can be reelected the next time instead of doing the work that they were elected to do the first time. And they also are rarely with each other. Uh, it didn't use to be that way. You met across the aisle, you met, uh, across the ideological divide. And we're not doing that, so people don't get to know each other. And so I think you, if you are running for one of these offices, you just have to be absolutely committed to spending a lot of time trying to build relationships because at the end of the day, that's what it's about. You have to have enough trust, enough understanding to be able to make decisions and you know, that's what we're missing right now.

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       I would also have, I have to bring your book back and quote in general, I was surprised at how many people in Washington operated in an evidence free zone where we're data and science are disregarded. You then go on and quote an unnamed senior Bush administration official who I'm dying to figure out who this is, who said the reality based community. People who believe that solutions emerged from your judicious study of discernible reality. I've always thought that's exactly how to solve problems the bush way when it went on. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now and when we act, we create our own reality. That attitude helps explain it a lot of what went wrong during those years. So, so maybe the answer is also, let's, let's go back to the, we can debate the principles and so forth, but let's make sure the data's correct. Correct.

Speaker 2:          00:53:01       Well, and what a place to talk about this. I mean, that's exactly, I mean, I used to give speeches about being in an evidence free zone, uh, in the Senate and we've got to figure out a better way of breaking down the intellectual barriers that exist between people of different political beliefs. There's some recent research has been done, and I would welcome any of your thoughts on this that shows if you hold an opinion strongly, like let's just pick supply side economics, trickle down economics, which don't work. There's no evidence that it works, but it is deeply believed by people, um, or the immigration is bad for the United States. Totally wrong evidence to the contrary going, can we just pause for miles?

Speaker 5:          00:53:46       Isn't that amazing? We just heard this.

Speaker 1:          00:53:48       No, this country was built on immigration hundred percent and, and so

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       we, we know we have evidence, but oftentimes it's difficult to break through the psychological barriers to hearing that. So we've got to do a better job. And I think about this a lot because of the dysfunction. Some people deny climate change because they think they are doing it to protect industries they make money from or they get contributions from. Some people deny it because they don't understand the science and they kind of just throw up their hands and it's easier to say, oh well all workout. Some of it, some people deny it for religious reasons, whatever. That's just one example of an issue that we are gridlocked over and thank goodness for President Obama beginning to do things that will deal with climate change, um, through executive action. But how do we begin to have a conversation again where we actually listened to each other because the, you know, we are much less sexist, much less racist, much less homophobic than we were a decade or two ago. But boy, the one remaining bias we have is we don't want to be around people who share a different political opinion. You know, we just don't want to argue with them. We don't want to listen to them. And it's on both sides of the divide. So we've got to do a better job of question over here. Yeah, sorry.

Speaker 6:          00:55:11       Thank you Secretary Clinton. Um, I was hoping we could, uh, use some of your experience and dealing with rather difficult international crises and controversies with one of the deep controversies affecting us. What do you think it will take to resolve the tension between advocates of synchronous and asynchronous programming? Ronnel's

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       um, all right. Are you,

Speaker 5:          00:55:38       are you saying, oh, would you like to wow. Good.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I'm no expert, but clearly no synchronous models require lightweight threads.

Speaker 5:          00:56:00       Have you been, have you been spending some time in Silicon Valley? I've been thinking a lot about silicon valley. Did you actually have a real question? Well, actually that was the right answer, I guess, right? Yeah. Hey, since we're so good at this, I'm wondering if maybe I could even ask you another one.

Speaker 6:          00:56:19       Given there, there is a suggestion that increases in productivity over the past few decades, that the total number of jobs that the American economy can even have, maybe structurally less than the number of people who are in need of jobs and even more so for jobs that can actually pay enough for someone to live on, right? If this is really a fundamental structural reality, we're going to have to deal with how do we adjust to such a world?

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       Well, I I really glad you asked that because I don't have a quick Glib answer to give you, but I can tell you that I would love to have any thoughts from all of you because you are making this new world. I mean, Google is a part of the future that is out there. And as I look around, you know, it's a very diverse crowd. A lot of young and youngest people, uh, who have, uh, uh, I think they all look young. They do, uh, who, who have skills and abilities that are really required in this new future. There is a serious political and economic dimension to that. And I don't think it's enough to basically say everybody else just going to have to get used to it, live with it because that is a recipe for not only increasing inequality, but what inequality does to social cohesion to democratic institutions.

Speaker 2:          00:57:45       Uh, so I think it's one of the most serious questions we have to figure out how to answer. Now, you know, there are some obvious quick answers, like you have subsidized employment for people in certain areas, or at least they have something to do all day, every day. Um, you try to figure out how you create incentives for companies to keep people employed instead of making them unemployed. You know, the German system where you're, the government basically subsidizes you to avoid layoffs, but then you gotta figure out what to do with people. I mean, there are no easy answers and given the intellectual brainpower in here, uh, the United States may be getting to this sooner than other parts of the world. Everybody is going to get to it. So, I mean right now the Chinese are trying to figure out how they continue taking tens of millions of people out of rural areas, bringing them to urban areas and putting them to work when wages are gonna rise, when their economic advantage then maybe diminished. So this is a huge social, political, economic issue. And if you've got any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

Speaker 6:          00:58:49       Let's have a quick question over here. Sicker essentially continents and honor to have you here. I saw you on the daily show recently where a John Stewart preemptively announced your candidacy for.

Speaker 2:          00:59:01       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:59:01       No, I took my daughter about six years ago to the Democratic primaries to vote for you in the face. She would be interested. She above 82. She's old enough to vote. That is she, she came to be with. I love that. Um, how do you, I mean I, I thought you handled it quite, but um, how are you going to handle when there's so many people who are obviously interested in having you, uh, in this next election?

Speaker 2:          00:59:27       Thank you. Well, John Stewart was a lot of it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:30       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:59:38       and, and I love the story of taking your daughter. We always took Chelsea to vote. I mean, really, I think every 18 year old should be automatically registered to vote upon turning 18. I think we need to get,

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       um,

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       this is a very personal decision for me. Um, and I don't take it at all lightly. I'm sort of feeling my way through it and toward it. Uh, I, I think we face some very serious hard choices as a nation. And I have no illusions about what a president alone can do because it's a necessary to bring the congress to bring the private sector to get people from all walks of life involve. But I think we're at a real juncture. Uh, and I'm well aware that I have a lot of experience. I've seen the presidency up close now over 20 years. Uh, both because of my husband and, and also I worked closely with George W. Bush after nine 11 because I was a senator from New York and we had to rebuild, you know, lower Manhattan and then obviously working closely and becoming a, not just a partner but a friend of President Obama.

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       Um, so I am going to take my time because I know that once I decide if I am going to run, it's nonstop and the campaigns are even more demanding than they were four years ago. Um, and so, I mean I've talked with people in the Obama campaign and they basically say, you know, 2012 was so much more advanced technologically and in voters in terms of voter outreach, then 2008 and we don't even know what's going to be required in 2016. And I'm sure you know a lot of you because of what you work on and bent and the light will be part of that. So I want to be sure that it's the right decision for me and that I will not just, I say in the book, you shouldn't ask somebody, in my opinion whether they're going to run or if they think they can win.

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       Those are the easy questions and most people run for president, no matter what you think, think they can win or they wouldn't do it. Um, but really what's your vision for America and can you lead us there? And I think that's going to require, and it goes to the great question that was asked over here that's going to require some really careful analysis and agenda setting because you, in my opinion, whoever runs, and certainly if I were to run, I would want to run on a specific and agenda as possible because I don't want there to be any illusions. You know, we're, we don't have time for people to, you know, just think in very general terms because we have to get a consensus coming out of this next election about what we're going to do to solve these problems and hopefully bring some people into the congress on both sides of the aisle who are willing to compromise and make those tough calls. So I'm thinking about it and I hope you'll say hello to your daughter for me.

Speaker 5:          01:02:37       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       So Secretary Clinton,

Speaker 5:          01:02:43       we have a way, we have a way of asking

Speaker 3:          01:02:46       during the audience what the most important question is. And when you became first lady, you're name was determined by the tradition of first lady Tru, Tru and Googlers want to know the following question. They want to know the name of President Clinton in a scenario where there's another president, clinic,

Speaker 5:          01:03:13       Googlers have indicated that there are two

Speaker 3:          01:03:15       choices. The first one is bill.

Speaker 5:          01:03:22       Okay.
