Speaker 1:          00:06          Today. We are so excited to have Dr Francesca Gino here joining us. She is, I'm a behavioral scientist and the Tandon family professor of business administration at Hbs, Harvard Business School. And she will be talking to us about some of her recent research, which is also represented in her new book called rebel talent. And I am told that one of the rebels, so they'll be talking about is a fabulous Italian chef. So among others. So we have lots of good stuff in store. So Francesca, come on up. Um, she's gonna talk yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:38          for about 45 minutes. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:43          45 minutes of content and save your questions. Um, if you're on the live stream, please feel free to ping them to Al Rahim Murali who's ELDAP as a l a h I m and we will go from there.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Perfect. Thank you so much. Welcome. Thank you so much for having me and thank you so much for all of you to show up and come to the talk. As you heard, we're going to talk about some of the ideas in the book and I want to share some stories, a little bit of the research behind the scenes and all fully you're going to feel as inspired as I felt when I was working on this book project. And I want to start with a story that I heard and I was told by going went back to the restaurant by the person who works at this a three Michelin Star restaurant in needle is called Osteria Francescana there in modern, um, and his name is [inaudible]. And this is actually the story of a family of four who visited the restaurant on a Friday night. So imagine your father and mother and eight year old boy and a 14 year old boy and Palmieri helps them find their table and then shows up to take the order.

Speaker 2:          01:52          And the father are incredibly happy, makes an order for each one of the four of them for a tasting menu that has a 13 dishes and he's called sensations and it's almost lunch time. So I want to give you a sense of the type of dishes that are part of them is menu, so quite creative in the way they were assembled. That's a Yo and other dish that is part of these 13 um, tasting menu course. Tasting menu is the one that you see here. It looks like a funny ice cream but that's a four gras, so not the type of dishes the growing boys would hunger for. Now the fiber was so eager to eat at the restaurant and not only me, the reservations for Friday night. You also made the reservations for Saturday night. So there's now 24 hours later the same families back at the restaurant and we're again welcomes them in a, brings them to their table and then shows up to take the order.

Speaker 2:          02:48          This time again very happily, the father goes a four at 10 cores, a tasting menu called the tradition in evolution. And again I want to give you a sense of the type of that are part of the manual. One of them is called his nails and under the earth he served as a soup, but there actually is nails at the bottom of the plate and they're hidden under a form of raw garlic and potato and the earth. Part of the dish is stands for black truffle coffee and nuts. Now I'm Permian was taking the ordered, you notice that the boys over most had a face of disappearing as if they were not sharing the eagerness and excitement of their father to have another gourmet meal and the boys were keeping quiet. But Palmieri turn to the eight year old at the table and said, what would you like to have pizza that the year old boy now is we, everyone just going is no pizzeria.

Speaker 2:          03:47          There is no way you could find pizza on their menu and it's a rather serious place. Fresh flowers are brought into the restaurant every day. The tables are put together with surgical precision. The dishes are arranged with a lot of attention to detail and this is a restaurant. The back in 2016 became the best restaurant in the world. And in fact, also this year in 2018 they were back at the top of the list. But despite all of that, when premire heard pizza is skills themselves ran to the phone, called up the best pizzeria moderner and order the pizza. And sure enough about 1520 minutes later, a pizza showed up and the door in a taxi and pizza was served that to the boys. Now I'm telling you this story because it's a perfect example of war. Rebel talent is all about even in situations where there are lots of rules, as in the case of fancy restaurant, permia was able to keep his mind open, look at the problem from a different perspectives and come up with a rather creative solution.

Speaker 2:          04:52          So what I want to suggest is that we all probably want to be people like Palmyra. If we think about our leadership broadly defined, the people that we influence in our different spheres of life, whether at work or in our personal life, I would say that we want to have people would order the pizza like Palmieri dead in that particular instance. Now, what's interesting is that I will call [inaudible] area rabble for this behavior for many other behaviors that you engage in on a regular basis in his work, but rebels usually have a bad reputation. I spend a lot of time in organizations and I've collected all sorts of words for them. They're called the show offs. Sometimes they're called the jerks or the annoying people who slow you down in your decision making processes. The trouble makers, the outcasts. In fact, I think that we often have a very precise idea of the rebels in the business.

Speaker 2:          05:52          We think about people like apple, visionary, Steve Jobs, so people are incredibly innovative and creative, but at least the stories go, not the type of people you want to work with, the or AV as a boss or as an employee. And what I want to do in the time that we have together, and it was a big motivation for writing this book is trying to shift that thinking and suggest that people who I call a rabbles are not people to break rules just for the sake of breaking rules. They are not people who are arrogant. There are people who break rules, hold them and others back and they break rules in a way that is very constructive and productive and positive for their organizations. So that said, let me share a few stories that are going to allow us to talk about what are the ingredients of their success and the first story that they want to share comes up from the domain of sport.

Speaker 2:          06:41          Now some of you might know this guy is a rather well known coach. His name is Marisa cheeks and I want to tell him particular about the evening of April 23rd the 2003 this was a big night for him. It was game three of the first round of the 2003 NBA championships. And I like you to imagine being there. You're in a very big arena, 20,000 fans ready to watch the game. You're there with them, ready to cheer up your team to success. Millions of viewers are from home and before the game started at girl, Ooh, as about 14 years in age, stepped into the arena, ready to sing the national anthem. And what I like you to do is watch a video clip that I brought with me of that moment and I like you to pay attention to what this coach does. Oh, why don't we do the following. We'll come back to add that and I'm gonna talk about a different ingredients first a where we don't need to look at the video quite yet. The second ingredient that seems to be something to rebels do quite well is having a great desire for challenge and for novelty. And I want to introduce this ingredient by telling you about a personal story. It is Christmas time, a few years back and our house, and

Speaker 2:          08:10          this is not what happened there. I had what I thought was the perfect gift for my husband. And the only thing that you need to know about him is that is the type of person who would be super happy to work here. So it's a complete geek, so always loves the new piece of technology. Uh, the lead is gadget. Everything that is a interesting and playful when it comes to technology is the perfect gift for him. And so on Christmas Day, he runs downstairs. There is a big tree in the living room and under the tree finds a big box that I prepare the for him and it takes the top off and then he start taking some pieces of paper out of the box. There was this card at the bottom of the box letting you know that they signed us up for a 10 week, two hour weeks course in Improv comedy.

Speaker 2:          09:02          Now, as it turns out in pro carbonate taught me all sorts of interesting things that are really good lessons for life in thinking about the work that we do, in thinking about the relationship that we have and in the spirit of, uh, bringing to bear something that I've learned by taking this class, I thought that we could do an exercise together. That is one of the exercises that we did quite a few times throughout, uh, Improv. Now. Um, just to close the story, my, my husband was too happy when I signed him up for this class. He really wanted the latest gadget in his hands, but I thought it was wrong. And by the end of the first two hour class, he actually told me that he hated it. But things started to change as we went on and on for our weekly classes. And he started really enjoying having this a date with the anesp acted. So I'm going to ask each of you, if you don't mind to stand up for this exercise. I'm going to ask each of you to find the partners. So a person who is a standing close to you, that would work well. Perfect. And I'm gonna put myself up here so that you can see the direction. So this is not too difficult. Okay. I'm going to ask you to stand about this distance from your partner.

Speaker 2:          10:27          That is a, somebody over here needs a partner since you're working in pair and if you don't have a partner you can also work with me. I'm fine with that. Okay, so here's what I'm going to ask you to do. From that position, you're going to standing in front of your partner. I'm going to ask you to spend the next 20 seconds and I'm going to keep the time for you staring in the eyes of your partner. Okay? And there are a few more rules before you get started. No laughing, no talking, no anything. No really expression of any emotions on your face. Okay, so that's the agro sizes. I said I'm going to keep the time for you. And when there is silence you can start.

Speaker 3:          11:26          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:32          And time. How did that feel? It was great. Okay. For some of you, maybe slightly awkward, a little bit weird, uncomfortable. As it turns out, if you felt a little bit awkward, slightly uncomfortable, that's okay. It means that you're human because our brain knows that if we stand that close to a person looking in their eyes for that amount of time, one or two things usually happen. One, we're going to kiss the person. Two, we're going to punch them in the face and I, I don't want any of that to happen on Google. So you can go to your partner and shake their hands and say, I'm not going to punch you. I'm not going to kiss you. Okay, now that that is out of the way, no, no, no. Standing up, not sitting yet. There is a second part of the exercise. Now, a beautiful principle of Improv is the idea of who is working on scenes with a partner and shifting your attention from us to them.

Speaker 2:          12:42          Our goal in scenes is always trying our best to make our partner feels good about what they're doing or feeling as confident as they can feel about what they're doing. And again, what a beautiful lesson about life more generally. And so to practice that, we're going to go back to the same position again. I'm going to ask you to engage in this 22nd of a period of steering, but this time you're also trying to pay attention. So what is their eye color? Is their haircut an interesting one or are their ears shaped in a slightly different way? Whatever you want to do, you're trying to stare, but pay attention to what they're doing. Okay. Same rules, same rules as before. So no talking, no laughing, no facial expression of any kind. Okay, perfect. If you're ready, let's go

Speaker 2:          13:46          and time. Okay, we're going to test what are you going or paying attention or not? Seems like that you were, I know. Oh, that sounds like a common from my husband. As we were going to classes, you're going to turn around 180 degrees and so each one of you, so this time is not your face looking at their face, but it's your back looking at their back. Perfect. And what I'm going to ask you to do is each one of you to think about two big changes. So I don't know if you have glasses, you might want to take your glasses off or rough up your hair, be as creative as you want to be, and then make those two changes on yourself. Okay. No taking off clothes, just perfect. Okay. If you have your two changes, when you're ready, you can turn around and each of you can guess the changes that you see in your partner.

Speaker 4:          15:24          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:30          Are you able to figure them out?

Speaker 4:          15:33          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          15:39          Again, it's quite nice to be able to shift the attention from ourselves to the other partner. So hopefully most of you were able to see the changes the other person actually made. Now I'm going to do that final part of this exercise. And do we have music? Are we good with audio? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. We're going to do the final part of the eggs this size. And this is what I'm going to ask you to do if you don't mind. Um, do you like to dance? Yes. Yes. Oh. If I were to find you on a dance floor, what you would be doing? Dancing. Okay. Can you show, can you show me one of your moves?

Speaker 4:          16:19          Yes. I generally have like you have generally. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          16:27          This is what I am seeing. So something else, sorry. The much better than what I'm doing, but it's something around that. Okay. So your role as an, again, each of you is going to do this, that you end up here, each of you is going to think about their favorite dance move. And I'm going to put on some music and ask you to actually try it out in front of your partner. And then you're going to switch when I say switch. But here's the very important role of the partner. Since your task is to make your partner feel as good as they can feel about their dancing in this case, or as confident as they can feel about their dancing, you're mirroring but exaggerating. Okay? So whatever it is, I don't know what I would do this here, but in a way that really makes them feel good about the way they are dancing. Okay. Um, as I said, I'm going to put up some users since it's easier to dance. That way you can decide who's gonna go first.

Speaker 4:          17:26          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          17:27          And when you're ready, the first person can start,

Speaker 4:          17:52          Michelle.

Speaker 2:          18:11          Okay. Hey, plus do all of you can take it.

Speaker 4:          18:16          [inaudible] I'm

Speaker 2:          18:26          really exceptional dancing in this room. I have to say I'm very, I'm very impressed. How did that feel compared to the first exercise when you were staring the first time you did that much better. Right? It's interesting that once we put ourselves out there in situations where we feel challenged, where we're always doing something new, it becomes easier to feel comfortable with the uncomfortable. That's what rebel often do. You know, I was obviously very interested in studying this idea in the case of businesses. And so I want to businesses to try to see how is it that they injected this idea of challenge and novelty in the work that people do. And one of the businesses I visited where I expected not to find any rebelliousness is a fast food chain in the middle of tenancy in West Virginia. They look like this. They're drives through bleed blue, big blue boxes with French fries and hot dogs on their roof, but then have quite successful at what they do.

Speaker 2:          19:22          In fact, if you look at any measure of performance, revenue per square, you name it, they beat the competition by far. And we're talking about big brands like Mcdonald's, Burger King, Wendy's. Now they also invest in people quite differently. So if a police like Mcdonald's, you receive an hour and a half, two hours of training per stations at Paul's, they give you 135 hours of training per station. So they're really all about making you an expert such that you have the free space in your mind to think about how to improve on the work that you do. Now, when I was there, I was in the middle of the store, actually a rush hours. And so you see people working at their stations almost like machines and that sort of thing. And then maybe work becomes monotonous or even boring. And yet the general managers of thought about this, and so it's more ways that they inject novelty.

Speaker 2:          20:17          One way in which they do this is that the idea of, um, letting people know the order that they're going fall, look throughout the day, the stations that they're moving from to one, they show up for work. So they created a little bit of unpredictability, a little bit of novelty that allows them to stay on their feet. And what's also interesting is that they have all sorts of challenges for the people working in the stores. My favorite to date is a challenge for the person working at the windows. So the person who takes the order, an interesting statistic about pals is that they have a lot of repeat customers. So people who eat there five to six times a week and they have a simple menu. And so people are creatures of habit, tend to make the same order whenever they show up. And so the challenge for the person at the window wounds, if you can remember a hundred orders in a row, then there is this reward.

Speaker 2:          21:12          And it was really interesting to see how the person really experienced it as being pushed in the work that she did. And she was very happy when she actually completed the challenge successfully. So what is very true about Rabil is, is that they have this desire for novelty. They're not afraid of putting themselves in situations that makes them uncomfortable. Now let's go back to the first ingredient with the video that I want to do, show you earlier. So you know the setup. And as I said, the idea is for you to think about how you'd feel if you were in the shoes of this coach. When went to watch the video, maybe, maybe not. Who knows a little bit of novelty, um, and see what he does. Pay attention to his behavior

Speaker 5:          21:57          and Alex, your water America. Absolute, the men and women serving our country with our national anthem. Please welcome as voted by you. The fans are a winner of the Toyota. Get the feeling of a star promotion. Natalie Gilbert.

Speaker 2:          22:18          Oh, say, can you see the what?

Speaker 6:          22:33          Hey. Ah, the stars law.

Speaker 2:          22:38          Stop Stars. Ooh, Scott's trial. Bye.

Speaker 4:          23:04          Oh, the whoa. Yay. Eh. Well the, Eh,

Speaker 2:          24:05          now let me ask you a question. Does this guy have a good voice? Absolutely not. And yet it took him no time to stop in the middle of the arena and start singing, helping the girl who needed help. What is impressive about him is that he has no problem making themselves vulnerable. Even one that means showing everybody that clearly singing is not one of his strengths but rather it's a weakness and that's what rebel's seems to be doing quite naturally. They make themselves vulnerable in a way that is not back firing as we often think you will but rather buys them a lot of respect. In fact, if you didn't feel moved in a little way, at least the watching that I think you have no heart because it really creates an emotional connections by doing what he does it. So as I said, rebels that are people who seems to be quite a happy to jump in and to help. Now, they also are people, as I said, that they have this interesting desire for novelty. But I want to share a couple of more of their ingredients. And again, we're going to go back to the domain of sport and we're not going to look at this guy bleeding. We're going to see a little boy, younger boy getting into the bees will feel. And I'd like you to pay attention to the reframing. Daddy does quite naturally

Speaker 4:          25:45          strike one strike two.

Speaker 7:          26:02          Why is the greatest hitter

Speaker 4:          26:13          strike three?

Speaker 3:          26:17          Wow.

Speaker 2:          26:25          Now this little guy is very impressive. We all tend to dwell on our weaknesses. We often over invest in our weaknesses and instead he shifts his attention to his strengths. And as it turns out, that's what rebels do. They play to their strengths on a regular basis and that's something that makes them feel authentic in the work that they do. I was very curious about this idea of authenticity. There is a lot of talking, uh, in the world about the power of authenticity. And I was interested in looking at whether a lot of the things that we say about authenticity or true and so with my colleagues we went to all sorts of contexts to look at whether authenticity is in fact a powerful driver in the work that we do. So one of the contexts that we explored is entrepreneurial competitions. So imagine entrepreneurs showing up, pitching their ideas to venture capitalists.

Speaker 2:          27:16          And what we found is that when entrepreneurs are authentic and genuine in their pitching, they're three times more likely to get money for their ideas. Now as in these, there is also an interesting part of this story of the chef and owner of the restaurant that I mentioned earlier, Osteria Francescana, you can see him here. His name is Massimo Bottura. Really interesting person and leader. In fact, it is a person and went to a context that traditional Italian dishes and reinvented them. Now I don't know how much you know about Italians, but there are two things that are very true. One is that there are lots of rules when it comes to cooking. And we cherish our old ways. And he went to a context where there are lots of traditions. So were recipes have been passed on for centuries from generation to generation. And he basically messed up the tradition and came up with something new.

Speaker 2:          28:15          So we studied traditions very carefully and then started asking question, well maybe made sense. Um, cooking this dish this way 20 years ago, but not today. Let's do something different. So if you have ever had Lasagna, this is his version of the Lasagna is called the crunchy part of the Lasagna. It looks nothing like the type of dishes I grew up with. Now what is interesting is that when you open the restaurant traditional moment, Italians weren't too happy. In fact, he talks about it as actively fighting against him. And when I asked him what allowed him to stay persistent, you told me about the power of authenticity. And in fact you told me about the story of the summer that he spent at the bully at the time, quite a famous restaurant in Spain. And what he learned from the chef there. And it was really a message of feeling the freedom and expressing the freedom of playing to your strength and staying authentic.

Speaker 2:          29:09          And so this is the quote is that what changed me was the message of freedom. The foreign gave me the freedom to feel my own fire, to look inside myself and make my thoughts. I dibble. And sure enough after the summary went back to Moderna, he sold everything that he had. You borrow money from his wife's family and then invested the money and the time in the restaurants came up with the recipes and a few months later the first Michelin Star arrive and the second one and the third. And as I told you in 2016 the restaurant became the restaurant. The best restaurant in the world and of Italian pride is since it was the first time when you tell your restaurant reached the top of the list. Now again, his interest, his story's interesting, but as a scientist I was curious to know whether he's stories more generalizable.

Speaker 2:          29:55          The idea that authenticity is really powerful to help us persistence through challenges. So one of the studies that we conducted to look at this is by bringing red sox facts into HBS campus. And what we did, we gave them, um, one type, one or two types of wristbands to where either the wristband of their favorite team, the red sox, or the wristbands of the New York Yankees. And then we put them through all sorts of challenges in the hour that we had with them. And at the very end, one of the challenges was to ask them to put their dominant hand in a bucket of ice. And so we were paying them the longer they kept their hand in a bucket of ice. We were interested in seeing whether a UC persistence, more persistent when people experience authenticity, even in the case of tolerance to pain and physical persistent.

Speaker 2:          30:48          And sure enough across all the different challenges we put them through people who felt authentic just for wearing the wristband of their favorite team or much more likely to persist through challenges even when he came to keeping their hands in the bucket of ice at the end of this study. So just in their authenticity is really quite powerful in helping us resist the through challenges. Now what this tells us, and the reason why I'm telling you these stories is that they are quite interesting in showing one of the talents the rebels seem to have. There are people who play to their strength quite often, but they also help others do the same. A few years back, I came across a quote of an Italian sculptor, an artist. They're really stayed with me. You probably know some of his work. Um, his name is Michela Angelo Buena Bonati.

Speaker 2:          31:41          Heres what you wrote about the sculpting processes. Sad sculpting is a process whereby the artist releases and ideal figure from the block of stone in which is lumbers. To me that's very powerful because it raises the question of what if we were to look around in our professional lives at work or in our personal lives and starting with the assumptions that fundamentally everybody has talent and that our role as colleagues, as leaders, as parents, as friends, is to help them bring those out. So I bought into this idea and then I started the questions asking question of how do we do that concretely. And so I'm going to leave you with a couple of examples that maybe my trigger, some suggestions or ideas in your head. The first story comes from Ariel investment. This is a Chicago based money management firm and the president of Ariel investment is the woman that you see in the picture.

Speaker 2:          32:41          Her name is Mellody Hobson, remarkable woman, really successful, really interesting what she does to bring a lot of these talent into your organization. And when I asked her to tell me a little bit more about her career, she told me that she started working at Ariel at the age of 22 right after graduating from college, no working experience. And she's been quite successful. So what was the secret to her success? She referred to the advice that she received directly from the CEO at the time on the first day of work, and this is what this, you told her, you're going to be in rooms with people who have a lot of money and have big titles, but it doesn't mean that your ideas are not as good or even better. I want to hear your ideas. It's incumbent on you to speak up. So from the very first day she had the license of bringing our contributions forward and this is advice that she shares with everybody at the firm or everybody that she brings into the firm.

Speaker 2:          33:43          Now back in 2011 I had an opportunity to think about how to apply these ideas. I was working with a company called the Wipro technologies. They're based in India and in particular my colleagues and I were working with their business process outsource inside of the business. So imagine people working in call centers now, as you might imagine, it's a tough job. And in fact what we were was experiencing was investing a lot in people, bringing them in and then 45 to 60 days into the job, most people were leaving the organization, so not the greatest investment. And so we did an intervention with them where we gave people who joined half hour of reflection. We ask them to think about their strengths, to think about what's unique about them and how they could play to their strengths more often at work. And the, since we wanted to test the ideas and some of the people actually went through this revise the welcoming process, some of them went through the regular welcoming process and we print them.

Speaker 2:          34:47          We looked at turnover rates seven months after the intervention. And what we found is that this moment of reflections where people had the chance to think about what makes them authentic and how they could bring that out into work was quite powerful. So people were more likely to be with the organization seven months later. There were also much happier in their jobs and they perform better as we know from the railings on customers' calls. And what is interesting, I think about this study is that it's in a context where the job is very scripted, suggesting that even there, there is an opportunity for us to rely on this talent. So what these different studies and stories tell us is that rebels play to their strengths on a regular basis, but they also help others do the same. And again, I felt very inspired by learning about this in a way that made me think about work a little bit differently.

Speaker 2:          35:43          So let me share a final ingredient and then we're going to open it up for question. This is a, I think at the moment, one that really puzzles me and it's a talent for curiosity and it puzzles me because we're all born with it. In fact, if you look at the data, he curiosity peaks at the age of four and five and then it declines steadily from there. I think that that's a sad finding and a missed opportunity. And I don't know if you can still remember the time you were cared is way too long ago for me. So I think about my children who are at the age where curiosity is really coming out and it's constant questioning. Just before I left for this trip, they were asking questions about why is the sky blue? Or why is it that we need to wear clothes when we leave the house?

Speaker 2:          36:33          It's constant exploring and a sense of wonder and question. And we seem to be losing that. And in fact, when I looked at this in the context of organizations, I looked at people who are starting new jobs across the different sort of industries. And it seems like curiosity is pretty high as you start. But when you go back to the same people, six to nine months later, curiosity a dropped across the board by at least 20% it doesn't have to be that way. And in fact of rebels or people who keep their curiosity alive and also encourage it in others. So I'll give you a couple of examples. One comes from intuit. Every year they have innovation at words. And these are for people, a ransom explorations that led to new products and new processes, but they also have failure words and these go to people lose explorations did not end up in a new product but led to good learnings for the team.

Speaker 2:          37:29          And what's most exciting about this example is that the failure of words come with a failure party. So you're really creating an atmosphere where explorations is in fact supported and valued. Now we started it with a story about the restaurant Osteria Francescana. So we are going to end with a story about this restaurant. This is a very busy night at Osteria Francescana and one of their sous chef that is known internally. A stacker was working on the last dessert of the night and it was a lemon tart. Tac has done for being obsessed with precision and attention to detail. And so he was working very carefully arranging the different pieces on the plate and all of a sudden the plate drop to the floor and I yet as mashed a lemon tart. Now Taka was starting to panic, trying to understand and figure out what to do.

Speaker 2:          38:18          And as it was feeling this way, chef Massimo Bottura walked into the kitchen and saw the plate on the floor and rather than yelling as I bet a lot of leaders would do in fancy restaurant, he looked at the plate and said, I think we have a new item for our money. And sure enough they came up with a new dessert is not one of their most popular desserts at the restaurant. And um, it looks like this. I took a picture of when I was there, it smashed on the play even in a way that is prepared. And the name for it is, oops, I dropped the lemon tart. And he's just a great example of how curious people are curious. Leaders like him are able to even look at accidents or mistakes and turn them into a source of inspiration. So it seems as if these rebels do have a recipe to their success.

Speaker 2:          39:17          And if you look at how they use their talents, there are all sorts of behaviors that they engage in on a regular basis. And there are many of them I write about in the book. I just captured the fewer of them on the slides and is not for talking through them. But just to give you the idea that a lot of these things, a lot of these behaviors are not requiring a complete restructuring of the organization or rethinking over what we're doing, but they require some thoughtfulness on our part. Now this rabble shares five talents, no matter what industry or um, a job they do. And we talked about some of them in more detail. They have this talent for authenticity. They have a talent for novelty. Rather than going with the familiar and comfortable, they challenge themselves have a talent for curiosity. They have a talent for perspective. A little bit like what Palmieri did. One looking at the problem rather than being stuck on the obvious answer, it looked at it from multiple perspective. And finally they have a talent for diversity. So there are people really reject social rules that are passed onto us by society and they think about surrounding themselves with people who think differently and can challenge their way of thinking. And then really leverage, um, differences. So let me stop here. I have many more story to tell you, but I'm kinda curious to see what questions are on your mind.

Speaker 1:          40:49          Yeah. Before we get into that, let me just remember or remind you, if you're on the live stream, feel free to Ping Al Rahim Murali. So He's a l e r a, h. I. M.

Speaker 8:          41:01          That we can start with the room.

Speaker 1:          41:08          So that great talk. Um, I'm just curious. So the literature on creativity shows that people are most creative under some level of constraint. Total freedom is not great for the creative process. Similarly, do rebels depend on there being some shared assumptions for them to question and break to some extent? And does that mean not everyone can be a rebel in an organization? Right? There has to be some kind of shared culture or structure or something like that for them to operate best. Huh.

Speaker 2:          41:34          So, uh, in one of the chapters in the book that comes a little bit late, or I talk about the principles the rebels live by and it was something that was inspired by, uh, going potentially to a strange place. So one of the organizations that they studied this as it was working on this book was pirate ships in the 16th century. They are fascinating and I had all sorts of wrong ideas about them and the ships, the crews actually had principles that everybody agreed upon before they left for, uh, uh, for their journeys. And similarly, uh, rebels, the Av principles, one of them is finding freedom in constraint. So you're right in saying that the fact that that, um, that our structures, norms, rules allows them to bring out some of their creativity. Now to your question of, does that mean that that affects the number of rebels that we have in the organization?

Speaker 2:          42:31          I usually receive the question in the form of what's the exact percentage of rebel that I should have in the organization. And my answer is always the same. It makes people feel uncomfortable. It's 100%. And the reason is that if we look at this balance, there is nothing threatening about them other than requiring a little bit more openness to people that bring into work different perspectives. And one of the things that is true about rebels is that you get to being more innovative, to perform better in your job, to have better relationships at work and because you're fully engaged in the work that you do. And so I've been struck by the data that, um, is very well known about engagement across the globe and the fact that there are two third of workplaces full of people were disengaged or actively disengaged. He's just puzzling and strange. And I've met some of those people and really the experiences, the work sucks for many of them. And so I think that we're encouraging rebelliousness. You also get the engagement that leads to all sorts of benefits. So a hundred percent

Speaker 3:          43:45          yeah.

Speaker 9:          43:48          You mentioned that, uh, rebels play to their strengths. And so I wanted to ask a question related to growth mindset and fixed mindset. Um, so if they're playing to their strengths, does that mean they're not improving or building on their weaknesses? And do you think then, uh, wondering if you think it's like not useful to do that and just like focus on building more strength?

Speaker 2:          44:08          Yeah, so I actually think that if you look at the two talents that I talked about a capture these idea of, of learning and growing. So novelty means putting yourself out there in situations, the challenges in a way that allows you to develop new skills. And so that's the part of the growth mindset. But there is also this idea that you focus a lot of what you do and gives you energy. That is what I mean by playing to your strengths as a way that makes you feel outstanding. So I don't see the two in contradictions. It seems like rebels do both quite, uh, quite well. And one of the things that are across the board. Um, I don't use the label growth mind is as much, but I use a thirst for learning, which in a sense it's similar and this a willingness to grow in their job is, it's quite important for rebels.

Speaker 2:          45:01          In fact, some people say what about a organs where arrogance is not part of their playbook, but the humility is, um, I'll give you a quick story if you don't mind. And it's in one of the chapters where I talk about perspective. The person I mentioned, they're, uh, they're really surprise me as a captain that you probably all now and his captain Sully Sullenberger, this is the captain who ditch the play when 155 passenger in the Hudson River back on a call live in, you know, 2009. And when I found myself reading the accident report, I was amazed by what he did. You had 280 seconds to make a decisions. That's the time that he had when he discovered that there was no thrust in the engines and the timing ditch the plane in the Hudson River, most of us under such time pressure and stress would narrow our thinking and options.

Speaker 2:          45:49          He instead was broadening his perspective. He kept considering what it is that we could be doing. And I reached out to him since I was curious about his approach. And what I've learned is that by the time the accident happened, he had a ton of experience over 30,000 hours of flying under his belt. He has served in the military, so he had all sorts of experience flying, all sorts of planes. He had served as a volunteer in previous accidents, so so in knew a lot about what can go wrong, but every time he walked into the cockpit it would ask himself what it is that could be different. In this case, what it is that I could learn. And so he kept that intellectually melody that I seen a lot of rebels that allows them to keep looking at the experience as a signal. Not that they know it all, but that there is more to grow and learn.

Speaker 1:          46:39          We have a question from the livestream. Most of the examples you shared involve men as rebels. How do you think that rebellious behavior is treated when those rebels are outside of the gender or ethnic majority?

Speaker 2:          46:51          A very good point. And I tried, um, in the book to actually be much broader in the sense of, um, not only going outside of the United States but also having both examples of men and women as well as different, uh, groups. Now, what I collected some data on this, this since one of the questions that I always receive is the can a women or minorities break rules as much as a white man? And the answer is that we perceive they can't. But actually the benefits of embracing these talents are equal for men and women and for all sorts of groups, which I think is quite refreshing. Um, for gender. More specifically ended up after the book came out, I ended up writing a blog post for HBR where it talks specifically drawing on a chapter on the book, on gender issues. And sort of giving tips out of the book of why is it and how is it that women can, uh, break rules. But yeah, so we have the perception, but it's the wrong perception and we can all break rules equally. I think we have time. The legal line.

Speaker 10:         48:12          Thank you for your talk. I'm curious about the downsides of being a rebel. So all the examples you gave are about the upsides and the rewards, but obviously there's a lot of inherent risk as you make yourself more known, take bigger risks or decisions. So what research have you done in that area?

Speaker 2:          48:32          So part of it is the fact that you're pushing for something different. And so, uh, I think the keys of water is a great example where you might fights, have to fight some resistance, uh, before getting accepted. But in terms of when is it that they could really go wrong or when the costs are really high. I think that for that it happens for rebels that are not effective. And what I mean by this is that often, especially new organizations, what do you feel that maybe the top leadership is not supporting this approach? People get frustrated and that frustration often turns into the wrong delivery as you're trying to use this talent. I'm going to give you a concrete example. So after the book came up as you don't mind Rumi and a message and sad, I saw the book, I bought the book, I read the book.

Speaker 2:          49:23          I think that you need to change your subtitle. I was like, okay. It says why you to break the rules working going in life. And we're scientists. So I obviously always want to learn and I might be wrong. Um, so I called them up and we had the conversation for two hours and I basically, his argument was, I'm the perfect rebel based on your descriptions, but things are not working out for me. And from what he was saying, I couldn't quite figure it out. And as it turns out, his job is right outside of Boston. And I said, why don't I come for three days and follow you at work? Like a neutral observer in the background. And I thought you would be a great experience for me just to learn about is approved. And after the first half a day I was like, okay, I get it.

Speaker 2:          50:06          And you was the delivery that was wrong. I think it was really frustrated by what the top leadership was encouraging. And so it was using a lot of arrogance. So, so for example, in a meeting, and it was, this was just priceless. Um, the group was talking about a decision that the company was considering and everybody talked before him was agree, the fact that that it was the right approach of looking at this decision and he was raising his and it was super angry. And then when he got called on it sad, I understand what you will sad and why you might think that way, but it's actually the wrong way of approaching the decision. In fact, I cannot even think of an even more wrong way of looking at the decision, what I suggest we do instead. And then he blurted out his answer and it was just, um, in between crying and laughing and seeing that because the approach was wrong. So I think that that's often when things get, um, a little bit difficult for people and they encounter costs.

Speaker 2:          51:05          Great. Thank you. I'm sure we had a lot more questions, but unfortunately we are out of time so I'll leave you with that. If you have extra questions, you should feel free to reach out. I'll also leave you with the following thing, some of you my, um, feel maybe not at ease with the idea. And so to get started on this wonderful journey you might want to go to the book website is called rebel talent.org. And there is a little test that tells you which type of rebel you are. So which type of talents come more easily or less easily to you. And so you're going gonna receive some tips and if you come out as a pirate, it's a good thing. It's actually quite a very good thing. So thank you so much. Thank you so much.
