Speaker 1:          00:06          Super glad to have just sell Carino here with us today. Um, just sal is the CEO of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in the Western Hemisphere region and today we really are going to have a conversation about the state of women's health in the state of women's rights in the region and how the International Planned Parenthood Federation is navigating the regions, um, rapidly changing political, economic and environmental landscape. I am delighted to have a woman leader here today to talk about this important issue. So welcome so much. Thank you for [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:42          introduction. Thank you all for joining this conversation. Thank you both John and [inaudible] for making this company companies a great opportunity to be here. Coffee is great,

Speaker 1:          00:52          and I look forward to the next, to the next opportunity. Thank you very much. Good. Well, just all, I always like to start these conversations with the personal stories. So can you tell us a little bit about how you got interested in this work and sort of how you got to where you are today?

Speaker 2:          01:08          Well, I, you know, I grew up in Argentina, in Argentina. And when I say rural, I mean rural. I remember receiving the Sunday paper at 4:00 PM that's rural. And, um, you know, I went to an all girls Catholic school. Um, we, and this is not a telecom faith faces as you just mentioned. I, I, we work with, uh, progressive, uh, religious leaders and I'm part of the board of Catholic for the right to decide. But, you know, we, I remember we used to be, you know, girls playing on one side and boys playing on the other side. And I remember always asking the question, why is this, you know, I have brothers and cousins. We used to play together and things were different there. And I remember the answers were not quite satisfying. And then as I grew up, um, you know, my parents would say like, what do you want to be when you grow up?

Speaker 2:          01:56          And across the street there was, um, a farming school full of boys and, um, and this, I thought that was really cool. You know, like they used to be outdoors all the time and said, I want to be a farmer, I want to go to that school. And, and they would be like, not real. That's, that's, you know, for boys. Like why is that? And again, not a very satisfying answer to that. And then I think all of it came together when I was in secondary school and one of my best friend got pregnant and she wasn't, I'm rejected from a school, but, um, but she couldn't be part of us anymore. You know, like the social stigma associated with teen pregnancy is huge, continues to be huge. And, um, and so I think all of it came together and, and it was clear that it could have been any of us, that we needed the information to be able to protect ourselves to live healthy lives.

Speaker 2:          02:48          And that wasn't there, that wasn't available to us. Right. Um, I also grew up, you know, during the dictatorship in Argentina. I was born in 19, 776 on in, and now, you know, my age and the leadership began in March of that year. So I remember that crashing sense of, um, that, you know, things would never change. And, um, and then when democracy came, that feeling of it was in our hands to make that happen and to protect that. So I think, you know, all of it had to do with ended up where I ended up in planned who do it worked for women's right. I truly believe that there isn't the possibility of development without half of their population being uh, including um, and sexual and reproductive health and rights are key, right? Deciding if we want to have children when we have, we want to have to live with whom is critical to us being a full participant, participants, um, in society.

Speaker 2:          03:44          So all came to everywhere. I love that. Well, thank you for sharing your personal story with us and I always appreciate that because it sort of gives a sense for, you know, how you got to where you are today, which I think a lot of people always want to know about. Um, tell us a little bit about sort of a wide range of services that planned parenthood does provide and sort of white you're the population you serve, looks like he has. Well, we, um, last year alone serve about 6 million women in lead in America and the Caribbean and provided roughly 30 million services from a really pap screening, cervical cancer screening, sexy location, a gender based violence services, access to contraception, um, and safe and legal abortion when that, when that is allowed by the local laws. Uh, one thing that I should mention is that, you know, we're a global federation.

Speaker 2:          04:35          Um, so we have a presence in about 150 countries around the world. Um, we represent the Latin America and the Caribbean. We work with 40, um, independent organizations, non for profit organizations that are affiliated to us. Um, I don't know how many of you do know, uh, of, uh, Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Many of you know, right? Yes, they're great. There are a great partner in the US. Um, how many of you do know of I BBF or International Planned Parenthood Federation? Probably not too many. Right. It's, it's okay. Um, Planned Parenthood Federation of America is our partner in the U S and lady that we have partners, uh, in 150 countries globally are so many of them providing a full care, comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services for women and men. About 10% of our services are to men. And we got a big focus on youth. Um, I across the world and in particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, about, uh, 40% of our services go to young people.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Um, yeah. And then a lot of those cases, are you providing free or low cost health care to the patients that come in your door? Yes, we lose one. We not only have clinics in many of the countries, you know, that is a, a game I like to play when I go. I spend much of my time visiting clinics and programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. And, uh, when the taxi driver picks me up from the airport, I always ask, so how do you know local clinics? Have you been there, your friends when they're, and, and the answers to those questions normally is yes. Uh, they, uh, they know our clinics because we've been providing services now for 50 years, uh, in the region, but we not only provide the services in the clinics, we also run community based programs down in communities where other people will then go.

Speaker 2:          06:23          Right. Eh, and many, all of our services are subsidized and many of them are free of cost in these. So probably in a lot of friends, a lot of these women, especially in rural communities, that planned parenthood clinic might be the only clinic that is affordable and accessible for them. Right. Indeed. Indeed. Yes. So you've been with the Organization for over a decade, which is quite impressive. Can you share what's changed in that time over your service with the International Planned Parenthood Federation? Well, you know, it's interesting because I transition, um, I am a first time CEO and transition to become the CEO last year, arguably not the best year to transition anything called planned parenthood. Uh, it's a, you know, full of challenges. And I think my work before was a programmatic work. I spent time with women and, and the communities. And I think I saw a great change in terms of, you know, we have been able to lift many people out of poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Speaker 2:          07:25          We still remain as one of the most unequal regions in the world. Uh, that means that if you are young, if you're poor, if you're from an indigenous community, if you're a for the [inaudible], um, the way you experience life health services, you're needs are different, right? Um, most of our countries are considered now middle income countries and uh, this means that donors have pullout from the region, but huge pockets of poverty and inequality remain. And, um, and the people we serve are these people, right? So we need to continue investing in this program and in the services. Um, I think we know that we have then great advances. We have been there for 60 years. We have brought contraception to many of these countries. Emergency contraception, what is called the morning after pill. It should be called the, as soon as possible, Bill, because you can use it up to five days after having unprotected sex.

Speaker 2:          08:24          But the sooner you use it, the better. We brought that to many of the countries in which we are working. So we have made great strides, um, in, um, you know, bringing in contraception to women, but we know that we have 23 million women who want access to modern contraception and don't have it. Right. So I think there have been great advances in general, but there are huge challenges that, uh, that remain and we have to continue working to close that gap for sure. You know, in Silicon Valley here we're technologists by and large. And so we always think about the role of technology in our work. So has technology played a role in the work of International Planned Parenthood Federation? Yes, I think we have made important than investments in technology. I, my, uh, seems small to you, but we invested in making sure that we have electronic health records across the world so that we can not only serve women better, but also assess the health outcomes over time.

Speaker 2:          09:23          And that's an investment we, we have done over a number of years now. We think that are great opportunities for technological innovations. We are a region with high conductivity and we have in front of us, um, the largest generation of young people ever. Wow. Reaching them. Uh, it's a huge opportunity, right? It's a huge challenge as well. And I suspect that we will know how to help us close that gap because I think probably technology has a key role to play in reaching these people with both, um, information, uh, it location and actual actual services. Um, unfortunately the, you know, telemedicine, uh, all of that is not as developed as it is here, but we do a follow very closely and, uh, love to try a few innovations that we know are happening in the United States right now. And that hold great potential too, to bring services to women in a much more cost effective way.

Speaker 2:          10:24          How that's a fantastic opportunity for all of us here to think about and be involved with for sure. So we do have a powerful female CEO here in our midst, and I always like to, to ask you a little bit about what that year has been like and what are some of the key leadership challenges you faced and the lessons you've learned, um, in that year? Well, it's, it was, it, it was clearly a tough year. Um, not only, um, you know, we had a new US administration, um, not quite favorable to our issues. And, um, you know, everything that happens in the u s has an impact, um, overseas. Um, we, you know, the US used to have a leadership role on these issues. That's no longer the case. And, um, prison term impose as soon as he took office. The global gag rule. Talk a little bit about that cause I'm not sure everybody's familiar.

Speaker 2:          11:18          Yeah. The, everybody, a Republican president since Reagan, um, uh, put in place something called the global gag rule, which is limits the ability of organizations overseas that receive us funding, um, to either, uh, advocate for change in the laws and policies in relationships to abortion, to provide abortion services with their own resources, even if our version is legal in that country. And, um, and their money normally, uh, from the u s government was for work lake access to contraception, gender based violence. Uh, what the was uh, impose a rule of really unprecedented proportions that in every source of funding from, from the US government, including tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, AIDS. Um, so normally about 600 million of us falling assistant money would be gab, um, as we call it. Um, in this case is about eight point $8 billion. So this is a policy that has the potential to really do serious damage to women around the world.

Speaker 2:          12:33          Um, we as an organization decided not to be guided by these policy. Um, we, you know, we give up out $100 million as an aside, as a holy, um, uh, and um, and we think this rule is unfair and unjust and harms women and really has the potential of harming women across the globe. So, um, that was a big challenge. We face as soon as I took, I took office in, um, I think in April last year we had Brexit in July and we had the elections in November and this happened right after in January. So I think that's, that was one of the biggest challenge. Um, the second one, uh, you might have heard we have a string of natural disaster you have effect in the region, um, over the past few months. Um, again, disasters of unprecedented proportions. Um, you know, our clinics have been badly affected. Our teams.

Speaker 2:          13:35          Um, what is really amazing to see if, you know, we had the earthquake in Mexico, they, after our teams, people in our, our office lost their homes. They show up to work to provide care for women, not in the clinics because the clinics were damage on the streets, whatever that was possible. They were there to help women because we know, um, that, uh, one of the things that happen when natural disasters effect is that the needs of, of women and girls are normally not the priority, but life goes on, right? People continue to need contraception, people continue to need a prenatal care. And, um, and I think has been amazing to see, um, the level of response in spite of, of such, such a difficult situation. And maybe if, if I am allow a second to talk about Puerto Rico because, yes, please. For the record, you know, it's a case that hurts, hurts me because the tuition of the island was dire before, um, before the hurricanes hit.

Speaker 2:          14:39          And, uh, you know, 50% of the population living below the poverty line, many of them women. Um, and then, uh, we have the hurricanes. And as you know, the response from the government, has it been, um, limited, um, unsatisfying? I don't know how to, what objective to objective to use to define it. And, uh, and I feel like we have four clinics, um, in the island, none of which are up and running because they'll steal because we don't have electricity. We, um, uh, you know, we raise funding to buy generators, which is the way, um, and if they go away for generators to get there, because obviously everyone is trying to, to buy generators and you can't keep them running all the time. So that will have some limitations. Gas is a problem accessing gas, uh, two random, um, and you know, we have, uh, we know the need is there. We have the infrastructure to set of women. We need help to get those clinics, uh, back in order and to provide the services that are very much needed because no one else will we be doing that. Right. So, so it's, I guess I plenty of help for the case of Puerto Rico in which the response has been with contempt. Yeah. And um, and he's wearing matching myth.

Speaker 1:          16:01          No, I think that's a really good point. And you know, as you point out, it really has been such a challenging year, you know, from policy and politics and natural disasters and I can tell that this work is very personal and it's very emotional and I really do applaud your bravery and your courage and your leadership. How do you sort of keep your staff and your caregivers and your providers sort of, you know, motivated to do this work in the long run because it can be very challenging and emotional and taxing.

Speaker 2:          16:32          Yeah, we um, hold tight to the good things. You know, these people are fighters. They been fighting in the front lines. These challenges are not new to us. Our bigger, that's right. It's always difficult but they, our themes are there serving the needs of women. There is nothing more satisfying. There is nothing more satisfying to me and to many of them. Then when, you know, when you sit with women in the waiting rooms in, when I travel and get to talk to him and the number of barriers they had to overcome to be there and you have the answer to what they need, there is nothing more satisfying than being able to provide that. Um, and I think that Colin tied to that is what keep us going and the support of so many of you, you know, we couldn't do this work without supporters like you who are there to hold the line and, and support us every step of the way. So thank you. Thank you very much. You know, um, then thank you.

Speaker 1:          17:29          Thank you for motivating, you know, your team of caregivers and providers to do this work. It's really quite incredible. You talked a little bit about how oftentimes when a young woman gets to your clinic, they've overcome a lot of barriers just to get there and be present that day for their services. Can you talk a little bit about some of those barriers women face?

Speaker 2:          17:50          Yes. And we work to help them overcome them. You know, like I'll, I'll talk a little bit about our cervical cancer work, which I think is a good indication of that. We, um, you know, cervical cancer is still a killer in, uh, for women in Latin America and the Caribbean and across the globe and is caused by a virus called HPV virus. Um, there are many strains of, uh, of the vitals, but two that really causes cervical cancer. And there is a vaccine that is a very low in developed countries. So we partner with the Ministry of Health in Bolivia and our members association there to bring the vaccine, uh, to, to Latin America and the Caribbean. And it was quite pricey at the moment. And I'm normally here, you know, women would, uh, take girls. The vaccination ranges between I think nine and 12 years of age.

Speaker 2:          18:39          Um, and, um, to the pediatrician, the pediatrician would offer the vaccine. The vaccine has three doses, so you have to go three times a year with your girl for the vaccine. So when we began looking at this program and knowing, I mean many of the women we serve, um, you know, working the fields, um, selling food in the market, they can't just take the day off to do these, uh, they might not have enough money to feed their family that we give. They do so. Right. Um, so we, uh, develop this initiative and um, uh, apply the vaccines in a pilot program in schools because we know a high proportion of the girls are in school, they don't need their mothers, their and, and we have a very successful rates of vaccination higher than any other vaccination program in this pilot initiative. So we tried to bridge the gap because when you work in low resource settings, um, we have to be creative and disruptive in the way we think through through programming. Right? So that has been a, I think, a very good example of trying to find people where, uh, where they are and, um, and help them overcome the challenges, uh, that they wouldn't have otherwise.

Speaker 1:          19:49          That's fantastic. I want to talk a little bit about a real issue in a real crisis. And our society, which is the issue of sexual assault. Um, you know, we've seen movements like me to start spilling out to other countries and we've definitely been hearing just more and more about the prevalence of sexual assaults, sort of, um, two women around the world. How are you sort of thinking about that work and thinking about educating girls and women about sexual assault, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and the impact of those things to them? You know, I come from

Speaker 2:          20:24          joining, which I'm one in three women have suffered violence, you know, the, um, I think if we have 25 countries with highest homicide rates, uh, feminist side we call them against women. 14 are in Latin America and the Caribbean. Um, I um, I think, um, I follow very closely. Me Too. I think, um, it's great. That is a lot in women's story. Deli come in, women coming forward and telling their stories. Um, I think um, it was very interesting to see how that, um, how that trickle effect and about 12 countries. Um, you have to love the French. They call it out the pig or something like that. I mean it's just a fabulous, and I think to see, uh, very quickly, even in Argentina, a few days after the waste end case in the u s uh, we have a case, um, uh, on, uh, for a journalist as well.

Speaker 2:          21:19          I think there is a lot of power in people telling their story in coming forward. This is not just about a solidarity, it's about self exposure, right? And four, we know those of us who have worked in violence, we know that for every woman that comes forward there yet that are at least 10 that haven't. And that is a of you know, a pervasive element in our society. Um, also in Argentina we are home of a movement called um, new and our not one less. This moment kind of happened organically as a result of a number of super high profile cases of, of homicides against women, uh, mostly by their partners. And um, you know, we are 40 million and they mobilize out a million people in the first time that they go together. Last year they mobilize 3 million people. And you could argue, you know, Argentinians like to march, but, um, but I think that it was incredible.

Speaker 2:          22:19          The mobilization, the digital mobilization. Many people show up at work, uh, dressed in black tomorrow to show their solidarity. And I think, I think that's amazing. I think as a, as a movement or I like to think we are reaching a tipping point, we no longer have to accept these as part of our life. And I think that is a lot of transformation going on. And I, if there is something to have faith confidence on is in the ability of civil society or follow fats, um, keeping this conversation going because laws and policies will follow. But we first need to understand that this is simply not accept or we cannot, we don't have to put up with this anymore. And that's right. That's the conversation that I saw going on that gets me very excited because I think it's the beginning of the end, which was, which is a terrific sort of optimistic view and I really thank you for that.

Speaker 2:          23:14          You know, you said something that really struck me, sad for everyone. My man that comes forward and reports a sexual assault or sexual violence, there's probably 10 more that haven't reported. You know, how can technology or how can our work help more women sort of be able to come forward and get the help they need and the support they need. Yeah. I think it's what we are seeing. You know, we, we have been one of the first institutions that created a health response to violence. No. And I think with technology, so much more can be done. Uh, I think, uh, as I said, there is a lot of um, it's very powerful for women to come forward and they have done so, um, and a beer, you know, this is a conversation happening, the regular conversation, everybody's is talking about this. And I think, um, technology's obviously a big part of the cooling cap happen before, you know, this is not, I support techs.

Speaker 2:          24:08          This is Mitchell. Yes, I am. I am very much part of this. And I think, um, and I think it was possible because of the connectivity and the platforms, we have to be able to express ourself. And I think that's a great thing. That's a great thing. Yeah, for sure. Tell us a little bit about how International Planned Parenthood Federation as approaching HIV and AIDS, um, the treatment, the care or the awareness and the region as well. Yeah, we have know, uh, sexual rights and, and the work around HIV AIDS have been central to our work. Uh, we integrated HIV detection services across our region in Latin America and the Caribbean. I have gone to the communities work with a specific population where the virus tends to be concentrated in the region, has been a critical piece of our work. Um, luckily the, the, there has been a lot of progress in the region, uh, on that issue.

Speaker 2:          25:00          And some of our member associations even, uh, provide treatment. Um, one of them Dominican Republic for instance. So we have been fully involved over the past 10 years in integrated service delivery, uh, on HIV and feel very proud of the accomplishments in that area. It's wonderful. And I want to turn a little bit to some of the laws and policy in the region. So, certainly even in the states, we're seeing laws and restrictions being passed that, you know, make it harder to have access to safe and legal abortion. Are you seeing that as well? Um, in Latin America and the Caribbean? Thank you for that question because when I talked earlier about service delivery and location, and I forgot to mention that we really work, uh, around laws and policies that inhibit access, uh, for women's exercise of their rights. Right? We work at the local and the regional and we also had the work at the UN on behalf of IBM as a whole globally.

Speaker 2:          25:59          Um, what we are seeing, um, in Latin America we have a lot of laws and policies. They, they issue a, the hardest nut to crack, uh, is in the implementation aspects of things and making sure that the money exists to support, um, uh, service delivery. Um, we're still home to, uh, for countries who have a total ban on abortion. And, um, for those of you who might not know what that is, is that you can't access abortion services in any circumstances, not even to preserve your own, uh, life. And, um, so it's a big challenge. We have, I remember the case of parents, she was a 16 year old from the Dominican Republic who was pregnant and had cancer and her treatment for cancer was denied because of her pregnancy would put at risk to her pregnancy. And in the Dominican Republic, uh, along with El Salvador and Nicaragua and Honduras.

Speaker 2:          26:58          Um, there are no exceptions. Um, so, um, she laid, she'll, if she paid, she paid with her life, the congress, the still, um, debating a bill to open some legal exceptions, eh, but, um, there is much work to be done. Um, in, in that regard, we have a number of countries that have, um, legal exceptions and the books, but those have not materialized, you know, in the life of women. Um, they might exist on paper, but the implementation of those, um, I guess offer often time limited and oftentimes we are a, one of the providers in those places in which legal exception exists, uh, for, for abortion care, for legal abortion care for women. Um, we should to up big window. We, um, uh, there was a total ban on abortion in Chilean. And, um, we just, um, maybe, maybe I want to say two months ago, we're able to, uh, pass a legislation that allows for three legal exceptions to preserve, preserve the life of the woman, four cases of rape and incest and cases of fetal malformations incompatible with life.

Speaker 2:          28:19          And, um, and you know, the law is limited in scope. It's only three circumstances. It was legacy from the Pinochet dictatorship. Um, but it's a biggest step forward with Chilean women, uh, to be able to access, uh, in these circumstances. And we still have four more countries to, to be able to, to overturn the total vans. We have the gates, I don't know if you, if you have heard or follow the news, we have the case of El Salvador. Women in El Salvador go to jail if they are suspected of having economists courage for 30 years. So these are really draconian laws, um, that, um, that, you know, need, need to change and um, and um, they need to be changed. Definitely. And so I imagine a lot of your work as the CEO of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the Western Hemisphere is working with policymakers influencing lobbying for change. How are you finding the receptivity to these issues and their willingness to understand the issues, learn and adapt and change?

Speaker 2:          29:25          You know, we have, I think a great partnership with the government. We have, you know, local organizations that are leading the work on the ground. Just like, uh, BFAs Lee in the work here in the u s um, that helps because the organizations have been there for 60 years. They have a reputation, they know where we do. Um, having said that these issues are hard. And as I said, it's not only just changing the loss once they load change, the real fight begins and the fight is making sure that those services are available to women. So we are also, um, act as watch dogs for the government to make sure that, um, the laws are implemented and quite importantly, that there is funding to support the provision of those services in the, in the, in the national budget. Because at the end we, you know, we are there to support as long as much as we can, but this needs to be part of, of the country program. And that's easier said than done. Right? Uh, when, when it comes to the reality, we have laws that have been on the books for a hundred years now and uh, and many of them, you know, implementation is a, is a slow, um, it's, it's, it's a hard fight, but I think one was fighting

Speaker 1:          30:43          very much so. I think you said something that probably, it's definitely surprise me and maybe some of our audience too, is that there's a big difference between getting a law passed and the practical implementation of it. And I think sometimes as activists, we think our work is done when the law is passed, right? It's a law is passed and change magically happens. And I think you're saying, hey, there's actually a long road between a law on the books and practical implementation on the ground. Are there steps that can be taken to sort of shorten that gap between passing a law and practically implementing it for the folks you serve?

Speaker 2:          31:15          Yes, we think, you know, we're experience, you know, working with health care teams as the low in building the support for the new low. It's critical because you've got to have providers query to provide services not only ready, uh, ideologically ready technically. Right. Um, so I think we have learned that if you engage, uh, healthcare providers from the get go, not only they work with women every day, they know their stories, they can bring their stories, stories to the public conversation, right. Um, but also, um, they are the ones who will have to provide services and that has proved to be, I think an important element that we have learned through the work we have done in the region.

Speaker 1:          31:59          Yeah. That's very insightful. Thank you. John. I just wanted to take a look our check with you. Are there questions from the Dory? I certainly have a lot more for just solve that. I want to make sure the audience gets correct.

Speaker 3:          32:09          These have a couple, right? One of the bully asks, I used to work in public health in Subsaharan Africa. One of the challenges I encountered was combating dangerous myths about reproductive and sexual health. How do you correct these misconceptions in the field? And is there anything that we have Google can do to combat this type of misinformation?

Speaker 2:          32:26          Of course. I mean, I think we heard it all right in terms of myths and misconceptions. Our contraception, I would everything else. Um, I think, um, I could not stress enough the need to have comprehensive sexuality education for, um, for young people and as early as that is possible and not any type of comprehensive sexuality education, but one that its evidence base that talks about power and relationships that helps kids, uh, young people in maneuver the life and the relationships and to calibrate them challenge, you know, the social norms around masculinity that offering oftentimes the basis for my Cheeseman and for violence. Um, I think, uh, that that's critical. I think you at Google can help. Um, as I said, we have, um, the VUS opportunity ever. We have the largest generation of young people in front of us. Uh, reaching them with the right information.

Speaker 2:          33:25          Um, it's critical and I suspect you will have ideas on how you help us do that. Um, but it's definitely something that will be an investment that will pay off in the next 40 years. We know a location base off, um, comprehensive sexuality education is not the exception to that. We have plenty of evidence, uh, of the dipole of, uh, sexuality, location that works. Um, and I think we, uh, we just need to be able to reach kids in a school out of school early, uh, with good information so they can actually live the lives they, uh, they want to leave. Um, and I think it's, um, it's critical that we do that. That's a great question. Thank you. Molly. Another one. John, can you talk a bit about how you evaluate your programs for effectiveness? Yes. We, uh, you know, for every program we run, we, uh, we do an evaluation of the programs.

Speaker 2:          34:19          Um, also, uh, you know, uh, each member association runs, uh, evaluation of own programs as well. Evolution is critical for learning for us. And, and I think, um, the program I was talking about in Bolivia on cervical cancer is again, a good example because we not only look about, uh, effectiveness. Is the vaccine effective, it's effective in this setting. Um, we also look at are there better ways, are there most cost effective ways of doing that? Um, one thing that we are very happy to know now is that the vaccine that I was talking about to prevent cervical cancer, um, instead of having three doses has to those doses. Being able to deliver a program with two doses as opposed to three, my seem a small thing. It's actually a huge thing because in low resource settings, if you can eliminate one step, keep the same results, you can use that money, uh, for other, uh, health pressing needs, uh, in the country.

Speaker 2:          35:15          Right? So we, uh, we'd love to do much more, but we have a commitment to, to evaluate everything. Everything we do. That's fantastic. And I want to share, we haven't touched too much on yet as maternal mortality and I'd love to understand sort of the prevalence or the demographics in your region around maternal mortality and sort of the, a little bit about the harm reduction that sort of really helps address the issue. Can you talk to us about that? Yes. It's, um, thank you for that question. You know, the harm reduction model was developed in Norway about 10 years ago and, uh, by a group of midwives and doctors who worked in a public hospital. And, um, maternal mortality was always relatively low in would away with one exception, which was maternal mortality view to unsafe abortion. Um, and you know, what happens in, in the region is that if you are, um, you know, a woman of means a, even though the law, my, um, may not allow for, for legal abortion, you can get an abortion from your doctor.

Speaker 2:          36:22          Um, the problem is that those who are not women of means simply die right from unsafe abortion. So this is what they face in the way they thought at the moment that, you know, abortion was restricted. There were a few exceptions, not really known by women and not really used by providers either. Um, and I Callum moment, but it also has a before and an after where women have, uh, contacts with their providers and doing nothing wasn't what they wanted to do. Right. So they develop a model that allows them to educate women about what they shouldn't do if they decided to pursue, um, and abortion, uh, what not to insert the warning signs. Um, and also, uh, to come back for care afterwards. They couldn't probably help them in the moment, only if they were eligible for the legal exceptions. Otherwise they didn't have the, the ability to help them but help them with education and they could come back for care when they need care possible.

Speaker 2:          37:22          John is legal in all of the countries. Um, and, and, and they thought this was a very important, at the same time, um, there was a new drug called misoprostol that became available in the region and it's a, a drug that saves life, you know, women can induce abortions. It's much more, much more safer. And so providers would advocate women, uh, on how to use misoprostol. They couldn't tell them where to get misoprostol or the coolant prescribed a drug. But, um, based on the right to access information, um, you know, they thought women should have access to the best information to preserve their lives and this is how they build the model. And quite interesting, um, the model was expanded to several countries in Latin America and in Africa and, uh, they drove maternal mortality to zero and in a matter of 10 years. Um, and um, they also pave the way.

Speaker 2:          38:21          Um, I think for abortion law reform would away in 2012, um, you know, pass a law that decriminalize abortion up to 12 weeks, uh, in the country. And I'm absolutely convinced that talking to women, educating providers was key to build support around the needs of follow that would allow women to, uh, to manage this part of their lives. Um, we'd safety and with good health outcomes. Um, so I think some other, uh, it was portrayed in the New York Times and, and very much we are proud of that they, they were able to, to, to create and how a role to play, uh, in such a moment in women's lives are certainly getting maternal mortality down to 0% is an amazing feat. So thank you for that. Um, you know, we talked a little bit about the laws and the restrictions that you're seeing sort of come up in Latin America and the Caribbean, but talk a little bit about, you know, certainly in the u s over the past several years, there've been a lot of restrictive laws passed, making it harder to access contraception, access safe and legal abortion.

Speaker 2:          39:28          How does sort of the policy in the United States and the arguments and, and politics sort of around women's health impact the work you do in the region? Yes, I, you know, the US used to be a place where we look up, looked up for, for leadership on these issues. And, and as I said, that's no longer the case. But, um, in addition to that, um, and in addition to the global gag rule that I talked before the really coattails, um, uh, the possibility for organization to serve women, um, I say that what we're beginning to see is a much stronger, um, violent and aggressive or position in the region, which is quite new. We had not seen that before in a matter of a few months. We had, you know, our office as vandalize in one of the countries, our executive director in another country with death threats and things that we clearly had not seen before.

Speaker 2:          40:24          Um, we also have something that came up in Columbia. There is called the gender ideology, um, a whole reframing conversation around. Um, and it came right at the moment of the peace process. Um, and um, and against all of our issues really a very strongly, and I think we, um, we have to think about, um, as a clear influence. There has been some reports recently I think in the Guardian about the role of, um, the opposition in the u s funding the opposition in many of the Latin American and Caribbean countries. And I think we are going to see more of that in the years to come. So really the work we all do in our individual regions and countries really is interconnected. And so playing a role to actively advocate for policies that advance women's health are important for all of us. Yes, absolutely. Very much so. Very much. John, any last questions from the dory is, I asked to sell just a few last important,

Speaker 3:          41:25          just one last one, which was a lot of the conversation around planned parenthood is on the topic of abortion. But, uh, I understand you put an awful lot effort into other kinds

Speaker 2:          41:34          of services. Well, could you perhaps touch on a couple of those? Um, yes, we, I mean, I've worked on, if you look at our annual report, our chancery, cause I, we're 5% of the services we provide. Um, about 30% are services on contraception, um, uh, cancer screening, a gender based violence. Uh, both, uh, detection screen and, and support. So when you look at, um, um, our, the number of services we provide and the division, um, you'll see that it's a very small proportion. We feel very proud of the work. We do a on abortion version, but we do, uh, much more, uh, indeed. And, um, and you know, as I said, we have been leaders in accessing, in bringing contraception to Latin America and the Caribbean and have done so for about 60 years now. So yes, we provide comprehensive care to women. We feel we need to serve the needs of women, all of them, um, with no exceptions, uh, when it comes to reproductive and sexual care.

Speaker 2:          42:35          And that's how we stand as an organization. And that can be easily verified by hour, by hour. Annual report hasn't changed much over the years. Really. I think that's a great reminder of the resources available to us to learn about planned parenthood and the wide range of work. You all do. So at Google here we're coming up on our annual giving week. Um, Googlers are very involved in giving back to the communities we serve. And communities around the world through our time, through our money. What is the best way for a Googler who is interested in women's health and um, you know, reproductive freedom. What is the best way for Googlers to get involved? Well, first, thank you. [inaudible] we feel your lab. We are really very capital account with us. One of our supporters. I think the first thing I would say become a supporter, you know, um, donate to us.

Speaker 2:          43:27          You can do so through our website. Um, IPPF whr.org this is the moment if it is, if none of the agreements before convince you, this is the moment to double them, uh, on women's right to reach the birth to support all of the progressive causes. There is no best time to do that. Uh, that now because so much is it's under threat, right? Um, we, uh, we just learned that you also have a program, uh, that uh, you can spend your time with us. We would love, I think you have a lot of ideas and thoughts that could be very useful to us. Um, and I think finally, you know, again, you can help us bridge the gap in the most difficult issues we are facing and will make a difference in the next 50 years, uh, in the region. So I love to engage in a conversation or how that could happen accessing young people, um, uh, you know, working together to be able to, to enable that.

Speaker 2:          44:24          Um, so I think there are many ways in which, and, and of course, collaborating and supporting your local planned as well. You know, we're a global movement and the support is needed everywhere. Yeah, that's fantastic. So I want to end on a positive note. You know, you did talk about it. It's a challenging time for women's reproductive rights, for issues of health care, for sexual violence and assault. But in talking to you, I can tell that you have a lot of hope and a lot of optimism for a better future. And can you tell us sort of maybe a story or share a few thoughts about sort of how you keep that hope and optimism? I'm alive in this work, which is so important. It's difficult than your, that automation, which shave them feel necessarily this way. Um, I think we have to keep an eye on the long fight, right?

Speaker 2:          45:13          We've been here for 60 years. We'll be here for 60 more. We are not going to give up on women and um, and we have seen the change that happened. Right. And if you, if one keeps, keeps their eye on the, on that long game, um, we know things are possible and, and, and change will come. It will require a lot of effort. Uh, it's tobacco fourth, it's never a straight line to the finish. There is never a finished right. But, um, but I have, I the confidence in the role of civil society organizations, you know, organizations like ours who will not give up. And, um, and I think it's very clear to us that, that this is a fight worth fighting, if anything. So yeah, that keeps me going. Well, just sell. I've gotta tell you, I think you instilled a great deal of hope and optimism for me today, certainly. And I know for our audience members, and I just want to thank you for that. I think, you know, we touched on a lot of issues today and I think really gave cooglers listening in the world, listening, a sense of sort of some of the issues that we're facing and the importance of getting involved. So I just want to thank you. We're very grateful for you and your knowledge and most importantly, your hope and your optimism. So thank you so much. Thank you so much.
