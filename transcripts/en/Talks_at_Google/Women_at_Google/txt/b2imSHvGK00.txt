Speaker 1:          00:06          Okay, thanks for coming. Uh, I'll introduce our main speaker. Amy Kurzweil have known her for 30 years.

Speaker 2:          00:19          It's a first vote, Huh? Yeah. That, that was planned.

Speaker 1:          00:28          So she's written a great book. Uh, she actually wrote it started as a senior thesis at, uh, Stanford. And finally three or four years later, it was finished and everybody is finally relieved. Okay. You're going to get it out. And she looked sitting there. The illustrations at the end are much better than the ones at the beginning. So I have to do it over and everyone is calm. I got this. Uh, so, but she got that done and then only another three or four years. Uh, it's a very labor intensive process. It's, it's a great book. Uh, if I say so from our family's perspective, uh, but other people have liked it. And New York, it was a editor's pick by the New York Times. They put it on their list of the best graphic novels or 2016 Kirkus reviews said it was one of the best memories of 2016.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Um, and so we, we will talk about that, but we'll talk about some other collaborative projects cause we've actually worked, um, quite a few things as we went through it for this presentation. Uh, she's, uh, her comics had been in the New Yorker, a New Yorker. I had a compilation of the best cartoons in the New Yorker for 2016 and two of our cartoons when they are in, she'll show, she'll share some of those with you. Uh, she's been a number of other publications. Uh, Shenandoah, the toast, they all, she has a ba from Stanford University and the MFA from the new school. She's an adjunct professor of writing comics at Parsons and the Fashion Institute of Technology. So welcome Amy as well.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Thanks Dad.

Speaker 3:          02:25          Thank you everyone for having me. This is such a pleasure. Um, so I'm going to introduce the man who needs no introduction. Uh, you probably know Ray Kurzweil. He's been director of engineering here at Google for over four years. A director, a director, uh, works on natural language, understanding his inventions include, uh, the flatbeds, Danner, omnifont OCR, a large vocabulary, speech recognition, realistic music synthesis. He's been awarded the National Medal of Technology, inducted into the inventor's hall of fame. He has 21

Speaker 4:          03:00          honorary doctorates, a grammy, and he's written five national bestselling books. Not Bad.

Speaker 2:          03:07          Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:12          You might not know, however that one of his lesser known but still very significant achievements is that he plays a bit part in the smash hit graphic memoir, flying cow, doing such important things as helping me get to sleep. That's so thank you dad for that. I'm going to tell you a bit about flying couch before we move on to other things. Uh, this is the story of three generations of women, the first myself young artists. And the second is my mother also happens to be the wife of Ray Kurzweil. Uh, Sonia Kurzwell. She's a psychologist. And uh, last but not least, my grandmother, my mother's mother, Lily Fenster, she's 90 years old. We just came from seeing her in Naples, Florida, where I did a book event down there. She was so excited. She hasn't changed a bit in 42 years.

Speaker 4:          04:14          Yeah. Here she is as a young woman. Um, when I show up. So we did this presentation in Naples, Florida, and she was there in the audience the first time that she's ever been in the audience while I've been talking about the book. And she was just interrupting every five seconds. Exuberantly like she saw. She's like, where did you get that picture? You know, she was so excited about everything. And then also in some moments, uh, it was difficult for her to watch because in this story flying couch, I'm telling about her early life during the Holocaust when she left the worst ghetto survived on her own. She was the only person who survived. So it's a difficult story but also an exuberant story. Um, the best way to give you the flavor of the book is to show you this animated book trailer that I slaved over. So, um, those of you who are animators, I have much respect for your work so you understand what we're doing. I am this then us questions. So I just say I'm lowly fence the night. My whole look was her revive it. Okay. So tell everyone about yourself, huh?

Speaker 5:          05:24          How do you feel about being a character? In my book, I love it mean be Dick head and it's mostly like cut, cut, cut, kind of the at you. Paramount. So you know, but why did you pick that? I have no idea. Who would light the number? Old Jewish woman. Is it going to be successful showing you? I use a Ph d child, 10 colleges for children. I arranged this. My kids, I called Amy has a heart of gold. She goes my first granddaughter and he wants to feel what they went through. Well, I'm thinking I would like it to get married. One Kid Hammer. We should stick together. Then chaplains that you flesh. If you gave a good family life, you ever good light? You survive.

Speaker 2:          06:32          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          06:33          Do you want to sing something? You want me to sit and get a thing? Should I sing in Jewish?

Speaker 4:          06:45          If you want to hear my grandmother's thing, that can be a ranch. Okay,

Speaker 5:          06:53          so you started writing this book eight years ago. Why? Why was this a story you want it to tell them what took you so long?

Speaker 4:          07:02          Well, as I said, I had to draw it twice. So that's why it took so long. Um, so this project started when I was in college and my mother, um, gave me this transcript that my grandmother had done with a historian, Holocaust historian at the University of Michigan. And she, uh, she painstakingly and in a lot of detailed told about everything that had happened to her. Of course, not in a totally linear way, but everything was recorded. All these memories, things that I hadn't heard, um, all at once, but that I'd heard pieces of for my whole life. And, uh, things like, um, her, her early family life, things like that I never knew about or the antisemitism that existed in Europe before the war. Um, the story of her sneaking through the wall and the Warsaw ghetto, there was a few bricks and she was skinny, so she snuck out through the wall.

Speaker 4:          07:56          Um, I'd heard fragments of these stories, but I've never really put them into a coherent whole. And I never really understood exactly what that might mean for me to grow up in the shadow of such a dramatic history. Um, it affects you and it's not exactly clear how, um, so I was a relatively normal kid, um, sensitive and spent a lot of time involved in my creative pursuits. Not technologically inclined necessarily, but I'm creating my own world. And normal is irrelative. Yeah. I had some strange habits or strange bends of mind, certain curiosities about dark things and curiosities about this history. And it felt to me like I had to look at it closely. Um, here's an example of maybe being a little strange a kid. Did anybody use to do that thing where you watch your eyes dilate in the mirror? Yeah. So you can learn about some of my other neuroses in the book, but that's one of the, um, but the main thing that spurred my interest in the story was when I left home to go to Stanford, which was those of you who've been there, it's not that far from here.

Speaker 4:          09:13          It's just a paradise of comfort and privilege. But I was really very anxious about leaving home and it didn't make a lot of sense to me. You know, my life was relatively comfortable. Why would I have so much anxiety about leaving home? And when I started to learn more about my grandmother's story about how she left home under these certain circumstances, I started to think that there was something I'd inherited, some sort of fear. And, and writing this book was the way that I explored that.

Speaker 1:          09:40          I mean, I also heard, I've heard a little fragments and bits and pieces of lowly story over the years, but there were little fragments. And until I read Amy's book, I really didn't have a coherent linear narrative of it. So it was quite a revelation to actually get the story in the, in the linear sequence. Something that I like about the book, it's really combines the holocausts with Umer Umer both of Amy's coming of age and, and humor of Lily herself in her current circumstances. That's very hard combination to pull off. I think the only other time I've seen that in the work of is it's a beautiful life, the movie, but, but they're, the humor is part of the story. The farther uses humor to keep his son Zane. But anyway, so it's a hard combination. So I remember Amy's early efforts in animation and drawing when she was in, I think 10th grade I attended, it was bring your parents to school day.

Speaker 1:          10:50          And so I attended her math class and she's like drawing these little drawings and Casey and looking up at the board, well obviously that angle is equal to that one. Minus. I won. I said, Amy, that's really good math thinking since this, it's not math thinking, it's, it's obvious that angle has to be equal to that one and yet subtract that and said, well, I said, well, when you understand something it always seems obvious. So we're very concerned here with girls dropping out of math and stem in high school, which seems to be a phenomena and we'd like to see more girls and women, uh, you know, entering these fields. Amy Fortunately had and has other skills, but she is a good mathematician. So we need more programmers than our day card groups and we may recruit her and, but, but she is busy with other projects that she'll tell you about. So, uh, but how did you transition to comics? Cause you at Stanford do studied writing and you had this background in illustration. When did you come to combine those two?

Speaker 3:          12:04          Yeah. Well yeah, my drawing career before this book was mostly just drawing during math class. That was the main way that I got to be an artist because they need to do something about the way they teach math. I think that's, but that's a whole other panel. Um, so yeah, I mean I was interested in drawing and I was interested in writing and I didn't think to put the two together until I read certain books, like mouse for example, which is another book that it combines humor in the Holocaust, but it's a short list of things that do that. Um, but mouse is definitely on that list. And there's something interesting about, um, about drawing. So we've, somebody taught me that storytelling is one of our first technologies. I wonder who told me that. Um, and there was oral storytelling and then there was written storytelling.

Speaker 3:          12:54          Um, and it, it feels like one progressed to the other, but there's this other thing in the middle there which is drawing. Um, there's, there have been cave drawings discovered, you know, 50,000 BCE. Um, and so people, early humans were recording their lives that way. And there's something about drawing and comics that they get a little bit of a bad rap for being unsophisticated or being associated with children, um, because they tap into something that I think is more primitive and it really is more primitive. Um, but that's not necessarily necessarily a dig against it. When you draw, you are much more, um, directly expressing something about what you feel or what you see. Um, and so Scott McCloud, the writer of understanding comics, it's a great book. People should read if they're interested. He talks about the iconic obstruction scale. And over here you have images, um, the least abstract way of representing the world.

Speaker 3:          13:50          So like a photograph for example, it's very close to what we actually see. And then in the middle here you have symbols and simplistic drawings, emojis. Um, and then over here on the other spectrum, we have words, uh, which are the most abstracted from reality. And we take for granted that words are abstract, abstract because we dealt with them all the time, but it requires more levels of abstraction in order to understand the symbols that we call words. Um, and so I think that's why drawing gets associated with what is child or primitive because it actually is associated with something that takes less levels of abstracting to understand. But what's cool about comics is that it mixes the two together. And so that mix is so sophisticated if people use the form correctly. And so once I discovered that it was like a revelation, it was, it was so magical and I was just hooked.

Speaker 1:          14:39          Is there a comics particularly good at describing visceral emotional experiences? I mean, what's your relationship there?

Speaker 3:          14:47          I said storytelling is the technology and I think storytelling is mostly a technology. Well, it does a lot of things, but one thing it does really well is create empathy and drawing because it's so connected to the what's visceral, um, and what's, you know, um, like this is a good example. What can't be expressed or, or what's felt? Um, I think it's that much better at, at inducing empathy and readers. Something I noticed when I'm drawing is it's, and it's very difficult for me to ever draw a facial expression. Um, like for example, trying to represent something like fear or anxiety. I can't draw it without having to form it on my own face. And you can experiment with that. It's very difficult. Um, and I can't draw, you know, tension or exuberance or some abstraction without bringing the quality into my arm. And so in this really immediate, interesting way, drawing brings feelings that you're trying to represent into your own body.

Speaker 3:          15:49          And so my grandmother talked about, I wanted to tell this story because I want it to feel what she went through. I didn't just want to know it or understand it. I want it to feel it. And drawing helped me do that. It helped me access that direct empathetic mode. This makes me want to ask you some questions. We were talking about how, um, comics have this kind of modus of sophistication, um, comics. In order to read a comic, you have to do something that's common cloud calls closure. So you see one image and you see another image and you have to knit the two together in order to create a sequence in your mind. And a lot of that's happening in unlike film where that happens for you with comics has happening, you have to do that work yourself. And so I've thought about what that work is like and because you have taught machines to read, um, first with the reading machine and now with natural language understanding here, Google, how hard would it be to teach a computer to read comics? Is that a harder problem?

Speaker 1:          16:50          I've got a few members of my team here and uh, yes, I think that would be quite challenging. Uh, Brian, this smirking I think, uh, realizing how difficult a problem that would be. So we were making good progress and understanding language. We can start to do things like summarization and we have different tasks that require actually understanding semantics of language. And Google has very good image recognition that people are familiar with. Big accusation against the field was five or six years ago, is that you guys can't even tell the difference between a dog and a cat. Now we can do that. Uh, and turns out the essence of a dog and a cat is at level 15 of a deep neural net. And we couldn't go beyond three or four levels because of a math problem. Just a five or six years ago has to do with keeping convicts ever era surfaces.

Speaker 1:          17:50          But anyway, it's a math problem. We could create 10 20 level neural nets, but the information disintegrated around the fifth level. So that problem was solved and now we could go to 2000 level neural nets. And once we pass a level 15, they could tell the difference between a dog and a cat. And now thousands of other categories. And the Google image recognition program can tell cats and dogs and cows and you know, 20 different varieties of birds, but also things like sunsets, autumn love, other kind of more a femoral, uh, characteristics. And it really does a very good job. This is not a Google project, but it shows the power of deep learning. In our Descartes group, we have a different approach to deep learning based on my book, how to create a mind, which is basic hierarchies of models of sequences. This was done with a deep neural net, but you can give it an image like this is just a photograph.

Speaker 1:          18:56          And then say, we'll repaint that same age in the style of Van Gogh and this, uh, or Picasso or munch, uh, who did the scream. He's, that's an actual image. And, uh, so it's redoing that picture of Ralph buildings, uh, in these different styles. So computers are taking steps in the arts and uh, they're not getting human levels. But, uh, I've been saying 20, 29, uh, the AI field, there's been periodic polls. We're getting closer, but not because I'm changing my view. Uh, when I first said 2029 and my 1999 book age of spiritual machines, uh, Stanford held a conference to deal with this startling prediction and it took a poll and the median was about 500 years. Uh, recently. I was just actually at a seminar or conference, uh, not named after this room, but uh, really to establish AI ethics based on the original list.

Speaker 1:          20:09          Uh, biotech is telemark conference, which is now 40 years old. Uh, and there was a poll presented. The median was 50 years. It's actually not because, uh, I mean part of my thesis is the acceleration of progress. Proctors keeps getting faster and information technology grows exponentially and I don't think there's actually a lot more appreciation of that than they used to be, but people, the actual rate of progress now has, is in fact a lot faster than it was in 1999. So peep people look at the current rate of progress and saying, well, at the current rate of pockets, I think it's going to take 50 years. And in 1999, they looked at the current rate of progress as well. I think at this rate of progress is going to take about 500 years. I agreed with both of those. I think at the rate of progress in 19 nine, nine, it would take 5,500 years and it's right in practice today.

Speaker 1:          21:01          It would take 50 years, but the rate of progress is going to continue to get faster. We're going to make 50 years a progress at today's rate of progress in 13 years. Um, anyway, people are getting more optimistic and these are sort of turning complete tasks or acquire all of human intelligence in any implications of that, both in terms of promise versus peril employment, uh, consciousness of computers. Should we worry about causing pain and suffering to our computer software? Uh, people are more concerned today about the opposite and software causing us pain and suffering. But yeah. Um,

Speaker 3:          21:41          well speaking about the future of art, um, we can talk a little bit about our first collaboration that we did together. Yeah. Way Back in 2001 when I was 14 and still had braces, I was roped into doing this a while. I was granted the opportunity to take part in this historic Ted Conference, um, where we were presenting the promise of virtual reality and virtual spaces being places where you can be whoever you want to be, which reminds me of writing, um, and the, the way we get to inhabit different characters and writing. And so we did this project. My father transformed into Ramona who's a rage rock singer. And I unfortunately do not have as much say in my transformation. I was transformed into three. Um, I got to expand my identity across bodies, three male backup dancers who were middle aged and no bit overweight, I have to say, and not wearing shirts and modeled in the image of Richard Saul Wurman who is the Ted Empresario at the time. And so I can't find any images of this online and I wonder if he's responsible for taking them down. So, yeah. Do you want to talk, talk about this?

Speaker 1:          23:02          I mean, you're in Vr. This was in 2001 at 10. Uh, Vr was very primitive. We had a lot of problems with the technology, but both Amy and I were wearing magnetic sensors and as removed these life size avatars on a big screen, moved in sync with us. They were kind of digital puppets of ours, quite had, uh, there were technical issues, but it worked well enough. We pulled it off the performance. So the idea was you can be someone else in virtual reality. You don't have to be the same boring person all the time. Present company excluded. Um, and so I tried to fix him and that was different from myself. And same with Amy. Richard Saul Wurman was not known for his hip hop cakes, but uh, her avatar was actually very realistic. Um, but uh, you can actually go to go to the web, uh, if you, if you're just put in the, uh, in Google Ramona songs, Kurzweil, you can these here, uh, the songs I sang, I sang white rabbit at Gracie slick song and then a song I wrote myself a, and you can hear it both with and without the gender modification.

Speaker 1:          24:21          Uh, it came, came out pretty well. I think this is one of the promises of virtual reality right now. The VR that's coming out, it's fairly static. You basically are in a VR world. There's some technical issues with it. I think the real promise is that you can be an actor in it and interact with other people, but you don't actually have to be the same person and you can actually change other people to be who you want them to be. Uh, so these are some of them. We tried to show this in 2001 so that was our first collaboration, Huh?

Speaker 3:          24:50          Yeah. I mean, I'm curious, I want to ask you about this idea of identity in virtual reality. Conceivably we might spend more and more time in these spaces as they get more sophisticated and this idea that you can be anyone that you want to be. Um, that's interesting to me because theoretically that's true in writing, but in the writing world, there is actually sensitivity about, for example, taking on identities that you don't really have insight into, sir. So, you know, a white person writing in the voice of a black person. Sometimes there's some questions about that. Um, or appropriate. And cultures in general, people are, they have questions and sometimes get offended about those kinds of transformations. I'm often rightfully so. And then sometimes there are times in which transforming our identities, you know, like gender transitions is celebrated and encouraged and virtual reality seems like a really promising place for, um, something like that. You know, somebody who wants to really embody a different gender and they don't have to have complicated surgery. So do you think that virtual reality will have the same identity politics as we see in real reality?

Speaker 1:          25:53          Well, it is interesting that people really begin to identify with their avatar and they seem to transfer their consciousness even if it's a simple game. Um, it was actually interesting, uh, incident recently I've been writing how virtual reality is inherently safer. I mean, ultimately we can be in virtual environments that are just as real. It's real reality. But one advantage of virtual reality is you can hang up. So telephone call is virtual reality as far as soon, uh, talking, uh, as far as far as the auditory sense is concerned. But you can hang up on a phone call if you don't like where it's going. There's usually an incident where a woman, uh, claimed quite sincerely that she had been assaulted in virtual reality. And I had been writing how you really from that, I still think virtual reality is safer because if Chavis he didn't like this interaction and happening quickly enough that she wasn't able to leave and she was densified enough with her avatar that she didn't like what this other avatar did to her avatar.

Speaker 1:          27:00          But it wasn't my avatar. She felt it was her because people do transfer their consciousness. She could then leave that experience. So at least she could stop the continuation of a interaction. She didn't like what you can't always do in real reality. So I do think it's safer, but I thought it was interesting cause I really hadn't expected that you could be assaulted in virtual reality, but cause you could be in a phone call to when someone could say something that you feel is assaultive. And, uh, so virtual reality is the term I think is unfortunate because virtual reality makes it sound like it's not real reality. So you know, if, if you and I make an agreement on the phone and say, oh, well, but that was, you know, virtual reality, that wasn't a real agreement. Um, it is real reality. Yeah. It's just in a different form. So the same rules might apply. Yeah. So I mean, I, there are a ways that it's safer, but there's also ways it's more dangerous because people can be there anonymously. You don't even know who they are. And some people feel like it can take more liberties and they're doing real reality. Uh, both parties are sort of less protected, but that can be, uh, I mean we see all the time people anonymously communicate things that they wouldn't otherwise do if we knew who they were. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          28:25          Yeah. I mean, it's interesting thinking about storytelling as something that induces empathy, a technology of empathy. It's interesting for me to think about virtual reality experiences becoming a mode of storytelling. Like you literally enter somebody else's life and you actually see what it's like to, you're not necessarily saying, now I am this person, but you get this really immersive sense of somebody's life and you have that experience and it's, it's sounds like, um, there's a, there's, there's potential to identify so strongly with that experience that you actually forget to have empathy for it or you end up being traumatized by the experience. It's, it's interesting to me that in, in art and storytelling and even in film, you still have this removal from the experience. And I think that that distance from the experience is important because it gives you the space to reflect and to say, oh, I'm watching this thing and, um, I have this distance from it in order to reflect on what it is and what it might mean. We can move you enough to, to cry or it happened. I mean, yeah, definitely. Um, it's, it seems interesting to me that in virtual reality where we're losing and closing that distance, and is that, is there any danger there for the ability to really feel empathy for the people that we become in virtual reality?

Speaker 1:          29:49          Well, I mean, potentially being more immersive, uh, we can be more effective. And I mentioned this anecdote about this woman feeling assaulted and that that was kind of startling to me. Um, but, uh, I think there is danger and that I think we will move to an era where we're at least in augmented reality all the time. Uh, and that has the potential of increasing empathy because we'll be able to be with people that we want to be with. But then people may enter the, uh, the, uh, situation that we didn't invite. We certainly see that. And social media.

Speaker 3:          30:35          Yeah. Well they're still be experiences, um, that are called, well, there'd be virtual reality experiences that we call art and others that we just call something else, like, just experience. Because what we talked a little bit about art, the roots of the word art being connected to the word artificial. And that route, meaning, um, trickery and crafts craftsmanship and that an inherent in the concept of art is that we are, that it's separate from us and that it's not real. And so I wonder, these VR experiences that we call art, what will, what will make them art if there's so immersive?

Speaker 1:          31:15          Well, I think it's the same thing as, as with, uh, anything else. I mean, you, uh, Gordon Bell invented life pitch in the 80s, so you could record your whole life and then you could do something like the movie John Being John Malcovich where you could actually inhabit someone else's body. And that's actually just about feasible today. Yeah. Um, let's see. Out of their eyes here, out of their ears that, that's fairly straightforward feel out of their skin. I mean, there's ways of beginning to do that. Um, but that's not necessarily art, uh, artists, when you select certain subset of, of our reality to give you some insight into, into deeper truths about, about life.

Speaker 3:          32:01          Yeah. It seems to me that in virtual reality, a whole concept of identity will be totally different. And the things that are connected to our physical bodies are going to be less.

Speaker 1:          32:12          It was very interesting when I became Ramona, how many just kind of interesting. But I felt it was actually quite liberating. The glow. I really felt like I transferred my consciousness. I was looking in a mirror and I was somebody else and I felt more relative to, okay, I happen to have this particular physical body, but that's not the only way to be. I really could be someone else. People very much identify, I'm this skinny teenage girl, I'm the so will wait, middle aged man. But you can be someone else. And it'll be actually interesting when you can have, you know, full immersive virtual experiences with other people being someone else. And uh, I think that I could potentially increase empathy because you can realize what it's like to be someone else.

Speaker 3:          33:02          Yeah. Especially if you can experience their stories and their histories. Because so much of identity isn't just the way we look, but the history is like, as my book was exploring, the histories that we inherit are the kinds of experiences we have because of the way we look and we can really simulate those experiences. Then I think that relapse, that's where are,

Speaker 1:          33:21          cause you've got to be selective and you tell that story. I mean you can't tell the 20th story in 20 years. So you pick the incidents that are, they really make a point.

Speaker 3:          33:31          Well, speaking of transferring our consciousness, maybe you can also tell us a little bit about your first foray into one kind of virtual world, which is the world of fiction.

Speaker 1:          33:43          Yeah. So in this Vr, some thing at Ted, Amy taught me how to actually move like a female, which did not come naturally to me. Um, but uh, I've been thinking a lot about, uh, intelligence since I've written books about nonfiction books, about intelligence. And I think once computers, region, human intelligence say you automatically will be super human intelligent. Um, you know, we've been using computers as it is to make up for weaknesses and our intelligence, we can't remember more than the handful of phone numbers. Uh, most people here could recite the alphabet. But if I ask you to recite it backwards, you can't do that. That's a trivial thing for computers to do. It's a computer's already do a lot of things that we can't do. They can remember a billion or trillion ton numbers easily. Um, but I thought really, uh, illustrate this a, I started to imagine what would it be like if one person and, uh, a young girl happened to be half superintelligence.

Speaker 1:          34:57          And I don't actually explain that. Uh, have a preface to the novel were saying, well, this does someone like Danielle, who's, it's very super intelligent girl, exists in the world today. And I said, well, from one perspective, anybody can be a Danielle. And we have young people, certainly college students who do things like start Google or apple or Microsoft. And we have high school kids now that are doing amazing things. And I think anybody who has the courage to pursue their ideas and to overcome sort of artificially, uh, imposed limitations and our thinking in our confidence in what we can do to the world can be a Danielle and make dramatic changes in the world. Uh, then I said, well, does anyone actually exists? It has the broad range of Danielle's superpowers has superpowers not melting steel with our eyes. It's melting problems with her intellect and her artistry.

Speaker 1:          35:53          And I said, well, perhaps not yet. So this book is a thought experiment. What if someone with Danielle's confidence and courage and an intellect existed, what would that mean for the world? Uh, and then I say, now imagine if we were all Danielle's and that will happen by the year 20, 45. So my publisher said, well, we need a backstory cause you know, superman has a backstory. And I said, well, I'd rather give my backstory as to why I wrote this novel cause I didn't want to say, well she's a girl and she's fused with AI and our brain or something. It would seem to pat. But anyway, she's a girl who follows her from zero to 22. Um, and she does remarkable things. She goes to Zambia at age six and solves part of the water problem. She becomes a worldwide country music stars. Page h he overthrows Kadafi was software viruses at age 10. She cures cancer at age 12. She brings democracy to China at age 14 and becomes, it's first democratically elected president. Um, she becomes present United States at age 19 by defeating Hillary Clinton. Um, that'd be a better choice. So, uh, W W I made a VR trailer we can't show you via yet for an audience of the site. We'll show it to you in two D. Right?

Speaker 2:          38:00          How long do I have? Precisely. 11 minutes.

Speaker 6:          38:05          Really starting to sink in that I've actually been elected chairman of the Communist Party of China. Some people seem surprised because, well, I'm a 15 year old girl from Los Angeles. I suppose part of me is surprised too, but the other part has been expecting it. It's been a complicated path to get here. I started out innocuously as a child that didn't talk. I didn't really see the point of it at least until I had something to say. I loved books I taught myself to read, but I didn't want people to know. I purposefully held my book upside down to throw my sister Claire off track. Clear by the way, was an orphan from the Haitian earthquake that mom and dad adopted two years before I was born.

Speaker 2:          38:46          Okay.

Speaker 6:          38:47          Well, I finally joined the conversation and said my first words when I was two. My mom was shocked at my insights into the word on him on a pia and dropped the blueberry dessert all over. Claire and me. The Dad took it in stride.

Speaker 6:          39:02          It wasn't very good at making friends. Well, at least the other kids had a good time. At my fourth birthday party, I finally made my first friend when I was six in Zambia, halfway around the world. I went there with Claire to help with the drought. We ran into a lot of predicaments like feuding warlords. By my calculation, we solved one third of 1% of the water problem. The world discovered me at eight when I was debuting at the country music festival, but I learned that fame has a steep price. The peace conference that clear organized in Libya. It turned out to be kind of a disaster. I ended up protecting the rebels and my sister with software viruses from our outpost in the Libyan desert. Negotiating a Middle East peace agreement was more complicated than I expected, but I had help from a wise rabbi in Brooklyn. Tragedy struck when I was 14 I discovered that there is an unrelenting banality to debt. Well, I better gather my thoughts and my acceptance speech. I'm the first teenage girl to be elected chairman of the Communist Party of China and I'm not even Chinese. I have to say I'm not really comfortable with that title of chairman. How about chair woman? No, that doesn't make sense. Either 15 someone suggested id just called chair and I'm not a piece of furniture. I've got a chair girl

Speaker 2:          40:27          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          40:40          Amy was my writing coach for fiction, which is actually quite different than nonfiction. You need is a character arcs and you need a story arc. Every story is the same. It has a, what's called a Christian arc. The character runs into problems and then more problems and then all is lost and then the bottom falls out and it's completely helpless. And then there's the resurrection at the end. Let me look at stories you'll see that they all follow that aren't, um, anyway that Amy did the illustrations. Um, and there was an interplay between writing the story and the illustration. Could she write an illustration that say, oh, that's what Danielle was thinking and what are you seeing this character in your mind does he wrote? Yes, actually it had fantasies about Danielle and for years. And finally I'm one vacation, but six years ago decided to write them down and had draft one of the novel. But I had the long way to go to understand the craft of storytelling, which as you pointed out with the first, our first technology. Um, but then your illustrations actually helped me to understand the stories that there was an interaction there. What'd you say a little bit about your next,

Speaker 3:          41:51          yeah. Novel. Well, the next part of that, I'm working on the beginning of our collaborations. This is Fred Kurzwell, a father of my father. And some of you might know if you saw the movie transcendent man that my father has this collection of documents and artifacts that he saved from his father. And I'm in a storage unit. I've actually been to this storage unit. At first it was like definitely haunted. Um, it was in this, you know, dark, all these dark alleys and nobody else was there. And like floors and floors of different storage units and the lights would turn off if you weren't moving. And it was the very horrifying, I had an interesting experience there. Um, and, and now you've moved those documents to a less haunted building, which makes her not as good as story. But, uh, so it's interesting to me why you've been saving all these documents.

Speaker 3:          42:44          Theoretically, we will come to have such sophisticated AI that we could take these documents along with memories and recreate an Avatar of this person who died quite young. Um, and I'm really interested in, you know, what that might look like and why we might do that. Um, and for me store, you know, stories especially in flying couch had such a, a meaning to my present life, the past and its relationship to the present, uh, has given my life a lot of meaning. And it's things like something I've had a lot of questions about. And so with this, if you can actually take the past and make it literally a part of the present by bringing somebody back, um, what does that mean? What, what does that going to do for our sense of self and our relationships? And so I'm curious to explore that in my, in my next,

Speaker 1:          43:32          well, I mean that was the theme of the movie transcendent man. We can create a chat bot today. We have the technology to take a corpus of writings and create a chat Bot that represents that person likes you planted. Do that with my father's writings as we did that with Danielle. Actually you can talk to Danielle, but it's not that human levels yet. I think ultimately wouldn't be x. You can pass a chain test. One of the implications is we could create a someone that is very much human like and that reflects all the information we have about them, even their DNA and uh, recollections of other people and all of their artifacts.

Speaker 3:          44:09          I mean, what's interesting is as a writer or something you're trying to do is to do as much research as you can and then trust your intuition about how to write about real people who lived. Um, so with my grandmother's story, I had to trust my intuition and I had a certain amount of information and I was able to bring her to the page and I'm wondering, will an AI one do that process better than I can, you know, will they have access to more information and potentially have more emotional nuance? Like, am I going to be out of a job? Probably.

Speaker 1:          44:42          My view is it's not us versus them. We're going to use AI to make ourselves smarter. We do that now. We carry these ais on our belts and who here could do their work or anyone in the world can they do their work or their education without these brain extenders already have. And then we're going to get more intimate with them. We're going to put them in our brains. We're going to connect our brains to the cloud. So we'll be actually better at doing these kinds of things. So if we could just take a couple of minutes in the shares, some of your cartoons, a similar one, the first one you had in the New Yorker.

Speaker 3:          45:15          My first New Yorker cartoon was Google inspired. This is the first one. Do you guys have any studious Google cars around who are, um, am I second cartoon was

Speaker 2:          45:37          Rhode Island.

Speaker 1:          45:39          I don't know. So probably close to doing that, but uh,

Speaker 3:          45:42          we both have robot cats. I got mine for Hanukkah last year and it's very, robots are very funny to me. I've, I've draw a lot of inspiration from artificial intelligence, um, for my cartoons because there's just something about robots in their current form that is like, you're, you're like, you feel for it. You know, you want it to be more, you know, because you're like, just try a little harder. You can be human or you can really be a cat, you know. Um, and this robot car, we have it, it's pretty crude and, but I was thinking, you know, to be a cat, it's not that hard actually. You just have to just have to sit there. Um, so yeah, I draw, I draw a lot of inspiration from are my dad's worked for sources of humor as well as more profound thanks. But you know, humor is humor and humor is connected to what's profound. I think we find things funny because they really resonate with something true about our condition. Um, so I thought to wrap up, I'd show you guys some of my unpublished cartoons and you can help me figure out which ones are the best. So I can, you know, go to Bob Makeup at the New Yorker and be like, everyone at Google said that this one. And I know that there's a partnership, something, you know, a partnership between the cartoon editor in Google. So maybe he'll, maybe you guys can help me out. All right, so here's the first one.

Speaker 2:          47:06          Good. All right. The future of art. Cool.

Speaker 3:          47:27          How went, took a second.

Speaker 2:          47:38          Okay.

Speaker 5:          47:39          That's how I would like to play golf. You never know who you're offending me.

Speaker 4:          48:24          I think that's a good place to end.

Speaker 2:          48:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:30          So cool questions, comments.

Speaker 7:          48:34          Hi. So it's interesting that you brought up the one panel two panel inferring what happened in between the panels in a comic for the things that people write or something like the panels in the story of their life and the getting an AI to speak in the voice of someone else using these panels involves inferring what's in between those two panels. There was actually a black mirror episode about doing that and it hitting the uncanny valley. How do you think human storytelling as a technology could be transferred into doing this for robots?

Speaker 4:          49:15          It's interesting what you say. I can only speak from a writer's perspective that you do so much writing before. What you put on the page is if you know, inked or is printed, um, you really have to have a full sense of a character before you can write them convincingly. And so much of that is unsaid and that's sort of what minimalism is about and it's what any good writing is about. And I think that's why people feel that in order to ride really well, a certain character, you need to know so much about them, which is why bridging racial or cultural divides, it's so hard for writing. Um, and so yeah, that sounds really hard. I mean, in order to really write convincingly, especially something like fiction or nonfiction, something more literary, you're, there's so much that you have to know.

Speaker 1:          49:56          Dan. Kenny valley is a key issue. I'm glad you brought that up. Particularly as we get to more and more immersive taps, reality that if we create a reality that's very different. So one of the first animated movies, it was Shrek. It's not really quite humans. I didn't really attack the uncanny valley. We get to more realistic portrayals of animals and humans. So we have that challenge. Jungle Book. I though was good at actually leaped over the uncanny valley, at least for animals. It looked like a movie of animals, but they were talking and the acting and so it was clearly animation, uh, can't quite do that for humans yet. Uh, in rogue one, uh, this one character they brought back, uh, through animation. I thought it was still in the uncanny valley. Some people thought it was cool, but I don't know.

Speaker 4:          50:50          There's a kind of uncanny valley, not just for visual. I think that's what you're getting at is like there's some kind of stilted, emotional thing going on with, you know, when you, if you talk to an AI and it claims to be having this life, but you can just tell, it's like you don't really have that life, you know, that's a sort of narrative, uncanny valley. And um, it just sounds like levels.

Speaker 1:          51:12          It was interesting. Dennis Hassabis at this beneficial AI conference presented the Alphago. He spent the whole presentation on this one move in this key game that that Alpha go played. Uh, and it was a move off. It was early in the game and it played a move near the corner. And any amateur knows you don't do that because you need to control territory and having a move that's right, right near the corner. Early in the game when you could really try to begin to control some territory doesn't make sense. And everybody groaned at this. And then at the end of the game, it turned out that that was the most brilliant move. It was key. The AlphaGo wouldn't have one without that amazing move. Now I've been talking about how I think when computers pass the Turing test, they will be conscious. And I talk about consciousness and my books and it's not a scientific concept.

Speaker 1:          52:08          Do you need a philosophical leap of faith as to who and what is conscious? But, uh, so some scientists like my mentor, Marvin Minsky, at least at times, would say, uh, don't, don't worry about consciousness is just an illusion because it's not scientific and there's no way to have a falsifiable looks, prime minister who and what is conscious, my view is to can't abandon consciousness because it's actually the fundamental value in the world. And our morality is based on consciousness and unconscious entities, only important insofar as they affect the conscious experience of conscious entities. So you really need to make that leap of faith in my leap of faith as if it really is convincingly acts conscious. Uh, and you really are convinced it is having the subjective experience of claims to be, which is not the case yet. We'll see how that they are conscious.

Speaker 1:          52:56          That's my leap of faith. And so AI is when they really pass a valid Turing test with emphasis on the word valid. And that's a whole nother discussion. Uh, will be conscious. But my feeling was, I mean, Alphago made this brilliant move. I didn't feel like when they made that move with a Ha, I've got him here. Uh, and that there was a conscious objective experience. They went along with that which a human would have had you saying, okay, I'm going here and boy, this is going to really shock them and ultimately I'll be vindicated and

Speaker 3:          53:32          well, didn't have an emotional investment in its victory. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          53:36          So, uh, it's interesting. I mean I think if it's acting human and certainly in the, and the world to go, it was acting super human because not even the human masters were shocked at this move and ultimately turned out to be the right one. I didn't feel that Alphago had a subjective experience to go along with that. You wrote a memoir about some very personal stuff. How do you make sure that when you're writing about something so close to you, you also, uh, have enough distance to make it good art?

Speaker 3:          54:13          Yeah, that's a great question. I mean that's probably part of why it took so long. You know, a lot of the experiences in the book I was writing about as I was, um, having them, and then you have to let a certain amount of time go by before you can really say, okay, this is done. And so I think maybe comics, there's something about comics that actually can be helpful because you put yourself a reflection and Avatar of yourself on the page and then it creates, it takes on a life of its own. Um, it's no longer you, it's like a character that you've created that's reflecting certain true things about you, which is what fictional characters do. Also. Um, maybe this, the degrees of separation are just, you know, slightly less here. And so once I could really see this character as separate from me, even though they were a reflection of me, that made it a lot easier to edit and trim. Um, and then also having readers helps, you know, people who can say, ah, this is bad. And you're like, okay, you know, you have to be quite humble I think to do it.

Speaker 1:          55:20          Um, and talking of consciousness, it often seems very vague. I often ask, uh, what is consciousness but itself? Um, so I was wondering about how we can elucidate that idea with, uh, other elements like reflective self awareness, uh, uh, anything more concrete that we can use to sort of put around it. I've said that there's no machine you could build that has a red light and a green light and you're sliding into Vienna. Okay. This one's conscious. Now this one isn't, that doesn't have some philosophical assumptions built into it. And so John's Searle at Berkeley would want to make sure it's squirting biological neurotransmitters. Otherwise the greenlight wouldn't gone. Dan Dennett would do moral about what you've said, which is to have a model of its own thinking and to be able to self reflect. Uh, but you could imagine, uh, you know, a, a Zombie that did that, that was able to convincingly talk about its own experience and you could build a model of that today doesn't necessarily mean it's conscious.

Speaker 1:          56:26          And so my conclusion is it's a philosophical issue, this to actually a role for philosophy beyond science, uh, but that we actually need to make that philosophical leap of faith. And we all make it to some extent. Three, assume other humans or conscious is leads. Most other humans. Um, most of the time, uh, people disagree about animals. The whole, uh, animal rights argument is a, is about what, whether animals are conscious and to what degree. And uh, I think Mike Cat was conscious. Uh, not everybody agrees. I think they didn't meet my cat, but then we'll have arguments about computers. That's the key thing. Uh, John, I'll make this a detailed argument. How ridiculous it would be that a computer program could be conscious and there's was really nothing more to his Chinese room argument, which I won't recite now, uh, other than the absurdity that a set of rules could, could be conscious. But then I took his essay and I simply substituted a symbolic manipulation for, uh, uh, manipulating neurotransmitter concentrations and made a very convincing argument that the human brain has no consciousness, no understanding. And uh, ultimately, I mean the human brain is made of neurons and we're understanding neurons is machines somewhat complicated but not that complicated. And so the whole brain is a machine. And where's the consciousness? Where's the free? Well, um, so it, it is a philosophical issue and I don't think you have to be biological to be conscious.

Speaker 3:          58:11          I mean, it's also, it comes down to being a kind of a showing of art and empathy. Like if, uh, if the AI is convincing enough, if it's like good enough of a writer or you know, good enough of an artist, it convinces you, and that's what's important. Um, and I think that's true for humans too. I mean, we read a lot of things and we're not convinced. And, uh, it doesn't mean that we think that person deserves to die, but we do discount how much credit we give them and how much we're willing to respect people if we aren't convinced by how they communicate. And so it, it seems like it's, you know, that just in another substrate.

Speaker 1:          58:48          All right, well, thank you very much,

Speaker 2:          58:49          chuck.
