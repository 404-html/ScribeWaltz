Speaker 1:          00:06          Rebecca katz of clean soups. Welcome. Thank you. I know the weather cleared a little, but when we were planning this event, we thought what a perfect time to get together and talk about not only comforting, nourishing food, but something that'll make you feel your absolute best for the new year. And I was speaking at length with Rebecca before the event about how obsessed I am with this book. So do not hesitate to get your copy. I can't stop making soup and I not even really like a super person, but tell us what's the idea behind this magical vision of yours? So today I think what we're gonna do is I'm going to make one soup out of the book. It's the Moroccan carrot soup with Chermoula and it's one of my, it's, it's what I call from the cashmere sweater soup collection. I'm going to use this handy Dandy Ferrari of blenders, the Vitamix to whip in this incredible amount of air.

Speaker 1:          01:07          And so we're gonna make this soup and it has a special broth. It's called the magic mineral broth, which we will talk about. And, um, and I'm just going to start so we can get the soup cooking and then I'll go into a little bit of like, um, more about what the book is about. So the big challenge for me today is how well I'm going to be able to use the stove top. But anyone who's been to an event with us now as it's not the most intuitive cooked, but I feel like I have a lot of technical support. We have your back. Yes. So I'm, I think I'm good. So, um, when I start making a soup, the first thing that I do is I add some fat to the bottom of the pot. And in this case I'm using all of whale and I'm going to talk a lot about this card that you have with the acronym that is called Fass at ass, which is bad acid salty.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Sweet. And so just to give you an idea that is like a little magic carpet that transverses your taste buds a carries the flavor back and forth. So if you're eating food that doesn't have any fat in it, it's kind of like, Eh, there's something that's not satiating about it and you just kind of keep wanting more and more and more. So it used to be that fat was like, Eh, but now we know that fat is really good. Fat is really good for our brains, but it's also the key to carrying flavors. So I'm letting my pot get nice and hot and I'm starting to see that my olive oil is shimmering. So far, so good, and said here, I'm going to add the first ingredients, which, which are some audience. So when I make soup, usually I'm starting with the base of like onions, carrots, and celery.

Speaker 1:          03:19          But this soup is just onions. And the second thing that I do is once the Iranians go into the pot, I give them a generous pinch of salt. Now salt is like a little scrubbing bubble and it goes into the onions and it pulls out the Iranians natural sweetness. I mean, we don't really think of onions as being sweet, but there's a lot of liquid in here. Um, the, a lot of sweet liquid that's going to be released. Now I'm going to turn this down. And so every time I add what I call like a new food to the pot or new, it's like I call food, like my little cast of characters. And, um, every time I add something new to the pot, I'm always going to add a pinch of salt. And this is what we call layering. And this is like, so you're, you want to constantly layer your flavors because that's where you're going to get what I call the maximum Yom.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So, um, I'm just letting this go for a little bit just to get, just to get a little kind of like golden glow or golden hue on these onions, because I'm in, this can be a little bit, if you don't let them get golden, if you don't kind of let them get to that translucent stage in cooking, they can be a little sour. So adding the salt in to help release the sweetness and just letting them go a bit is a, um, is a good thing. So, um, you asked me why soups, I like what's the deal, what's the deal? Well, so I've been a suit maker, my, well since I was five and I was sitting on my mother's yellow formica counter in her like 1953 Youngstown kitchen, which she still has with the old coil electric stove, the whole bit. But Anyway, um, uh, I come from a family of soup Sharmans and then, um, when I was in culinary school, I really, um, I gravitated to soups and um, I feel like soup is like giving somebody a culinary hug.

Speaker 1:          05:49          You can get so many, I mean there's nothing more nourishing than a really good bowl of soup. And there's a lot of the alchemy in making soup and creativity and making soup. And I think it's also of all of the, the, the culinary mediums, like all the things that you can do, saute grill, be a saw ca or whatever. Soup is the most forgiving and it allows for creativity. So, um, it's really good for people like to color out of the lines which would be made. Um, and it's so I laugh because I like as a, I create recipes and I have to write everything. You know, I have to, I'm getting everything dialed in. Like all my measurements are dialed in and, but really, oh, you're just throwing stuff, just find stuff. Then. I mean, so it's like I have to use my left brain when I'm creating a book, but when I am left to my own devices, I am just like, you know, um, hats off to the wind.

Speaker 1:          06:55          I'm this throwing, but this is not your average soup cookbook. This is not just a regular soup cookbooks. Yeah. So you're right. So I have, I do a lot of work in the health and wellness space and this is my fifth book child. And um, and the cookbook that came before and all the soup chapters in my previous books were my favorite chapters to write. And I really believe that soup is a portal for really amazing nutrition. And I don't mean nutrition that's like, or a healthy food like hippy gruely or you know, just like Eh, meth. I mean, like, like really Yummy, sustainable food. And so through the book, what I do is I give you sort of you the keys to the Kingdom of a how to make soup. Like what do you need to have to do it and what are the tricks of the trade, what, what are the tactics behind it and what are all the nutrient dense things that you can put in a soup to make you feel like all your cells are sort of waking up, right? So now I'm, my onions are exactly where I want them. They're like, see, they're like Nitel Golden, they're beautiful and golden. So now I'm going to add the star of this soup, the carrots.

Speaker 1:          08:34          And so with those carrots I add another generous pinch of salt and now I'm just going to stir them up

Speaker 1:          08:50          and get them nice and coated. And now here is where I'm going to add like all my spices. Now oftentimes when people make soup, they think they never know what to do with their spices. Like when they're first starting, it's like I'll throw them in at the end or I've, I've heard all different variations on a theme. Usually standing in like the supermarket line. I'm hearing people and I'm like, no, you don't want to do that. So, um, so here I've got this, this is the base, right? And there's all this lovely fat and um, everything is dancing in the pan. This is where I'm going to put my spices. Now full disclosure, I am putting in saffron a pinch of Red Chili pepper flakes, cumin and coriander and some cinnamon. Now when you look at the ingredient list of a Rebecca Katz Book, you go, really, God, it's like so long. But when you realize that like I'm usually using like five spices or three spices and that takes up space. But if you have your pantry set up and you have your spices, then really you're only dealing with carrots and onions and olive oil. I could completely testify. I've been making soup side of this book since the New Year and I have only had to shop for ingredients one time. Everything else was things that I had on hand just was able to play with.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Yay, really accessible and really delicious. So one of the things that's really interesting about the herbs and spices is that we don't necessarily think of spices as being like we think of them as being flavorful, but we don't necessarily think of them as being like these antioxidant powerhouses, like, like amazing spices can do amazing things to our bodies and we don't necessarily think that way. Um, but for example, I have a teaspoon of cinnamon, has more antioxidants than a half a bowl of a half a cup of blueberries. So super powerhouses, so many phytochemicals and things that you know, can shift gene expression and all sorts of things. So the here, I mean we're making soup, but we're also again adding some incredible nutrient density. So I am going to add, right now I have a cup of the magic mineral broth, which you and I will truly magical, truly magical, which, which we're going to talk about in a minute.

Speaker 1:          11:43          But this is what, um, this is what I call creating a flavor seal. So I've got half a cup of Broth, which I'm just using. I'm just gonna let it boil and reduced just a little bit before I sync the rest of the broth in. And what that does is it concentrates all the flavor and it almost like seals it up so that when I go and put the rest of my broth then and I let it cook, all those flavors are going to kind of do their thing. They're going to just permeate those little carrots and onions and everything else. And that's honestly, that is the trick. This part right here, it's like Saute your audience and good olive oil, salt. Put your spices in the main event, put some more salt in, do this little thing with half a cup of liquid and you are sat. So in the book I have a template where I literally, I do this template about how you, you know the stages of which you, what you, how you put things in.

Speaker 1:          13:01          And it's like once you learned that you can make any soup any way you want with any vegetable. I mean we could be working with any vegetable here. Carrots are kind of easiest specially because they're so easy and accessible and warming and easy to chop. And when I was in culinary school and we were doing knife skills, oh my God, we had to chop carrots. I remember hauling back to my apartment like five pound bags of carrots just to practice. So, um, now this is just where I want it. So I'm going to put the rest of my magic mineral broth in here. And this is about eight cups. I'm going to probably use six and just keep some just in case. And this is a great way to store, um, your broth in the freezer, in these types of containers. All right. And now I just need to find a lid.

Speaker 1:          14:15          Ooh, Lid guys coming. Lid coming. Great. Incoming. Thank you. Thank you Noah. Thank you. Okay, so you ready to go over and tow yet the main event? Talk about this broth. Okay. CanNot get enough. All right, so, so this broth has a little history. So this is, these are the ingredients for the magic mineral broth. And I created this broth 20 years ago and, um, it took gallons, two cycles around the earth. Um, and I, it would like so specific just in terms of all the ingredients and getting it dialed in and it's Kinda has a cult following now of which I am one newly, I cannot get over it. And it's the reason that it's so different than a normal vegetable broth is that I'm using it like normal things that you would find in stock. So carrots and celery and parsley and, um, but then I add like sweet potato, like this is a Hana sweet potato.

Speaker 1:          15:36          It's like there's so many different variations of sweet potatoes, but this is a had a sweet potato or you could use a white Japanese sweet potato, or if you don't want to fuss, you could just use any sweet potato. But, um, but chef dd was kind enough to get me the varietals here. So, um, Garnett, a garnet sweet potato, um, a white sweet potato because this has a bit of a nuttier flavor to it. And then just some red skin potatoes and onion. And then this is where we kind of get funky. I have some bay leaves and peppercorns, eye of newt. No, just kidding. And then just a little and some garlic and onion. And then this is um, Combo. So now I wouldn't use all of this, but I would use about this much. Now Kombu is usually used to make Dashi. Um, but here it adds a very distinctive like Umami flavor.

Speaker 1:          16:50          But also this is so chockful of trace minerals and, and certain compounds of B vitamins actually in this little strip. So this is like nutrient density to the, to the, to the, to the, you know, whatever combo. And it's a seaweed. So it's a kelp. Yeah. So you can get an in any Asian market, you can get it at whole foods. It's got the shelf life of a hundred years. I ordered some online. Yeah, Amazon prime. I had mine the next day. Yeah. So very accessible and long shelf life. So like, so you're a magic mineral broth may occur. So you, this looks kind of intimidating, right? A little bit. It's a lot. At first when I got it all assembled, I was like, okay, a big pot, luckily. Right? So there are two ways you could go about this. If you've got a big pot, right? Um, you can just do

Speaker 2:          17:50          one whole batch at once. Okay. Now I call this the chop and throw, which was the best part. I mean, once I cleaned everything, there's, there's really no other work, right? Because you know, here's the deal, right? All of this skins on all of these, right? The mineral content in your vegetables are right is right there. Okay? So this isn't what I call Glam Arama stock. I mean, this is not like, you know, a gorgeous Boone, y'all or whatever. I mean, there's sediment that you will get when you strain the stock, and that's great for the kind of soup making that we're doing, right? Because it's adding more nutrient density and it's not this clear concent may that you're serving to the queen of England or anything. So we're okay about it. It's like a rustic stock. So literally it's like chop throw. Really. It's like, um, I think I even did a video where I was like chopping and like throwing it in the back or whatever.

Speaker 2:          19:01          So, and these are cut. Um, these are, these are like the hugest sweet potatoes in the land. I mean, this is like, should I go and dog? But, um, so you could cut this smaller and again, you're throwing it in all of this. Now if you don't have a huge stock pot, right? Um, you could buy all your ingredients, chop it all up, take half, put it in a zip top bag, put it in your freezer and make just a half a batch. Okay. The other thing is if you have an instant pot, this cooks really fast in an instant pot and it also is great in the slow cooker. The thing about cooking it on the stove is that you get this, just checking on this. Hang on. See, I'm becoming friends with this. See, we got it at the time. Yeah. So the thing about, um, the broth is that it's sort of like aroma therapy because really my house smells amazing. Every time I make it, it's, it does. I don't think it's the allspice berries and that culmination of the allspice berries and the w whatever, but it is, it really, it smells beautiful. The ultimate winter candle and it's like, so you're Starsen now like on the big proponent of making this broth and in my book there's a Venn Diagram and the diagram is the middle is the magic mineral broth, right? And of this broth you can make five other really fun. So he make

Speaker 1:          20:48          this once, right? Then you can make a Thai coconut broth, which is amazing. I pay her. Amazing. Okay. Just Fyi. No, I showed up today and was like, let me tell you all the reasons why I'm obsessed with your book. We scheduled the event long ago and I have become a complete diva. She ever say she's a major. She's, she's like on the verge of becoming the major magic mineral broth. I mean, I'm going to get a sign, I'm going to walk around. Right? You didn't tell people about it. Maybe you could get it from her. Right. So, and you can make a bone broth out of it. You can make a beautiful pasture be foam broth, you can make a chicken bone broth, you can make a homemade veg, you know, you can make it, you can amp it up and make it into a big immune boosting bone broth with burdoch and ginger and Tumeric.

Speaker 1:          21:38          But once you've got it made in your, in your freezer, and I love freezing it in these kinds of court. And look, this is the best, the tape, right? It's like everybody needs tape like this to make sure that their broth is marked. So it doesn't turn into a science experiment. But how long could you keep it in the freezer? Two months. Oh No, this is six months of this guy to like a long shelf life. And we're not lasted that long. I've been using it, but right. So it lasts a long time. And if you're tight on freezer space, you can let your broth cool. And you can let your, you can let it sit on the stove over night and let it cool. And because it doesn't have any beef in it. So or or animal protein so you can like let it and you can deep can't it the next day and you can put it in zip top bags, just get all that air out of it and then just lie it flat.

Speaker 1:          22:42          Um, so that's if you have, if your real estate challenged, right. So the whole key is if you've got broth in your freezer, you have soup in 20 minutes. That's the, that's the proposition. And then you can make, you know, all of these different soups and then when you make your soups and there's a whole thing about storage, like once you make your soup, what are you going to do? Like back in the day I would make soup and it would be like, oh my God, I'm eating the same soup for five days in a row. I couldn't be more bored. I never want to eat the soup again. Now when you make soup, you take half of it and eat and the other half you freeze. And either this size or in pint size containers and you mark it and you develop a freezer inventory so that when you come home at seven or eight or whenever you have soup, you

Speaker 2:          23:45          have like a variety pack in your freezer. And based on how easy it is to make, I mean, I was able to make the broth and two subs in an afternoon on a Sunday and have done that then like three times and have just had like eight or nine different soups hanging around in the freezer. You're exactly right. It's the, the quickness of it. It tastes like it's been simmering all day. Right. But it's actually really quick process. So I think that's where people, um, we think of soup as being this long simmering process. Like when Mike Dad, I made soup when she made chicken, you know, her homemade chicken soup. I mean, it was like a major production, uh, because she was doing it all at once and you know, but it really doesn't have to be that way. So I'm going to check, I'm doing this like speed flash.

Speaker 3:          24:42          So can I ask a question?

Speaker 2:          24:46          Oh right. If you are making a bone broth and we're going to get ready to go here in a minute. Um, if you are making a bone broth, you're the reason to let it simmer for ever and ever and ever with some vinegar in it is to pull all that collagen out of the bonds. Right? But I'm going to give you a shortcut. You can buy really high quality powdered Collagen if you don't want to simmer, you're brought that long and you want to add that extra boost, whether it's a bad stock or it's a bone broth. If you don't, if you know you don't want to go down that road. But yeah, that's, it's, it's, it's getting all that glycogen and college and out of those bones and you know, bum bras, amazing guys. If you ever need a reset broth is really a good, a nice way to go. More so than juicing really, at least at this time of year for sure. So you ready to blend? Yeah, let's see it. Okay. Cashmere sweaters. Here we come. All right. So,

Speaker 3:          25:54          um, hang on

Speaker 2:          26:01          the off the off. Ah, great. Okay. So let's see if I can make it to the blender without burning myself. I May, I may, but let's see. Okay. So normally I don't feel my Vitamix this high, but, um, since I'm front of the, in front of a large group of people, it sounds, it's like a dramatic moment and very cover your eyes.

Speaker 3:          26:54          Okay. Yeah. Wow. Okay.

Speaker 2:          27:03          This is why I take a towel. Are you sure you might get spit art on your, okay, so this is puts the cashmere in the cashmere sweater soup. Okay. Now I'm going to put on my glasses so I can see what I'm doing and I don't hurt anybody. I'm going to start on variable.

Speaker 3:          27:45          The [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          27:57          so far so good.

Speaker 3:          28:01          Everyone's saying,

Speaker 2:          28:26          oh gosh, okay. And everybody saved so far. Okay. So

Speaker 3:          28:40          now

Speaker 2:          28:44          I've got soup, but not quite right because one of the most important things about soup is what does it tastes like at the end? How many people have made a recipe and they get to the end and it's sort of like [inaudible]. Yeah, I definitely right. And there's that missing thing and you're like, what is that missing thing? What is it? What is it? What is it? And I spent all this time and money and whatever on my ingredients and it's still kind of like, so this is where I'm going to um, have like three people to come up here with Jenna and be my taste testers. Who else wants to come? Yeah, come on, come on up. And we are going to,

Speaker 3:          29:37          okay,

Speaker 2:          29:38          we are going to do what I call a fast check. So we've got our fat in here. Now we're going to talk about um, how you finish off as soup. So, um, what I am going to do first, everybody gets a spoon.

Speaker 3:          30:00          Thank you k. Now

Speaker 2:          30:09          we've got to go from Yuck to yum, right? One is the worst. I would never eat this. 10 is that involuntary spasm of vocal delight where you go. Hmm. Right. And I'm just going to see where we are.

Speaker 3:          30:33          Okay.

Speaker 2:          30:35          So I'm not going to say where we are, but I'm going to have come in, bring your spoons over. This is like the magic trick. This is like once you master this and you have your little cards, you will apply it to any cooking you do. SNEAD's salts. Yes,

Speaker 3:          31:11          yes,

Speaker 2:          31:13          yes. Oh my God. It needs who's been studying their card? No,

Speaker 3:          31:21          I actually got real depth to you.

Speaker 2:          31:25          Oh my God. See fast master. I'm not alone. You're up bass master. You know? Okay. So here's, so let me explain what, what you're tasting to everybody when something is kind of hanging in the back, right of the palate. It's sort of like in Nowheresville, right? And what salt does is it moves flavor from the back of the palate. I care to the front here. Right? And because it's so bland, right? You can't taste any of the flavors that are in there. So we're going to put some salt in. And the other reason to, now everybody's walking around that you're going to be walking around with seesaw, that you're in your bags and Lennon's right, because the, what the lemon will do is it will an acid acts like a little Pixar animated character that goes in and brings up, makes a food brighter, and also is going to bring up all those spices that are in here that we can't really taste.

Speaker 2:          32:39          Okay? So I'm not even gonna ask for numbers because I know. All right, it was spot on completely right. Yeah. Alright, so I have a Meyer Lemon here, which I brought from my tree, so I'm going to give it now. People are afraid of salt sometimes. Don't be, do not be afraid of sea salt with its 80 plus minerals because again, you're trying to make food taste good. It's not like having a lot of fake sodium in processed foods. Whole foods are full of potassium and potassium and sodium are likened. Fred and ginger Rogers there, dance partners, they go together. Okay, so you're not going to, you're not going to have a problem with adding like a keep adding until you're getting where you want to get. All right, so I know that I've got to add three. Rebecca pinches here. Okay. And then I know I'm going to add,

Speaker 3:          33:45          okay.

Speaker 2:          33:46          Probably about a two teaspoons of lemon juice. Little bit more lemon juice. See, it's like alchemy. It's the question is how, how are you making that decision for our friends on the live stream? Yes. Okay. How are you making that decision? Because it's still wasn't bright enough and I knew if I put in a little bit more lemon juice, I get some more spices coming up at the top. All right, now spoons again and let's see if this has changed it. We're almost, we could be on this therapy still needs more. More lemon juice to it.

Speaker 3:          34:55          Yup.

Speaker 2:          34:58          Okay. This is a pot of soup. Pseudo don't, you know, and my broth was not seasoned, right? So I'm dealing with no seasoning. Okay. More lemon juice. And then I'm going to do one more thing that I haven't talked about.

Speaker 2:          35:16          My grade B Maple Syrup, I call it a drape of mape. Okay. And I'm only going to use like a little cap fall. And what that does with the sweet we'll do is even though the carrots are sweet and there's like a sweet underneath in the broth because of the sweet potatoes, a suite can act not just as a, um, acting as a sweetener, but to round out and balance a flavor. Okay. One more time. And are those things necessarily on your ingredient list or those are just things we should have in our arsenal there on my ingredients, I always cue you to taste and that you might want to add something else to it.

Speaker 2:          36:09          This is good. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Okay. Now, one more taste because I'm going to put a little topper. So twist our arms. Okay. So don't go anywhere because I've got to put the topper part on. So we're going to put the Chermoula, which is a Moroccan pesto and this like a soup topper or a dollop as I call a dollop of yum is like putting, um, a piece of jewelry on a black dress. Did I get a, wow, did I, do we hear a yama? Yum. In voluntary delay. Involuntary spasm of Vocal Delight, right? The Chermoula, it's gotten more acid and more lime in it. So you all are going to taste this, but you just saw, what I really wanted you to experience is this is what you take into your kitchen, right? Just these little ingredients here is going to make such a difference.

Speaker 2:          37:22          Nobody should be eating at a five when you can eat at a 10. And what you'll do is you will tinker and I wanted you to have the little cards and it's in the book to all about fat acid, salty and sweet. And you just just follow that, you know, and also the Chermoula had some olive oil in it so that your mola was parsley, mint. So those really high bright notes and um, a little bit of sea salt, lemon juice and olive oil and that's it. And some spice, some cumin and Paprika. But even if you were just to put, um, just, uh, and that by the way, the top or you can use on fish, chicken, whatever. It's like it's Shimmy Chimichurri it's a Moroccan Chimichurri. That's exactly what it amazingly delicious. So that is, that's what I have to share with you today. You are now, I hear by now w suit masters. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. Does anybody have any questions? We have just a couple more minutes.

Speaker 3:          38:31          Yes.

Speaker 2:          38:32          What should be the temp of the broth when you're cooking? You know, um, room temp is fine and even if you've just taken it out of the freezer and you sort of defrosted it, it's fine. I mean, again, it's going to do what it's going to do it, there's no hard and fast rules. It might just take you longer to, exactly. That's it. That's all. It's can slow the cooking time down, but room temperature ideal. But if you're doing it on the fly, go for it. Hard to mess it up, right? Yeah. Tenure. How do you know where to get good saffron? Ooh, okay. So there are a couple of places at home would, there are lots of places online, um, at whole foods or is as uh, they, it's called Spice Lee. And, and also I use them as a resource. Um, they, what's great about them is they make these small boxes of spices.

Speaker 2:          39:35          So you're not like buying cute and they, they had beautiful saffron. Yeah, because you want it, you don't, and also the thing about saffron, no more in your cooking than ever than half a teaspoon or else you will get kind of a must musky thing going. Now you talk about the number of threads. Yeah. And there's a sweet spot, right? There's a sweet spot. Don't pass, go over tips on animal protein based breaths. Hmm. Yeah. And then you can turn it into, oh, so once you've had your vet, you know, you can do the magic mineral broth one of two ways. You can do it as a vegetable, vegetable broth. And then if you decide, hey, I want to make a bone broth, you can roast your bones, put it in the magic mineral broth and let it do its thing for a long time. Or you can just start with roast, you can do the whole thing, all your vegetables, roast your bones, put it in and let it go. So either way, the thing about starting as a vegetable base is that it gives you a little bit more flexibility in terms of what you might use it for. But anyway, it's fine. It's really easy to take it from the magic mineral to one of the broth variations. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          41:08          Is the instapot actually good for making bone broth? I, um, I think it is just fine. It really, you know, because basically you're cooking under pressure and those minerals are like great. They're coming right out. It's not, it's there, there, it's, if we were talking about, no, it's, it's, it's definitely, you're not losing anything in the instant pot because it's all like trapped right in there. Right? Yeah. And it's all trapped right in there. No, it's perfectly fine. All right. Well, thank you so much. Thank you personally and on behalf of of Google. Loved it. Thank you so much.
