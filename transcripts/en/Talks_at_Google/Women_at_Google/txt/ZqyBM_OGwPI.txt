Speaker 1:          00:07          Good afternoon and welcome to toxic Google. Today we're joined by Arlene bloom, celebrated alpinists in biophysical chemist as a mountaineer. She lived the first all female ascent of Annapurna, one of the 14 8,000 meter peaks on Denali. She Co led the first women's team climb. She was the first American woman to attempt Mount Everest and completed the Great Himalaya traverse across Butan, Nepal and India. As a scientist, she's worked as a tireless advocate for consumer safety. Her research has focused on the use of toxic chemicals in everyday products. This work has led to bands and carcinogenic flame retardants and children's sleepwear and household furniture. Currently she serves as executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute and as a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley's department of chemistry today, she will share stories of climbing and policy from her memoir breaking trail, uh, climbers climbing life. Please join me in welcoming Arlene bloom.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Well, it's really great to be here sharing adventures in both science and mountain climbing because I suspect many of you have your own adventures and things relating to science and it probably feels like mountain climbing. Um, so I'm going to send, some of you might be looking at me and thinking, you know, that I seem like a regular person, and how did I start doing all those crazy things? So I will start back where it all started. That's my freshmen chemistry lab at Reed College. And my chemistry professor was a young woman. She was 23. She had a phd from Mit and thought chemistry was the neatest subject on the planet. There were four girls in my class, and we all got doctorates in chemistry, which says something about the importance of role models. Um, also, my chemistry lab partner was a very handsome young man, uh, from Portland who was a mountain climber and late one starry night, he said, do you want to go climb Mount Hood?

Speaker 2:          02:14          And he was very handsome, so I said, sure. And we drove up to timberline lodge and he put a big pack on my back. I was from Chicago. I had never done anything very physical in my life. I started gasping. He later said he didn't think I'd make it out of the parking lot, but he was very handsome. I was very determined and we got up on the snow. It was the most beautiful place I'd been. I fell in love with him and with mountain climbing and started a life of mountains and molecules, or we said peaks, public policy and public health. So I continued doing expeditions. Um, back in those days, the world's highest mountains had not been climbed much by women. And indeed when I applied to go on an expedition to Denali, the highest mountain in North America, I was told that women didn't have the physical strength or emotional stability to climb mountains like Denali.

Speaker 2:          03:10          So this is the first all women's expedition on top of Denali, which I took the picture so I'm not in it. Um, and so I continue doing mountains and molecules and then things really changed on this beautiful mountain in India. Now isn't, this isn't a stock like a easy, beautiful mountain. When do you all like to be there? It's nearly 24,000 feet, but it's general snow slopes and reclining this mountain and got, um, up to near the top. It was our summit day and I'm kind of a slow climber. So the others got to the top first. And when I got to the top, someone said what happened to Bruce who had gotten there first? And Bruce had walked along here to what was here, which was snow, but it was actually a cornice or the snow is over a rock face and the cornice broke and he fell to his dad.

Speaker 2:          04:06          And Bruce was the country's leading young rock climber. He had pioneered the hardest droughts in Yosemite without using p tons. And it was just unbelievable that he died on this easy but high mountain in India. So when that happened, I got very depressed at the time. I was a postdoc at Stanford studying how proteins fold and that seemed really irrelevant and I wanted to do something for the environment in Bruce's memory. And so I went to a professor of Mine at Berkeley, but I, my Earth Committee, Bruce Ames and said, is there anything I can do to help the environment? And he said, well, why don't you look at the flame retardants in children's sleepwear? He said, right now, pretty much all the kids in America are wearing pajamas that are 10% by weight of flame retardant called brominated Tris. And I think it might get from the pajamas into the children.

Speaker 2:          05:03          And it's a cancer causing chemical, I think. And so it seemed a little weird to me, flame retardants. But I was depressed and I thought I want to do something. So I found a little girl who'd never worn interest treated pajamas and we put her in the pajamas and collected her urine. And the first morning she wore them, she had tris breakdown products in her urine and she wore them for three days. The level of Tris in her urine went up and she stopped wearing them and it went down. So it meant the truss was getting into the little girl. And then we ran a screening test to see if Tris was a Mutagen, did it change DNA? And it was one of the strongest mutagens ever studied. So this was a huge worry and we thought, oh my goodness, we need to tell the parents of America that most of the kids in the country are wearing pajamas that are 10% by weight, this harmful chemical. So about that time I got invited to go to this mountain. Do you know what Matt? And this is, anybody know not Everest. It's the highest mountain in the world. And at that point, no American woman had ever even had a chance to try to climb Mount Everest. So I was like, wow, this is such an opportunity and I didn't know what to do. Should I stay and write the paper about the Tris treated pajamas or should I go try to climb Mount Everest? So I can't help but ask, how many of you would have stayed and written the paper about the tryst cheated pajamas?

Speaker 2:          06:36          Most of you, how many of you would've gone to Mount Everest? Ah, even more. Well, I did both. So I did go to Mount Everest and when I was climbing in the Khumbu icefall every night I write the paper. And then up in the great western coon cow, we put stringing ladders and making her way. It's the crevices and we get up steep ice faces. And every night I keep working on the paper until I reached my high point. Here I am at about 24, five on Everest. And my summit flag, um, the mutants has a petri dish without Tris. There only two colonies cause it's a Mutagen. And this one you can't see, it's blowing in the wind. That's the Tris Petri dish with many bacterial colonies. So this was on October of 1976 and we did reach the summit. We were the second American expedition. Now people reach the summit all the time.

Speaker 2:          07:37          But the first American expedition was 63 and we were the second one in 76 so it was much less, and we had the whole mountain to ourselves. Only one expedition on Mount Everest, which is a little bit different nowadays. So I finished the paper, I sent it by mail runner to Katmandu and it was published in science magazine a couple months later. And if you read the subtitle of the paper, um, the main flame retardant in children's pajamas is a Mutagen and should not be used. Now that's a little bit of an unusual title for a paper. If any of you, I'm sure you have, if you read scientific papers, they tend to have the same recommendation at the end almost invariably. And what's that recommendation at the end of all scientific papers? What is the next step? More studies. And it's always more studies and it tends not to be something like a chemical should not be used in kids pajamas.

Speaker 2:          08:40          And at the Green Science Posey Institute, our goal is to really help inspire, encourage scientist to take their research and tell people what needs to be done. Because scientists are the ones who really know, they understand the science and then they understand what needs to be done. And we believe that that science is to have a responsibility to share their science in a way that affects change, particularly if they're working on harmful chemicals. So, and it works. Scientists are very respected when they speak up. Things happen. This was January of 1977, uh, where we called for tourists not being used in kids pajamas. And April, 1977 Tris was banned from kids pajamas just like it should be. And that was a really good thing because whole generations of kids only wore it. It was only used for a couple of years, which is a very good thing. So however, when a chemical is banned, there's a big tendency to replace it with another chemical that's very similar because industry likes to keep processes as similar as possible.

Speaker 2:          09:45          It makes sense. Um, and if it was funny, I remember about six months after the Tris ban, I thought, I wonder what they're using now, if they're still using tourists. So I remember I rode my bicycle to penny's downtown Berkeley and I bought 20 pairs of pajamas and all different sizes. And the sales lady just gushed to me, Oh, you have such a nice big family. And I sort of felt like a super spy with all my pajamas. And I thought, well, these might make nice shower presence for my friends. So I just took a little fabric out of the inseam of each Pajama. But I actually didn't need to bother since none of them would. I have wanted to give for presence. And then I analyzed what was in them. And not surprisingly about a third of them had brominated Tris, you know, cause it takes time for the market to turn over.

Speaker 2:          10:32          But then nearly two thirds of them had a new chemical, which turned out to be chlorinated Tris almost identical. And so we went, oh my God. So we ran more immunogenicity tests and chlorinated Tris also as a Mutagen, it changed DNA. And uh, we at another paper in science and chlorinated Tris was removed from pajamas. However, what we didn't know then as it continued to be used, for example, in furniture, and in 2005 when a very bad flame retardant was banned from use in our furniture, it was replaced with coordinated Tris, which was then band in 2012 but if any of you have a couch that was purchased between 2006 in 2012 anyone have a couch sleep purchased during that time anyway, there's about a three quarter chance that your couch, 5% of the weight of the foam will be chlorinated Tris. So if you have 20 pounds of foam in your catch, you have about a pound of this chemical in, in your couch.

Speaker 2:          11:39          Not the best, but we didn't know it back then. And back then I thought it was really time to give women a chance to climb one of the world's highest mountains. So, um, in the 70s, all the roads, 8,000 meter peaks, there are 14 of them. The highest mountains in the world had been climbed by men and no women had climbed that high. And I thought women should have a chance. Um, we've done pretty well on Everest, so I got a permit for Annapurna on my way back from Everest and I thought it's the lowest of the apple. It starts the first of the 8,000 meter peaks ever climbed among the lowest, it must be one of the safest and easiest, but as it turned out, there wasn't so much research in those days. So guess which is the most dangerous of all the 8,000 meter peaks Annapurna and which has the highest, the highest fatality rate and is considered perhaps the most difficult to climb.

Speaker 2:          12:37          Anyway, we didn't know that, uh, but we found out, so this is our team. Uh, we had 10 climbers, a couple of filmmakers, base camp manager, we're all still friends. Um, there are copies here afterwards. I'm happy to sign copies of Annapurna or breaking trail for people. And Anaplan has just been reprinted. Um, like September 15th, a CRQ books had been out of business and the book had been out of press for a few years. So it's just back in past and we're all going to be getting together for an print, a book party next month. And I have to say when we get together, it feels like we're back on the glacier and just like it did in a long time ago. So climbing Annapurna was incredibly beautiful. I'll just share a few of the pictures place that the beauty was extraordinary, but the king was really tough and there were huge storms.

Speaker 2:          13:34          The reset, it's such a dangerous mountain is very high precipitation and these huge snow falls lead to huge avalanches. Uh, so it was a very dangerous place ever since I became a mom. I haven't wanted to go there. Um, but wonderful climbing. And we did reach the summit. We were the first women, the first Americans. We reached the summit with two sherpa climbers. We unfurled are flags, um, held together with the save the whales pen and we felt content that we have achieved our goal, but we tragically lost two of our team on a second summit attempt. So climbing an opponent, it's a very, very dangerous thing. Um, I, I wrote this book and a Pronoun, a woman's place, which now as I said, it's just been reissued this week. Um, and then I wrote another book breaking trail. I'm trying to understand how my childhood and my life had led to both my scientific research and my, and my mountain climbing.

Speaker 2:          14:34          And when I finished breaking trail, it was in 2006. Um, I'd spent 20 years writing breaking trail. It was like a personal therapy project. It was a lot of work trying to understand my family and I just finished the book. My daughter was starting, I thought I really would like to go back to doing science, but I hadn't, I actually stopped being a scientist in 1980 to walk across the whole Himalayan mountain range. I had a job at UC Berkeley and I said, I want to take a year off to walk across the Himalayas. And they're like, we have to decide you want your chemistry job or the Himalayas. So I chose the Himalayas in 1980 and um, many things intervened. It was 2006 26 years later. And, um, when the last sentence of breaking trail, it is the sun. Um, the future is like an unbroken snow slope.

Speaker 2:          15:31          I hope I can find a way to break trail to a better world, but I actually really didn't know what I was going to do because if you haven't done science for 26 years, I thought, well, maybe like you had a job washing test students in the lab. You know, I thought I must be completely out of date, but that was nine years ago and the last nine years I have felt every day. Like I was climbing Annapurna like I been on my life's greatest adventure and it's been really similar because we're working with a great team of scientists and business people all over the world. A bunch of people in Google or on the same team, um, really working together for healthier and safer products. And, uh, it's a, it's a real challenge, but you know, a real opportunity. So I felt incredibly lucky that I could not do science for 26 years and then come back and be able to, to, um, really try to climb this mountain.

Speaker 2:          16:28          And the reason that we're all climbing this mountain is there is a big problem and that is, I sometimes ask this question, I bet you'll know the answer, but what do you think? Do you think if you have chemicals in your shampoo or your toothpaste or your chair, anyone thinks the government is making sure they're safe for their, your health? You all know not, but most people do think that. I used to think that and the government actually can't because they don't have the authority. There's only one law about chemicals before they go out in the world. Once they're out in the world, you have a clean air act, the clean water act, but you can't really bring them back in. So they only law before they go out in the world is called the toxic substances control act. It passed in (970) 660-2000 chemicals were grandfathered like you're okay and even a chemical, I guess bestest that kills 10,000 people a year cannot be controlled by the EPA and you might say as best as there, as best as law suits, asbestos is illegal.

Speaker 2:          17:34          Well as best as is not illegal, there are lawsuits and there's a rare form of cancer called Mesothelioma that's only associated with this Bestus exposure. So if you're an asbestos worker or the specify in his bestest worker and you get Mesothelioma, um, you can sue the asbestos industry that that's the reason for your disease and you'll probably win the case, but you also will die. Everybody who gets Mesothelioma dies and that's not a good way to regulate chemicals. And that's how we regulate a stasis through lawsuits. By then, it's really late. So the 62,000 chemicals, nobody can do anything about. There've been 20,000 new industrial chemicals. No data is required. Most of them have no health data. Two thirds have no data at all. The EPA has six weeks to try to show harm with no data. And if they do show harm, the company has several years to try to prove their chemicals.

Speaker 2:          18:37          Okay. And they can sell it during those several years to raise the money for the testing. And once they're out there selling it, it's really hard to stop it. So basically, and indeed, I'm going to speak at the EPA tomorrow. In fact, if anyone, anybody wants to hear my talk, you can tell them 10 o'clock tomorrow, I'll be speaking by the post office, the main EPA building. Um, ask the EPA, they say we can't even Banis best us. I mean, they say that it's, it's really a problem. Another problem. And in fact, the fact this leads to what two brilliant pediatricians, herb Needleman and Phil Landrigan said that we are defacto conducting a human toxicological trial, um, our children and our children's children's or the experimental subjects. So if these chemicals aren't tested, uh, in any other way, they're tested on us and that's not a good thing to do.

Speaker 2:          19:37          And they do contribute to increased rates of cancer, infertility, neurological impairments. So another problem is what we call the regrettable substitution problem. If after a lot of work, a chemical is regulated, the substitute is often the chemical cousin. For example, over here we have, you know, chemistry. We've got Deka, Bromo 10 bromines die fennel to fennel rings that could brominated diphenyl ethers. That's an ether bond with the oxygen in the middle, and it's persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. So after many years, and it's about 15% of the weight of the plastic and an average TV is deck Abramo. Dot. Fennel ether, um, it's used in fabric, back codings, many uses, um, due to its severe persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The decade ether has been phased out, but what's the substitute? Deca brominated dive fennel ethane. So there's an ethane bond instead of an, it's also persistent biocumulative and appears to be toxic.

Speaker 2:          20:53          So as the decade ether sales go down, the decade ethane sales go up, is that a good deal? Not much improvement. So it's a discouraging situation, however, everyone's looking depressed but me, right? Because I think there are things that can be done. And, um, to solve this problem, we decided to bring together scientists who cared passionately about this to really focus on what could be done. And so we have had a series of retreats, uh, where we invite five scientists from industry, five from academia, five from Ngos, and five from government. So it's about 20 scientists, maybe 25. And at the first retreat we said, are there certain chemicals, certain chemical families that we know are harmful, that can be avoided? A simpler way of thinking of this? You know, when you think of that 80,000 chemicals, it sounds kind of daunting. Like, oh, you can just kind of put your head down and get poisoned because who can deal with 80,000 chemicals?

Speaker 2:          22:01          So we came up with six classes and this is a solution that really invites action. And so briefly, the classes are highly fluorinated chemicals. These are standing water repellent like Scotchgard. Let me just ask, how many of you knew or know, and by the way, there's a handout at the back when you leave that lists all the classes and more information about them. But let me say, how many of you know that Scotch Guard is a problem in these chemicals? Okay. One person who works in this area, um, but when people know they can make better choices, the next class is the chlorinated antimicrobials, like Tyco San and triclocarbans and liquid soaps. Who knew about them? A couple of people. Then we have the flame retardants. Who's heard about the flame returns? Okay, you've all heard about the point returns. Uh, we have this fantasy. Remember those bits?

Speaker 2:          23:00          Funnily water bottles, ballet, it's organic solvents, certain metals. And you look at this list, this is most of the harmful chemicals in everyday products. And when you know they're there and you know what they are, you can make safe choices and avoid their use. And even more than that, we want to ask if they're in that class. Is this chemical really necessary? So if the chemical that makes a carpet standard palette is a highly fluorinated chemical that's quite toxic and never breaks down for geologic time, maybe if you'd say to a mom, you can have a stain repellent carpet, but the chemicals going into your baby's body. And what would the mom say? Maybe she might say, it's not worth it. It's not worth it. Um, so I believe just asking these questions, do we really need it? Is it necessary? You can stop the use of a big chunk of these chemicals really reduced their use.

Speaker 2:          24:03          And then if you think they're necessary and they're worth it, then say is there a safer alternative and really invest in that safer alternatives. So we've heard about green chemistry for a very long time. It's been around for 20 years. A caustic book was written by John Warner, who's here in Boston and I'm Paula Nastiness. Um, and it's a great idea. Everybody loves it, but it's not happening as much as it should. And so if a kind of function is needed and you really want that function, then invest in green chemistry, not in moving to the chemical cousin. Um, we have a webinar series about these six classes. They're 15 minute webinars. There's a flyer in the back. And uh, when we played the Webinar series, when we ran them live, about 1200 people signed up and they were for many of the retailers and manufacturers across the country.

Speaker 2:          24:57          And amazing things happen. Like there was a Webinar on antimicrobials and after it was on, someone from target called and said, we had no idea that we had [inaudible] sand in our personal Caroline and we're taking it out. And they just took it out like right away. So companies can do that overnight. For government, it's much, much harder. So if you want to learn more, you can listen to this webinar series. Um, purchasers are key manufacturers of consumer products can just stop using toxics in their products. And that is starting to happen. Large retailers can say we're not going to sell a Kia is our leading example. A Kia has it said no more fluorinated chemicals. Almost all of the six classes a Kia is not putting in any of their products, which is really inspiring. And then corporate big buyers can say, we're not going to purchase products with these harmful classes of chemicals and consumers.

Speaker 2:          25:57          Consumers is a hard group to reach. They get many messages. They're pretty busy. Uh, so we prefer to work with some of the larger purchasers and manufacturers. Um, and the actions for manufacturers is to come together and say, we want disclosure, we want to know what's in our products. And then we want to really ask if harmful chemicals are needed and ask for products without them. And if that's not possible, invest in Green Chemistry. So a very cool thing is there's a buyer's club out in California and Google is a number along with Kaiser and Facebook and all these companies and they've all come together with their tens of billions of dollars of collective purchasing power to say, we want transparency for manufacturers, we want to know what's in products, and then we're going to come together and buy safer products with less toxics. And that's really exciting. I know I've just spoke at Harvard earlier today in Harvard says they want to organize a buyer's club here in the northeast and see if they can get MIT and other educational institutions.

Speaker 2:          27:04          Um, Oberlin's talking about trying to organize one in the Midwest with a lot of the small schools there. So buyer's clubs can be really powerful and can really move the market. Uh, yeah. Here's Harvard saying they want to make a buyer's club targeting harmful chemicals on campus. So we're going to talk now about flame retardants. That's how I started doing all this. And the reason they're there is back in the 70s standards were made for products, children's sleepwear, furniture, foam, plastic building, insulation. And these standards led to the use of flame retardants. And nobody asked if the standards provided a fire safety benefit or asked about the harm of the chemicals. And with flame retardancy only way to change things is to change standards. Changing the chemicals doesn't work. There's always a chemical cousin. But if the standards change, then you no longer need them. So back to people's couches.

Speaker 2:          28:05          Several of you bought your couches bef between 2005 and 2012 and you have chlorinated Tris, the same chemical that was removed from kids pajamas. And the reason is a California standard called technical bulletin one one seven. If you go home, you lift the center Christian of your couch, you'll probably see a label that says [inaudible] seven and this is not a very effective standard. It requires the foam inside the furniture to resist a very small flame for 12 seconds. And so if you think about that, what happens if you drop a candle on your couch? What Burns first, the fabric. And when the fabric burns, you have a large flame and then the foam burns and two or three seconds. And when foe, when foam has is treated with flame retardants and it burns, it gives off a lot more smoke and toxic gases. And what kills people in fires is such smoke and toxic gases and so technical and, and one, one seven has been around since 1975 and there's no data to show that it's provided any fire safety, but it is instead ended up that the toxic flame retardant chemicals are, and most Americans bodies the chemical.

Speaker 2:          29:24          So if you brought your couch before 2004, anybody have a couch from before? 2004. Okay, well those who are worse because they all have a very harmful chemical. Um, the pent up, it's pent up brominated [inaudible] ether a big mouthful, but the top picture up there is polybrominated by fennel, a PBB or a PCB. Those are toxic. They're persistent. Pcbs, you know, are not good molecules. If you, instead of having a covalent bond, you have an ether bond between your rings, then you have a polybrominated by fennel ether. And if you burn or oxidize, that becomes another ether bond. This is a dioxin and a few man. So this is the flame retardant that was used from 1975 until 2004 to meet to be one, one seven. It's happily instructure between the Dayaks and between the dioxin and a PCB. Not a great molecule to have in your home, in your dust, in your body.

Speaker 2:          30:33          And in fact, we had a group of Berkeley students, summer students studying chemistry and policy at Berkeley collecting foam samples and getting them analyzed. And one of the professors said that the students should not touch that PBD flame retardant except wearing full gear and a fume hood. And I'm like, but it's in everybody's furniture. So that is an unfortunate thing. Um, and almost all the use of the chemical has been in North America in large part to meet this standard, but it has traveled the world as a global pollutant. So when we make these sorts of chemicals, they go all over. Um, there are hundreds of animal studies showing a neurological and reproductive harm from the Penta chemical. And about two weeks ago, studies were finalized showing it indeed does cause cancer in humans. If pregnant women have higher levels, it takes them longer to become pregnant.

Speaker 2:          31:32          Um, and during critical windows of brain development, their thyroid hormones are altered so that their children will have lower birth weight, impaired attention, uh, poor coordination and lowered Iq. So the average California Chubb has lost four to five Iq points just from this flame retardant Penta and economist calculated and $9 billion loss in earning power in California children due to Iq loss from Penta, which is one of the many, many harms from this chemical. So how does the chemical end up in us? Um, it's a semi volatile organic chemical and SVOC. So it's continually coming out of furniture, dropping into dust. And if you say eat a sandwich, you have some dust on your fingers, you eat a little bit of dust, the Penta ends up inside of you. Um, children, toddlers who chrome, the dust put their hands in their mass tend to have three to five times higher levels than their parents, which is not a good thing. And cats have up to a hundred times higher level compared to humans. Why would cats have such a high level because of their grooming behavior?

Speaker 2:          32:52          So as I said, no fire safety benefits, serious harm, uh, we came to realize that TB one, one seven, the standard could be changed to a fabric standard that could be met without flame retardants that would stop the fire in the fabric. So they didn't need to be any flame retardants and you could have increased by your safety. Does that sound like a good idea? So we had, uh, a bill with Senator Mark Leno there in front and our bill was supported by the furniture industry who didn't like putting toxics in their furniture, foam industry fabric industry. Firefighters supported it because they knew the flame retardants didn't help and could cause cancer. Everybody supported it, but these bills never passed. And the reason was Californians for fire safety and they, this is part of a one week long $7 million advertising campaign when one of the bills almost passed and they were very determined, I believe, to keep their market share and selling flame retardants.

Speaker 2:          33:57          And the legislators tended to vote for California. It's for fire safety rather than business firefighters, scientists and the public. And this went on for about six years and I go to hearings where the lobbyist for the flame retardant industry would be saying, it's not sound science to say there's harm from any flame retardants. They've all been evaluated by the EPA evaluated. What did they find? They don't say that part. So we decided to put together all the science and in a big meeting in San Antonio, we developed the San Antonio Statement. It was signed by a couple of hundred scientists. It documented the harm and the lack of benefit of the flame retardants. And it was published in environmental health perspectives back in 2010 and still nothing much happened. Um, I would sort of joke, I, when I went to parties, people would ask me what I did and I'd start telling the whole story of the toxic flame retardants and everybody's furniture, no benefit, and get all wound up.

Speaker 2:          35:03          And after a while they'd go, I have to leave now. And I'd see them on the other side of the room talking to someone else. And I thought, oh my goodness, am I going to spend my whole life being this woman who rants at parties about filing returns? You know, Stonyfield just a little crack powder ish. And then things changed when the Chicago Tribune, I had pitched this to many, many reporters, but the Chicago Tribune did a fantastic job. Uh, this is the first front page, the headline, a deceptive campaign by industry, but flame retardants into our homes and into our bodies and the chemicals didn't even work as promised. And this story documents, it's kind of what I'd been, all these hearings I had been to, there was awfully sis burn doctor who'd won the Dalai Lama compassion award. And he was always talking about some poor burned baby.

Speaker 2:          35:58          It was this horrific death, this baby at all because there were no flame returns in her crib and it was horrible. And it never really connected to what the subject of the legislation was. It made no sense. But he would do it and then everybody would be very emotional and it would give the legislators sort of covered to vote no on these new standards that would increase by her safety. And so these reporters kind of research the hearings and they listened to four times. He talked about the burn baby and they realized they were all different. And then they confronted him and he said, well, really? I was just kind of talking. Um, but there was a baby and he gave them a picture of a baby and they tracked it down and this baby died for a completely different reason. And the mother was really unhappy.

Speaker 2:          36:51          And the doctor said, well, we're not under oath in California so I can say what I want. And ultimately it was learned that he was paid $240,000 for his testimony and he stopped being a doctor. So, but real scandal, you know, in the series, if you want to read them, you can read playing with fire. They came in second for the Pulitzer. They won all these environmental awards and everything changed. So instead of me being this person, but parties ranting, suddenly Dick Durbin was ranting in the Senate. Uh, there were hearings in the Senate. Um, this really empowered Jerry Brown, our governor. That series came out in May, 2012 a month later, Jerry Brown directed the state agencies to revise our standards so that we could reduce and eliminate dangerous flame returns. And at the same time increase fire safety. So this made a huge difference. And thanks to this, uh, we now have a new standard.

Speaker 2:          38:00          You can go out and buy a couch that meets TB one one seven, 2013. Um, and as you see your couch, we'll have a label on it and it says either contains flame returns or contains no flame retardants. So you, you can have that choice. Um, foam, plastic building insulation. Unfortunately, the materials that make buildings energy efficient, polystyrene, poly, urethane and puff, probably ISO Cyani rate contain the worst flame retardants and there's no benefit. You think about foam below the cement below the grade down there, it has flame retardants, there's no oxygen, there is no fuel source and nonetheless flame retardants are required. So we are now and it's really hard been trying to change the international building code to allow foam plastic without flame retardants where there is no fire safety benefit. The big hearing is September 30th. Um, and it's really a struggle because the same three companies who make the flame retardants are adamantly wanting to keep them in our building installation.

Speaker 2:          39:09          Um, if you want to reduce your own flame retardant exposure, uh, it's not a bad time to buy new furniture or to swap out the foam in your furniture for safer from or else to vacuum with a hepa filter, wet mop and hand wash. It all reduces exposure to dust. Um, so I'm going to go now through the rest of the classes much more quickly. A highly fluorinated chemicals I think are the worst of the worst. The carbon fluorine bond is the strongest in the periodic table. Um, it really does not break for geologic time. So this class of chemicals are very oil and water repellent, but they never break down. They just accumulate on the planet. And the chemical that was mostly used was something called the Pfoa or c eight, eight carbons surrounded by fluorines. And this is a book stain resistant nonstick, waterproof and lethal, the hidden dangers of ca.

Speaker 2:          40:14          And it's very interesting because it tells the story of the harm of c eight and a story that what happened was [inaudible] was used in the making of tough fun. Um, dupont dumped the ca in the water supplies and communities in Ohio and West Virginia. Uh, people got sick, they sued, they measured the levels in thousands of people who had very high level. And then they looked at health effects. And among those people, this is again, human health effects. They found higher levels of two kinds of cancer, cholesterol, thyroid disease, all those health conditions. And those people sued dupont. And the first hearing is today. So this happened a long time ago. Today is the first lawsuit I read about it and dupont had known since the 60s about the harm of c eight. They had been monitoring the water supply, knew it was in the water, but they claimed that the levels they didn't think were that high and they said, and if the chemical had really been harmful, but government would have regulated it, that was their argument.

Speaker 2:          41:28          So, um, we'll see what happens with these trials. But dupont is actually spun off all this liability. They have a new company called Kenmore's that has the liability and makes these chemicals. So it's not clear what the outcome will be, but you can follow it online. Where are these chemicals found? Food contact paper. If paper is oil and grease resistant, like pizza boxes, microwave popcorn bags, it very likely has highly fluorinated chemicals. Cosmetics, not many cosmetics, but several thousand of them do contain fluorinated chemicals. It will say flouro on the package. Outdoor equipment, carpets, clothing, furniture. Um, and so c eight has been phased out in 2015. It took 50 years from when the harm was first discovered. And what is the replacement for ca [inaudible] six carbons with fluorines all around. It's equally persistent. It doesn't break down for geologic time. That's millions of years, possibly longer than humanity.

Speaker 2:          42:40          And the world is like filling up with it and there's nowhere for it to go. It's in water, increasing levels in human blood. Um, still at ground to Shane, a professor at Harvard who studies it says, it seems to accumulate in the brain and do we really want see a in our brains? Um, so we did a Madrid statement on highly fluorinated chemicals. I, it was signed by 230 scientists published last May 1st and environmental health perspectives. Nobody much had heard about these chemicals. They, I always say did not get the attention they had deserved. So we document the potential for harm, a roadmap to prevent further harm. And it got a lot of press. Nick Christoff wrote about chemicals in your popcorn, national geographic, these chemicals and pizza boxes and carpeting last forever. My favorite massive group of scientist thinks you shouldn't use nonstick from modern farmer, but there were hundreds of press hits and the world is slowly starting to find out about nonstick.

Speaker 2:          43:43          Um, a lot of brands are eliminating it. Starting with h and m Levi's has phased it out. Now these brands don't talk about it because if, you know, if they say, well, you're, you know, your new products don't have this toxic chemical, what does that say about your old products so that they don't tend to advertise it, but it is happening. This is in the public domain that all these companies are facing it out. Um, what can be done? Um, Google really wants safe building for their employees and they're very active and working for transparency and they're part of the buyer's club. And we're working with the buyers club in California to give them lists of products with and without fluorinated chemicals. This is from a database called Pharos, but there's a lot more chemicals in this. So if you want any of these products, you can pick the ones with and without the fluorinated chemicals.

Speaker 2:          44:39          And the hope is to really move the market towards without, when people know the extent of the harm. And the fact like with every, you know, the chemical industry is saying a c six is perfectly fine, but they're 40 forms of c six, we took 50 years to ban one form of [inaudible] band phase out. So with 40 forms of c six, it's just not going to happen. But purchasers can move to safer products. So all of these products can contain fluorinated chemicals. So try not to buy nonstick and if you can avoid it. Um, the last class I'm going to talk about in some detail is the chlorinated antimicrobials. That's Tyco San and try called carbon. They're used, for example, in liquid soaps. It turns out the best thing to wash your hands is soap and water. You really having bacteria on your hands is a good thing.

Speaker 2:          45:36          Um, triclose and kills all the bacteria. I've heard people say, well, maybe in a hospital setting it's useful, but Kaiser has banded about six years ago. Um, now that's pure al. You know, alcohol is fine. It's try close and the antimicrobial try called carbon and it's really sad. But the FDA back, you can see, get that pointer. In 1974, the FDA wrote a monograph on the lack of efficacy and safety of Trico sand and that report's still has not been finalized and published. Meanwhile, back in 94, there was a handful of uses for antimicrobials because they were considered pharmaceuticals and they were removed from that category. And now there's 2000 uses. So antimicrobials, microbiome, Tracko centric, oh carbon or no fast number of products and building. They're in everything, you know, doorknobs, counters, seals, walls. But the fact is they don't provide a benefit. They have huge potential for harm.

Speaker 2:          46:45          They reach out of products, they're not taken out by sewage treatment plants. So they end up in our water supply there. One of the top 10 water contaminants, they'd been found to be an endocrine disruptor. And tragically there in most women's breast milk, which is not where you want these chemicals. And the fact is, once again, we don't need them. They're not needed. And so again, purchasers can pick products without um, Tracko San and try called carbon. And Google is really leading the way in these kinds of efforts. Consumer products, um, cosmetics because um, trackless San is actually considered a pesticide. It has to be labeled. And so when you buy things, you can look Colgate total toothpaste 0.05% triclose San, uh, I heard crest is advertising that it doesn't contain, tried go San. So that's a good sign. But when you're buying personal care products, you can just look on the label cleaning products, apparel, all these products you can choose with and without Tyco sin so quickly.

Speaker 2:          47:55          The other classes I won't go into in much detail, bespoke phenols many of you probably go out of your way to get water bottles that say this fennel a free, anybody do that? So I have a friend who studies them as toxicologists that UC Davis who likes to shock people. So he goes around saying, I really liked my water bottle to say it's got this fennel a in it because that way I know that doesn't have this funnel s in it and that the substitute for bis fennel a is often bis fennel s which he thinks is worse. So with the class concept, we don't want bisphenol a to z. Do you really need something like this panel? Do you need that function? Is it worth it? Is it necessary? And if it's worth it and necessary, then let's really invest in Green Chemistry and come up with something entirely different that meets this function without that potential for toxicity.

Speaker 2:          48:50          Similarly, thalates that also helps soften plastics. There's a tendency to go from one harmful thal eight to the next. So let's find green chemistry solutions when we need it. And in many cases, let's not use it. Solvents hydrocarbon coronated oxygenated solvent's often are harmful. Many times you can use water. One way to reduce your own exposure is to limit dry cleaning. And when you bring things back from the dry cleaners to air them out, there's aqueous dry cleaning so you can use water instead. Um, and you can find aqueous dry cleaners. Well, we can own for a long time about the harm of these metals. And still there's paints with letting them, it's still worth checking, reducing the levels. So what's happening, uh, retailers are changing. Many are selling furniture without flame retardants, a home depot, Lowe's and Menards or phasing out validates and flooring.

Speaker 2:          49:51          Um, I got an email near the middle, middle of June that made me really happy from a major us retailer, but I can't mention their name. People don't like dimension and they said starting July 1st we're not selling anything with flame retardants or stain repellents. We're not offering any stain repellent treatments. And this is a loss of a profit center for us because we make money with these stain repellent treatments, but it's the right thing to do. So if you go to and try to get a stain repellent treatment and they won't sell it to you, you'll know this is the retailer. Um, Akia is really the star this year, a Kia who we've been working with for quite a while and said, no fluorinated chemicals in any of our products worldwide. There are substitutes, they said for shower curtains, raincoats and umbrellas, but that they have a nice tablecloth that needs grease resistance that doesn't exist without fluorinated chemicals.

Speaker 2:          50:46          So they're going to stop selling the tablecloth, which is pretty principled and pretty neat. So, um, and a Kia has banned chemicals and all of the six classes. So based on all that, we have come up with a very bold statement. We believe that the youth of some or all of the six classes containing chemicals of concern can be reduced in consumer products by 50% in five years. And I think that's possible. Just asking the, do you need it? Question. You know, a Kia has done this. One large American retailers has done it. Um, we're having a meeting in December with the furniture, commercial furniture industry, the big companies, and they're interested in stopping the use of all antimicrobials, flame retardants and stain repellents in office furniture. That is a big deal. And if they do, that's going to really reduce the use. So I'm really optimistic.

Speaker 2:          51:48          Um, our goal is to take good science and use it for good policy. And now I'm saying you can use good science for good purchasing and the purchasing can be even more powerful than policy. So we send out newsletters once a month with updates on all of this. If you'd like to be on our newsletter list in the back there, please leave your card or sign your name. Um, give me your card. Uh, and I'm happy to autograph books if you'd like a copy of an printer or breaking trail out there, both here. Um, so I'm optimistic that by reducing the use of harmful chemical classes, we can all have a healthier world. So thank you.

Speaker 3:          52:35          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          52:35          So if there are any questions, please come to the mix.

Speaker 4:          52:38          Hi. Thank you. Um, so if I go to whole foods and I go to the cleaning aisle and they have all these things that say they're safe and green, are they,

Speaker 2:          52:48          I kind of looked for trackless San, I don't know pop. They're probably, but I think it's good to take a quick scan of the ingredients.

Speaker 4:          52:55          Hi. Um, I have a question about the a, the c six in the Ca, the chemicals that don't break down and geological time. Does that also make them less reactive? So would they be less likely to cause harm and biological? Um, you know, chemical reactions

Speaker 2:          53:12          because that would be nice. No, right. Unfortunately they appear to cause a lot of harm and the mechanisms aren't so well knowing

Speaker 4:          53:21          well they might be like catalyst or something.

Speaker 2:          53:23          Yeah. Are they fit in? They fit into, we don't know why, but there's this unique human epi study of these, I think, I don't know, 20,000 people who've been exposed, um, in southern Ohio and West Virginia where they came up with that whole list of health problems that's on the slide. And in fact, that's what the lawsuit today are starting. So it's pretty unusual to have that much human, you know, cause all these chemicals, by the way, to say the six classes, the harm is irrefutable. You know, there are things like genetically modified foods are real worried but there's not a lot of data to show him these. What we went for is what we, the things where there was no question of harm. We didn't have to do any more experiments. So the fluorinated chemicals that have been studied, there's vast numbers of animal studies and then inadvertently the very sad quote human studies where human populations are exposed and you find human health problems. So I think the harm from ca is knowing from c six there, 40 kinds. It's going to be really hard to prove things. I mean the fact that it ends up in the brain is not a good sign and they are biologically active.

Speaker 2:          54:41          Okay. Well I do hope that you will sign our mailing list. You can go to green science policy.org and click on fluorinated chemicals and learn more or click on six classes and learn about the six classes. And, um, if I said, if you sign our mailing list or you can send me an email arlene@greensciencepolicy.org and we'll write you once a month and update you on what's happening. I think saying in five years we're going to reduce the use of these chemicals by 50% in consumer products is a high goal. But it feels to me just like Annapurna, you know, that seemed pretty impossible. One of the world's highest mountain that had never been climbed by a woman or an American that, you know, we were able to get a team together and reach the summit of Annapurna. And so to me, this feels just the same, um, a great team. If you sign our mailing list, you'll be part of the team, you know, working with scientists, people in industry, government and NGOs and we all see the same summit. It's a healthier world. And I think, you know, moving step by step, we can all achieve that goal. So thank you.

Speaker 3:          55:57          Okay.
