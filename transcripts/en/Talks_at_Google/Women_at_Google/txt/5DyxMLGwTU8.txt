Speaker 1:          00:06          Hello everyone. Welcome to this decoding race series. So happy to have you here. My name is Rachel [inaudible] and I'm the project manager for race at Google race that Google is a new comprehensive effort across Google to organize around racial justice issues. Um, but more importantly, this started back in 2013 after the verdict of Trayvon Martin came out and a group of BG enters, organize and did a Hoodie march around campus. And that's when we really started grappling with race issues. So I just want to take a moment to honor one of our panelists, Sabrina, for her sacrifice to get us to this point where we could have a packed out room and have race dialogues that everyone wants to participate in. And now I'm going to pass it along to Felicia who's going to tell you she leaves are decoding race series and she's going to tell you a little bit more about what you can expect from this talk.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Hey everyone. Um, first thank you so much for Rachel's leadership and getting us to this point. I started in January as the head of black community engagement. And I'm so very proud of our company, uh, here at Google, being willing to have open and constructive conversations on race. I think it's a huge step forward and it's no secret that in our country, racial tensions are high. And so we want him to have a, or do our part here at Google to have those conversations again constructively with external leaders. And so just thank you for being here. This is the third of a series of conversations happening. Uh, so we're so glad that we could do this in San Francisco and be sure to join us also in mountain view. Uh, December 12th for can computers be racist, but today is about deconstructing race. And so again, we want to make sure that we are in a room where we can be open, honest, constructive with each other.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Uh, so we definitely, definitely look forward to a conversation, but also an exchange, uh, at the end of this program. So thank you so much. Without further ado, I want to bring to the stage Michael Skolnik. Michael A, we contracted a to help us lead the decoding race series. Uh, he's done tremendous work already, but even before his partnership with Google on this, he political advocacy, uh, for Russell Simmons who we both worked for for years. He's a national leader and activist in his own right and we're so proud to have him here as a strong supporter and partner. So welcome Michael

Speaker 3:          02:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:23          over here. I want to thank the panelists. These are all personal dear friends of mine, other flown from other country to be here. Uh, and our leaders are heroes and sheroes. Um, I sit on the board of the Trayvon Martin Foundation, so Sabrina and I work very closely together. Um, but so thank you all for taking time out of your schedule, especially during this time, uh, to come here. Uh, I would say think very briefly because I know we want to hear from these amazing people, uh, today. Um, the day after the election, this, this event was planned way prior to thinking, what would the outcome of the election going to be? So there's no, um, there was no quick maneuvering to get this thing to happen today. Um, this had been planned for a few months now, but the day after the election, I got a lot of phone calls from, from friends or text messages and emails from friends and family.

Speaker 4:          03:14          Like, what do we do? Um, from all folks who voted for Trump, folks who voted for Hillary, what do we do? And what I recommended to people to do was to get together and have dinners in their homes and just bring together your family and your friends and your colleagues. I invited 20 over to my home on Wednesday night, 85 showed up. Uh, the next night I invited 30, 90 showed up. So it's no surprise Felicia, ah, that best room was packed because I think people want to get together in community and have conversation. But this is one of many. Uh, so I would end by saying I am here to be of service to you as Googlers. We do have one coming up, uh, at mountain view on the 12th. We have, I believe, seven more after that are around the country and around the world.

Speaker 4:          04:04          Um, these, uh, amazing people were folks who are called on first. Uh, but we have other folks we want to call on after this. So if there are people who you want to come speak at your campuses, across the country and across the world, please let folks at Google know, um, that you want them to come and which we're taking, you know, recommendations you want to bring the best and the brightest minds we have in this country and around the world on this issue. So please offer suggestions after you hear this conversation today. So this series really means something to you. So without further ado, I'm going to pass it off to my dear friend, Michaela, Angela Davis, who will lead the discussion today. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          04:41          Thank you. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          04:46          Michael, thank you for setting, um, setting the stage of this as a conversation and, um, I don't do panels. I don't do keynotes. It's too real. Like it's too real right now to not want to make the effort to like really have real talk. Where's my sister? Felicia. Okay. Don't get it twisted just because he looks that years girlfriend has been in the trenches and I love you and there is no mistake that it was sisters that put this together because that's what we do.

Speaker 3:          05:28          So, uh, I appreciate it.

Speaker 5:          05:35          And on that note, I think it's first. How y'all doing? No, I mean real talk. How are you doing? I I there is um, is very difficult to talk about something as complicated and triggering as race without particularly today without checking in with our humanity and a lot for a lot of people they are rocked and terror and traumatized and terrorize and it is real. I haven't, you know, I was talking to Felicia, I have a 92 year old grandmother who was a refugee from Jim crow south. She was in World War Two. She saw the assassination of Martin Luther King and she told me my mother is the worst thing that happened in her lifetime. That's her. For some people this is like, this is the, this is the American dream. We are having such a range of feelings, like real ass feelings that I d I just don't want to put, I don't want to start this conversation pretending that now we're just going, we're going to solve race today at Google.

Speaker 5:          06:46          Right. But that we are um, that we, that we ground this in our humanity and in the ways that we can because I am struggling. I am radically revisiting a lot of my relationships, a lot of my projects, a lot of my platforms. I am side, I in so many people right now when the numbers came out, I'm going to just be honest. I, I just, so I have to, I want to be honest so we can grow because they, we, we can't be, we can't shape shift around issues if our intention is to understand each other because sometimes it is more important for I think for us to feel understood than to be loved. Like I, you don't have to like me and love me today, but hopefully we walk away a little bit more understanding. So I just want to set that as my attention today in this conversation is to have, um, some honesty and get to some understanding and understanding, always leads to solution. I think you look so familiar. Yes. Hi. Anyway, so it was just feeling your editor. So, um, so I, so instead of doing like formal bio's, I'd love for, um, and we'll start with you Jose. First. How are you feeling and how do you identify yourself? Like who are you as you get to define yourself?

Speaker 6:          08:19          Um, I am a product of the bay area, so this is where I'm from. This is where I grew up. I grew up in mountain view before Google got there,

Speaker 5:          08:28          okay.

Speaker 6:          08:29          To score at San Francisco state and lived in Valencia and 17 when a studio was $800. So that's the first thing I would say. Um, but identity wise, and I think identity is the thread that ties it all together. So I'm the Asian looking person with a Hispanic name who's gay, who was undocumented, who majored in African American studies at San Francisco State. So that's my identity. What do you do? Um, and then two years ago I made a documentary for MTV called white people. And I did that because I was really struck after coming out as undocumented five years ago, meeting so many young white people across the country, the millennial tolerant, diverse way white millennials across the country. I was struck that many of them didn't know where they came from. I mean in some ways immigration, Angela Davis says it's like the link to all of this because where we come from and how we got here forcibly, right?

Speaker 6:          09:33          The African American slave experience, right. Forced like nation, not forced migration, whatever that is. Right. And all struck at how many young white people we interviewed just didn't know where they were from him. And then I started thinking, wait a second. So how do you ask me where I'm from and how I got here. If you don't know how you got here, like white is not a country, right? And we have an organization called define american.com and the whole job is actually who were, as everybody's doing Mikaila, like going through like how do we talk about our work in this new atmosphere and what we came up with and crazy seven hour meeting the other day is this idea that we're actually trying to do is tell America's whole story. The story that has never really been told like here in the valley. And having grown up here and having a lot of friends who, you know, work in the tech industry, we like to say that immigrants built America.

Speaker 6:          10:25          The moment we say that we are leaving behind leaving off two groups of people, maybe of Americans and black people, right? Like that is how do we tell America's whole story in that way? Um, one last thing about my feeling, my feeling right now is as you know, undocumented immigrants, people like me have been at the heart of this campaign. Um, I would argue that Donald Trump was very smart in making integration a central part of his campaign because most people don't know what that is, right? People here, no h one B visa, you know, Dream Act maybe. But for the most part I spent, I visited 48 states and done like 850 events like this in the past five years. Most Americans don't know what that is, right? And he was able to kind of use that as a central part of the campaign and to blame people.

Speaker 6:          11:17          Americans are struggling, every American is struggling and they want someone to blame and they think it's us. And I wonder what happens when he, he becomes president. President takes the lighthouse right now, you know there are 700,000 young people who are, who came to this country as children illegally whose names, addresses, phone numbers have been given to the government that Donald Trump is going to be in charge of. And I'm just finding out that some of those young people are actually Googlers who have that. So what are y'all going to do when he starts rounding them up? What are you going to do? Right, and what the showing up

Speaker 5:          11:54          for each other. Me and I loved that. The panel, this is the versus it is because I think representation, like what do we all going to do to show up for each other? I think for me it's something I'm really grappling with.

Speaker 2:          12:06          Um, I'm Krista Alonzo, I'm a standup comic and, uh, I feel I feel broken. Um, I've been doing standup for 13 years. I have traveled the country on the road in a rental car by myself. And, uh, I always felt American. I was born in, in Texas. Um, it wasn't till I started traveling by myself that I realized how different the country was. And, um, I remember the first time I was, I wasn't allowed to check into a hotel room, which was in 2013. And I was shocked and that's when it kind of realized that I realized that life was different outside of my bubble when I went into the real country, you know? And, and then I started realizing that I was terrified of my life because I was put in situations that were very uncomfortable and I felt my God, if I feel like that, how many others don't feel like that. It got to the point where I, um, I used to do the Walmart test and a, I would go into small towns and I go to Walmart and if I saw that they had Latino products, I felt safe. And if I didn't see the Latino products, I wouldn't stay there because I was scared.

Speaker 5:          13:36          Wait, let that settle in for a second. Y'All feel that for a minute. Particularly people that, cause you know, there are a lot of people in here that could, maybe it's not, they're looking for Latino, um, products, but they have something similar, right? If there's not a Martin Luther King Boulevard maybe, but settle into this, and this is for the people of Whiteness in the room. Particularly, just imagine like you're, you're probably doing your own Google search in your mind and there is nothing like that, right? So just let that settle. There's nothing in it, in your database that goes, let me check to see if I feel safe because of my actual identity in this space. Okay. So just, okay.

Speaker 2:          14:24          Um, I think that for me, uh, this election has been a life changing for me because being completely honest, that's it. That's how we got, um, I realized that, uh, I was actually seen as illegal too, a lot of people because of my skin color. And that's when I realized that the term illegal, not white because you think how many immigrants from European countries can come in here and nobody asks them, Hey, where are your papers? Because their skin color dictates that they belong here to potential first. Like I'm coming to that soon to be first lady. Yes, absolutely. So for me, when I feel like that and I was born here and I belong here and I don't feel like I belong here, my God, how does that make everybody else feel? And for me, I think I want to talk about it because I think the most important thing that we have to do is listen and we need to accept our truths. We can't negate and say, that didn't happen to you. It did happen. That's why you said it, and I think that's how we change things. To actually take everything that we say as truth, process it and say, you know what? I might be part of the problem and that's how we learn to accept that maybe we don't have our eyes completely open and maybe understand that I'm at fault. It's something. Maybe there's something, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          16:01          I'm broken. I did a panel last week with the Lotus [inaudible] who fought for farm workers, farm workers union. I was crying nonstop after the election and I walked into the room to meet her and we've known each other for years. She's like, why are you crying like this? This election broke me. She said country felt like that when Nixon got elected. They let me tell you about how it felt and to hear those emotions that you don't read them books. It took it to own life. She, she was standing next to Bobby Kennedy when he was assassinated and she describes hope dying in front of her face. And when she talks about it, I realized that this is the first setback I've been through personally. And that's why I'm so affected by it. But when you see her, you realize we're going to get through this. Yeah, it's going to be hard, but we're going to get through this. And sometimes you need to hear the history of somebody else to accept it and process it.

Speaker 7:          17:06          So it's a perfect

Speaker 5:          17:15          Sabrina because when you talk about people going through it and what, what is difficult and what is pain and who, you know, we often get into pain Olympics and my pain and I couldn't see my cat and no real talk. And also who, how people, what people can stand through. And you know, we, we opened this by, um, I think that you inspired this and Sabrina, I am just indulge me for a second because I love you. I saw it. I loved you before I met you. I saw you stand one. What does that mean? Yeah. You started a different kind of activism for me because my entry point to Humana, I'm just going to be real. My entry point to humanity is through black women. That is my on ramp into most things. That's my, you know how I start? So when Trayvon was murdered, I look where there was a lone black woman standing with microphones and met you had buried your boy. The hardest thing that anybody who is it, you know in your personal life, if you are a parent in this room, you know what I just said?

Speaker 3:          18:38          Okay,

Speaker 5:          18:39          you did that and you still stood and you still created a moot the mothers of the movement. Be Clear. We're in this election. You all were on the front grounds. You all, you all were in towns, in churches, in beauty shops. You had every, you had every reason to be broken in bitter. How the Valley Brogan, you buried your baby that never goes away and still you were able to see how you could help move this country forward. Ew. Ew. Ew. Trayvon is our Emmett till. We know that. We know this, the black lives matter started

Speaker 3:          19:22          okay

Speaker 5:          19:22          as a rallying cry for people to try to, to, to heal around what happened to Trayvon because he was our son. He is our son and if he is our son then you are sister forever. So thank you. And why I think it's really, really important for you to be in any room is because we do look at life through our own sets of disappointments and is hard to do that with juices like you, like really like how and and and so how are you feeling? And also I just sometimes get tired just to be real real of we will make this through this. We're going to get up again. Like there are times like I don't want to live my life. How much pain can we go through? How much can we take? And often people in the margins, that's, I mean of course it's what we do. Do we go to church, we got to our spirit, we go to our flow, we go to each other. But at some point when do we stop getting knocked down? That's, that's how I am today. I might change, but there are times that we know we have to tell each other. We won't be all right. But sometimes it's like dance, stop knocking us down. Okay.

Speaker 5:          20:36          So, oh, and how do you identify who are you? Before I was

Speaker 8:          20:48          Sabrina Fulton. Now I am Trayvon Martin's mother. That's my name. Trayvon Martin's mother. And people even call me Ms. Martin, which I have not been Ms. Martin and many years cause I did divorce. I am. And what I can't understand for the life of me is how everybody can go through a divorce and they don't even see their exes. But every time I turn around, my ex is right here. And so let me start off by saying my conversation to you and what I have to say is not polished, is not filtered. I may not say the right things all the time, but it's how I feel. Um, when this happened, I had a normal life, you know, uh, one house, one car, two kids, Everage life. You know, I was a government employee working for the housing agency, um, to try to assist low income residents. Um, just normal life. I mean, I had to save money to take my kids on vacations. I would go to work, complain and keep looking at the watch to this time to go home. I mean, just an average things, you know, come home from work and asked my kids, why didn't you take out the garbage? Did you do your homework, cut your hair, something, clean your room. Just, just every day, average things. And I don't know how for the life of me, my life got interrupted.

Speaker 3:          22:31          Okay.

Speaker 8:          22:32          So I constantly picked, tell people however tie am because this could have happened to anybody. Average, average, average. I want to continue to say that to myself because I had a, my family is very tight knit. I have a very close family. I have really good friends. I have a strong church. I mean, I think I did all the right things.

Speaker 3:          23:02          Okay.

Speaker 8:          23:03          And this happens to my son. So it went from having a decent average lifestyle. Um, I'm from Miami, Florida. So this looks like Miami and here, you know, it's a mixture of everything. It's not just African Americans, it's everything is, it's, it's Puerto Ricans, it's kill Benz's Bahamians is Haitians, Jamaicans is Colombian. I mean everything. We have everybody there. And, um, I just don't understand for the life of me how an average person paid my taxes. I'm a citizen. I paid my taxes, you know, I to work, I saved my money. I did whatever I needed to do to take care of my household and my kids and to get rid of my ex husband.

Speaker 7:          24:00          Okay.

Speaker 8:          24:02          So on a, on a serious note, I went from a very average life to a broken life and then it continued to break. So not only did I know or I found out my 17 year old son had been shot and killed and not just shut in Keel because I don't believe everything that was told to me by the Sanford Police Department and by the person that killed my son. I just don't, and you wouldn't either. Um, but it was a part of me that said that I was never going to San Fran again and that I was just going to try to pick up the pieces to my life and move on.

Speaker 8:          24:56          But that never happened because the mother in me, even though my son was to seize the mother and me came up and stood up because my son was shot down. So let, let me just say that again. When my son was shot down, I stood up. You never heard Trayvon Martin's name before February 26 2012 so it'll bring out some things in you and they can bring us some negative and you went and bring out some positive in you. So don't think for one second that was not negative thoughts in my mind there were, but I chose not to act on those negative things and I chose to try to do something positive to you. Well, what had happened to my son and just the play on terms and just the play on words. Beyonce had a video out there, you know that remember name? Yeah,

Speaker 7:          26:00          lemonade

Speaker 8:          26:01          is when you're tying something sour into something sweet. And so that was something that was very important to me because I didn't want to live the rest of my life better because it would have taken two lives instead of one, not only what Trayvon be deceased, but I would be here on earth decease and I had another son to live for. I had my whole life to live for and I decided, I made up my own mind with my broken pieces that were on the floor that I wanted to do something positive to help this country because this country did not see just how broken it was. This country is broken. We have to say that we have to come to terms with it. What is going on now is a reality show. There's a show in is happening to us and real life. Well we have to say it, a lot of people don't feel like the justice system is broken until you have a 17 year old son that's killed and you know the exact person that shot and killed him. But because of a technicality, because of the laws and how the laws are applied, the person walked free and not just walk free, but continued to do things to antagonize the situation. Like sell a gun.

Speaker 3:          27:31          Really, really?

Speaker 8:          27:36          You mean to tell me the gun that stopped my 17 year old. You have people bidding on it. So by it, think about that for a second. I know we're all walking around here with the heart. What? Some people are heartless, some people are actually heartless. But what I decided to do is I refuse to let somebody else's ideas and suggestions and comments determine who I am. And so a lot of people tell me how strong I am. It's not because I want to be, it's because I have to do this for my son, for my son that's in heaven and my son is here on earth. I don't have a choice. This is my new life, this is who I am and I will continue to fight for all children. And two, I rest in peace. And so it does not matter. When I hear a story on the news and it talks about a six year old that had been drowned in a pool or got in a car accident, I don't care the color of that child's skin, it does not matter and we have to get to that space where it does not matter if it's your six year old brother or your six year old son.

Speaker 8:          28:58          It does not matter the color of his skin because I can sit here right now before you and there are a lot of things I can take off my jacket, my blouse, my pants, my shoes, but I cannot remove the color of my skin nor do I want to because it's Hawaii. I am

Speaker 3:          29:22          [inaudible]. Whenever I hear that,

Speaker 5:          29:31          when people say that the system is broken, the country's broken.

Speaker 5:          29:36          I hear no, I think the system is working and the, I think that there are tons of, we don't really acknowledge that we are living in a post genocidal country at a post. Like we started off with stolen land and stolen labor. Yup, that's true. The history. Right? So perhaps, and I'm not even here yet, this is just a philosophical, like I'm just working it out with y'all. Perhaps we are not broken. Perhaps we're getting closer to being fixed because we started off with genocide and slavery. Let's be clear. Yup. Right? So how does even a post genocidal country say that they were ever whole and how does the justice system that was designed to contain and you know most most people, so, so hopefully I'll get there in my heart that maybe sometimes healing and being scars feel the same when they are healing and when they are happening. And so perhaps this pain that we're experiencing isn't the breaking it breaking of America. It may be the actual unifying of it because now some people can actually feel, this is the first time some of my white liberal friends aren't life fucked up. They're like, oh my God,

Speaker 5:          31:02          what you've been saying is real. Oh my God. You know, it's not theory. It's real. There's possibility in this moment y'all, even though we're broken, we're crying because this doesn't happen to everybody. Sabrina list, you know this, I've never heard of white colleagues say, Oh, I'm afraid my child might not come home from school.

Speaker 7:          31:24          Okay?

Speaker 5:          31:25          And I, I didn't see the fathers of Sandy Hook get together march across the country and talk about gun reform. You did not have to do this. There are people whose babies have been killed by gun violence and they think, oh my God, that was a phenomenon, a horrible phenomenon that my young white child got shot four black families.

Speaker 7:          31:49          Okay?

Speaker 5:          31:49          For Latino families, there are people, there are mass graves at the border. We don't even know your names. They are Latino people being lynched. We don't know their names. So this doesn't happen to everybody. Let's just be clear about that. Let's be honest. You, you are extraordinary, okay?

Speaker 7:          32:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          32:17          are you feeling and how do you define,

Speaker 9:          32:21          um, I'm feeling incredible amount of dissonance. That's going to be the word. I don't have a feeling word right now, isn't it? Says where I'm, where I'm at. And I think to your point of how do we, when we're shifting from something soured, it's something sweet. Uh, moving to lemonade. It makes me think alchemy, it makes me think of the process. What does it take for a piece of coal to become a diamond? And it's an incredible amount of pressure that's put on it and you have to face face it if you're going to actually Walter, that I want to borrow from Juno Diaz. I read the New Yorker article of artists and I think this is such an important time for people who are artists, creatives, writers to help us make sense of the chaos, make the chaos coherent is sort of where we're at. And I think, um, election night and the next morning I reached out to one of my dissertation advisors John Diamond and was like, I don't understand.

Speaker 9:          33:15          I feel like I re reword it to like a five year old. And it was like, you know, like someone makes sense of this for me. And one thing that I thought was really useful about the way Juno Diaz characterize it is he saying that we are grappling with a level of rejection that's at a macro level. I think if you're black, if you're brown, if you're Muslim, if you're Lgbtq, if you're a woman who didn't vote for Trump, um, you're, you're in a place of flow in a macro level of rejection and incredible amount of fear. The vulnerability that I think most many people have walked around with. But I feel like it's heightened now. I've been looking at the SPLC count of, uh, incidents of harassment. Yeah, I think there are over 400 since election night has been announced. And just literally for me, I have to like, there's a prayer before I exited my door of like lawyer wherever I encountered a day, just, just like cover me on the train.

Speaker 9:          34:12          There was a video of that was put out or women on bark, I think she was from Algeria and she was recording a woman on Barton who's telling her, how are you going to be deported? It Trump's going to send you out of here. Um, I used to be an elementary school teacher and people who are teaching in classrooms, um, that are in my network, uh, where kids are yelling, you know, build a wall to Latino kids sitting in the classrooms. Um, my dad who's immigrated from Nigeria sent me a video yesterday morning of Trump actually talking about not allowing west African immigrants to come into the country. Um, so I, I think there's a level of fear. There's a level of rejection as a level of vulnerability. And I see like we're in morning and a lot of ways, and I think that we're mourning this experimental idea of democracy because I think America is unique from other countries in the sense that it's not to roadshow and multiethnic, multiple religions.

Speaker 9:          35:00          I'm all in one space and it does have a history of genocide and the history of involuntary immigration, um, for, for, um, African peoples. But I would say for the way that America has pursued it's foreign interest, what suggested even other people who are immigrating here voluntarily, you may not necessarily be so volunteering. Right. Um, so, um, I think there's a level of despair. I think what's been challenged is our vision for this country, I think, and the ideals that have been held up. So most of us have been sold a story since birth about what America is about democracy. And a lot of us who identify that people identify white had been sold a real good story about the history and a lot of things have been left out. A lot of things have been sugar coated. Um, and I think that a lot of people who are in who are now just coming into this and waking up like, oh my gosh, I didn't even know this was real.

Speaker 9:          35:51          I think it says a lot about the bubble and you've grown up in and what's the implications of segregation? The implications of like the choices I've made. The New People here can wake up and turn on the television and see only people who look like them on the TV. They can go to any magazine rack and the hundred most influential people all look like them. The most beautiful people in. We're always looked like that. And they can go to their church, they can go to the synagogue, they can go to a funeral. And it's everybody who looks like them, the toys that they buy for their kids, the media that they consume in terms of entertainment. Like sometimes I literally have watched television and I'm just, I'm gonna go through each station to see if I can just find one black person, like without going to be, if I do find us, like how are we being characterized?

Speaker 9:          36:33          Is there some variation or does it fit the stereotypical narrative? So I think I'm in a place of dissonance and I'm in a place of, of mourning, like deep mourning internally. And, um, I have to think about my grandfather. He was born in 1911 in Texas and when I was very young, I was still at his feet and just stare at his hands. And he had these hands that were full of wrinkles and scars and tears and Marx. And he had been working in cotton fields since he was seven years old. His mother was half native American, half African American and wasn't slaved. And I remember I would, I don't know why, but his hands just carried the story of his family. And what does it mean to pick cotton? What does it mean to start doing that? A seven years old? What does it mean to have to drop out of school?

Speaker 9:          37:17          Because your older brothers were fighting in a war then when in a country they weren't citizens of, um, and, and what it meant to actually keep going back despite that. And he adopted my mom. I'm at six months old. We didn't have any kids of his own. And I sit with that right now of what it meant for him to survive 1911 until he passed. And then like in the late nineties, and I think about Dave Chappelle when he talked about what it meant to be alive, um, through that time. Like we just think about the depression in and of itself would admit to survive that if we think about the 1960s a number of black people who were killed from like 1960 to 1969 in a very public forum. I can't even imagine this psychic violence that, that, that creates. And those were all people who were, who were activists, who were organizers, who were putting themselves on the line.

Speaker 9:          38:08          And what does it mean now for us to witness digitize killings of black and Brown people, native American people on the Internet, on Facebook, and the psychic violence that creates for us. Um, and then to have the same electorate that supported Obama twice with elect Trump now or select, I don't know if it was elect yet, there's a popular vote, didn't really count this time. Um, so I'm in a place of extreme dissonance and incredible amount of, of morning. Um, but I'm, I'm also, I'll get to the hopeful place and, and like less work and less fight, but right now I want to sit in the dissonance and I want to say it with the morning.

Speaker 5:          38:47          Thank you that that's honest. I'm sorry. This is really how this had to go today. You know, like we had to, we couldn't get it all academic about but we um, but we, but we do want to be in conversation so it would be great too to shift to, to you. Um, oh great. Okay. India. Oh Great. I'm going to read a question of, of our door. You were Googlers all over the world. Um, are, um, asking questions. Yes. I'm not in the frame. I'm sorry. Okay, here we go. All right. Okay. So we actually have someone from India asking this question we hear a lot about, so he's asking for a comment. We hear a lot about black and Hispanic experience experiences and related interventions, but not much about how other races experience the multicultural workplace. For example, Asians, Indians who are also agents, etc. So any comments on that?

Speaker 6:          39:50          Uh, have a lot to say about this freight to see it here. But here it goes back to what Miguel is saying. I actually think we are where we are because our conversations are far too comfortable and simplistic. We've had each other in the back. We think we're down. We think we know what's happening, all of that. Before I say what I say, I think I also from a, I've been just doing a lot of reading is grounding me, but I've been thinking that in some ways 11 nine that is when Donald Trump got elected. It's in many ways the culmination of nine 11 right? After nine 11 we, after we were terrorists as a country, we started terrorizing each other, right? We sort of terrorizing each other like the other and all of us. I have to say that having traveled the country like the other, now many people feel are working class white people.

Speaker 6:          40:38          Right? I can't tell you how many times I've interviewed working class white people who feel that they're not welcoming their own country and I'm like, Yo, you built this. What are you talking about? Right. So that conversation, so I'm going to name one statistic that I think is crucial. In the next 50 years in America, 88% of the total population growth is going to come from Latinos and Asians. 88% at a time when the black lives matter movement that you had sparked should forever be central. Because how we deal with anti blackness and the Latino and the Asian community in the Arab community is important. And at a time when white people are an emerging racial minority, which is already the case in high schools all across America and grade schools in high schools across America. Now it's fascinating whenever we talk about race and identity that Asian people who are now the fastest growing racial and immigrant group, 72% of all Asian adults in America are immigrants.

Speaker 6:          41:38          We are more immigrants than Latinos are immigrants. And yet we are just kind of invisible in our, you know, rice noodles, and I hate to say it out, I'm just, you know, I don't want to stereotype this, but if you think about it, the Asian community as it is, is a huge community with different languages, different cultures. We don't all speak Spanish, you know, the only thing that I've got that has really organized Asian people in the past two years was a letter those edited on Google docs. And I don't know if you remember this, when Asian people in Twitter started getting together after Philando Casteel and wrote an open letter to their families about why they stand up for black lives. And I remember going into the letter, I'm like, I'm a journalist, I can copy edit. So I'm copy editing the letter. And at one point on Google doc, this amazing Google doc thing, there was like 200 of us.

Speaker 5:          42:33          Do you think Jose Mpas, I mean just in the world of engineering or safety standards, often things are built because of some kind of horror or tragedy or you know, you know what I mean? And so because we don't have a Trayvon Martin to or or a build a wall, kill them all kind of thing too to attach to the Latino community or you know, what are we seeing Muslims being terrorized so we can make so people emotionally get involved. Do you think that that has something

Speaker 6:          43:04          and I think because in this country to be American has always been to be white, white miss was constructed to say you're not black. And now that the most of the countries, Latino and Asian, how we pass us white. Like sometimes I wonder within my own Asian friends and colleagues like how many of us actually think were white or better than white, right? Like we're not even a part of that conversation. And now that Asian people, and I'm saying this is an uh, someone who is undocumented and has been doing this work, it's been really lonely. How even in the own, how in the Asian community, this has been a silent, for the most part silent issue. The fastest growing undocumented population are Asian immigrants. One out of seven Koreans in this country is undocumented. One out of seven. Right? And so the fact that we have allowed it to be racialized as a Latino Mexican issue, right?

Speaker 6:          43:54          We've allowed it. Right. And what I struggle with is this idea, now what do we do? Right? Like there was a report that said that apparently Asian people are now the most affluent and educated group of people in America, yet civic involvement, like what does citizenship, I was, I gave this really uncomfortable speech in Chicago. The home of like a lot of Filipinos make us a little bit. Yeah, so, so it was like 300 Filipinos, you know, and you know, I can't vote. I've been here for 23 years since I grew up amount of view, but I'm here illegally so I don't have any voting power. Right. So I asked the audience, Hey, let me go, here are American citizens like 90% how many people are registered to vote? Out of 300 people, maybe 10 and I'm like, book the Lumpia down. You know what we'll get is it's amazing.

Speaker 6:          44:42          I'm like, are you freaking kidding me with this? There is more to America than buying an ice house and driving a Lexus and earning the money so you can send it home to the Philippines in boxes. Like how are we going to involve ourselves? This is our home and the intersection of race and immigration. Right? The first group of people that racially got excluded were Chinese. The Chinese exclusion act in this country with an in and giving me the American citizenship rights until 1924 I would argue that the black lives matter movement is all about citizenship, but it's way beyond papers a loss, but it's about dignity. So to me, I actually think the question of citizenship of how we earned that, how many people here are American citizens? Can you raise your hands? Congratulations. I'm so happy you are. Now. The question though is what are you doing to risk it and what have you done to earn it and not to the people who have always been marginalize, right. I would argue that I definition of America for me are the people have always been excluded from it and have to fight for it. All of us have done that in our capacity, and I'm sorry, just we're going to get uncomfortable about this. The conversation is really about whiteness and how that is always central. How it's always as if we always have to explain who we are and how we got to where we got. I actually think we should start a woman trying to explain why people, how did you get to where you got

Speaker 10:         46:07          [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          46:08          Why, why do you think you're the center of the world? Why is it that when white people move, it's manifest destiny, it's the next frontier. It's white man's burden. When we move, it's a question of legality and criminality. How can my iPhone have more migrant rights than I do?

Speaker 10:         46:25          Hmm.

Speaker 6:          46:26          I think that's an essential question. And all of us who are privileged, you know, we are in San Francisco, we are here like again, the question is what are you doing to risk your privilege? How are you going to get them comfortable? How are you going to get out of your comfort zone? How are you going to learn the fullness of American history? Right? And how are we going to advocate for us? So I think that is kind of where I'm at. And I feel like sometimes we, you know, dupont to Ella about shape shifting. You know, like I always, when I'm in front of Conservative tea party Republicans, like I was just at like last week I have to go, okay, don't offend them. Don't be the angry illegal person. The smile, you know, pronounce your words like Charlie rose. Um, and you know, I, I feel as if my life and maybe Asian people, because of our identity, we were always so excluded, always excluded that maybe because of that we've internalized that exclusion, but now we have to insist on being included and we have to insist on being too [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          47:30          We're going to get a quick question. Can I know, I know you can hold it.

Speaker 11:         47:35          Is there a question from the floor? I just wanted to say thank you. First of all, even the discussion was about race. You asked everyone what their identity was and that is really important to me because what I consider myself, my identity is not really race because I feel other people don't look at me and see an Indian split I've always grown up is people look at me and see religion. So identify myself as a sick who is often mistaken. For the first 15 years of my life, people would call me a Buddhist and then the last 15 years of side 11 a muscle and that's fine. I don't mind being mistaken, someone I would like it to be. It makes me happy when people recognize me, but it's fine because I think it's important to accept everyone who they are. For me personally, I don't mind if people mistake me for someone else or some something else.

Speaker 11:         48:22          What I do want is people to accept others for who they are just too. They are whoever, however they label themselves. My question is how do we promote just acceptance right now? That's the biggest thing which I think is dividing us. Even if you feel some way or spiel someone else's raw as, and there's a lot of people who are angry at like the people you were saying, who are, you know, the poor white middle class who felt marginalized and there's all people who just didn't accept them. How do we just promote acceptance in general and what's the best way to go about doing that?

Speaker 8:          48:56          One of the things. One of the things that I would say is as a human race, we really have to get back to the basics. We really have to start respecting one another. Regardless of your education level, you can't possibly look at someone and tell if they're educated or not. It's just so not important. What's important is that they are a human being and you should care about them merely because they are regardless. Nobody asks to be here. You, you didn't ask your parents to be born, you didn't, and so we have to make the best of WHO's here. I just have so much to say. It's just hard for me to put it into words, but we have to get back to the basics and that's respect. It doesn't matter if, if I have long hair, if I have short hair, I had dreadlocks of my hair is nappy. If my hair is blonde, Brunette, Brown hair, it doesn't matter if I wear glasses or don't wear glasses or I'm short, I'm tall, whatever religion I am, it does not matter. Can you just for a second, look to the person to your right and just say

Speaker 7:          50:40          hello.

Speaker 8:          50:48          When was the last time you just said hello? How are you? We have to get back to the basics. I'm a firm believer and that it does not matter. All the things that are put into our heads, and I shouldn't say it by social media and by the media, you know, it's just so those things are not important.

Speaker 3:          51:10          Hmm.

Speaker 8:          51:12          What's important is who's here, what we're doing and how we're going to move forward. It does not matter your, your, your nationality. It does not matter your race. It does not matter your religion. Everybody is a human being and we should treat them as such. Let's get back to the basics.

Speaker 7:          51:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         51:41          well, why don't you go, I want to get another question. I know that that we're going to, both of you can have ha prepared like 30 seconds. How do you want to respond? But this is helping. We have to tell each other stories. Okay, well how have you, all of you can help us think about how to move forward. Like how, what frightens me is the level of hatred that we have so much time, so many hate crimes act. And so instead of Hillary Clinton being sad that she didn't win, how can we, um, activate those people, President Obama, Hilary Clinton to say, how can we make a stand that those ask are not going to be tolerated and prosecuted to the highest level of the existing law that we have now? How can we stem the tide and everyone who felt differently, what can we do actively to make that stop? Did, do you mind if I, if I throw that to Michael, but just some fair, no, not to shock you, but just some various, you know, because there's some very, there's some places to go. So if you can just kind of give a couple of websites or places to go to be very pragmatic about that. Okay.

Speaker 4:          52:49          Very pragmatic. But I'm also going to segue to on my own show, I think some southern poverty law center, right? Aclu, which organizations that need help, I'm going to give you support. So go to the southern poverty law center website and Slu on that specific question on hate crimes. We've seen 400 plus hate crimes since the election of Donald Trump, uh, reported in this country. Um, and that is what southern poverty law center has seen in six months prior to that. So 401 week, six months prior and reported hate crimes. Um, so sort of those two organizations you can go, if you could give resources your time, your energy. I think he was a help.

Speaker 2:          53:24          Can I just say that? I think that, uh, we talk about, we're talking about race and we also have to, we have to talk about why Trump won one. Yeah. And I think this is the theory is that for eight years there were white people that felt like they weren't listened to. They weren't paid attention to what they felt disenfranchised to solution and they decided to do something about it. And it's, it's cute for me that it's eight years because people of color, that's what we live our entire lives based out of. Our entire existence is based out of being uncomfortable, feeling, feeling left out. And it's weird to think that so many of them under the Obama administration felt like that, but that shows that there's a problem because they didn't feel like they were being listened to. We feel like we haven't been listened to and I know I haven't been listened to.

Speaker 2:          54:25          I know my people haven't been listened to. I mean look, we're the guy won on the premise of building a wall and I have people calling me illegal and say awful things to me everyday of my life now. It's weird to think the, the Midwest felt like a person of color did for eight years and they did something about it. I think it's interesting that we're in this room talking about hundreds of years and we're still trying to catch up in eight years. They got to, they got to have their voice spoken and here we are saying it's been hundreds of years. What do we do? And it's weird to think that in order to make any kind of advancement, we really do. We have to pay attention to what we're saying because that's the only way that we can move forward to make each other feel like we matter. We have to matter. That's I think one of the most important steps. What do we do? How do we fight? How do we let her voice heard? Um, except everybody for what they're saying, even though you may not agree. I think that in order to make any progress, we have to make the country very uncomfortable for a long time now until they listen.

Speaker 7:          55:46          All right, talk [inaudible] we all know every, everybody these

Speaker 12:         55:59          tradition, they tell stories and that's what you hear someone's story. You can't unhear it. And so I want to thank you for giving us a space to share this. Now everyone knows a little bit more about somebody and um, there's power, there's power in and then it, even though we're all tripping and broken and feeling crazy, I do feel there's a lot of smart people in this room and there is opportunity in tragedy always. Sabrina is testimony to that, right? So take care. I think we need to take care of ourselves. And everybody get their 10 sessions, but, um, but feel like, be available to the opera. There are hundreds of thousands of young people in the street that are letting us know something that the future does it, the future is not comfortable. Right. So I feel very encouraged by that if we're seeing like all these youth uprisings and they're very mixed. They look like this room. So, um, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible].
