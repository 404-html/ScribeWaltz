Speaker 1:          00:06          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06          Thank you very much for, for coming this afternoon and thanks to Louise and Google food talks for inviting me to speak. So, um, I'm going to talk to you a little bit about Orthorexia. Um, any of you have any idea what Orthorexia is? Some of you are nodding some saying no, not so sure. What, what would you, what would you say Orthorexia wars. What was your kind of, what's your kind of definitely the obsession with helping you. Yeah, pretty much. You've pretty much hit the nail on the head there. It's exactly what it is. So, um, so yeah, it is, it's, I think it's a really interesting topic. It's a fairly new term. Um, it was only sort of brought to our attention in 1996 when Steve Brotman, um, he's, uh, a physician in, in the states kind of identified it as a, as an issue with a lot of his clients who were kind of trying to be healthy.

Speaker 2:          00:54          But I'd almost be quite at the point where it was obsessive. So when you break down Orthorexia is it is basically the obsession with being pure of eating correctly is the exact term. Um, and I think it's come about because there are so many kind of ideas around what healthy is. So it kind of like one of my questions to you is what does it actually mean to be healthy in 2017? I mean, what, what are your thoughts? Know I asked this whenever I do workshops and I do workshops with schools, with athletes, with coaches, um, with school nurses a lot as well because they do a lot of work around disordered eating and sort of poor relationships with food. It's really interesting what comes back. So I'd love to know what you think healthy eating is or what health, what it means to be healthy in, in 2017.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Yup, Yup,

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yep. Yeah. I love the fact that you've picked up on the term balance. We'll go back to that at some point. Anybody else want to add anything else?

Speaker 1:          02:00          Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:03          yeah. And I think one of the things I want to make really clear here is, um, sometimes people get the wrong idea about what I'm trying to promote. I am a Dietitian, so I do promote a very healthy way of eating, which does mean majority to lots of fruit, vegetables, whole grains actually in line with some of the things that you do here at Google. So it is, it is what I promote. What I want to bring to the attention here is the actually sometimes in some people we can get a little bit extreme. And when it becomes extreme, it starts to affect your health and your mental health. That's when it becomes a problem. And that's what I'm seeing more and more of. And so that's kind of what I want to talk about today. So, yeah. So one of the challenges I have as a practitioner is that there were so many messages about food.

Speaker 2:          02:47          I'm sure every single day you pick up your phone, you look at magazines and there's always something new. What should we eat? Who should be follow? What should we do? And obviously while I'm a big fan of social media, I think it do lots of really positive things and get some really positive messages out there. I'm also slightly nervous of it because I think it creates influences that don't always give us the right messages. So I mean these are just a few. I'm sure you know all of these people. Um, and, and I struggle with this because on that page, on that slide, there's not a single person who is actually qualified to give out nutritional advice. So from my point of view, when you are putting stuff out on Instagram or you're doing blogs or you're writing articles, you're writing books, even actually you're kind of giving some misinformation and, and the problem comes, not to, majority of us, majority of us can read something and go, yeah, I'll take a bit of that, but I'm going to forget about that.

Speaker 2:          03:43          That's okay. The problem comes when you are somebody that may be, is a little bit susceptible to developing a poor relationship with food. Um, and again, I will go through what that would look like. So I guess some of the big trends that are come out of the last few years, um, eat clean, I think we all hear about that is always hashtag he clean. That's the big thing. It's almost like a badge of honor. I mean the number of of athletes and clients that have come see me and they're like, I always eat clean and they're really excited about the fact that they're actually saying that to me. And I'm like, okay. And then really a bit like, well you don't seem impressed. And I'm like, well what does that mean? What does eat clean actually mean? Because from my point of view, if I don't follow your rules, then somehow it makes me feel like I'm eating dirty, which I know I don't.

Speaker 2:          04:30          So for me, labeling and terms and hashtags, while they're brilliant and useful, these things can be really quite, they can be quite detrimental to a lot of people. Um, so eating clean, green juices, superfoods, these are all things we hear about all the time. And I am not for one second saying that you shouldn't have a green juice and you shouldn't eat foods that are seem to be super. Although I don't ever believe in a particular one. Food being super, it's more about your collection of foods that then gives you a balanced diet and all the nutrients you need. In the same way, I don't demonize any foods because I don't believe one food group alone or one food is what is going to cause you negative health problems. So some of the common misconceptions, sugar, let's talk about sugar. What do we know about sugar? What do we hear about sugar?

Speaker 3:          05:27          Anyone want to tell me what they yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But then you've got those sugars, like fruit, sugars, stuff like that. So, but your main conception of it, as soon as you hear, should we go straight to the bathroom? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:50          Yeah. Really, really, really good answer. And the thing is for me is that I think it's just been, it's been blown out of as well because again, we have bloggers and influencers who talk about refined sugar free and sugar free cakes. But then you look at the recipes and they're full of maple syrup and coconut sugar and that it somehow is deemed healthier. But actually the end of the day sugar is sugar. Whether it is molasses, honey, white sugar, maple syrup. And one of my biggest kind of challenges to some of the bloggers and I have been on stage with one. Um, but I won't go there and um, is the actually the end of the day you say that white sugar is processed. Well it's no different to removing the SAP from coconut to make coconut sugar is exactly the same process. There was no difference. So you cannot say the sugar, you know, white table sugar is processed and coconut sugar isn't cause at the same thing.

Speaker 2:          06:48          Biggest thing about all of it though is that they all give you the same amount of energy per hundred grams and they all are used in the body in exactly the same way. The body cannot dif, you know, cannot kind of go, oh this is coconut sugar is better for me so I'm going to use it. And this way it doesn't, it just literally breaks it down. Uses it in the same way. If you eat any product to access any product to access of what your body needs, it will get stored as access. The only thing I would say potentially in kind of kind of in defense of some of these other sugars is that things like maple syrup, honey, they are sweeter. So potentially you could use less potentially. But that's probably the only thing I would say. So otherwise that for me, whether you're um, using table white table sugar in it and your cake or whether you're using honey, it makes no difference.

Speaker 2:          07:39          It's still a cake. Enjoy it, embrace it. Because actually there's nothing wrong with having cake or dessert every now and again. And that's kind of what I want to get across. I don't have, I get really cross when I see people using, uh, having a Brownie and there'll be, it's brilliant. It's really healthy for me because not only is it sugar free, it's also gluten free and it's like it's still a Brownie. It still gives you the same amount of energy is still going to use and the body in exactly the same way. I'm actually from my point of view, if I want a Brownie, I'm just going to be a Brownie. Simple as that. Similarly plant based milks. Now I get a lot of grief about plant based milks because people seem to think that I'm like, you know, a real uh, a real Nazi against them.

Speaker 2:          08:24          The only reason I struggle with plant based milks is because they are promoted in the wrong way. There's nothing wrong with using alma milk or milk or hemp milk or whatever you want to use if you prefer the taste, but don't kid yourself that you're going to get the same nutrients as you would from cow's milk. That's the only thing I would say. So I'm not anti any of them. You know, I, I, you know, I would probably say that actually for some people the taste of almond milk is better than cow's milk. They prefer it. Great, but don't kid yourself that you're going to get the same nutrients. This is particularly I find with with athletes because obviously when it comes to working in within the performance athletes that I work with, milk is such an important recovery drink because it's the right composition of carbs and protein.

Speaker 2:          09:09          So if they then think they can recover in the same way with almond milk, they don't. And you can see from the kind of table that if you look at 200 mils of Alma milk versus 200 mils of Skim Milk, almond looks just pretty much expensive water. So what I say to people is by all means use it. But don't kid yourself in thinking it's got the same nutrients. A lot of the milks, I say milks, I have to do this cause it's not really milk is it? But a lot of the, the, the plant based milks are fortified with calcium now, which is a benefit. Um, I did a talk two days ago in Belfast and there was a, a professor who's very big on her bone health, um, uh, research. And one of the things that she came, what she was talking about is the actually the intake of calcium is so important for our bone health.

Speaker 2:          09:56          Um, and it doesn't matter how you get it, but it's really important if you are below par, even especially when you're, you're sort of in your early, late teens, early twenties, it can have a real negative impact on your health and your sort of sixties and seventies. So it's a really important area. Gluten, I've already mentioned gluten. Um, again, I don't have an issue if people want to be gluten free, that's entirely up to them. Um, what I find interesting is that when I first qualified as a dietician many, many years ago, nobody wanted to be gluten free. Like celiacs hated being gluten free because actually there wasn't an awful lot of choice out there and the food's out that they were provided were really high in fat, really unpalatable and really high in salt and nobody wanted to do it. And now it just amazes me that we've got so many different options that people want to be gluten free because they totally believe it's healthier.

Speaker 2:          10:53          There is no evidence in any article you will read a proper credible scientific article that is that glute being gluten free will benefit you if you don't need to be. Obviously if you have a medical reason, then of course you have to follow a gluten free diet. And I think what again, I find really interesting is that the athletes and the clients I work with who do have to be gluten free, they really moan. They don't like it. They still don't think it's fair. But at the end of the day, um, you know, I think it's just been highlighted as a, a kind of a cure for immune problems and um, sort of digestive problems. Often the reason why somebody who goes gluten free feels better is because actually when you change any aspect of your diet, when you sort of decide you're going to follow a new thing, you become more mindful of what you eat.

Speaker 2:          11:43          If you become more mindful of what you eat, you get a balanced diet and actually that's what makes you better. That's what makes you feel better. It's not necessarily that you've got gluten free sugar free or you know, or, or dairy free. It's actually the, you just become more mindful. And that's something that I hope, you know, is, is a message I really want to get out there. So what is the impact of this kind of Hashtag eating clean or you know, what, where does it come into? How does it become Orthorexia? So orthorexia as we said is kind of, it's the obsession with eating correctly is with eating pure. And the problem is what might start off as a really innocent, I'm just going to try and make myself feel a bit better. I'm just going to eat, just kind of talk chart, try and cut out, maybe, you know, cut out the takeaways or cuts out, um, the biscuits and cakes every day or whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          12:35          That's fine. We all do that. I have weeks where I go, oh my goodness, I've eaten so much chocolate. I really need to have two weeks where I don't eat very much. That's normal. That's not me. Being obsessive when it becomes obsessive is actually when you cannot deviate. So when you start restricting and you, you basically cannot deviate and it starts having impact on things like your social life. So sadly I see lots of people that come in to clinic and they think they're fit and healthy. They think that, you know, they're doing everything right, but when they can't join in with their friends. And I personally find that really very sad because for me food is more than just fuel. Food is about relationships, it's about networking, it's about bringing people together. And it's so important is kind of, you know, when I sit at a table I can often spot someone who's got food anxiety because they're not joining in.

Speaker 2:          13:30          They're so fixated on whether they can eat this or not. [inaudible] they kind of miss out on that real kind of connectivity time. With that, you know, with the people you want to be with. I know when I'm, I'm my, my job takes me all over the country and Archie in different to different countries as well. And I really miss out on that time with my friends. So usually the first thing I do when I get back into the UK or back home is kind of organize a meal out with some friends. I don't care what we're eating, I'm just there because I actually want to spend some time with my friends. But it's just nice to do over food and wine. So for me that's a really important thing. So the problem we have is once you've got somebody that's following these very strict food rules, they follow it because it makes them feel very safe and controlled.

Speaker 2:          14:12          It's, it gives them something to, to fixate on and focus on. But it can also then start to create those like vitamin and mineral deficiencies. So if you go dairy free and you don't replace it correctly, you will end up with maybe a deficiency in calcium and also potentially phosphorous. These are really important for bone and teeth and also muscle contraction. So that can be a problem. You might if you decide to go gluten free, you actually might find you don't eat as much. Whole grain. Actually whole grains are really important for the gut biome. And we all are hearing loads more about how important the gut biome is and how that can help your mental health and how that can also help your digestive system. But again, people don't realize that these things are really important. So from my point of view, what people set out to kind of think they're going to be healthier actually makes them more unhealthy.

Speaker 2:          15:05          And this is what Orthorexia is. And the problem is they can't step away from it. They find it too difficult. So I guess the question is why? Why do some people, like if you, if we, you know, we're in it, we're in a room here full of people. Not everybody in this room is ever going to have any issues. Like often people, like we said earlier, we'll want to, you read all these new things, you think, oh, I'll take a bit of that. But I'm not bothered about that. Like, if somebody said to me that you can never eat chocolate again, I'd be, I'd be completely and utterly kind of distraught. So, you know, but that's just, that's just me. So why do some people look for thirdly answer? Well, it's really about your personality type. And again, I'm not saying that everybody has got this personality type is going to develop an eating disorder because if I would always write in the presentation thinking that's actually me.

Speaker 2:          15:57          And, and though I need to be really careful about that, but, but yeah, we know from studies that generally speaking tends to affect people who are high achievers. They're very determined, they're very self critical. Um, they do have an obsessive streak in them. That's kind of the biggest element of it. Um, and they're very sensitive. So what happens is that they have that kind of, that, that perfect framework for where things can go wrong. And like I said, not everybody will. And I think it's really important that that I highlight that, you know, you could have all those, like I said, you can have a work mostly on traits and actually be completely fine. A lot of it is to do about your experience. So as we go through life, we all experience different situations, different circumstances, and we interpret that in our own way.

Speaker 2:          16:48          It's our perceptions and it's those perceptions that can then start to create this very negative mindset. And that's where you then find that people are looking for something to help them make them feel better. And it's much easier to look at food training, you know, some other element is much easy to focus on that and go, well, if I control that, I'm going to feel so much better when actually what they don't appreciate is that a lot of the issues are going on with inside them because they're high achievers because they're people that are always wanted to do the best. They never know when that's enough. They never know when that, when they've hit that ceiling and actually they're very, very bad at accepting failure. And this is why actually I see this a lot in athletes because they are that very driven personality type.

Speaker 2:          17:36          They hate failing obviously because obviously to be a Olympic or Paralympic athlete you have to to to kind of, you don't need, you don't want to fail. But actually the way I interpreted it with my athletes is, but you know what? It doesn't matter. You learn from every experience. So if you didn't do that well this time, let's, let's, let's come, let's reflect on it and work out what went wrong and then we try and fix it for next time. And these are things I'd love to be seeing in schools more because this sort of mindset will develop in a school. This is, you know, when you're, you're in, you think about teenage boys, teenage girls and the bullying and the kind of chastising and stuff that can happen. This is when these things can be set up. So while that might not be the time you develop your problem, if you are somebody that struggles with your sense of self and your sense of self confidence, a lot of these things will be happening a lot younger and it's only when you get to a certain point there'll be one particular thing that will trigger it.

Speaker 2:          18:30          But actually the, the, the process has started very early on and that's why it's such a difficult condition as well to help because sometimes the feelings and the emotions are so deeply ingrained, it's really hard to step away from it. And it's much easier to focus on trying to eat clean and the pure then actually deal with that real negative kind of emotion that's going on inside you because that makes you feel uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          18:57          So worried said all threats in a session with being pure. And Steve Bartman was the, was the, was the MD that kind of um, identified it. So what I wanted to do was give you a little bit of an idea of what goes on in the mind, like how it works because none of this is intentional. That's the other thing is that nobody goes out to develop an eating disorder because it's really a very miserable place. Um, but a lot of it is about just not feeling that you're doing enough. You know, you, you kind of like, you know, I don't feel like I'm performing my best. Well we could probably all say that at some point. We can, we already precut probably all thing we could have done better, but it's when you start acting on it, when you think I need to do something to change it, you know, everybody else around me is so great and it's when you do that constant comparison.

Speaker 2:          19:44          And I always say to again, people I work with, especially the younger teenagers that I tend to work with, there's a lot of comparisons. And that's another way social media can really come into play is that, well, they're prettier than me. They're, they're more successful than I am. They're, you know, they've got, it looks like they've got it all. Um, I'll tell you funny story many cause actually I went through something like that very similar yesterday but I'll tell you about in a minute. But um, it was um, but the problem is you can never compare yourself to anybody else because we are all unique. We are all individuals and there is nobody else. There's nobody else like me out there. But I don't think there is a, but there's nobody else like me. There's nobody else like yourselves out there. So comparing yourself to somebody else is just a few tower way of making yourself feel worse.

Speaker 2:          20:28          You can only actually compare yourself to yourself. So whenever I start to doubt things, which is quite often I will stink. Well, compared to a week ago, I've now achieved this compared to a month ago, I'm on a power and that's a much more kind of acceptable and more Cook Self Compassionate Way, I guess of, of looking at it. So the problem is though, when you don't feel good enough, you're searching for something to make yourself feel better. And often it does. You know, in, in Orthorexia it's very much about, well, if I eat better, I'll feel better. We've all heard Evan and we and we see all the books, you know, eat this and you'll glow or do this and you'll have loads of energy. We all see it. And of course we buy into that because we're looking for an answer. The thing is the answers within us, because until you accept yourself and be comfortable with who you are, it's really difficult to move forward from this.

Speaker 2:          21:24          And this is why when you, if you do notice these traits or these symptoms or these kind of, these emotions in people you care about or even in yourselves, please try and get some help early on because actually the longer you stay in this cycle, the more entrenched these food rules become and the more impact they start to have and the harder it gets to step out of it, the harder it gets because the anxiety of stepping out of it is just too difficult to bear. So the way I tend to kind of describe it is that you're almost sitting on a box of emotions. It's like you're sitting on it so that you don't let any of those negative emotions come out. You don't want to deal with them is like, absolutely. When you soaked go through recovery, you do have to jump off that box and you have to let the emotions out, which does mean you sent tend to start to feel very uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          22:16          Now I suffer with anxiety massively. The anxiety I felt as I came off the chip and walk to the Google offices. I cannot tell you I, I'm I, you know, I do really struggle with anxiety but I've learned to manage it because I know that it will pass because it does pass. But it's very hard if you're somebody who never allows herself to feel it because you're constantly worried about what we're going to be awful. It's going to catastrophic cause that's what the, the anxious mind does. A cactus cat tracker catastrophize is everything. And so you don't want to do that. But actually the only way to move forward is to be comfortable with the uncomfortable. Similarly, when you challenge negative behavior with behavior, that's when you change. But it's all very, it is difficult. It's a long, long process.

Speaker 2:          23:09          So obviously when it comes to Orthorexia, if, when I'm working with people is trying to help people understand that healthy eating is not just about what you put into your body. It's not just about what's on your plate at one time. It's actually about the collection probably over two to three weeks. So, you know, you have a few bad days, so, right, it's not the end of the world. It doesn't mean you failed. It doesn't mean you're a bad person. It's just, you know, it's a bit busy. It's Christmas or it's birthdays or actually you've gone on holiday, that's okay. It's fine to relax because the norm is that you normally probably eat really well most of the other times. And then it all balances out. So I try and actually really educate a healthy attitude to eating rather than healthy eating is actually a healthy attitude to eating. And I just think, again, when we're teaching in schools and, and kind of even in universities where this is a really big problem, that's what we should be teaching and educating people is not always about, you know, the kind of the wheel and this is what healthy eating is actually about the attitude because that's what is going to help people move forward.

Speaker 2:          24:24          So my final slide really kind of is that

Speaker 2:          24:29          the biggest thing is trying to be comfortable with who you are and it really is about self acceptance. And for some people that takes time and actually takes a lot of inputs. So majority of the people I work with, I work alongside a psychologist or a counselor because the two things need to go hand in hand. Um, some people can do it themselves, some people can, can make it, can turn it around. But majority, I'd say probably 90% of the cases I work with, it definitely needs both kind of nutritional and psychological element and sometimes more psychological than nutritional. Any questions?

Speaker 1:          25:08          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          25:09          thank you very much. So it was really interesting. Um, I'm going to kick off if that's okay. So you touched on it earlier about the, the younger generation now as sort of adults, I feel that we can make a bit of a better informed choice and kind of research and the media and things but with children and kind of um, I don't know, secondary school age for example. How do you think the best way is to talk to her about their diet and to make sure that they can make those educated choices and then they're not being influenced by the media? I think one of the biggest things is teaching them through, through food. So you know, one of the problems we have is that when you're in it, like you look at secondary school menus and things and they're not very good or they're not sorts of comp, they're not foods that maybe they're familiar with.

Speaker 2:          25:55          And that can be a real problem because, I mean I've done workshops with young athletes and we've done practical workshops where I've brought things like macro and avocado and things and, and some of them are like, well I've never seen that before. Or what is it like literally had no idea and you know, you make them into things that are palatable and easy to use. I would never get somebody who's never had macro to eat macro because I think that's just quite harsh. But actually what we did with the blended it up and we made it into a macro patty and interestingly, all the, all the children that had never had it, probably only two were like, no, I definitely don't like it. But the rest of them were really like, oh. And they went home and they were like, I want to have this again.

Speaker 2:          26:37          So I think food needs to be quite a big part of education in schools because I think there's, there's a lot of, it's, it's kind of, sometimes it's like something that you should just have to do and you'd have to give the kids. But actually if we feed our kids properly in schools, they'll also concentrate better. We'll get better productivity because again, we know that if they don't eat at lunchtime because they don't like what they see, then they're either eat loads of sugar, which is going to make them kind of peak and trough or they'll just skip it. And the problem then is these are the things that then start to create this kind of negative relationship with food. Because if you do have somebody who's very vulnerable and they start skipping lunch because they don't like it, that becomes a behavior and that becomes an acceptable behavior to them.

Speaker 2:          27:21          The problem we then have is that can then kind of go into their other aspects of their life. And before you know what you do have somebody who's, who kind of doesn't really know about food. So I think education's really important, but not just what you teach in the classroom. Actually getting in there and and kind of getting the kids to work with food, taste, food, try different things. But equally I think as I said, there needs to be a lot more on your sense of self, especially as a teenager. I mean, God is probably one of the worst times ever when you were a teenager, isn't it? Because everything's changing. You don't feel great, you don't look great and we all know that you will get through it and you do, you know, you do eventually look fine, but at that point it's really, really hard and you're so self critical and I think that's, that's something I would love to do more of in schools is really kind of look at how we promote a positive sense of self because I don't feel there's enough of that going on if I'm honest.

Speaker 3:          28:24          What is your opinion on every diet that is based on calories? When I went there like a year ago, I spent three months on having a certain amount of calories I could eat every day. Meaning I was waiting everything that I was cooking and I could only cook. I could not go outside. Not it was with like feedback. Um, and like taking a step back on it. It sounds awful. Um, but I've been there and I'm wondering like, what is your perspective on this? There's like so many ways this can go wrong. Yeah, actually.

Speaker 2:          28:57          So I actually very rarely talk about calories when I work with my clients because you're right, it becomes obsessive. Again, if you're working with somebody who is obsessive, as soon as you give them a number or something to fixate on it, it's what happens. And, and at the end of the day, the body is really quite, um, it's quite an amazing, it's very good at regulating. If you, if you, if you let it, it will work for you really well. And that's again, another big message I will say to people is that if you just listen to your body, it actually does tell you what you need when you need it. It's just that we've lost the art of doing that because there's so much, there's so much information, you know, like, like for example, the sugar stuff, everybody's trying not to eat sugar because we've heard how bad it is for us.

Speaker 2:          29:45          But actually there are times when the body and the brain can only work on sugar. And so if you deprive yourself, if you start to restrict yourself, the body, we'll, we'll kind of work against you. So what I often find is when people severely restrict their calorie intake less than what they need, now, everybody in this room will have a very different requirement. But when they restrict their carer less of what they need, the problem you then have is that when food becomes available, the the body will try and eat to access because it will say, well, hang on a minute, I don't know when you're going to feed me again. So I'm going to take on as many calories as I can that then then set up this real negative cycle of, Oh my God, I've just eaten so much and that it restricts again, and, and, and actually what you need to do in these situations is regulate your eating.

Speaker 2:          30:31          So I tend to educate people on getting the correct balance of carbohydrates, proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables at mealtimes and snacks. I'm not anti snacks. I always have to eat every three hours, otherwise I fall apart. So, you know, I'm not anti any of those things. Um, but it's right for you as an individual because if you are somebody that say doesn't x does exercise an hour a day, your requirements are going to be much higher than somebody that just sits at their desk all day long. And I think this is where we do get some problems because we as Dietitians, we talked very much about moderation and balance. And of course that's really boring. It's not sexy. It's not exciting. It's just a dull word and it is. Um, but balance is about what's right for you. Now I have to be careful because I don't get people saying, yeah, but I don't need to eat sugar than ever.

Speaker 2:          31:25          Cause that's what balance is for me. But that's not what I mean. Balance is when I say that it's actually about giving your body what it needs, but also allowing yourself to have the things you want. Because when you suddenly go, I do want that, but I can't have it. You set up a whole new mindset going on almost like a deprivation cycle. So it can go one or the other way. You can either you end up people who would just want that food and that's all they can think about and they're going to just eat loads of it. Or The opposite side of that is where it becomes a cozy anxiety. So I think in your case, from what I hear is that it became quite an, and you know, if you step even one calorie over what you were meant to have, it became, became a problem or it cause you anxiety.

Speaker 2:          32:13          Should we say not cook made a problem. Now this is why also I don't like, I don't like truckers. I don't like the online food truckers because one, it's really difficult to get the right thing of what you're eating and kind of make it work. The other thing is how does that tracker know the actually today it might be the actually depending on, on what's going on for you hormonally, depending on what's going on for you mentally. Actually that day you do need a bit more. The truck, uh, can't tell you that, but your body can. So when I reeducate people, it really is about helping them to see that eating is, should be fun and enjoyable. And actually the balance is kind of very much, my principal is very much 80% of the time I try and eat as well as I can, which does mean that if I then wanted to have a glass of wine or pudding or chocolate, then I can and I don't worry about it at all. And that I would use for anybody whether they're doing read loads of exercise or whether they're not because you can, it's, it's proportional to what you do. Does that answer your question?

Speaker 1:          33:16          It does.

Speaker 3:          33:22          Hi. Uh, I have a question about what you talked about too earlier. You kind of made reference to sugar and how your body doesn't actually know if it's coconut sugar, white sugar, but is there something in the science, and I'm asking you as a can nutritionist, is there something in the science of how your body actually metabolizes that? Cause you do see that some sugars are processed by your body differently, such as raising your glycaemic index, for example. Yeah. Could you speak more to that? Yeah, so yeah, I mean obviously some, yeah,

Speaker 2:          33:46          some do have a slightly different glycaemic index, but if you look at all the sugars that we've been exposed to, the differences my minute, because at the end of the day they are all simple sugars so they all affect your, your, your blood sugars in the same way. So um, so yeah, things like honey for example might have a slightly left glycemic load than table sugar, but we're not talking enough to make the difference that we're being, we're being told that. I think that's the thing that it's really important to, to understand is that the, the messages were getting about being sugar free and only eating honey and only eating maple syrup, et Cetera, et cetera. Actually then they're not significant enough for it to be that to make that change. I have one more question.

Speaker 3:          34:33          Sorry, I'm going back into your 80 20 rule, but she just spoke about is there a danger and people creating morality around food. Then being like, oh, this is part of that 20 or oh this is part of that 80. I can eat freely for it. Like do you see that that could also be a kind of session or something like a trigger in itself?

Speaker 2:          34:53          It's really good question. I've never seen that because I don't ever really spell it out. It's kind of how I tend to, I don't sit there going, oh well I've eaten really well for 80% of the day to day, so now I can have my piece of chocolate. I don't do it like that. I kind of look at it overall. So I tend to sort of know that actually I do that naturally. I don't have to think about, it's kind of just what I do. Um, so when I work with people, I very rarely use percentages or numbers because I know and then that becomes obsessive and we kind of move away from that. It really is about, it's actually more about that attitude to food. The, I try and really work on that kind of behavior change.

Speaker 3:          35:36          Um, I think just

Speaker 4:          35:37          to go back to your question about calories, like when I found really interesting about, um, calorie restriction is that my flatmate does it, and anyways, it's a whole thing. But, um, she will have her a certain amount of calories for the day and then, um, but she'll eat whatever she wants to make up those calories. So I might eat way, way, way more calories than she had, way, way more, but more calories. But it'll be, you know, through, you know, lean protein and whole grains and whatever, whereas somebody else might need way less calories, but it could all be crisps. Um, so I, what I find really interesting is like the idea that when you restrict yourself, you know, we talk a lot about this stuff that you're not getting the nutrients you're not getting, but is it, does it also work the other way that you might be getting too much of something? Like people who aren't eating any sugar, dairy or green, you know, they're obviously not getting those things, but are they getting too much protein and too much, um, you know, other nutrients that, because they're trying to make up for what they're not eating, like almost too much of the good stuff. Is that kind of possible too?

Speaker 2:          36:39          I think. I think the whole thing about balance is that obviously if you increase your intake of any other food group, you would display something else. So one of the things I really struggled with when I'm working with athletes is because they're trying to be healthy and they're eating loads of vegetables. They don't get enough carbohydrate, they don't get enough energy in to be able to perform because they're trying to be good. And so, so that's what I mean, like, you know, it's kind of trying to get that balance for everybody as an individual. So yeah, you're quite right. Because the thing is, again, everybody's body will always be trying to reach energy balance. So no matter where you're at, whether you're at the weight you want to be or whether you're not the way you want to be, your body will always be working towards getting energy balance to basically maintain where you're at.

Speaker 2:          37:25          So that's why often when you do decide to go on a very restrictive diet, you can probably do it two or three days, unless you're very extreme and obsessive. And then you suddenly go to, I can't do this anymore because I'm just exhausted and an eye, I'm hungry and I'm going to eat that burger or whatever it is. And you almost go the opposite extreme because the body is always working against that. It's trying to keep you alive. Remember that, that that's what the body's innate thing is, is trying to keep you alive. So when people do restrict calories, it will slow down or the processes. So the thing I see a lot is it's those silent things you don't see. So for example, when somebody is on a very restrictive diet and they restrict their calories, the body slows down the digestive system. So that can have a real, a real impact on how your body works in that respect.

Speaker 2:          38:16          It will, in females, it will reduce estrogen. So menstruation will stop because of what he's going, well, hang on a minute. I can't, there's no way I can fall pregnant and we produce now because there's not enough energy in the system. So it doesn't actually affect your weight. And that's what's really interesting is because the body will actually slow else down to keep you alive. So it will, you'll find that you can't concentrate, you get cold, you know, you can't, you, you can't really think straight. It was all those different things. You can't sleep. That's a big one. Um, and that's something that people don't always realize that actually when you restrict your intake, the body is doing everything it can to, to kind of work against it so quickly. One thing to pick up on though is really interesting is that you're right, some people don't change in weight and they, they stay the same and they might not eat the best way. They might literally make up their calorie through Mcdonald burgers or, or whatever. Um, their choice, but that's not good either. And that's not what I'm promoting either. You know, it really is about if you eat the right things, if you base your meals around wholegrains and complex carbs and lean proteins, you will feel full, you will feel better. Um, but that also means there is then room for those little indulgences if you want them. I think that's kind of the message trying to get across.

Speaker 3:          39:40          Hi. Hi. And then we talk about alternative milks. What about something like goat's milk? Is that as good as cow's milk or is that, yeah, I mean goat's milk

Speaker 2:          39:51          is fairly similar in composition to cow's milk. So if I'm honest, when I work with somebody that can't really realistically can't have milk, just just has a lactose intolerance or a dairy intolerance or dairy allergy, then you have to find them something because you need to get the calcium in. Um, some people, goat's milk, we'll work, it comes down to the protein or the, all the sugar in the milk depending on, on what the problem is. So for some people, goat's milks fine. Sheep's milk, good for other people. Even those, there's so much crossover with the proteins that if they are, if it's that particular protein that they can't digest, then you have to find another alternative. So in some cases it's Sawyer, but we also know there's 40% it's for people with severe dairy allergies, there's 40% crossover. So a lot of people that can't have dairy can't have Sawyer. And that's where it becomes problematic because also then you're looking, then you do end up looking something like almond or, oh, um, and I said, I don't have a problem with people doing that. But what annoys me is the man marketing that it's on par because nutritionally it's not. So you just have to make sure that you get your nutrition from somewhere else. That's all.

Speaker 4:          41:07          Okay. I have a lot of friends who swear by intermittent fasting just eating two meals a day and they're just starving for 15 hours. And that's something that I don't believe in and I don't feel in the right place to tell them that they're starving themselves. But do you have any specific advice for this area? In a lot of the ideas you say kind of contradicts that this is good for you. So yeah,

Speaker 2:          41:30          again, intimate and fasting is one of those ones that's been really, it's been around for a long time, but it became its heyday probably a couple of years ago with the five two and you know, and and that kind of thing. I'm, I'm going to say I do use intermittent fasting in some athletes, but not in the five to, because I don't believe in two days a week where you eat only 500 calories because your body is just not in a happy place at all. But what I do sometimes do for athletes who were knee to particular body composition or or wait and it's just giving it is giving them a rule unfortunately, but it helps them. You do it for a very short period of time. But what we do is, is actually the intimate and foster and where they eat for eight hours a day. So we say between 12 and eight and then they'll have 15 you know, they'll have like the 16 hours of fostered because we know scientifically that's quite a useful way of helping athletes meet weight.

Speaker 2:          42:24          But with anything I do like that it's monitored and supervised and it's only done for a very short period of time. So with your friends doing the kind of, if they're doing sort of two meals a day and, and, and that's all they're doing for start, that's not intimate and fasting, that's just fasting because intimate and fast and would mean they do intermittently. So they'd have some days where they, well, and other days where they eat very restrictive. I think what's interesting is that when you look now at the data that's coming through, the people that were very big advocates of the five two are struggling to maintain it. It's not sustainable because you then have two, maybe three days a week where you can't actually focus. You can't actually contract. You can't be productive. Um, and that because your body won't be on 500 calories a day.

Speaker 2:          43:11          So it's hard when you've got friends and you're watching them and you want to say something. Um, and I think the only way you can sometimes do things is, is, is, is give them some sort of tangible data. Like, you know, did you notice that you made a mistake there? Or did you notice that you haven't got, you're really tired or you're actually really irritable and it's not much fun to be around. It's, it's, I mean, you have to be careful how you say that, obviously, but, but it's that kind of is that kind of thing. I mean with, I mean they're often the opening conversations I have with a lot of my clients. I don't go straight in there and go, you've got a problem with food. It's very much about asking those open questions like, what's going on for you? Like, why are you following that?

Speaker 2:          43:48          What, where, where's that come from? Because it's really important to hear why? Because that's something that they feel really passionate about and you don't want to sort of kind of belittle. You want to encourage them to open and talk to you. So as a practitioner, building trust with my clients is the first step. And then after that you can start to then kind of really tackle some of the, the kind of what's going on for you. Cause you'll probably find the, again, there's a reason why your friends are doing that. If they are trying to maintain a certain weight or be a certain way or look a certain way, where does that stem from? What's that about? That's kind of how I'd go about it. And Yeah. Any more questions from anybody? No. Thank you so much for coming in. We really appreciate it. Um, when he's gonna be staying in signing copies of her book as well. Um, and also joining us up in the cafe. So if you'd like to purchase a book, please do let us know and she'll sign it for you. Thank you so much for coming.
