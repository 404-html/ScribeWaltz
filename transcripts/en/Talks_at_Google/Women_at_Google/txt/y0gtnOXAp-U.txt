Speaker 1:          00:06          We have a very, very special guest with us here today. Her name is Kristin Neff and we have a very interesting topic for today. So thank you so much for being here. You're welcome. Let me just tell you, I briefly

Speaker 2:          00:20          about, um, how I got involved with self compassion and how it got to the point where it is now, where it's really my life's work. Um, it actually all started not too far from here. I was going to graduate school at UC Berkeley. I'm getting my phd and basically my life was a mess. I had just gotten out of a divorce. It was very messy. I was feeling a lot of shame. Um, I was under a lot of stress, not so much about what I get my phd, but what's it going to get a job after getting my phd? That was a big stressor for me. Um, and so, you know, I was in Berkeley and I had heard about meditation. I had heard that meditation was good for stress and there was literally, I'm a meditation group just down the block from me. So I went to this meditation group.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Um, and really to my surprise, the woman leaving the group at talked about the importance of self compassion, about how we had this ability to be kind, supportive, caring, tour ourselves. Um, when times were difficult. Uh, and it was, it was like exactly the message I needed to hear in that moment. Um, believe it or not, I started changing the way we laid it to myself instead of judge you, myself and Jamie myself. I started to try to be that good kind support a friend. Um, and it made a huge difference almost immediately. Uh, and then luckily I did get a job. I got a job at ut Austin where I am now and then I decided I wanted to research self compassion because I thought it offered a lot of benefits. Um, that self esteem didn't it? I actually did two years of post doctoral study with the self esteem we suture.

Speaker 2:          02:00          And while it was while I was working with her, I realized self esteem, although it was good for mental health is pretty problematic. For instance, um, the half high self esteem, we have to be special and above average, like everyone has to be at the same time, special and above average, which is basically a logical and possibility, right? So, um, we, we, we get involved with all these ego games trying to raise their self esteem, suddenly putting other people down or getting ego defensive. Um, the other problem with self esteem was it's really contingent, right? Self esteem is there for you and things are going well, but what happens when you fail your self esteem, dessert shoe. So as learning all this, my postdoc and I was practicing self compassion and seeing really what a stable refuge self compassion was in terms of self worth.

Speaker 2:          02:48          So when I got to ut Austin, um, I decided I wanted to connect research on that. So the way I, I define self compassion is I define it as having three main components, right? This is, I'm kindness toward oneself. Um, a recognition of common humanity and mindfulness. A lot of people have talked about mindfulness. A mindfulness is actually embedded in the construct of self compassion the way I see it. So let me take you through each of these a little bit more closely. So the ideas was self compassion. Again, we treat ourselves with the same kindness, care and concern that we showed a good friend as opposed to harsh self judgment. You know the Bible says do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Good idea, but really not such a good idea to do on the others as you do unto yourself.

Speaker 2:          03:42          Because most of us are shockingly crew author ourselves. We say things to ourselves kind of mean, harsh, cruel shaming, things that we wouldn't say to anyone we cared about that. In fact, you probably wouldn't even say to someone we didn't like very much, right? If you actually start to tune into your internal dialogue, most people are surprised by how hard they are with themselves. So the ideas with self compassion, we start changing the way we talk to ourselves. We start changing the way we relate to ourselves. We didn't be kind, caring, patient, understanding the way you are with a friend as opposed to inpatient, cold and cruel, right? So self kindness. It involves first of all, soothing and comforting ourselves in times of struggle the way you might with a friend who was upset or a loved one. It also involves supporting and protecting ourselves, right?

Speaker 2:          04:35          So self compassion. It's not just like touchy feely, more fuzzies. Self compassion can actually be quite fierce. They can say, listen, I need to stand up for myself. I need to protect myself. I need to draw boundaries. Sometimes that's really part of being a good friend who yourself is also standing up for yourself when you need it the most. Okay, so self compassion. Basically the sum up, what compassion is, I'm technically compassion is defined as concern with the alleviation of suffering and mass. The thing with self compassion as well, it means we are actively concerned with their own suffering and we say, what do I need in the moment? And then we try to give ourselves what we need to leave. He ate her suffering by the way, just like a little footnote, when I use the word suffering, I just mean any sort of emotional pain.

Speaker 2:          05:26          So when people hear the word suffering, they think that Jesus dying on the cross. That's not the way I'm using it. So it, that's a connotation for you. Just recognize when I use the word suffering, I just mean any moment of emotional pain, which from my point of view is worthy of a compassionate response. Okay. So self kindness in a way is the most salient aspect of self compassion. But there's also a very important element and the self compassion that helps differentiate it from self pity, right? We don't like people who are lost in self pity Dewey. So what's the difference between self compassion and self pity? There like near enemies they look kind of similar but they're actually radically different. So with self compassion, we recognize the imperfection is part of the shared human experience that every single person in the world isn't perfect.

Speaker 2:          06:19          I mean, you may have a few people you really like, you think are close, maybe his holiness the Dalai Lama or some author you love. But I share even they probably have their bad days, right? We know no person is perfect and no one means perfect life. Okay, so we know this logically, but what happens emotionally almost fail or we make a mistake or we feel inadequate about something is we feel like something has gone wrong, right? Think about it, I failed. Something has gone wrong. This isn't supposed to happen. It's, it's kind of an irrational assumption. But in the moment we feel as if everyone else in the world is living a perfectly normal problem, free life. And it's just me who's failed, who's gotten dumped by my boyfriend or whatever it is. Now this is a problem because not only are we suffering, we feel all alone in our suffering.

Speaker 2:          07:14          So self compassion, remember, wait, this is normal. This is what's supposed to be happening. No one ever said I wasn't going to fail or experience hardship. And I'll just tell you a little personal story where I saw how powerful this can be, the switch in my own life. Um, so, uh, if you ever read the book, when you read the book, you'll find out. And my son, Rowan, is artistic. And I remember when he was about four years old, I have a very clear memory of taking him to the park and there were their mothers, their with their kids and you know, all the other kids were playing, laughing, interacting, you know, here's rowing on the slide. Just stimming away, right? Not Interacting with the other kids. And I started going down the path of self pity, right? I started thinking, you know, why me?

Speaker 2:          08:02          Why can't I have a normal happy relationship, easy relationship with my child like everyone else. But I caught myself because I had been practicing self compassion for many years at that point. And I realize is that Christian, wait a second, you're assuming that all the other mothers and kids on the playground, you're assuming that all these mothers are going to grow up to have perfectly normal problem free relationships with their kids. Are you kidding? You know, surely they may develop other mental health issues or physical issues or maybe just have a very conflict built relationship. And I realize actually in fact what Unitus United, all the mothers are on the playground that day was that we struggle with our kids and we loved them anyway and we do our best and this is, this is what separated me from the other mothers. This is what connected me to the other.

Speaker 2:          08:55          So the second I pulled myself out of that rabbit hole of self pity and started giving myself self compassion, you know, it's hard to be a parent. It's a challenge for all of us. Then everything got reframed and it really gave me more emotional resources to deal with the situation. Okay, so common humanity is key and then mindfulness, right? So as I said, we've heard a lot about mindfulness. I know Google's really into mindfulness. Mindfulness is really the foundation of self compassion. Okay. So mindfulness is basically being with where it is in the present moment without resistance. No, of course. When what's happening in the present moment is suffering or going through a hard time. We're having difficulty, we're struggling in some way. We actually need to have the courage to be present with what's happening in order to have compassion for ourselves. And more than that, typically what happens is when things are difficult, we were in a process, like I call over identification that some were fused with the storyline of what's happening.

Speaker 2:          10:02          We're lost in the storyline. So in order to have compassion for yourself and one of the reasons it's so beneficial is you actually have to step outside of yourself and say, wow, you're really struggling. Are you okay? What do you need in this moment? And that kind of stepping outside yourself to form a self self relationship is one of the things that gives you emotional balance needed to make wiser choices. Okay? So those are the three components, self kindness, common humanity and mindfulness. And actually hopefully have time. Want to give you a little sense of what these feel like in your body because these are all inner concepts. First of like give you a taste of what self criticism feels like. Okay? So please everyone, if you're eating, just put it down for a second. Uh, uh, make two fists in front of your body like this. Go ahead and give him a good old squeeze and please do not release them until I say you can.

Speaker 3:          11:02          Okay?

Speaker 2:          11:05          It's keeping your fist like this for a few moments. And as you make this gesture, just notice what I'm mood state does this evoke in you? What does this bring up for you? How was your mind in this posture?

Speaker 3:          11:22          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          11:23          defensive stress. Feel stressed. Sorry. Tension. What'd you think? Aggression. Right? It's pretty uncomfortable, right? Okay. This is what self criticism feels like. You might even say echo, literally beating ourselves up. Most of the day we go around with this attitude to ourselves. Stress Resistant, clash, clench, aggressive, right? We aggressive toward herself. Okay. Now finally you have my permission to open your hands and just let them raise to the ceiling. Okay? So what shifts for you when you do this?

Speaker 3:          12:05          Relaxed and God

Speaker 2:          12:07          relief. What else? How does this feel? What? What changes in your mind compared to before? Open. More spacious, right? Feels lighter. Yes. So this actually is a metaphorical gesture for mindfulness. What happens when we stop resisting life and we just opened the way it is. There's a lot of spaciousness. A lot of room there. Now if you put both arms in front of you like this,

Speaker 3:          12:36          right?

Speaker 2:          12:39          Okay. So what, what comes up for you when you make this gesture? Sorry, what? Faith.

Speaker 3:          12:50          Warm.

Speaker 2:          12:52          Welcoming. Yeah. So in a way, this is the gesture of common humanity. When we give and we see, we welcome, we embrace other people, not just so self focused. Right? And now if you put one hand over the other like this and place both hands over the center of your chest, right? And savings. Pause for a moment. Really feel the warmth of your hands.

Speaker 3:          13:18          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:19          Feel the touch of your hands on your chest. And so checking in, um, what mood state does this evoke in you? How does this feel?

Speaker 3:          13:34          See, confident. Comforting, comforting. Are you going to say something

Speaker 2:          13:43          kind? It feels kind, right? So this is, um, a gesture of self kindness. You might say this act of being there for ourselves. Um, but remember that self compassion isn't just comforting and soothing and there's another stance. It kind of represents what we're doing. Um, and you're all sitting, but so you can see that if you don't, you don't have to, but you know, the horse dance and martial arts kind of this ground opposed your knees are bad and you've got your center of gravity right. Self compassion also gives you a center of gravity so that you can support yourself, remove as you needed or even defend yourself without being knocked off balance. So one of the things self compassion gives you is the ability to get through difficult times with the sense of balance and support. So that's kind of what it feels like in your body. Um, just to say, okay. Um, you might be thinking, okay, sounds good, but we have a lot of misgivings as a culture about self compassion and when we are raised thinking this is a good idea. What are some of the we have as a culture and maybe yourself or your friends that you hear expressed.

Speaker 2:          14:57          Yes, absolutely. Yeah. The number one actually misgiving about self compassion is that it will undermine your motivation. There'll be lazy you won't, you won't. You lose your edge. Yeah. There's, there's lots of other misgivings that we just heard. For sure. It's such a good thing. Right? So just letting yourself off the hook. It's an excuse

Speaker 2:          15:20          that it's a weakness. Yeah, that's for sissies. I remember once I have a New York Times article came out about my work and I really thought all the comments would be good. I really did. About a third of them weren't. And I've got comments like, oh great, just what we need a nation of Susie's right. So people think it is for sissies. It's weak. Yeah. Maybe like selfish. It's selfish, right? I already supposed to be focused on compassion for others. What do you mean give compassion for myself? Right. So there's a lot of very common misgivings. Um, uh, very, you know, used to be, I would, I could give you lots of very well argued, um, the reasons why I think these misgivings are misconceptions, but actually now we have the research to really address all these misgivings. So just a little chart. You can see I'm back in 2003 there.

Speaker 2:          16:07          I publish a first, um, theoretical article on self compassion, what it is and I quit it to skill to my trip and now it's just exploding and we couldn't even keep up with the research is absolutely amazing. And so we've got, we know a lot now about self compassion and how it works. So just to say first of all a self compassionate as strongly predictive of wellbeing. Some people who are more self compassionate or who are helped, um, taught to be more self compassionate and they tend to be less depressed, tend to be less anxious and they're less, lot of people suffer from shame, suicidal ideation, um, at the same time they're happier and they're more optimistic right there. They're more hopeful about their future. So this kind of overlaps with self esteem. We also know that self esteem is good for wellbeing people high self esteem.

Speaker 2:          16:58          I also you know, have better mental health. The difference between self esteem and self compassion is it first of all self esteem is based on social comparisons often, right? You have to even better than others to be thought of high self esteem, self compassionate. And you just have to be like a wreck like every other human being. You don't have to be better than anyone, right? You just have to be human. And also the sense of self worth link with self compassion is much more stable than self esteem. So we did one study where we track people's sense of self worse for I'm 12 times over eight months, I'm a self esteem but went up and down based on how your day was going, your latest success or failure. So if compassion was a much more stable source of self worth, it's there for you actually.

Speaker 2:          17:41          Precisely when self esteem desert shoot and that's when you fall flat on your face. Do you make a mistake or you're struggling in some way? Um, yeah. So it's self compassion week, right? What we're finding it in fact is it, I feel comfortable because I'm a little bias, but I feel comfortable saying that self compassion is probably one of the biggest sources of strength, resilience and coping you have available. Right? So lots of research, people going through divorce or when Eddie came out of people coming back, veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And what they find is the way people treat themselves. And these hard times, you know, the level of self compassion, support, inner inner, um, beat an inner allies and poster, an inner enemy. That's what predicts whether or not they do things like develop PTSD. I'm nine months later. So self compassion will help you get through hard times.

Speaker 2:          18:34          It's a strength. Absolutely not a weakness. Um, linked to healthier behaviors. A lot of people think self compassion means being self indulgent, you know, oh, it'd be nice to myself. I think they'll have that bowl of ice cream and then another and another. And you know, is that being nice to yourself? Right? It's actually not self indulgence means choosing long term harm over short term pleasure. People are self compassionate. They want, they want to levy their own suffering. So they do things like they exercise more, they eat better food, they go to the doctor more regularly, they take care of themselves. So it's self compassion, a selfish, um, I'll say if you guys are pretty young crowd, some of you are probably like on doing the online dating thing. I Dunno what app she got these days, but you're probably maybe on the market, you can actually take the self compassion test on my website.

Speaker 2:          19:28          So I would suggest getting their score before meeting for coffee. Maybe not. But regardless, the idea is we know that people who are more self compassionate are rated by their partners, is being much better. Relationship Partners, they're more giving, they're more intimate, they're less controlling, they're less aggressive in the relationship. So in fact, what we know is that when you give yourself what you need, when you have this pool of compassion to draw on for yourself, you actually more to give to others. So at least the less selfish behavior, that more selfish behavior. And in fact we also know that people who are more self compassionate, not only are they more compassionate to others, they're more able to sustain compassion for others, right? So if you have this pattern where I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving to my friends, I'm giving to my partner, I'm giving to my children and you don't recharge your own batteries and you don't give yourself what you need, you will burn out.

Speaker 2:          20:25          So I'm, a lot of the research I'm doing now actually is like teaching as self compassion to caregivers to help them prevent for now. So I just want to have a little more detail on this one. The idea how it's linkedin motivation cause this is the one people just say this, there's a lot of research on this because I think a lot of researchers that no, this can't be true. Surely not. But it is, right? So, um, we have lots of research showing, first of all, people who are self compassionate and their standards are just as high. You know, they, they also want the best for themselves. The differences. What happens when a self compassionate person does it meet their standards? Right? So a self critical person when they fail, beat themselves up. Oh I'm terrible. I can't, I should have gotten a ride. And they like this whole slew of self judgment and self criticism, which does two things.

Speaker 2:          21:15          A, it undermined yourself. Confidence, right? When you think, oh, I'm a failure, I'm full of shame. Shame is not exactly the most motivating mindstate we can have. So undermines herself competence. And what happens is we become, we become afraid of failure. We developed performance anxiety and it actually undermines her performance. This, this process of self shame and self criticism, self compassion. On the other hand, when you know it's okay to fail for spa, you can recognize that you fail because you know, yeah, okay. It's safety. Okay. I own it. It really messed up there. But just because I failed doesn't mean I am a failure. So self compassionate people are much more, uh, much less likely to be afraid of failure. And when they do fail, they're much more likely, um, to try again and to keep on trying. Okay. So for instance, they just study at Uc Berkeley where they had people, they gave these students one of those impossible tabulary tests that everyone failed.

Speaker 2:          22:12          And half the students, they told them to be self compassionate. They gave them self compassion instructions. The other half they said, hey, don't worry about it. You must be smart. You got into Berkeley. Right? And then they had a second vocabulary tests and they made it, how long did the students study for the second exam? So the ones who were helped to be self compassionate spend a lot more time studying and they kept trying even though you know, the, the, the potential for failures there because he had this resilience and the strength to deal with it. Okay. I want to teach you a little practice, um, because I'm hoping that you guys can actually some point in your day to day or the next week, um, can actually put this into practice and see how it impacts how you relate to yourself in times of struggle because it's more than just conceptual.

Speaker 2:          23:02          This is actually a practice. Okay. So if someone comes in, I think about 10 minutes, I just kicked him out. Okay. All right. So, um, I invite everyone to close your eyes partly just because I want you to be able to go inward and I don't want you to feel like other people are looking at you because I'm going to have you make a few funny gestures. Sorry. Okay. All right. So with their eyes close and actually the first thing I'd like us to do is see if we can find a type of supportive gesture, physical touch that feels supportive. And some people really like the hands on the heart touch I used, but actually a lot of people don't like that. It feels vulnerable. It doesn't really affect them. So I want us just to see if we can find some sort of touch that feels good for us. So why don't we go ahead and start again with the hands on heart like we did before. All right. Just noticing how that feels. A lot of people love this gesture. It feels safe and comforting and soothing. Um, but as I said, a lot of people don't like this. It feels weak or feels vulnerable. So some other variations you can do is you can try putting a fist on your heart it fist of like strength, courage, power, and then place the hand gently over the fist,

Speaker 3:          24:33          right?

Speaker 2:          24:33          Some people like this, oftentimes men like this gesture more.

Speaker 3:          24:39          Okay.

Speaker 2:          24:40          Um, you can try putting both hands on your belly.

Speaker 3:          24:44          Okay.

Speaker 2:          24:45          Right. Supporting your belly and then both hands on your face. Okay. So just take a moment to see if he can find some touch that works for you. Um, it's amazing if you have a self compassionate touch, it cuts through all the mental chatter and you can go straight toward kind of emotionally giving to yourself. So just experiment a little bit or eyes are still closed and for now, choose something that seems to work kind of. Okay.

Speaker 3:          25:19          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          25:20          Sound a lifelong commitment and just try it out for now. I'm going to need, we're going to use this in the next exercise. Okay. So what, why eyes are still closed and I hear the noise. So people are coming in. That's all right. So what I would invite you to do is see if you can think of, um, a real situation in your life right now.

Speaker 3:          25:39          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          25:39          That's causing you some stress or struggle or some emotional difficulty,

Speaker 3:          25:45          okay.

Speaker 2:          25:45          Right? This may be a relationship issue, work issue. I'm a health issue,

Speaker 3:          25:52          right?

Speaker 2:          25:53          Um, don't, don't choose your most overwhelmingly difficult problem because we're just practicing. We don't want to overwhelm ourselves. There's something, this wheel, something that's, you know, you can kind of feel the stress of it in your body. So taking a moment to think of this situation,

Speaker 3:          26:13          right?

Speaker 2:          26:13          Call it into your mind eye. You know who said what.

Speaker 3:          26:17          Okay.

Speaker 2:          26:17          Uh, what happened? What are you afraid might happen? Okay? So see if you can make it real. Bring it into the present moment. Then I can get to say a series of phrases designed to evoke the three components of self compassion. Um, so the first phrase is, this is a moment of suffering.

Speaker 3:          26:45          Okay?

Speaker 2:          26:45          Okay. This mindfulness we're being, we're being aware of what's happening. But that language may not be the best for you. You can say something like, this is really hard right now, or I'm struggling.

Speaker 3:          26:58          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          26:59          Okay. So we want to use our mindfulness to just neem and become aware of the fact of what's happening, which is this is, this is difficult.

Speaker 3:          27:12          Okay?

Speaker 2:          27:12          Okay. The second phrase is a suffering or struggle. Stress. It's a part of life, right? So we're just remembering our common humanity. This is normal to feel this way. Things like this happen, they hurt, but it's normal as part of being a human. I'm not alone in feeling this way. Okay? And then, so for the third component, self kindness, I'd invite you to adopt whatever gesture you found. Fields kind of comfort, name, hand on heart or elsewhere, just on heart, hand on stomach, whatever seems like it gives you that feeling of being supported,

Speaker 3:          28:01          right?

Speaker 2:          28:03          And so at the third phrase is, may I be kind to myself?

Speaker 3:          28:11          Right?

Speaker 2:          28:12          So what does this mean? It's asking, what do I need in this moment? And seeing if you can kind of wish that for yourself. Maybe you know, what you need is patience, courage, or maybe we need is to accept yourself that little bit more, right? Just asking yourself, what do I need? And wishing that for yourself.

Speaker 3:          28:47          Okay.

Speaker 2:          28:48          Um, and if, and if you're getting a little stuck with the language, is often really useful to think, you know, what would I say to a close friend who was going through the exact same situation I'm going through, right? We're off. We're kind of naturally more compassionate to our friends. So thinking about what you would say and also maybe the tone of voice, you would use the warmth that would be in your voice.

Speaker 3:          29:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:15          Right. And then, then just try it out with yourself. See if he can speak to yourself the same way you would speak to a friend. You cared about the same issue. Okay. And then letting the practice go for your hands back by your sides. Um, you can open your eyes.

Speaker 3:          29:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:58          So this is called the self compassion break. It's one of the kind of most handy dandy tools from the mindful self compassion program we teach. Um, but the idea is in the moment of struggle, not like you know, in a separate time when you're meditating or you can do it then too, in the heat of the moment, you remind yourself of the three components of compassion, being mindful that you're having a hard time remembering this is part of life is not just me, this is, this is part of being human and then bringing kindness to yourself. Right. It can often feel weird at first. Absolutely. It often feels very strange to speak to yourself like you'd speak to good friend. It feels, it can feel fake and phony at first just to normalize that, but eventually you start to form new habits and it starts to feel natural to be kind to yourself as opposed to awkward and if you really work with this practice, if you really work on integrating self compassion into your life, what the research shows is that, like I said, it's been a tremendous source of resilience, coping, self confidence and motivation.

Speaker 2:          31:09          There's also research now showing it's good for your physical health or immune function. For instance. I was just curious about your view on cynicism and sort of ways that that might undermine sort of the overall structure. Yeah, so again, in our culture, the that because a lot of people think that self compassion is soft. They kind of cynical about like, oh, all this hearts and flowers stuff. Um, so it is, it is a block, right? And for some people, I mean, I'm really comfortable, calm myself, sweetheart, I'm mushy, I have a son. But a lot of people aren't. So the really important thing is to find language that works for you. Like do you got your back? I mean, that can be whatever, you know, be a wing man, whatever you want to language it. It doesn't have to be warm, but absolutely, you know, it's cynicism, right?

Speaker 2:          31:58          Is it going to be better for you to support yourself or to undermine yourself? I mean, Duh. You know, it's so funny, her culture somehow thinks that by cutting yourself down, that's going to help you. Obviously it won't. And all the research shows it won't as well. So if you want to do your best and you can be as dry as you want, you don't have to be warm and mushy regardless. You want to be your own support system as opposed to pulling the rug out from underneath yourself, which is what most of us actually do with self criticism. So cynicism is there and people just have to find out for themselves as a worker, not basically. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. Thanks for coming today. Tried a

Speaker 4:          32:39          variety of different styles of meditation past to try and calm my mind and calm down that voice that's constantly running and criticism and just find it challenging to kind of break past that and make it a pattern and a habit. What tips do you have any in your approach towards self compassion and working at self compassion to take some of the early steps or things to keep in mind about the process? Maybe too often I've expected I'm going to have this instant breakthrough. Um, how would you advise someone to go about it and make it work?

Speaker 2:          33:13          Absolutely. So the first thing is we can't get rid of the voice, right? The voices there. We didn't choose to have the voice. A lot of us, especially depending on our family history and you know, we have the voice more deeply than others. The first thing to do is recognize that your inner critical voice is actually trying to help you. It's not doing a great job of it, but it's trying to help me. Usually the inner critic is trying to point out some danger, danger, danger, don't do that. Don't do that. You know, if you've done that one problem wouldn't have happened. So you might think of it is like a three year old trying to help you in the only language it knows how, which is the language of self criticism. So when you recognize you can even just try saying like, thank you.

Speaker 2:          33:57          Um, I hear you. Okay, I see what you're trying to point out. Um, but then the, the, the only problem with that self critical voices that it's counterproductive because by using the harsh language and the harsh tone and it actually doesn't help you. So I, you know, acknowledging the inner critic and then just saying this, that or another part of me that also usually wants the same goal. I believe that we all have an inner compassionate self and it's not just the spiritual thing. We know like you know, evolutionarily that we all are the brain, the human brain is wired for compassion, is part of our biological makeup. So we can tap into that part of herself, which is usually a little wiser. And also think, you know, what does this part of myself, the part of me that knows how to be supportive, good friend, what does this have to say about whatever's going on?

Speaker 2:          34:44          So don't try to fight the self critic. Really see if you can turn toward it, appreciate it for how it was trying to help you. Then just don't let it, you know, be the only voice in your head. Hopefully it can have a little more room to, to, to lead in some other voices. Yeah. So it really, it really is our friend. It's just what I think of it as like a tangent mean two year old, you know, it's a low on also on. The other good thing is just to tune in to the pain of self criticism. You know, it hurts, ah, the term tenderness toward this very human process of self criticism as well. And please do not beat yourself up for beating yourself up. I've, I've gotten emails from people said, thanks for, you know, give me one more thing done bad at self compassion. You know, I was like, oh, that's not what I meant. Right? So we want to be kind about the process and it's slow and if you have a family history with this is what you were raised with, it will, it will go slower. Just allow yourself to be a slow learner and be patient and being patient and understanding with the self critic that actually is self compassionate.

Speaker 4:          35:51          In your last response, you actually mentioned, um, this young child's mentality and that was, that could lead into my question is do you have some suggestions for teaching self compassion to young kids? Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          36:04          so I'm for that. I think that the number one best way to do it of course, is to model it. You know, a lot of parents are so good about not harshly criticizing the kids and trying to be supportive and then they dropped the glass on the floor and say, Oh, I'm such an idiot. You know? So really being conscious of what you're modeling, I, I really believe that if you, uh, hourly model, self compassion and moments, a mistake or something, kids will pick up on that message. Um, the other cool thing is that all human beings are brains are wired for emotional resonance. We pick up on what other people are feeling. So believe it or not, if you are really self critical, rounder kids, you kids will notice the self criticism and respond to it. I'll just give an example. If my son were all in, right?

Speaker 2:          36:51          So when he was, he's, he's doing great now, but when he was younger, he would have this horrible autism tantrums. Like just really off the charts. And if I, you know, and sometimes he didn't when I got you rotated. Oh my God, you're right. I must, I blown it. Or I triggered him. I didn't know what to do. And they got really frustrated with myself. He would ramp up. It's like he would read my emotions. So what I learned to do when he would throw an all muddy tantrum is I would just flood myself with compassion. This is so hard right now. You know, I'm here for you and make sure he was safe. But like 95% of my attention was on me and never audibly, he would pick up on that and he would start to calm down because he would read my mind state.

Speaker 2:          37:35          So as a parent, you know, that relationship is so close. If you embody another term for it, use for self. Compassion is loving, connected presence, kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, loving, connected presence. So if you just sync when you're around your kid, how can I embody a state of loving connected presence that we'll do a few things. First of all, they'll feel your loving, connected presence will also mean your parenting is that much more balanced and wise, et cetera. So, um, that's kind of step one and you know, there probably are techniques to develop, but I haven't done that yet. That's what, that's, that's, that's what I do.

Speaker 5:          38:15          Hi there. Thank you so much for coming. I'm so glad that you asked that question because my question is on the same lines of [inaudible] for kids. So I actually work in education, I focused on educators. So I'm curious, you know, what, what research you have or, or as an academic, what you guys have done as far as helping support educators implement compassion and also, so that's the first part. And then the second part is how can we as educators are individuals that are really helping these individuals, um, help with cyber bullying and the implementation of self compassion for kids that are being bullied online.

Speaker 2:          38:53          Right? So there's a lot there. Um, so in terms of what we have for teenagers, so we've developed, my, my colleague Chris Cromer and I have developed something called the mindful self compassion program. If you're interested, you can go to center for msc.org we've developed a teen version of that that we can teach the teens. Um, right now like, like in spring, I'm the local Austin School district asked me to come in and help their teachers learn self compassion to present burnout. Not a lot of research yet it's coming. Um, and one of my dissertation students actually is doing this dissertation on cyber bullying. The idea being that if you can help people, victims, he was more focused on victims, help people and be more self compassionate when they're bullied instead of retaliating with more bullying, which is the normal pattern, the actual deescalate the conflict. So we're, we're working on it. Yeah. But we aren't quite there yet.

Speaker 5:          39:48          Yeah. To go back to self compassion. Yes. Uh, I often when I feel hurt by somebody, feel compassion for them thinking, oh, they must be going through hard time. Is it okay to mix these two self compassion and compassion for others? Or it should be only us. When we concentrate.

Speaker 2:          40:10          You can definitely, ideally the idea is that it's this easy flow. Compassion for me. I really feel her compassion for you. You must have stuff going on. We actually teach you a practice called breathing compassion in and out. Um, so you do maintain both. Um, but if you only have space for one in your [inaudible] only have enough working memory pits for one person. I would suggest starting with yourself because again, when you build the resources for yourself, then you can have more to give to the other and more importantly, this sustain giving to the other. But it doesn't have to be either or by any means. I mean, common humanity's common humanity. You're a human. I'm a human. This hurts you hurt. You know, ideally that's where we're focused is just having compassion. Typically what we do is we cut ourselves out of the circle of compassion. We treat ourselves radically different lead, then we treat others and that's a problem. We want to create ourselves the same way, at the same kindness and care. Thank you so much for being here

Speaker 3:          41:13          and thank you all for being here.

Speaker 2:          41:18          Russia, oh, I've got the self compassion break and other meditations and exercises. I'm a website. Just Google self combat.
