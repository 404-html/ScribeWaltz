Speaker 1:          00:06          Actually unusual for me to talk to people who barely know me and my work, but also they give him five minutes to summarize my entire career and then have a conversation. But, um, but it's actually more interesting to talk to people who don't know anything about my work. But as you explained, um, I am Iranian born but I've lived in the u s I think now longer than in my own country. And, um, the first, uh, body of work that I made after being proven to be a terrible painter was photography. And, um, actually I'm not a photographer. I don't even own a camera. I actually hire photographers, site director photography, and then I deal with, um, the process after. Um, but I'm just going to, since I want to speak very little, I have a conversation. The first serious body of my work, um, after 10 years of not working at all at art was a group of work called woman of Allah.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And this is basically a series of photographs that I did and that sort of really focused on the Islamic revolution in 1979. And the role of woman in militancy during the Islamic revolution and the whole concept of martyrdom and the idea of being a murderer and what it meant in terms of being in this intersection of love of God and yet cruelty and violence and death. Um, and in for most of those photographs, I post myself and I photographed friends. Um, and this photography continued later on after I made many movies, uh, into this book, a series called the book of Kings, which was like over 10 years later. And it really was about, um, the 2009 green movement in Iran. Now it's more than 10 years is far more. Um, but it again, it captures another pivotal moment, Iranian history. If the first one was Islamic revolution, this shows them more modern, uh, Iranian society, but still battling with people were fighting against tyranny and political oppression, etc.

Speaker 1:          02:20          So this body of work was about, I don't know, 65 photographs. I'm going rather quickly. But what you'll see constantly is the female body. Uh, I mean the male and female body being a significant part of my photographs. And obviously this inscription of texts that were, uh, poetry by people of Iran. Um, and, um, so now I'm going again quickly. This is another body of work that I did in Egypt, uh, which was immediately after the Arab spring. And that sort of captured the notion of patriotism and the euphoria around the revolutions that we experience all over the Middle East, yet the terrible aftermath, which was, uh, a lot of genocide and death. Um, the next group, big group of photographs I created in 2015 and 16 was in Azerbaijan, which previously was a part of my own country called the home of my eyes. And in this series I basically acted more like a documentary artists.

Speaker 1:          03:25          I photographed the local people and as I, by John being a place of mixed ethnicities from Turks, Armenians, Persians and Russians. Uh, but all of the people that I photograph had common hand postures that were very similar to the cushion payments that are Greg paintings. And the team being the idea of home or the absence of home and what meant to these people. They're little inscriptions written all over their bodies that are there transcripts of the interviews that I conducted. I make a lot of videos. I've been active in media of video since 1998 and this was my breakthrough into the art world with video, which won the golden lion in Venice biannual. Um, but again, it was literally taking the aesthetics on my photographs, but having it move and that having music and choreography and a story that had a beginning, middle and the end.

Speaker 1:          04:26          This is another piece fervor, which again, it became a little bit more narrative, but as you can see, they're highly stylized and very fictionalize. And, um, these were all shot in Morocco. So by now I began to shoot videos and films outside of us must be in Morocco and Egypt and Turkey in different places. So these are examples that said, okay. Um, and, and so the next thing I wanted to share with you is that since 2000 known yeah, since 2002 I've been very busy making feature films. I made a film called women without men that was based on a magic realist novel that won in the Silver Lion Award in Venice Film Festival. That took six years. And I just completed this new film looking for Omakase assume that, uh, we will show some clips. Um, but that was based on Egyptian singer in Egypt. And I spent 12 years making two feature films and I did an opera. So that said, we go right to the conversation

Speaker 2:          05:32          being an Iranian female living in New York. This informs a lot of your work. You lived in exile basically in the United States. Can, can you talk about what it was like to have that happen and what your return to Iran was like given that that was sort of the starting point of all of your work? Well at the time, and I grew up, there was a,

Speaker 1:          05:52          a lot of Iranian families were sending their children abroad to study because lack of, um, you know, situations at colleges, universities. And so the, we were all sent out the, we didn't predict the revolution. And at that time, my father sent me and my sisters and brothers, they all went back and I happened to be in the u s when the revolution happened. And, um, so unfortunately at that time I was very young. I came when I was 17 and the Russian happened. Um, I was in college actually. I was at UC Berkeley. And immediately after the revolution, they took over the American embassy in Iran. The hostages were taken. So there was an incredibly strong anti American sentiment. Um, so I found myself alone in a country without financial help and without the, and the loving family around me. Um, but also, um, against the wall politically as there was a strong reaction.

Speaker 1:          06:52          Um, so I didn't see them, not for the 20 years, but 11 years. I didn't go back. And, um, and eventually when I went back, I started to make art and then the, the country, the government found my work problematic. And then since 1996, I have not been back. Wow. And I think that sort of leads us in when you said the government found your work problematic. You're work is highly political and you often talk about having a social responsibility. So I was wondering if you can talk about the idea of being the voice of a country that you haven't lived in in a very long time. You know, you don't have the possibility, uh, to distance yourself from the political reality. And is, is that the political consciousness is something that is not a choice. And I think that's difficult for Americans to understand that if your everyday life is defined by a this and that, for example, this reason breakdown, you know, again, the, the exit of America from the nuclear deal, it's a huge issue for my family in Iran, for me and the future of us as immigrants.

Speaker 1:          08:00          And so, um, so I think the work is a manifestation is kind of artistic reflection on the political reality, but it's not, it's not a propaganda. It is rather a kind of a fictional work that somehow tries to shed light on the complexity of the situation. And so I don't see myself as the voice of the country or, but the fact that, um, my work has, um, properties in the way that it communicates about the people and to the people. If you're on well, you've made, you've made photographs, you've made short films, you've made feature length films. Can you talk about how your process changes between each medium? Well, it's a, I think that, uh, this kind of nomadic behaviors, a little bit of my personality because I'm extremely restless and nervous. Yeah. And all of his living in a very nomadic lifestyle. And I'm never anywhere for very long.

Speaker 1:          09:00          People like me. And I think a lot of us are like that. And, and that we turned to learn very quickly a new places, new languages, new food, new environment. It's just a way of life. So it's not, we're not really fixed at any place, any situation. And so somehow I feel like this lifestyle has also been my relationship to the mediums that I'm not really faithful to anything. I'm not really good at anything and I haven't been really thinking you're good at. I'm not educated in it, but I, I spent a lot of times, like I said, I spent six years making a film. So I spend a lot of time studying whatever I'm doing, but I give myself the license to feel adventurous and uh, and, and also to struggle and beyond that edge because I, she like by embracing a new medium, you really inventing yourself and that's often keeping yourself excited as a, as an artist, as a human being, that even as you get old, you feel young and you fail. And I think that's been nice. My nature as a person and I think in a way that informs the way I work.

Speaker 1:          10:10          What's the process? Over six years of making, I do other things as well because I have source of survivors and artist. I do exhibitions. Um, the process of the film has been, first of all, it's a script writing and then finding the right producers, then finding the money, location scouting and actually casting, etc. And, uh, I think the two films have been the most painful experience I've ever had. Worst thing giving birth to a child, but the point is that at the end of it, I feel like it's a great accomplishment in some ways. I think every frame of the film becomes a photograph and every few minutes becomes a video installation. And that also you're able to communicate to a larger audience that are not just gallery, museum goers and you're really thinking about the masses and the general public. And I think that gives me a great pleasure.

Speaker 2:          11:09          Wow. Um, so I think that's a good point for us to turn to. Looking for a home called Tim, which is your most recent film project, one of these projects that has taken a very long time to complete, it's a movie within a movie. It's about a Persian directors attempts to film the life and legacy of the Egyptian singer called Tomb. Um, can you give us a little bit of the backstory about how you discovered her, why she was so fascinating to you?

Speaker 1:          11:41          But first of all, I'd have to say that even though my work looks very sociopolitical on the surface, it, there's always something they personal about the work. It's always been about my experience, my perspective, not my experience, the way I viewed things. That way I find my questions. And, and so it has this very personal, um, um, approach, uh, with looking for Onco zoom. Zoom is the biggest, the most important artists of the 20th century in the middle is without a doubt. He happened to be a woman, happened to be gay, happened to be non traditional. She never got married, she never had children. And yet she's loved by men, by women. The Sunday news is she is secular and ours, you know, so Cuellar and from Israel to Saudi Arabia to Iran to, it's an amazing phenomena. And so this film is about an Iranian woman artist living in Aza, uh, questioning the, the, the success of the iconic artists from them, that ease and really facing the question of how can be as women become successful, uh, and does this mean that we have to sacrifice personal lives and, uh, issues that are deeply traditional expectations from a woman.

Speaker 1:          12:57          And so this woman and myself, I've had a child and single mother. And so how do you navigate between, you know, romantic life and traditional role as mothers, but yet, uh, pursue your passion and pursued your career and be successful. So it's really a question of a smaller artist to an iconic artists. And, and of course the script was impossible and you know, so if you call in and out of a period film too, so the film behind that and a highly controversial because she's the biggest artists of Egypt. Um, so it's been showing in the Arab world and interesting reactions. That's actually one of the things we wanted to ask you about is how was it perceived in Egypt and in Iran? Well, the Iranians are upset. They said, what can you find an iconic woman singer? Why do you have to go to Egypt?

Speaker 1:          13:51          Because there's no Iranian artists as ever reached that popularity. Um, and I needed a break from Iran. Um, but I think with the Egyptians, um, it's been, uh, really at the beginning they were like, what you, I mean, not even Egyptians are there to make a film about her because she's too sacred and untouchable. And some people say, in fact, maybe this was the best way to approach it. I think it film inside of a film because we were very honest about this, that, you know, this isn't a time, this is the vision of Iranian artists. This is not a documentary. This is not a biopic. This is not exactly the story, but this is the way this woman is struggling to tell the story. Um, and I went with the film to Tunisia, it in Egypt, in Lebanon. It's opening in Morocco and you know, of course in a small scale and um, but, but it's interesting that the film is finding its audience and I think it is not ever a film that would have a huge audience and he's not targeting a commercial audience.

Speaker 1:          14:55          But I think it's something that would last, it would have a life a longer because it's a really, an artistic project is not meant to be, you know, anything that you'll see and you know, Union Square, what do you call them? The movie theater. Regal cinema. If he's lucky somewhere you didn't take it to Toronto though. And they were opening more mouth for a week in July 26. Uh, and uh, it will have a week run, which I'm very happy about. So go see it. Um, what was it like to sort of take it to the Toronto Film Festival? What was, um, what's it like? You've done a lot of film festivals, you've taken things on the circuit. How does that, this one made me very nervous because, uh, first of the second term is very difficult as so, uh, it was an Arab story. And I'm not Arab. So a lot of the audience often are Arab and I know you're like, Oh God, they're going to like throw tomatoes at me.

Speaker 1:          15:55          Um, and also that is, it's a very artistic film, so you always have a mix. It's always sold out. The screenings are full and because people love her and everything, but, and there's always a great mix of receptions and people who, uh, critics who don't like it, who like it, I have absolutely don't relate to it, to those who appreciate it. So like everything I've done, it's never ever like praise completely or destroyed, but I'm still going on. Um, so it's a mix, but I think slowly it's finding its audience. And in terms of the story and the main character in the film seems to have some reflection of you in terms of, um, it's a female director. She encounters, um, some pushback from being a female, um, from being Persian. Is this personal? It's about my experience. It's about, um, you know, my own struggles to make this film my own shortcomings.

Speaker 1:          17:00          Even the script we wrote is problematic. It's not a perfect script. And this woman also struggles with the script. It was just impossible to know how to go under the skin of this incredible, incredible woman that was a myth. You know, it was not even a human. And she, she actually wanted to remain as an image. So what I asked for, it was an impossible task to devour and demystify a myth that it was just impossible. So, so in this film I tried to be really honest about, you know, I chose a very difficult subject and I didn't completely succeed and, but, but, but what did I learn about this from her? And what was the angle? What was the obsession about? And I think then when you get the intimate about the process, there's honesty about the film that, you know, then if, if you are that kind of person, you understand this film, by no means try to be pretentious or trying to compare me with her, but really showing the artistic practice involving a lot of struggles and failures of an artist, but also doubts.

Speaker 1:          18:10          And I think that's something that we don't give credit to the artist, but the process, it's often painful and it involves taking the risk and that doesn't always succeed in a positive way. But that is part of the process. And I, that's all I tried to show and even the film has at the final, it's not a perfect film and I'm the first one to say it, but I think that's what it was all about, you know? And what do you think is so imperfect about it? The script I think, um, because you know, again, um, the way that we try to navigate between different periods and the story of the Iranian woman versus the story of this iconic artists and how to balance everything between the political reality when she lived her own political reality as a woman in [inaudible], there's a lot of information there is, there is a lot of metaphorical meanings that we wanted to, to weave into the story that about woman, about being artists that are living within political reality that affects their work and their success and failures. And me as an exotic artist, she is the one who, who became very loyal to the political leaders in order to stay successful. So there was just so much intentions that we tried to build into the narrative that maybe just wasn't perfect, you know? Um, and, and I think that's okay.

Speaker 2:          19:37          It's totally okay. And I think one of the things that's interesting is obviously this fits into your larger practice in terms of um, uh, you know, in Islamic female protagonist, but you, you often talking about that you're more interested in form then you are in the content. And so I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about how making narrative films sort of fits into your larger practice of photography, of sort of short experimental film. Um, and, and if you think you were successful there,

Speaker 1:          20:08          and I'm glad you said that because they often people just focus on the scene because I'm Iranian, but in fact I think I consider myself among some of the western, also artists who are beginning to break through the way from the museum and Gallery walls and tried to experiment with what it's like for visual artists to tell the story, what kind of form would it take, uh, without mimicking conventional cinema, but also not making things that are completely incomprehensible. I also directed opera last read, Salzburg Festival, Ada and I sort of go and, and Ricardo Muti the conductor and what is the nature of ambitiousness experimentation. But I think that is happening more and more where, um, both at film festivals, the music festivals, and are really welcoming artists coming from other mediums to experimenting with this. And, and I have to say that, um, I, you know, I do photography, I do video installations, I do film, I'm making a new song, uh, and, and I, you know, still do performing arts.

Speaker 1:          21:17          And not because I'm good at all of these things because I enjoy the process and I think it's good to give yourself, um, the, the goal of being able not to stay stagnated within one form of work. I could have stayed with those pictures, writing calligraphy for the rest of my life, make a bundle of money and make zero money making some, in fact, I put everything I have from the photography into the film. So it's a kind of stupid because there's money never paid a place, uh, in its equation. And, and so I think that's a decision I made. It's a true labor. I think it is an eye. I stand behind it and I will never be very rich.

Speaker 2:          22:01          You mentioned the Ahhbra, something that you said that I really thought was interesting was you said sometimes the boundaries between Ada and myself are blurred.

Speaker 1:          22:09          MMM.

Speaker 2:          22:10          What do you mean by that? What's your relationship to Aida?

Speaker 1:          22:13          I either is the story of its European businesses in exile in Egypt. And the director of the music festival, uh, invited me because I either just historically has been highly problematic, uh, opera for, for a lot of middle easterners because it's the most cliche and orientalist I opera. And that sort of, um, badly stereotypes. The Middle Eastern, even in the ancient times, each have an inner tube. Ian's make them into this very barbaric, um, you know, and, and then the westerners are the glory of know it's written by an Italian composer Verde. And so he found it very interesting that if I could take this, which was a huge task, um, Eh, this narrative and sort of maybe a new reinterpretation of it that somehow kept the grandiose, uh, of the classical Aida and, and didn't compromise the value of it, um, but yet was able to address the kind of cliche and, and sort of it didn't have the elephants and the horses and the people painted black walking. So I took three years and I had to do it is also very controversial, is never done in this way. Um, but um, it was completely successful in the way that was really highly attended, but it was also very controversial.

Speaker 2:          23:39          That sounds like a huge undertaking as are a lot of your films now that you're doing, you're doing really elaborate projects. And I want to turn back a little bit to, to your work with film, one of the films or short films that you started with with turbulent, you went to women without men that you mentioned before. What sort of happening on your path with film right now and, um, they have this undercurrent or at least turbulent does about music. Um, when you talk about the power of music, so you're a visual artist who is using music. Um,

Speaker 1:          24:13          yeah, I mean I think again, because so much of my works about the sociopolitical religious realities, music brings with it, its something they, a gospel, very emotional, something that doesn't need translation. Uh, I think that helps in a way neutralized someone saying, Eh, that political content of my work. Um, and because I think my work is as much about existential universal, timeless and emotional issues as it is about today's realities and political realities. And I just want to take this point and just mentioned that, uh, another reason that I go toward very stylized of surrealistic narrative like woman would happen then was based on a magic realist novel. And, and, and the reason I feel so comfortable with dreams and surrealism is because it allows you to make reference to reality, but yet also staying in another place that sort of gives you some space from that.

Speaker 1:          25:09          And the current film that I'm working, I think it's the first time I really talk about it, it's called Dreamland and it's really in a summarized way, is about this surrealistic novel that would be shot in the u s uh, about Iranian people spying on Americans dreams. Um, and, and, and his episode, there's a political satire, but it really is a, is institution is Kinda Evanion colony that is the future of Trump doing with Iranian people. I would say refugee camp full of Iranian people, but sort of oddly, and ironically there is an institution within this colony that it's actually a room for interpretation of American people's dreams. And there's a woman who every day goes on the highway to a small little American town and her job is secretly, she goes as a census worker, the door to door to people's homes asking information at the end she says, I'm, what is your last dream?

Speaker 1:          26:08          People say dreams that we have to uh, Jennifer, yes, it's part of the survey from Washington. So she was a spy, but she carries their photographs and their dreams back to that call and so they can interpret the dream. So, so my idea again of creating a narrative that there is symbolically and absolutely absurd and fat tire go away. It's sort of critiques this, um, tension between two countries. The superpower would dominate the world, uh, and the fanaticism, right? That exists in the upsert Iranian government and that the humanity in between the two parts and, and, and, you know, so there's a, this is the story we're doing and I'm hoping we can shoot it 2019. Wow. Well, we look at

Speaker 2:          26:57          forward to seeing that and um, there are so many dichotomies in your work including this sort of, um, play with reality versus sort of these more magical, fantastical, um, sort of aesthetics that you even bring into Miquel tomb. And there is a sort of abuse attention between the beauty and, um, and also, you know, the undercurrent of what you're, you're having to say.

Speaker 1:          27:23          I think that's, you put your finger on absolutely the right thing. Every single thing I've ever done is about the notion of opposites, the paradoxical men or men, east, West mysticism and violence and, um, you know, women without men was the orchard and the city of [inaudible]. I think that's the only way I can think in general about the, the good and evil and all of that. And so I never see anything in one way

Speaker 2:          27:51          you were named artist of the decade by Huffington post at one point. It's a pretty, it's a big deal. And you've received a lot of awards and you've worked on so many things. And uh, I'm just curious sort of at this point, you know, what accomplishments are you most proud of? Um, and what do you look,

Speaker 1:          28:07          he's interesting. Anytime somebody says nice thing about me, I said I was, I, I always considered myself, um, struggling artists. I think it's a good thing maybe. And I, I'm, I, I know I seen that I do is so hard to accomplish and we work so hard, like I work seven days a week, um, and, and so I never see myself as a success story and it always blows my mind when people say flattering things. I even criticize my work more than necessary because, not to be humble, but I just see it that the way that it deserves criticism, so, and they flourish when people say Nice things.

Speaker 2:          28:46          Well, there are a lot of Nice things to say. I think we should at this point roll the clip and then we can open it up to Q and. A.

Speaker 3:          28:55          So I'm saying I'm from Egypt. And growing up you always hear about her sexual orientation as a rumor, not like a confirmed fact. So I was wondering why do you have to say about that and whether the movie addresses the issue at all or no?

Speaker 1:          29:06          Yeah, I mean, uh, I'm really glad you brought that up because, um, what option you would speak to her has a different explanation or, or impression and, and, and relationship to Amoco. Some. So what I found also about her sexual orientation, everyone says something different. Some people say she absolutely was in love with so and so and, but she did eventually marry her doctor who, you know, at the end when she died, she was married to him, uh, and she adopted a son. Um, but in Riyadh and many say that she was absolutely working with men, but they love with woman. And she had, um, at the beginning we did a lot of research about that. And indeed there was a lot of images and videos. But, um, of her really the time that she laughed a lot and seem, cause when she was performing, she was always very rigid.

Speaker 1:          30:03          The time that she was seeing most relaxed was around woman. You know, uh, she seems like she really felt comfortable. Of course it happens for a lot of women just even if she not get, um, but I think everything hinted at the fact that, um, for her conservative environment that she lived there was absolutely out of the question that she could, um, be open about it. But, but also the Egyptian theater really, you know, wanted to devour her personal life in that way. Like the way we do with celebrities here, which I really respected. Um, some people I talked to and say it didn't matter to us. You know, some people said, oh no, she was not there. Some people said, yeah, she was. But in general, I find that the status that she reached, um, it's, you know, like wildly different, like in, you have Michael Jackson here and made his sexuality like the biggest, you know, American icon as a pop culture, pop artists.

Speaker 1:          30:58          But you understand that he really was devoured in the way for his celebrity status. But the, the customer, they just loved her music, you know, and, and it didn't matter if she was a woman or a man or, you know, gay or not. And that's what I admired about her and her relationship to her audience, that they didn't destroy her like they, the way we do, you know, Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston, it did pay off, uh, Billie holiday. Uh, you know, every great artists that we build up, we, we bring down because we just, you know, oh, she was very freaky. But in reality, you know, like I said, I found that she has this very secret place that you just cannot take away from her. And, and people were really the, the most religious conservative community just left her alone because they loved her. You know, and I think that's so rare and it honestly is something I took a lot of pride that we in the Middle East have an artist in that level of popularity where 4 million people went.

Speaker 1:          32:05          It was one of the largest funerals ever in the history of Egypt after Nasir, I think, um, in the America, in the West, you have never ever seen this many people go for, even for Michael Jackson.
